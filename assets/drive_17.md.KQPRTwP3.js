With the exception of this particular Chill Mat. I have been using this Chill Mat for four or five months now and have noticed that it was actually hotter using the mat than without using the mat. After comparing it with other devices, I noticed one single flaw. The device pushes air upwards towards the laptop. I saw a Technology Demonstration on Youtube.com, and I was using the mat in exactly same way as it was demonstrated. I have since turned the Chill Mat Upside down[opposite the mat direction as orientated in the above photo]. After turning the mat upside down, it is now pulling the heat down away from my laptop, making the laptop tremendously cooler. Either the Targus Chill Mats were improperly designed to push air upwards, or I received the Mat that missed the quality check.

In terms of cooling capability, it is strictly passive (i.e., no fans or other cooling mechanisms) and isn't even constructed of endothermic material that would draw heat away from your laptop; any cooling that occurs is soley dependent upon the stray breeze that may or may not flow under your machine. The device does allow you some modicum of tilt adjustablity, but only within a 1/2\\" to 1 3/4\\" range. Additionally, the lego-like system used to make the tilt adjustments is cumbersome.

This is not the case. The fans only blow straight through top-bottom. Second, if the Chill Pad is sitting on anything -- even though the legs provide a small gap, the air flow is reduced to practically nothing.I bought this to put on top of my DirecTV DVR, to help pull hot air away from the DVR.

The model I replaced it with is black (but still has the same PA248U model number on back), and is much more dependent on airflow from underneath. This means that as soon as you place it on an sofa arm or pillow or something, it will immediately start to audibly strain. However, it does provide a lot of airflow when unconstrained on a table or desk.But the final straw came when one of the fan blades started making a scraping noise. I lifted my computer up to see what was happening and - I kid you not - one of the fan blades came shooting out of the unit and landed two feet to my left.

This causes the laptop to getas hot as it normally would without the chill pad. And I suspect thelow pressure caused by the suction at the top may reduce cooling airflowinto the laptops, most of which have opening at the bottom to suck in air.I would expect the fans to push air up to the laptop sitting on top of it.There is no way to reverse the flow, and the fans are not removable fromthe case as the case moulding forms the fan axle.Total waste of money, other than to see how cheaply todays products are made."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S CHEAP","review":"I brought it because I needed it but the complaints about the openings being to much in the center is an issue.

Heat dissipation was alright when I first bought it, but now...it's not performing up to task. Why?! THE FANS BLADES BROKE OFF!!!

I am a college student, so I do a lot of work using my laptop. The cooling pad itself is a little small for my Dell Inspiron 1150; this causes the fans on the cooling pad to be located closer to the front than where they need to be in the back.

The buttons are hard to push. The power switch doesn't work 9/10 times. The laser is weak (whether you use the supplied betteries or high powered lithiums). The button placement for the record feature is in a good position but it is incredably sinsitive.

Two weeks later and I'm giddy like a kid in a candy store.It took a while to figure out how to install the headset to your ear, but I'm sure most, if not all, Bluetooth headsets share the same minor inconvenience. The other minor inconvenience are the buttons; they don't have a nice feel when you push them and the locations are sometimes tricky.If it's one thing I would REALLY like, then it's a replaceable [rechargeable] battery.

While it is SUPPOSED to work in a range of 33 feet, I found that if I merely put the phone on the opposite side of my body, the connection gets fickle. You get lots of staticy noise if the phone is more than 2 feet from the earpiece and in a direct line of sight. Sort of defeats the purpose of the bluetooth technology, doesn't it? And the static is NOT just in your end; my girlfriend complained about it more than I really even heard it. So if yo get this, be prepared to anger your party on the other line.

Although it is a little larger and heavier than the Casio I lost, I am finding it really easy to use. I haven't begun to discover all the things it can do, but the camera is very good at telling you exactly what you are doing. The icons are intuitive, but each selection displays on the large screen what the icon does. I'm really impressed with the 10x optical zoom as well. The outdoor setting for the digital display is very helpful and makes taking and reviewing pictures outdoors really easy.

I've had no trouble and loved my camera so much that I bought this blue one for my wife. I picked up an optional 16GB SDHC card and the Panasonic hard case and everything runs flawlessly. I'd recommend it to friends and family, and Amazon is the way to get it fast and affordably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nana05","review":"I love my Panasonic Lumix DMC-TZ3S.

Panasonic, you have lost a customer. We nevertheless decided to have it repaired by the Service Center.

The zoom and the Optical Image Stabilization work great. The Scene modes can be a little confusing, but overall it is easy to operate and has nice buttons.It also has a nice feel to it, and the screen is big and beautiful. The only negative is that it is quite a bit larger than our Canon SD-550 that it is replacing.

It is great in tight spaces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great travel camera","review":"Bought a Panasonic TZ3 in black early in the summer in preparation for a trip to Europe. I was very glad I did! The camera did very well! Exceeded my expectations! It does a fair job in low light (I remember \\"pushing Tri-X in the 70's to shoot low light with a Nikon!) The 10x zoom is a MUST Have feature! Especially for travel! It has a few quirks as well, but easy to figure out after playing with it for a while. For action shots I use the burst mode and chose the shot I like the best! (yes it will stop a propeller in flight!)Great little camera and it does take some bumps and fumbles... I would not drop it from any great height though...Fits in a cargo pants or shirt pocket. Bigger than the credit card size cameras but you can actually hold on to it and see the buttons... If you are over 40 you know what I mean..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera!","review":"I bought the camera to replace a perfectly fine Canon SD550, because the TZ3 featured 10x zoom and image stabilization. After a recent vacation trip, it turns out that the feature that I like best is the wide angle end of the lens, which gives just enough additional field of view to make a noticeable difference in pictures of scenery, etc. (it is 28mm equivalent versus 35mm for the Canon and most point and shoot cameras). The surprise feature that I would rank #2 is the easy-to-set-up scene modes, which I found very useful in practice. The long zoom is startling for such a small camera too, although there are no miracles and indoor pictures in low light at high zoom can disappoint.All in all the camera is small and light enough to bring everywhere, has versatile, intuitive controls and it delivers great pictures with no annoying compromises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera for the money","review":"I bought this camera for my daughter at Christmas, it was so wonderful I bought one for myself.

One extra battery is helpful if on a trip where you take lots of pictures, and might not be able to recharge every night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bulky, and pics are nothing special","review":"Let me go against the grain here - I ended up selling mine, although there was nothing wrong with it (no defects).I purchased this as a second camera to complement an \\"oldie but goodie\\" Sony F-707. I thought that the 10x zoom and the smaller size would help me be able to take photos in more places - when I traveled, took walks, etc.But I found that this unit is too big and heavy for a pocket - and I needed to use a hard case to carry it. At that point, it was almost no different than my (very large) F-707, and the photos it takes do not approach the Sony.In short, it was the wrong compromise for me. I suspect this would be a good camera for a lot of people as an \\"only\\" camera, but it did not fit my needs as a portable. Perhaps I am spoiled by my 6 year old Sony. I will be buying something else for traveling, but it will be ultra small as opposed to the mid-size and weight of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, but not for a beginner","review":"I purchased this for my wife, which isn't very good with cameras.

I have taken about 300 pictures in a variety of different settings. The image quality ranged from good for daytime outdoor pictures to poor for any indoor pictures. Every picture is grainy with little detail. Even the colors were off on most indoor shots. I read the owners manual twice from cover to cover for tips and setting adjustment I could make but nothing really allowed me to get the type of picture quality I expected from this camera. What a waste of time.My old Sony DSC-W5 takes much better pictures with no fuss. I upgraded to this Panasonic DMC-TZ3 for the 28mm wide angle and 10X zoom capabilities of the lens. The phenomenal Leica lens is useless in front of such a poor camera. It's like putting performance tires on a Yugo.I am returning this camera to Amazon immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This is a great camera. I was going to get a digital SLR camera because I wanted a faster shooting speed, but after researching further I realized everthing I would give up. This is the best compromise between a compact and a larger SLR camera. I love the 10x zoom, it has a nice big LCD monitor to review pictures and position shots. I've become addicted to filming video clips of my kids and sending them to friends and family thru youtube. My only wish is that it could be faster when shooting multiple shots, but I think it is still better than most compacts. Also some pictures seem to come out a bit darker than I would like, but that might be the photographer.

If I had known that Panasonic builds planned obsolescence into their products, even a camera for several hundred dollars, I would not have participated. So now I have a camera that doesn't work and also the guilt of having to find a safe way to get rid of this thing so that it is not clogging up a landfill somewhere. I won't be buying any Panasonic products again.I think I am going to go back to low tech and just build a pin hole camera until the manufacturers can build a camera that will last more than a few years with the expected abuses that a camera will experience.

The camera has many customer delight items that enhance the photographic experience.While manual operation of shutter speed and f-stop is desirable, the use of pre-set scenes compensates for this lack. If you take the time to review the scenes, their use will generaly result in proper exposures.Some of these pre-set scenes allow for photos to be also labeled with chronological data such as the age of a child or pet or the vacation day of a trip. These are easy to set and simple to use for photos.The 12X zoom brings objects close but you'll need to practice a light touch to get the amount of zoom correct. The ability to take photos in low light without flash is impressive but beware that the trade-off is a photo with significantly lower resolution.Overall a great feature rich camera at a competitive price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Camera.","review":"I bought this for my wife, and when we got it, we were amazed at the ridiculous amount of settings we found for picture quality.

We had a lot of fun while in the Dominican Republic using the sports setting to try and catch motorcycle taxis zooming by. We also got great vibrant photos of many beautiful flowers and the wide angle lens allowed us some gorgeous shots of the oceanside and beach. The water looks almost as blue in our photos as it was in real life. The only downside that we've experienced so far, is that when we go to upload new photos to our computer it automatically pulls all of them, which can take a long time if you have many photos stored.

Its ease of use was evident by never having to open the user's manual.

I cannot take a picture on a nice sunny day without having vertical lines across the horizon. This renders the image useless. Pictures taken using the flash are either totally washed out or they are underexposed. Quality of images taken with low light levels are also poor. This leaves a limited range of lighting conditions where a decent image can be taken.Based on my experiences I would not recommend this camera. There are many positive reviews on Amazon so perhaps my camera is simply defective. I have contacted Panasonic and they will not help me because my camera is out of warranty.We have several older digital cameras including a Kodak and a Canon and they do not exhibit the problems that I have encountered with the TZ3 so I know that what I am experiencing is not normal for digital cameras.I'm at the point where I will soon pitch this camera into the garbage and buy a new camera.

So I came here and ordered the TZ3 thinking it should be a much better version. I was dead wrong. It won't let me zoom in/out when taking videos, whereas the TZ1 was able to!

The camera worked the day before my trip and the first day of my tour it stopped working. It would turn on and off, on and off and then say turn off and then back on. All it would do is repeat this over and over. Needless to say I was not able to purchase another camera or have it fixed on my tour. I had to rely on disposible cameras and other people's photos. I will NEVER purchase another Panasonic camera again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing zoom always with you","review":"This camera has lots of interesting features but the key reason to buy it is to put 12x in your pocket. You can't get the shot if the camera isn't with you and most big zoom cameras don't fit comfortably in your pocket. This one will always be with you. Because I had it in my pocket while hiking, and because it has a huge zoom, I was able to get some excellent shots of a couple of deer.You may have thought that the camera had a 10x zoom. But if you set the image quality to 5mp instead of 7.2mp, the camera can zoom to 12x. At 3mp you could have 15x.Based on the images I've shot, 5mp is plenty for any printing or cropping.The screen is beautiful. I miss a viewfinder.

But, no small camera that I liked can take wide angle pictures and 10X optical zoom. This camera can take pictures in 16:9 format which look great on my Widescreen HDTV. Plus, this camera has many fun features that I didn't know about before I purchased it. The camera has various scene modes, such as sunset, at night, firework, self-portrait and so many more that really make the pictures even better. Now, I don't have to be a professional photographer to take great pictures anytime and anywhere with my shaky hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera!","review":"I love this camera! It takes great stills and wonderful movies. The resolution is great and it takes good pictures even in low light. I would have given it 5 stars, except for the fact that without an optical viewfinder it makes it hard to take pictures in bright sunlight. That being said, if you just point it in the direction of what you want to take a picture of it takes a great picture anyway!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value","review":"I bought this camera before going on vacation. I took a lot of beach photos and other outdoor photos. The quality of the photos is good. I wanted a camera with the 10x optical lens and would have preferred it to be smaller.

The commentary track points out some of the weaker parts of the story such as the assassins in part 1 and the ship's Captain that might not have been as noticeable or memorable. The history of the Cybermen was great as I love seeing them.

Cybermen cannot be shot down; only gold is \\"hostile to their function.\\"2. Firearms will not work in the TARDIS.3. The Doctor does not shoot his enemy with a firearm; certainly not at point-blank range.Robert Holmes was the heart and soul of this TV program. Virtually every story he wrote or edited is worthwhile, and virtually every story that was made without his input is mere flummery (\\"City of Death\\" is the notable exception). His was the \\"larger consciousness\\" that could breathe life into such wildly improbable characters.

The difference between this and the 2002 GDM release is that the 2008 release is presented with the first 14 tracks in remastered stereo and the last 10 in greatly improved remastered mono sound. The 2002 release was all mono. Both recordings still evidence a small bit of tape hiss on some tracks but the remaster really is the way to go.Booklet includes cool artwork and 8 pages with high quality pics from the film.

While I am happy with the 1,750 PSI, the motor on this model and brand will not turn off when the sprayer is released. I contacted the manufacturer and they sent a new wand after about a month. The new wand did not correct the problem. I needed to get the deck done before winter so I kept the sprayer on the entire time since I was afraid the motor would burn out. I know if I take the unit apart, there is a component that is only supposed to be adjusted by the manufacturer. I am not going to waist any more of my time with the manufacturer so it looks like I will be spending 5 or 6 hours to fix it myself. My recommendation is not to buy stuff like this on line.

Unfortunately, this movie did not manage to achieve that level for me. For the most part, I found the lead female character (\\"Nomi\\") to be unappealing, and disagreeable, which made it impossible to care very much about the story. She was a total turn-off. The lowest point in the entire film however is when the one truly decent human, the lead character's main friend \\"Molly\\", is brutally raped in a particularly revolting scene.

Also, there are really spectacular dance scenes, and lots of female flesh for the eyes to feast on.But the story and the dialogue and the direction are stupid. The red haired actor who plays the choreographer also played the Wig Master for Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat on an episode of Seinfeld. Kramer somehow misses seeing the show and as consolation, is allowed to walk down Broadway wearing the Tecnicolor Dreamcoat. He is then mistaken for a pimp and arrested.

She clearly has the looks and talent to be successful, just not the pedigree. The movie is about what it takes for her to achieve her goal, in a somewhat seamy world where women and men are exploited by a cast of sleazy characters. Secondly, Naomi, the main character played by Elizabeth Berkley, does have character. She eventually has to decide if her dream is worth her compromising her values.

Liz Berkley is not only an awful actress but a horrible dancer. I lost count the number of times she flung out her arms, either in anger or \\"dancing.\\" Fries over here, ice over there. Her character is supposed to be irrestitable to men & women alike but she looks like a cheap hooker throughout the whole film. Blonde is not her color. And that overbite is not Gene Tieney sexy at all. I have to agree with some of the other reviewers; her body doesn't look so hot when she's naked, which is frequently. I don't know why Joe Eszterhaus hates women so much. His films are very mysoginistic. I will give it credit for one of the best (unintentionally, of course) movie lines ever.

The first time I tried to watch it, after about 20 minutes, the screen went to digital gibberish and my DVD player hung up so that I couldn't even open the tray to remove the disc or turn off the power. I had to unplug the DVD player, wait, and replug the power cord to remove the disc. Overnight, I decided I needed to replace my DVD player. However, the next morning, I tried a different DVD and it worked fine. It still works fine on all my other DVDs. I complained to your customer service people and they were nice enough to send me a replacement copy of Showgirls. Unfortunately, this one has the same problem. It plays for several minutes and then goes to gibberish and hangs my DVD player. I gave up on the problem at this point and decided to just get through my life without Showgirls. I use my DVD player almost every day and it works fine except when I try to watch Showgirls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad, bad","review":"Even Elizabeth Berkley's nudity couldn't save this movie.It was tasteless and just bad.

I enjoy Verhoeven's other films such as Robocop, Total Recall, Starship Troopers, Basic Instinct and some of his other less known films, but this film was just trash. Alot of nudity of un-needed nudity and bad scripting of a rather lacking plot made me gag. As for the moral lession of the film you might as well watch a Kevin Smith film such as Dogma or Clerks to get simular moral messages that are in surprisingly good films. But if you like stuff that you can just sit back and get lost in the amount of titilation and air humping then you'll probably love this film.

This movie is a fun time for the absolute 100% disaster of it all. The acting is B movie grade, and that even includes Kyle Mchlachlan slumming here(David Lynch come and save him). The story is paper thin and silly, laughably so in fact. This movie received notice only because it was rated NC-17, which is the main reason I have a loathing for this film. True sincere films that also got hit with this rating suffer from the impression that they like this one are simply brain dead gratuitious trash.

Watching that Saved by the Bell girl commit career suicide is the major benefit of this movie. Where has she been? You'll know after seeing Showgirls.Watch Showgirls and the Godfather back to back.

After twenty minutes, the nudity and sexuality is rendered banal, and the film is a stylized interpretation of America's obsession with sex and a metaphor for women's self-degradation while harnessing sexual \`power'. Nomi is a victim who sees herself as a survivor while the men in charge absent-mindedly exploit her and then dump her at will. You have to be incredibly insensitive to find this movie exclusively erotic and not disturbing. Bad acting? Yep. Gratuitous violence? Yep. Did Berkley realize what she was getting into? Probably not.

Unfortunately, they are simply bad movies for the most part. \\"Showgirls\\" is another story. A wonderfully tawdry, overproduced, overacted spectacle featuring a goddess of over the top performing, Elizabeth Berkley. She attacks this glitzy trash as if an Oscar nomination were just within her reach. Gina Gershon and the rest of the cast give this beautiful mistake of a movie the aura of pornographic glamour that only big budget Hollywood could provide. Immensely entertaining, and more fascinating each time I view it. If you're ever feeling depressed, or simply down in the dumps, just watch Ms. Berkley sniff her sad little sniff in what is perhaps my favorite scene.

I must advise people, who haven't seen this film, that the most nasty, disturbing rape scene is in this film that involves a pop singer, his bodyguards and a female fan of his.

If this movie did not have T & A, it would be called \\"GIRLS GONE STUPID.\\" Hats off to the director for having the cojones to make such a film. This movie makes Basic Instinct look like Basic Disney. There's more bouncing, bare breasts in this movie than you can shake a stick at; plus, some good full-frontal scenes from Liz Berkeley. I'll bet she never dreamed of doing this when she was making that sitcom \\"Saved By the Bell\\" !!

This might be the most repugnant movie ever made because it portends to carry a message, and fakes redemption. Don't be fooled.

Yes, it is bad: the acting is not even one-dimensional, the writing is hilarious (though the story line is not improbable), and the direction is heavy-handed. I can't really imagine a film like this being made any other way. This is about Vegas, after all. I mean if you're going to hear a line like \\"She learned it alright, but they don't teach it in any school\\" delivered in complete earnestness then it must be Las Vegas, right? But somewhere beneath all of this lurk interesting ideas. The writer and director obviously had some smarts -- the main character is young, hot-headed and hungry. So they (of course) made her physical appetite insatiable. Her food of choice: meat -- hamburgers to be exact. Look for metaphors, themes and imagery like this throughout the film. Sometimes they hit you over the head, and sometimes they're more subtle.

People that do are hypocrites. They want to be cultured snobs but are too lazy to read books so they demand and expect movies and television shows to provide that intellectual stimulation, and are aghast when it doesn't work out that way. Get over yourselves. Movies are made for entertainment, \\"escapism\\" if you will, not to be some big life-changing thing.

It is not the content that I object to, merely the repetition. There is only on essay on politics in this volume and Vidal has repackaged it several times, reheating and serving it up again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"mostly illogical, but intellegent","review":"Gore Vidal, clearly one of the great essayists of our time, a wonderful man to read. He speaks to the best iun us and one must be educated to fully comprehend his literary indulgences. Unfortunatly for all his grandeur this publication is mostly flawed. its essays ont he Japanese intentions in WWII, its view of Islam and his biased, illogical hateed of the Republicans and his view of Americas role in the world are all flawed.Nevertheless I recommend this book to anyone interested in reading a fair and intellegent critique of the conservative agenda. Most of illogical trash that documents Americas sopposed obessesion with dominating the world is not worth the reading.

I ordered it in orange and it did not disappoint - it's still bright orange, although more orange than the product image makes it look like. Looks sturdy, yet flexible enough to let the plant distort the planter without breaking it (which is key for my false zamia). Also, although it is plastic, it does not look cheap. It took me a minute to figure out how to remove the saucer - you just have to pull it out (as opposed to twisting).

Lots of tracks are quite well-known and good, and although it's a 3-hour mix, and it doesn't have tons of sampling on the tracks (very few actually), you don't get bored since each track is about 1:30. Still, it's mixed very well, the transitions from track to track are well done, you don't feel anytime that one track has been suddenly cut to start the next one, even between the Daddy DJ and the Parla & Pardoux / DJ Galaga track.

I also will note that Julian is not John in any way. I always believed Julian was much better than he sounds or I should say, makes himself sound anyway. I believe there is John inside Julian somewhere, but we have yet to see that in his lyrics. I don't think the lyrics are that good honestly, and the sound is more like a 1980's retro alternative than modern day. I suppose what I'm disappointed with, is missing the sound that John developed over his life and I wish Julian would transition back to some of that. I also wish Julian would perform more of his father's music, to grab onto that feeling. Or perhaps I just miss John as most of us do.

The arrangements and production are as intricate as anything on \\"Photograph Smile\\" without the addition of saccharine. In its day, the advent of Q Sound made this album swell from the speakers and fill the room with song.

Originally published in 1984, but republished in 2003, Sullivan's Woman features a moody jerk of an artist and a completely innocent dreamer of a writer. Of course she's stunningly beautiful, so he must paint her. Over the two months of their sitting she manages to fall completely in love with him, but heck if I can figure out why. So far as I can tell, they didn't actually talk and he just yells at her a lot. In the very final chapter we find out that he can't live without her and they live happily ever after. What? Huh?

Why? The authors attempts at erotic tension fell flat for me. The two main characters are in such a state of arousal when they first meet I'm surprised they can walk. This state seems to continue throughout the book to a ludicrous degree. What the author considered 'exciting' and 'erotic' frankly just made me groan.Also, I was bored with the whole orphan subplot. Not a big fan of kiddies in my romance novels. Yes we get it. The heroine is a saint for looking after two orphans.

The plot would probably make a better book or short story than a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Thriller - NO spoilers here","review":"This is a very early move for Witherspoon and Josh Brolin. The film may not have the best script but the plot and charcters progress enough to make it interesting. I don't think is a movie to see over and over unless you are a rabid fan of the stars. The acting is good and actors sell the story, even it does strech the imagination. In general it is about greed and what people will do to get easy money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting","review":"I expected this movie to be a teen movie,but it wasn't.I was surprised at how much I liked the movie .What helped was it made you care for the characters + plus it had nice plot twists. The plot does seem familiar though, seems like a mixture of other movies like Indecent Proposal,Requiem of a Dream plus some that I can't quite put my finger on.Anyway it's defenitely worth watching.Especially if you like Reese Witherspoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lysergik is ill!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Forget everything you have heard from bands like Limpbizkit, Linkin Park, Crazy Town, etc. Forget all the TRL, MTV, POP-rap-rock bands being shoved down your throat. Lysergik does the metal-hiphop hybrid the way other bands wish they could. This is rap-metal the way it was supposed to be - with a heavier hiphop influence than most bands. If Lysergik had been in Limpbizkit's place maybe this genre would not be so slept on. anyways, I think Lysergik has what it takes to re-write the books on rap-metal music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Giant Book of Sudoku Presented by Will Shortz","review":"This book will keep me busy for a long time.

I found that the hostage plot made the novel a chore to read. Perhaps my opinion is this way because I prefer a good murder mystery when the killer/s are completely unknown.

A good novel for anyone interested in long hostage negotiations, otherwise try something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING","review":"i thought the book was really good. there's only one problemwith it and that's the rape scene that was way to descriptive. i wishhe wouldn't have put that in, it spoils the book. it bothers me alot to read that kind of thing, because then i'll have that image in mind for some time. besides that i thought the book was one of his best. it had well written character, a good plot, and not a bunch of technical terms they spend pages explaining to you.

Immediately after I read it I was ready to read it again, but my mom wanted it back. LOL"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After reading The Bone Collector, A Maiden's Grave was extremely disappointing. The hostages were not very strong characters and spent the majority of their time either crying or feeling sorry for themselves. Characters like that certainly make it difficult to stick with any book.The only interesting portions of the book were that of the hostage negotiator himself, how he negotiated with the hostage taker(s) and the internal politics that he comes up against and confronts while trying to do his job.The book does take a surprising turn at page 376 which makes the reader feel semi-rewarded for sticking with the first 375 pages of a ho-hum storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising twists","review":"Great characters.

I had just seen the Bone Collector and say that is was based on a book. So I went to my local library which didn't have it in at the moment. They did have this one though and from the moment I read the first few pages I couldn't put it down.The story just grabbed me because it was something I hadn't read before from one of the main characters being deaf and how she was able to overcome her handicap inspired me. After I read this book i had to have more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really good book","review":"This Book is one of my favorite books I have ever read. I raed this book in two days and I am not a person who reads a lot but this book is so good in my opinion, I gave it to some of my friends and they all read it just as fast as I did if not faster.

I also really enjoyed the story line it was very intriguing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!!!","review":"This book was amazing one of the best I have read so far form the author. It was a book that you could not put down for second because you always want to know what is going to happen next.

The characters are amazing in this book. It is nothing like any of the other books he has written!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deaver Dithers, but WOW!","review":"Deaver's love of excruciating detail has certainly exasperated many readers caught in his exciting stories: come ON!! Get on with the story!!!I am not going to spoil the ending of this novel for you (you're welcome). Simply allow me to say, the plot really picks up just when you think all the dust has settled.So find a comfortable chair for the long haul, and happy reading!PS: If you read at night, you will probably want to turn on ALL the lights."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had high hopes for this book - they were dashed","review":"I was excited to begin this book, as I had read \\"The Bone Collector\\" and loved it. After I got into \\"A Maiden's Grave\\" I found myself searching for any periodical to read to avoid finishing \\"Grave\\". Deaver does a great job with narrative, making you feel as if you were there. The problem was that the plot dragged on and on. I felt like shouting \\"let's be done with this, already!\\" There also seemed to be a sense of hopelessness that pervaded the storyline - that doesn't make for enjoyable reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deaver's exceptional portrayal of the Deaf","review":"Deaver has portrayed Deaf individuals in A Maiden's Grave in exceptional clarity and realism. Being Deaf myself, and a Teacher of the deaf, I was delighted to see the realistic portrayals. Deaver at times includes people with disabilities in his writing and he is to be congratulated for putting his characters in real roles and not patronising people with disabilities. He has an insight into people with disabilities and is refreshing to see this awareness.Truelly educational reading as well well as exceptional on the edge thriller material!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nerve wrecking","review":"I found this book to be very intense and nerve wrecking. Deaver keeps the reader at the edge of their seat (is that only a movie watching term?) and eager to find out what happens next.I liked the general ending a lot (the last 50 pages), but the very ending seemed kind of far fetched - meaning the way Deaver concludes the story of the bad guys. Also, the romance between the deaf assistant teacher and the negiotiator was beyond stupid and should have been left out."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING, SPELLBINDING, TWISTS AND TURNS EVERY MINUTE","review":"Jeffery Deaver is nothing short of amazing in his ability to keep the readers attention. He has in fact perfected his craft. \\"Maiden's Grave,\\" is a book you will not want to put down. It is enhancing to all of your senses and the imagery will truly take you there. Actually the first book I have read by Deaver I have read everything I could get my hand on since. If you enjoy true crime books, you will love this. Although it is fiction you will feel it is real."},{"rating":"2","title":"His Best One!","review":"I thought I was a Deaver fan before this, having read Coffin Dancer and others, but A Maiden's Grave is definitely one of the best books I have read this year. The characterisation of Arthur Potter is excellent and the girls' strength during their ordeal will make you go from feeling sorry for them (for being deaf) to forgetting the disability and concentrating on how strong the main character is. Deaver's explaination of the Title of the Book is a particularly poignant scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!","review":"This book did not hold my interest at all.

Many vegetarian recipes require exotic ingredients, but most of the recipes in this book use ordinary ingredients, herbs, and spices. Many of the recipes are unusual but all that I've tried have been declicious. The only problem with this paperback edition is that it's very difficult to keep open on the counter while preparing a meal---I have to weight down the pages to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I just received my book yesterday. Upon looking through it, I was quite disappointed. I expected a book \\"for the vegetarian gourmet\\" to use mostly fresh ingredients. The majority of the soup recipes (and several other recipes throughout the book) use boullion instead of vegetable stock made from fresh vegetables. In addition, while \\"Boboli Pizza\\" is quick and easy, I do not consider it to be a gourmet recipe. The recipes in this book are quick and simple, and a lot of them look fairly tasty, but I think it is a stretch for the author to call them gourmet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lemmings is back, again...","review":"Not the first Lemmings game I've played, but it came bundled with my PC and gave it a spin. It installs in seconds on a Pentium II, even, and then went off straight away. When you enter the game, it gives you the storyline as part of the opening sequence. With that over, click 'new game' and you get this sideways pyramid of cubes. Most are yellow, but 3 are green. Click a green block to play that level. Then, wait a sec, and after a few moments a cylindrical tower will appear, all in lovely 3d. When you've conquered that level, 2 more will bcome green. And so on, and so forth. This game is good if you love lemmings, but it's also fun to see them 'plummeting' to their certain doom. And it's nice to see, a few times, their little faces exploding witha teeny pop. Overally good, too, even if it does take you a long time to find out how to rotate the screen view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool, really hard though","review":"I would definetly recommend this game to someone who has a lot of spare time. it is very difficult and frustrating if you don't get these suicidal lemmings to thier balloon on time.

I was thrilled when this came out and like the rest think it's a blast but VERY addicting. I love the pause feature which allows you to make changes and I love the zoom. I also agree that the circular layout doesn't add much - but the 3-d effects are great. This is totally worth the money.

So I called the manufacturer (World Imports) and they ultimately offered to send me a few crystals. I had to push pretty hard though as they wanted to to return the light and reship another. Well, I had the thing hung already. Just a huge hassle. Also, the wire they provide to hang the crystals has to be rigged and bent. I ended up going to Michaels and buying an earring post and made my own. All that being said, I think the light is very pretty especially at $150.

I bought it last week and I listen to it several times a day. I bought it because I loved the song Bailamos so much and I had seen several interviews with Enrique on television in the last few weeks. He is very passionate about his music and his fans and it comes through on his album. The songs are really great. I am currently studying the Spanish language and even though I don't understand all the lyrics yet, Enrique conveys the meaning with the feeling and emotion in his gorgeous voice. There are two songs in English and even people who don't speak Spanish at all will enjoy the other songs.

Sometimes he sound like somebody is killing him, as if he couldn't get the words out because he is shoking. I think the best thing Enrique could do is stick to writing and sell the songs to someone that could really sing them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A voice from Heaven oh boy!

There's no room for a techno beat in a Latin song, and anyone who is truly interested in hearing soulful Latin music should put down this album and slowly back away. Instead, buy Buena Vista Social Club-now THAT is real Latin music.

In my research I stumbled upon the Acoustech HT-75. They were certainly efficient enough and the reviews were good, so I thought, for the price, I'd try them. Boy, was I shocked. These speakers are terrific. The low and mid frequency reproduction is superior while the high frequency is very extended with a little edge. I'm comparing these unit's to speakers that cost at least 10 times more. They are not perfect, but for the price you can't go wrong. Especially with tube amp's.

When listening to music, highs are very clear, but not over-hyped. There is also a considerable amount of low end that comes out of these cabinets. I do have a sub, and would recommend one, but if you don't have one these speakers can hold there own. I was a little surprised when watching movies though considering they are marketed as cinema speakers. Action scenes and music all sound great, but I have the matching center channel as well and don't love the way it treats spoken word. Which really has nothing to do with these speakers. But vocals on music sounded great through these speakers, so maybe it is the center channel. I'm not sure if I love horn loaded cabinets yet or not. The horns sometimes sound a little squashed or compressed, but they still sound very good. I have no problem recommending these speakers to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very musical pair of speakers","review":"The vendor AcousticSounddesign shipped out the tower speakers promptly. The tower speakers (one in each box) arrived undamaged, to my relief. These Acoustech HT-75 speakers doesn't need that much power to produce decent volume, living up to the \\"high-efficiency\\" description. The sound coming out is bright, accurate, quick and detailed. For more low end, a sub-woofer is recommended to go with these tower speakers. The construction is on the thin/light side. I suspect that if the huge front port is made any smaller, resonance will form inside due to the light construction. Overall, these speakers look as good as they sound. A good value for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING BOOK....","review":"I'm so glad to find this book again. I have the original copy my mother had and passed onto me. I have read this book over and over again over the years and it is getting pretty used. I have known Bob Tininenko all of my life and it still amazes me that he went through this, it seems eveytime I plan on seeing him it makes me want to read this book again. He is an amazing man and I'm so lucky to know him and his loving family. He is so interesting to talk to, funny, sarcastic, and a joy to be around. I'm getting this extra copy to lend to friends who want to hear this amazing story of survival. Ok, I'm starting to read it again today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning - Not for reading with kids!","review":"I mistakenly picked up this book and began reading it to my 7 year old son, thinking it would be a fun read together, which might inspire him to explore other books of this topic matter. In the first page I coughed my way through the word \\"G--D---\\" and found myself coughing my way through reading the entire first chapter. I found it too much effort to \\"bleep\\" my way through the tricky French-Canadian-Cowboy dialect of the trash-mouthed main character and eventually put the book down. I can't say I enjoy reading those words, myself, even.So, if you are a parent and think that these older fiction books are more \\"safe\\" than the onese being produced today... think again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Godzilla 2000","review":"Godzilla 2000 is the BEST Godzilla movie EVER! It had great special effects, and it had the best monsters. I went to see it when it first came out in theatres, and couldn't wait for it to come out on video so that I could buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie but the dubbing stunk!!!","review":"This is definitely one of my favorite Godzilla movies, however, I'm one of the lucky ones who has seen the original subtitled version. The dubbing stunk on this movie. It seems that Tri-Star, when they released these new Godzilla movies in the last year, put their C team on them. Anyway, The special effects are really good, except the scene where the little detroyers are swarming around. The story is great- Godzilla on the verge of nuclear meltdown. The movie is very emotional-Junior's apparent death and the death of Godzilla. Man, that scene where Godzilla melts makes me want to cry. Akira Ifukube's music during this scene is among his best themes. Amidts all of the movie's apparent flaws, I highly recommend this movie. If you can get a copy of the subtitled letterbox version."},{"rating":"1","title":"lousy movie and a phenomenon","review":"since i cant rate it a 3.5 im going with 2. first off space godzilla. ilike space godzilla but the director mustv been the hedorah faluire who i hear is directing the new godzilla movie. very bad and gives this pack a bad name. i recomend destroyah.now destroyah is really coll.and this movie did a god job ending the heisei series. the ending was depressing because 1 godzilla was melting 2 the muisic was sad 3 they did a good job with the camera. i recomend going to [...] (destroyah only) if you can get it to the us. i have a goal of collecting every godzilla movie so yeah..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not what I heard","review":"I was sorely disappointed. Sorry, guys, but this was a waste. I love BigG, but the writers were really stretching this time. To summarize the plot, a scientist revisiting the destructive power of the Oxygen Destroyer (\\"Godzilla, King of the Monsters\\") creates (inexplicably) monster-sized micro-organisms which can, at times, mutate into one giant monster. This behemoth of a bacteria (Destoroyah) spontaneously degenerates into little bugs and reforms time and again. The whole movie is just too trippy for my taste--I loved King of the Monsters, GvsMechaG, Destroy All Monsters, and GvsSpazeG, but Destoroyah shames the good name of Godzilla."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Godzilla","review":"I will tell you about both movies:Godzilla Vs. Space Godzilla: Created from the cells that Biollante shot into space, Space Godzilla forms and heads towards Godzilla and his son. While a madman tries to take down Godzilla by weapons....Space Godzilla and Godzilla clash, while a super robot tries to help the King Of Monsters to defeat the invader from Space!Godzilla Vs. Destroyah: As Godzilla's body starts to meltdown, scientists beleive they only have limited time, untill Godzilla's meltdown destroys the Earth. In the meanwhile a type of chemical monster forms....Destroyah! As the monster causes damage in Tokyo, it seems the only way to stop Godzilla from destroying Earth is to put a device known as the Oxygen Destroyah in the water, which will destroy Godzilla. But as Godzilla fails to defeat Destroyah...his son Godzilla Jr. takes hold of the battle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Space Godzilla is pretty lousy but Destroyah RULES!","review":"This DVD is of very high quality and the Destroyah movie was excellent, but that stupid, mediocre Space Godzilla movie brought this DVD down and prevented it from getting 5 stars. That movie is just loaded with stupid, boring characters and the fights are uneventful. The only thing that saved the movie was the awesome design of Space Godzilla and the cute Little Godzilla. Destroyah really needs no introduction to Kaiju fans. Needless to say, it rules."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Godzilla film of them all!","review":"If you see one Godzilla film this year make it Godzilla vs Destoroyah. The story line is good, the action is some of the best to come out of Toho. The special effects aren't too shabby either. I highly recommend buying this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest movies of all time!!!","review":"Godzilla vs. Destoroyah is the greatest Godzilla film ever and will always be. It can never be topped. This of one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time!!! The ending scene is so great it will bring tears to your eyes and you will never ever forget it. THE LEGEND WILL NEVER DIE! LONG LIVE GODZILLA JR.!"},{"rating":"2","title":"2 Great Godzilla Movies in 1 package","review":"Godzilla vs SpaceGodzilla is an awesome movie. SpaceGodzilla is a cool monster. Little Godzilla is so adorable! I love that little guy.Godzilla vs Destroyah is a very sad movie. It is as sad as Old Yeller. Godzilla's death is as sad as the death of Old Yeller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why this is a must see","review":"This movie has it all, it truly is the best Godzilla ever shot and ranks up there with many Sci-Fi films. It has fantastic special effects, a great score and a very thought out script. They even brought back Yemico, one of the main characters from the original King of the Monsters movie! The action is fast paced and there are scenes unlike any of you have seen in other Godzilla movies. But be prepared, your going to get quite the lump in the ole throat toward the end of the movie. I HIGHLY reccommend this movie to anyone. The only thing I wish they could have done was brought Raymond Burr back for the big finale, but seeing as he is no longer with us I guess that would have been a little difficult."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would prefer the Japanese version instead","review":"Although I have seen both the English and Japanese versions, I would have to say to those Godzilla fans out there: Watch the Japanese version instead. I will admit that watching Godzilla die is hard, but at the film's end Godzilla Jr. has grown up to take his father's place. The Japanese version's translations are precise, but the English translation of the film doesn't follow the movie itself. But all in all, Godzilla vs. Destoroyah is one movie that you don't want to miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!!!","review":"This definatly the best Godzilla movie yet! The little B&W clip at the end of the movie was pretty cool to put in, but I've heard that the Japanese ending (with a FULL rolling credits screen) is a lot better. Anyway, if you WOULD buy this movie from Amazon.com because I ordered mine from Blockbuster and had to wait 2 weeks without a dollar discount!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Double the monster action","review":"This is a double feature dvd set.1 of them is Godzilla vs Spacegodzilla and Godzilla vs Destoroyah.If your a Godzilla fan like me than i reccomnd this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Godzilla movie made","review":"Second to Godzilla Vs.King Ghidora(1991) this is the best film Toho has made in the new series .More than the plot etc. I think its the final scene when Godzilla melts away that WILL stay with you for a while.Evokes plenty of feeling especially if you have lived with Godzilla all your life.This movie is a must see.Long live Godzilla 2000(Jr.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good Godzilla DVD","review":"Godzilla has been around since forever as long as i can remember. But seeing the 90s type Godzilla is truly awesome. This double feature is a very good and decent DVD to be honest. If you happen to get this Godzilla DVD, get it for \\"Godzilla vs Destoroyah\\", which, in my view is the best Godzilla film of the 90s...highly recommended !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One fair one awesome","review":"I recorded these two on Sci-Fi one time, but the tape got ruined so I bought it. Godzilla v.s. Space Godzilla is not great, but it's tolerable. I don't watch the movies for the people, I watch them for the monsters. Space godzilla is cool, but Godzilla's head and roar remind me of a rat. Mogera is really stupid, too. My rating:6.0 Godzilla v.s. Destoroyah is something else. Destoroyah is really cool monster, the guy looks dang evil, and his ability to lift Godzilla is incredible. Godzilla rocks,with the red heat beam and he's a lot taller, too. Junior (A.K.A. little Godzilla is really cool and when he dies, it's pretty hard to watch. and even more heartbreaking is when you see Godzilla's one and only tear. Godzilla dying is an amazing way for the king of the monsters to go out with a fight and I know that even in his death, Godzilla is immortal. my rating:9.8"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of the New Generation","review":"People may read these reviews and not believe that they are for Japanese Godzilla movies, but these are great films. Keep in mind that the links between the movies are thin and they apparantly are not always intended to be part of an ongoing storyline although elements do continue through them. That said-sit back and enjoy some great entertainment!The eco-friendly slant on all the new Godzilla (and Mothra) movies makes them make you feel warm and fuzzy even during the destruction of countless Japanese urban areas. The tear that comes to your eye in Godzilla vs. Destroyah when Godzilla is mourning the loss of Godzilla Jr. is a true surprise, the ending sequence (about 20 minutes) is classic and should not be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Destroyah and Godzilla. Thats a twist","review":"This is one of G's Best films EVER The music is good the FX the monsters everything except there is hardly any comedy. I especially like the scenes where Destroyer kills the fish and when Godzilla melts I would get this movie if I were you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd Duck","review":"This movie is an odd duck. If you watched it in 1990 when it came out then you'd probably think it was funny (like I did) but after buying it in 2006 and watching it again - I could barely sit through it! Sandra's humor is very \\"New York\\" and in some ways very sophisticated so if you don't know the name of designer furniture and clothing many of her jokes will go over your head as could many of the jewish and ethnic jokes. If you're into that type of humor then you might find it hysterical. It's a musical in case you didn't know but some of the songs are VERY SLOW (and, um, sorry to say... boring.) At the end of the movie she does strip down to a stars & stripes bikini and dances away to Prince (formerly known as) - which could be worth the price of admission for some."},{"rating":"2","title":"It will change your life","review":"My introduction to Sandra Bernhard, the ultimate sage of our times, came when I went to see \\"Without You I'm Nothing\\" in the movie theater when it was first released. I knew nothing about her and was blown away by her wit and insight into American culture. I have never been in a movie audience that laughed as hard and as often than when I saw this film. Sandra has that uncanny ability to be at once hilariously funny and deeply moving. Her stage performances are brilliant and \\"Without You I'm Nothing\\" captures her brilliance in an innovative and creative way - this film is not simply a multi-camera shoot of a stage performance, but utilizes fiction, documentary and stage elements all at once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sandra at her Best","review":"This is Sandy at her best... ironic, sarcastic, hilarious, and heartbreaking. Based on her one-woman show which played Off-Broadway in 1987, she made the decision to film her show in front of an audience... but one that pays her absolutely no attention. In doing this, you can focus on her performance without the distraction of hearing other's reactions. This is not for everyone... if you're not overly aware of her many pop culture references, you may feel that you're not in on the joke. Like an early Bette Midler, she can turn from wildly comic to sentimental in a moment - and with a voice that wraps itself around a melody like Streisand (without the self-conciousness), you will either love her or hate her.Nestled in between her various numbers are vigniettes of talking heads commenting on her stardom... can't say I understood what they were really all about, but it adds another dimension to the work. Plenty here to laugh about, discuss, and just plain enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of a kind","review":"This movie, WITHOUT YOU I'M NOTHING, is based on Sandra's off-broaway, smash hit one woman show. Whew.. that was a mouthful. Anyway I wasn't familiar with Sandra's work before I saw this but after I saw this, I was floored. It's funny, touching, silly, and crazy. It's one of the best movies/shows I've seen. During WITHOUT YOU I'M NOTHING Sandra takes jabs at people but she's also an incredible storyteller/comedian. She also sings and dances thoughout. This movie is like no other. It's dark humor, crazy stories, and Sandra's eccentric attitude is sure to entertain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will change you whole view on Sandra Bernhard.","review":"Sandra Bernhard talent shines in Without You I am Nothing.

I wasn't really sure what to expect... but once I started, I was hooked. The first chapter describes a red dragon's birth... from the point of view of the red dragon, inside the egg.Then, it was all a swirl of dragons, following metallic dragons as they grew, and then moving on to include several generations of dragons -- mostly gold, silver and the chromatic and evil red -- as they fight for territory and in the Dragon War.Well, no review could actually do this book justice, so go out there, buy it, read it, if you love dragons as much as I do, I'm sure you'll love The Dragons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragon Heaven","review":"If you're wondering how things are with the dragon race of Krynn, then this book is all your answers in one!

Each character is beautifully represented by Mr. Gardner, who shows his remarkable grasp of a world knocked slightly askew...one might draw parallels between this work and Douglas Adams' 'Hitchiker's Guide' series. A truly remarkable book on it's own, and much better when you read it's predecessors! Definately recommended reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"20 years and still reading!","review":"I bought this book when it first came out 20 some odd years ago, and of the 1000+ books I've read, this is still one of my all time favorites.

The author does this and more.A very well written meditation book that will soothe many that read the words between the covers of this work.Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most helpful, wise books I have ever read","review":"This book is more than wonderful in it's wisdom, gentle strength, affirmation of self and deft perceptions. It has offered much sage, useful and worthwhile nuggets of pure lovliness and hope. I have started 2 different groups that use this book to discuss and make big changes in their life. Melodie Beattie certainly knows of what she speaks -- and her knowledge/wisdom resonates with many."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect insight and inspiration","review":"In the early months of my sobriety, I called my sponsor one night after a fight with my husband. She took out this book and read a small reading from it, and it resonated so strong with me that I purchased the book for myself. Since then, it's been an invaluable part of my daily meditation. When I need a little insight on a particular topic, I look in the index and usually find the strength I'm looking for. After reading this book for almost a year, I think it's for more than just people in recovery. It's for anyone that cannot depend on themselves for strength, love, guidance.

The book made me want to bond with my girlfriends, pamper myself and turn the whole ordeal into a positive, even fun experience.

It's an easy read, and the characters and situations are very interesting, even engrossing. However, the book is driven by a string of highly improbable coincidences. A drunk just happens to remove the license plates from a car. The detective just happens to keep running into Lucienne on odd occasions and critical junctures. The detective just happens to be struck by a painting hanging on the victim's wall. Lucienne just happens to be in a location where some Italians just happen to be talking about the victim's wife, in a language Lucienne just happens to understand. The victim just happens to withhold from Lucienne his crucial conversation with his wife. Van der Valk didn't solve the mystery, the solution just happened to fall into his lap (with some loose ends that are never explained).

The police try to figure it out but Gypsy Rose Lee and the fellow strippers will ahve to figure it out themselves.Needlessly convoluted and pretty poorly written. What's frustrating is that this has some well-written passages and interesting characters but then it just gets confusing and/or dull. Lee was obviously no author. It is a somewhat interesting look back at burlesque houses (which are long gone) and the people who worked them but that can't support the sloppy writing and confusing narrative. This was considered pretty risque back in 1941 but todays it's tame and silly. Some people love this (look at the other reviews) but i found it pretty bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Product, Horrible Shipment","review":"Drive installation is pretty straight forward, but a bit clunky because of the way the steel brackets clamp together. The company did not think through how the duplicator controller should be placed, and the connecting cables get wired. The case weighs a ton when it shouldn't have- e.g. the company could have used aluminum instead of steel, which would've made it lighter and better for heat dissipation.The product was also shipped to me straight in its original box- no packaging to ensure things didn't break or chip, as they most certainly did. The rivets that the screws were going into had bent, making the case I received very unstable. I had to disassemble and re-assemble it with some patchwork fixes to make it stand straight. The case was bought a year ago and I did not have time to follow up on requesting a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and thought-provoking","review":"Ive required this in class and students respond well to it.

This book was a big hit with him and me!This book organization of this book gives it 4 sections for paid (city), volunteer (country), forest and harbor departments.

They are now running around cleaning up rubble and writing reports, two aspects of firefighting that were left out of many other books.

I put my 12 favorite spices in this rack and it looks great on our counter and takes up very little room. I really like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well I can only speak for myself","review":"I read a few not so favorable reviews, mostly stemming from problematic attachment of the stand (which mine does not suffer), but I decided to order it anyway, figuring the potential upside eclipses any issues with the stand (you can also wall mount it). Well it has paid off, as the magnets work as promised, the tines stay sealed tight, and the tops rotate to open two different sized outlets for the spices. I pitched the included spices and filled it with my own. As for labels, there are many clear preprinted labels available for purchase here or elsewhere to accommodate your own spices. I honestly have never seen a better designed spice rack, and it has worked beautifully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont do it! There are better options.","review":"I strongly suggest buying your own metal strip or board or painting your wall with magnetic paint and then buying some higher quality magnetic spice tins from a retailer elsewhere.These particular tins are made very cheaply. Spice gets stuck under the plastic front and metal edge, and it's pretty gross.They are easy to knock of the wall when you take one because the magnets are so weak.The magnets will eventually just fall off he back of the container and then the container will fall to the floor, getting dented and spilling spices.I have found much better options elsewhere, dont write off magnetic tins from these cheapies. They can and do work -- however these won't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away, this product is garbage","review":"This product is garbage. I have finally thrown it out after one year due to the following problems --1) One by one, each jar lost its magnet due to weak adhesive. One by one, I superglued them back together.2) Several of the jars became entirely bonded shut and the rest are difficult to open so they're almost there. (Climate related? I live in New York.)3) The ones that are still usable smell like metal and impart a metal flavor on the spices.4) I too had a problem with the frame snapping right off the back so I had to just lean the whole stand against a wall.5) Several of them appear rusty though I have no recollection of ever getting them wet."},{"rating":"1","title":"TIN magnetic Spice Rack","review":"I think I was just so excited about the price and when the only metal listed in the product detail was \\"stainless steel\\" I impulse purchased this. The containers are tin the STAND is stainless steel. The problem with tin is the smell and the durability. 2 of the 12 containers in my set came dented. The smell will definitely over take the spices eventually. I think in the product detail it also suggested this be used for crafts, I think that would be a better use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Expect to Love this.","review":"What a great idea: a spice rack that you can hang next to your kitchen work area that won't be in the way. Wrong. The magnets on the bottom of the spices, fall off. That's right: in the middle of mixing something, a magnet falls off causing a spice to fall onto whatever is close. Of course, the magnets fall off when you're not even close to the rack. You get to walk into the mess in the kitchen after the magnet has come off, the container has dropped, and the lid has come off.Great idea in theory, but a horribly high price to pay for something that you will want to throw out within a few weeks of messes."},{"rating":"2","title":"looks great in the kitchen!","review":"bought this spice rack purely for organizational/ aesthetic reasons. it's easy to use and looks great in the kitchen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kamenstein 12 Tin Magnetic Spice Rack","review":"I love my spice rack. I was hoping to hang it on the wall, but it was just a liitle too tall for the space between the counter and cabinets, but it really takes up very little counter space. I do with the opening was easier to find, it seems that I spin the lid around several times trying to find it. Maybe an indention or mark where the opening is. Other than that, I am very happy with my purchase. I fill the tins with my own seasonings, but it does come with seasonings. I didn't use the lables since I use differnt spices, but a small strip of masking tape and a sharpie work just fine for me. I think this is a great value for as many containers as you get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad magnets, bad seal, look for another spice solution","review":"I've had two of these for a number of years and I am finally fed up.The magnets are poorly adhered and weak, so either the magnets detach from the tins or the tins fall at the slightest jostle.The seals on the jars are equally poor. If mounted vertically some of the lids can slide off causing spices to spill. You cannot store any sort of powdered spice in the tins because humidity will cause things such as garlic powder to clump.I'm sure there are good magnetic spice solutions out there, but these aren't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tin Cans Rust","review":"I loved the idea of this magnetic spice rack. But after a few months, the tin cans have begun to rust. It's unfortunate because this set was expensive. I actually bought these at Target first and they were being clearanced out. Then I bought a second set online to expand my collection. I see now why the product was being clearanced out. They should make the spice cans out of steel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magnets fell off as soon as you opened the box","review":"Thought this was a nice idea for the kitchen, but it was not meant to be. Upon opening the box for the first time, the magnets glued to the bottom of the canisters had already fallen off over half of them. The magnets themselves are very weak and can barely hold the canister itself, let alone with spices inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"great space saver","review":"no problems with the magnets falling off of the base. attached easily to the wall. great for a small kitchens with not much counter space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something else","review":"Thought this would be a perfect spice rack, until the magnets came off the tins.

My kitchen is small, so I needed something that would mount on the wall, but would still look like. With my stainless steel appliances, this was perfect.

You don't buy a book like that for the story -- you buy it for the story and the pictures -- it's a book for younger children after all -- and you hope that the pictures will bring back the fond memories of seeing the story on big screen. But this book is so modestly illustrated that it seems totally unrelated to the film. Even the characters look different. All excitement and all that underwater magic are gone. 'Toy Story' -- from the same series of Disney books -- is illustrated much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Big disappointment. The illustrations are very poor.

Edmund Obrien,Peter Lawford and Harry Gaurdino just to name a few. The story is well plotted so you do not get bored while watching.Garner is the star and does well in carrying the movie. it is great to see him in something that did not just having him survive on his charm.

I profoundly appreciate their uniqueness among the genre and there are few resemblances of anything else outside, it's pure ZF sound, still it's very clearly related to the noise and \\"industrial\\" field.

I have been listening to it, and three or four Randy California posthumous albums lately. I think I can only recomend \\"Spirit od 76\\" for those die-hard Spirit fans who want to know where Randy, and the band was at in 1976. For me overall the album was meandering, and very dated. There were only a couple bright spots in the 2 disc album. I listened to it twice, and then pitched the album in the trash. I knew I would never listen to it again. Over-all a disappointing experience. To me, only of value to see how Randy, and the band had progressed. I can highly recommend \\"Cosmic Smile\\", \\"Sea Dreams\\", and even \\"Son of America\\".

The main character, a former nun, meets tragedy after tragedy, and eventually assumes the identity of a young priest, sent to spread God's word to the residents of an Indian reservation. She is so obscure, as are many of the characters in this book, and was impossible to relate to. My mom and I both read the book, as did the eight dedicated readers in my book club, and out of the ten of us, three actually finished the novel.

And what do her quasi-mystical aphorisms actually mean? They are often just plain nonsensical, like something out of Monty Python.

Our daughter loves the Hello Kitty character and we, too, think it is very cute. But this DVD is definitely not for children under the age of 5. The stories are quite scary and a child at the age of our daughter cannot really distinguish between fiction and reality. The stories are rather for older kids but then the characters are not interesting for this age group anymore. So I think, there is no appropriate age group for this DVD.

It gives true insight into the lives of most Japanese women, and how women in general are treated in Japan."},{"rating":"1","title":"editing needed","review":"My main impression of this book is that it would have made an excellent (long) magazine article or series. It seriously needed some editing to hit the highlights instead of going on and on with details. For instance, the whole storyline of the trees being razed for a parking lot, and the way the author could never fully understand it, was quite tedious. That being said, I did read an advance copy of the book, so it may have improved before publication. (I still think it would have been better as an article)This book does provide a great peek into an ordinary life, and I've come away with a different view of certain aspects of Japan. I was surprised to learn of how the teenagers fight with their parents, and dismayed to see how much time the Japanese man spends at work instead of with his family (or anything else, for that matter)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoyable, but not nearly intelligent","review":"This book about Japanese society is written from the point of view of an American. It is highly readable and enjoyable, but here and there are typical American's biases. If you want to know why American's way of living is different from Japanese's, this is the book for you. If you want to know why Japanese's way of living is different from Americans, look for a more intelligent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great look at the grass-roots...","review":"The best books about other cultures are those that start at the bottom and work up. In this book Elisabeth Bumiller interviews a Japanese women and her family, friends and others linked to the family to give a very detailed picture of a Japanese family from 1991 to 1992. We get to join festivals, sit in at PTA meetings, visit mobsters, learn about local politics, find out what family issues the Japanese have and even the family's view on America and international events.NOTE: The author has very strong views of her own and will state them, but don't let that get in the way of the rest of the book. She digs up a LOT of information and makes it clear that while the Japanese might have different ways of thinking or doing stuff, they do have some of the same goals, dreams and fears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outside, looking in","review":"As much as the author's view on the complex dynamics of the Japaese appears simplistic and limited, nonetheless, her observations are keen and her articulation of her own reactions are flawless. This is not meant to be a judgemental account of the West looking at the East. Rather, it is a collection of one's own analysis and predilections of a society- an attempt at wrapping one's mind around an organic, enigmatic phenamenon. Thoughtful, genuine, true to the Asian experience that not all things can be said on the words of a page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome underlayer but not warm enough to wear alone.","review":"I really do love these pants.

Kane's book is talky like a soap opera, has idealized but unrealistic characters, and plenty of sex appeal but little in the way of an actual mystery.

And that really stinks since I had it on back order for so long. For some reason, I just couldn't get into it, or get a good feel for the characters. It seemed really boilerplate in places. And frankly, the ending was really obvious. I mean, it's been done before (like just about everything else out there). I finally skipped a good chunk of the front and moved on and was able to read the mid section. Then, when it dropped off again, I just skipped to the back. (I did go back and read those skipped sections to make sure I didn't miss anything. It was like returning to a soap opera after two years to find the exact same plot line.) Trite and obvious prose in places, this is a story that has potential but falls short of what I expect from this normally fantastic author.

The characters are deep, and you can easily relate to them.Good read. I can't wait for more!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too predictible and unlikeable characters","review":"I read this entire book, but only because I didn't have anything else to read. It's the kind of book you could put down at any point and not miss the characters or wonder what happened to them. You know what happens to them and who did it to them almost from the very beginning.

If you have no experience reading music, I would rate this as moderate in difficulty. I liked it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Boz at his best","review":"This was his second album following his leaving the Steve Miller Band. I have never seen it in a US release. This album is much more in tune with Boz as a blues/rock musician. A top notch band including a horn section. Not much like his later work, where he became more of a ballad/pop performer, but a better production than his first solo effort(also a must have for the \\"Loan Me A Dime\\" track with Duane Allman). This CD is simply great music which stands the test of time. Buy it now while it is still available. You will not regret."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Boz","review":"I rate this album right up with Silk Degrees and Slow Dancer as his best work. He's never been funkier than on tracks like Monkey Time, Why Why, and Flames of Love. There are four great ballads, including Love Anyway, one of the best ballads he's ever done. And he also mixes it up a little, throwing in a lot of big band sounding horns on Runnin' Blue and going a little country on Up to You. Of course, the musicianship on every song is incredible. I paid $40 a while ago to get a used copy of this with a mediocre mastering job! I was happy to find that copy, though, and I will gladly buy it again to get the sound upgraded by the new remastering--because it's that good. If you enjoy anything by Boz Scaggs, trust me, you need this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Funk?","review":"To be honest, I only bought this recording to hear more of obscure organist Jymm Joachim Young who was so outstanding on Steve Miller's song Fly Like An Eagle. On Boz Scaggs Band his (and everyone else's) talent is wasted. None of these songs are memorable (and I've listened to this CD about ten times). So called standout tracks like Monkey Time and Runnin' Blue have great titles but are ultimately forgettable.Perhaps this would be a good keepsake for those who saw Boz Scaggs in the late sixties or early seventies. For the rest of us, the question comes to mind: where's the funk?[DW]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very interesting and informative","review":"I was looking for a book on this subject that would bring me up to date on current thinking about the evolution of ourselves. This was an easy read that was also very informative and for me, exciting and interesting. I had not read anything on the topic for at least 10 years. The author presents very common sense theories based on many years of research that are not dependent on a story scenario to make his case(s).

I had to re-install it once because the main screen was glitching. After I got that taken care of, I discovered that the scrolling in the game was about as smooth as sandpaper, and hard to control the mouse. Luckily I also have a Pentium II computer, and it works fine there.I also found some data mix-ups with the populations of cities, I don't think Los Angeles only has 550,000 people! I also think that the pop. of 4,000,000 for Mexico City was a little off. As well as 30,000,000 for Miami.If you don't mind these kinds of problems, buy the game, it's great.

There's a lot of room for improvement, different ways to play the game, etc. Nothing will ever be the same. Unfortunately, it's very predictable. It's quite capitalistic-like, but too extreme. The game starts off by giving you NO business so you're in the red. This can be overcome by little initial spending. Soon after this turn for the worse - business is booming! Contracts coming from all over the place. THEN...you experience a drought that is impossible to overcome with NO explanation. This has happened to me multiple times with no remedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"All right, but could use ALOT of fixing up","review":"It's fairly good but there are major flaws. First of all, When you opened a saved game, all the planes you had at youre airport are gone.

The graphics in this game are pretty cool, you can really see what you are creating at many different angles. However, the game becomes very frustrating after a while because nothing happens! I read the manual and in the back it showed us an example airport in Chicago. It told me step by step how to build a simple airport. For one thing, I ran out of money. Also, it never told us how to negotiate contracts or anything! The end result? My airport just sat there with no planes and diving into debt.

Learning the game takes a while though. It took me a few hours to learn how to play it. The tutorial hardly helps you to figure out the game. It does not even make a full airport. The only way to figure out the game is to use trial and error. But once you learn the game it is very fun and realistic. If you like sim games you will probably like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great game, but...","review":"This game is great. yes there is a pretty high learning curve, but unless you could not get over sim city 3000, you should be ok. The graphics are absoulutely amazing and once you get your place moving a control tower view is available. From here, your airport takes the shape of one from real life. Really very cool!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE MOST HORRIBLE SIMULATION GAME CURRENTLY!!!!!!","review":"This is one of the worst games in the world. The tutorial is poorly built and confusing. Even DinoPark Tycoon is funner. It seems like this game only took 1 day to make. The management is horrible, graphics are horrible, and this game will make a good sleep pill. It is so difficult to learn and once you master it, it is boring. I recommend that you don't buy this game if your life depended on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"this game [stinks]","review":"well i am a big fan of tycoon games but this one really bites the dust. Now i think it is a really great concept and i dont mind the graphics. All the buildings are pretty cool but there is one problem. One of the things that i like most about tycoon games is to watch the people in the game. Well in this game the people dont do anything and it gets boring to play, in fact its depressing. There is no noise and sound, its boring to watch and even more boring to play. If you want a good tycoon game, one that i think is much better is airline tycoon. It is the same concept but a much better game. Take my advice and dont waste your money on this game"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Game, Awful Support, 2 many bugs","review":"This was a total waste of money. I work for a software company in NH/MA and do Quality Assurance on software programs. This program has entirely too many bugs for any user. Before you buy this game, read all of the comments and reviews, that was the mistake I made. How can a company release a piece of software that will result in constant freezes, enless waits, and an annoying as hell pager that goes off all of the time. Hundreds of flights can arrive and depart daily from your airport, yet you may never see a single plane all day, What's up with that? Poor design concept. The thought is good, but they really ruined the game by releasing it before the bugs were worked out, AND STILL NO PATCH EXISTS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, bad development","review":"I was very excited when I bought the game because I am a huge fan of tycoon games. Unfortunatedly, this one wasn't as good as you could expect from the name and the idea. After you open your airport and get your first two or three contracts, the game enters in an endless task of approving and rejecting business and airlines contracts and there is nothing else to do. Basically, after the first two or three hours of playing it gets boring doing over and over the same things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"This game is interesting at the beginning, however money soon begins to run out after a certain amount of time. When you reach a large amount of passenger volume you have to constantly build security gates and lockers and other items in the terminal to keep passengers happy. One of my airports had almost 100 security gates and they kept asking for more - after all the effort you put in the game it just frustrates you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good vs. Bad....","review":"I bought this game at wal-mart (for half the price...), and I've done the tutorial, read the instruction book, spent a few hours trying to play...not very entertaining. It has BASIC graphics, very simple (not user friendly, basic programing). Very difficult to master, but if you've got the time, you could possibly enjoy this game. One of the other reviews said looking online for strategy guides, again...how much time do you really want to spend playing this game?I buy a lot and play a lot of these 'tycoon' or simulation games, and I can tell you by experience, this game would be at the bottom of my list of favs. Hope that helps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away!","review":"You'd think, OK, someone new is following in the steps of Railroad Tycoon (like Chris Sawyer when he did Transport Tycoon), but not this game. The game won't even work the right way. I can't even build the terminal! Stay away. If you're thinking \\"It has the word tycoon\\" step back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Potential","review":"Wait for the patch. This game has far too many bugs, very disappointing. But it is otherwise a cool game. You can manage everything in your airport. I like how you can negotiate contracts with businesses to place things like fast food joints in your terminal. I'm waiting to find a patch (something you can download that will fix the bugs) for this game so i can finally enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea -- abysmal execution","review":"This could have been a great game. It has all the elements to succeed and is well-conceived. The designer included all sorts of elements from airport design, a financial model, negotiation of contracts and numerous camera views such as walking through the terminal. Unfortunately, the execution is awful. The graphics are 5 years behind (& ugly to boot); the interface is awkward; there is no sound to speak of; there are numerous bugs; the manual is no help; construction of the airport is clumsy; and not much happens once the game runs. Did I say the graphics are only 5 years behind. Compare the passengers walking through the terminal to the Dire Straits video from the early 1980's (I want my MTV)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I am not much of a game expert, but I do know what I like to play. I decided I wanted the game because the concept of running my own airport would be fun. I even read a few of the reviews on amazon. My husband seen the game at [local store] including in a pack with other games. He only paid [some money] for the pack and I see why. First the box said airport tycoon, but the cd saids Air Mogul. I guess it is the same game. When I first seen the graphics it was awful. I still thought there would be hope. The game play is not easy to understand and the game tutorial was worthless in fact it was mess up itself. I just didn't like it at all. I was very disappointed. So if you are just a person who like to play games just for the fun of it, and not one of those hard gamers don't waste your money on this game. It wasn't even worth a few dollars. Now one of the other games in the pack I am currently playing is RailRoad Tycoon 2 and it was definitely worth the few dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Airport Tycoon Review","review":"I thought that the game is very entertaining.

At first, I was excited to build my own airport with security and gates and everything, but the makeshift passengers could care less about boundaries and markers, so the game automatically gets the [worst] rating. The Planes that come and go on the runways are sortof interesting, but when asked to sign a new contract with an airline, you don't even notice a different plane coming in, they all look the same! Also, the title of this game is \\"Airport Tycoon,\\" but, when installed, the game is somehow renamed \\"Air Mogul\\" which is the stupidest thing I have ever seen.This game is a great idea, it just has to be developed further into something that works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Airport Tycoon is trash","review":"I bought the game with high hopes having played Roller Coaster Tycoon for many months. This game is just a disappointment. It takes a long time for one year to pass and the game just creeps by. I start the game and then walk away to do other stuff and then come back and clear up any trouble that has developed and then walk off again. It doesn't hold my interest. The graphics are poor to say the least and there are not any instructions to help you get started. This game is not worth it. Go buy RailRoad Tycoon instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"DUMB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"When I bought this game I thought that it was going to be something fun to play. IT WASN'T!

The interface is terrible, the menue vanishes at times and you have to restart the game as well as the lag of just trying to get the mouse to move to a position. There is no help for the game at all.

And the biggest factor that it fails to anywhere close to fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad bad bad","review":"This program tries to be a serious business sim and a Sim City type of game but instead does neither well. The manual is too small to help. In the time it takes a plane to land several hours have passed. Night time never comes and though flights are delayed by bad weather nothing reflects the bad weather other than the warning on your pager. Oddly enough, I saw a remarkably similar program entitled Airport Inc on the web that looked more involved but it was obviously the same graphics. I think this company is just trying anything they can to recoup losses incurred in making this turkey. Too bad though - it's a great idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Airport Tycoon 2","review":"I haven't bought this game but it's on the way. After reading all of the reviews, they all have something in common. Not enough money. It says that its Air Mougl but that's not the game. It takes time! In the real world, you don't just POOF! Money floods in! You need to start small, maybe 1 plane and a small terminal etc. Don't build a gigantic airport and then expect money to come when you have no planes! Save up money, and once you have enough, build on. DuPage Airport didn't just appear out of nowhere and it became the best airport!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An enlightening \\"science fiction war tragedy\\"","review":"I was one of the first to receive and finish Roberts' first novel, Dark Renaissance. Needless to say, I was surprised. For an author of his age-- a mere teenager-- he has a vast understanding of the world. There is something in this novel for everyone. Romance, tragedy, personal struggle, action, violence, science fiction, drama. Although the writing itself may not to be up to par with his older-generation contemporaries, it is engaging, using many similes and symbolism. The plot is also easy to follow and relate to, and is very original. No matter what kind of person one might be, there's a little something for anyone in this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calcium & Magnesium in the right proportions","review":"I have been using Kal Dolomite powder for many years now.

Cordrescu's idea of linking the past (Bathory), with present (the current problems in the Balkans as represented in the figure Drake), is solid. But as the novel unfolds, he barely scratches the surface of possibilities. The litany of horrors -- and there are plenty -- eventually leave the reader bored. The violence and sex become gratuitous when it becomes apparent that there is no progression in the story, and that what you're reading seems more and more like a cut and paste job. The last two hundred pages are torture (maybe that's the point). Still, you can find some good stretches in this book. But if you have something else on the shelf (King, Straub -- if its horror you want), I suggest starting there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef???","review":"A surprizingly disappointing rendition of a potentially exillarating story. I have read articles and other short stories written by Godrescu, and I expected so much more... (Good thing I didn't pay full price.) The story within story set up didn't impress me, but he could have been worked it better. Historical details were Ok, perhaps one day I'll visit Hungary. The gory details were lacking. There wasn't enough anything - not enough gore, not enough history, not enough sex, not enough horror, not enough details; just not enough! To the Author I say: \\"Read one of Gary Jennings books.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash in Silken Clothing","review":"While Codrescu's prose is clear and elegant, all those showy words can't conceal this novel's true, trashy nature. Countess Bathory is indeed an intriguing personage, but the story of her life is contorted by Codrescu's heavy-handed storyline and his unsuccessful attempts at weaving two disparate stories into one effective drama. The gratuitious sex and violence, while intended to be shocking, comes off as cheap, crude, and rather embarrassing. Those interested in the history of Countess Elizabeth Bathory should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"B Movie Material from a Likeable Source","review":"I wanted to like this book. I really enjoy Codrescu's essays on NPR, especially when they touch on topics pertaining to New Orleans, where I lived for five years. I also thought the subject matter had some potential. Unfortunately, he is trying too hard to follow in the footsteps of his fellow New Orleanian, Anne Rice. The portrayal of the countess is really unconvincing. She wants eternal youth. Ok, so? She comes across as about as complex as the evil queen in Disney's Snow White. The \\"present day\\" subplot makes the game, Clue, seem like an Umberto Eco masterpiece of intricacy. For readers who want a complex representation of a reprehensible villain of the middle ages, go to Joris Karl Huysmans' La Bas for his depiction of Gilles de Rais, who made the Marquis de Sade look like a neophyte. Codrescu should stick to what he does best - write clever essays for NPR. He's no great shakes as a novelist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made me sorry i bought this trash!","review":"Although I was caught up in this trashy novel trying to pass itself off as history, I did enjoy the author's style of story telling. I only got half way through, when I scolded myself for wasting too much time on this garbage. Nothing but glossy porn."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is a NOVEL (and not that good of one)","review":"This book is a NOVEL, and as such, isn't that great of one. To me, it reads as merely an elaborated story based on an internet biography of Elizabeth Bathory. It almost seems like a Hollywoodized version of a book, changing details and such to make the story flow better. And a good third of the book doesn't even deal directly with Erzebet Bathory, but of some clunky trial. Is it interesting? Yes. Is it an easy read? Yes. Do you learn more about the Lady Bathory? Some. Is it worth spending money on? NO (unless its really really cheap). It seems difficult to make a bad novel on one of the most intriguing figures in history, but nevertheless, this is a bad novel. I give this two stars. It would be one star, but the simple fact that it is about Erzebet Bathory gives it another. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"For a reporter this man has no ethics.","review":"Perhaps it isn't fair to blame the author for trying to pass off The Blood Countess as some sort of well-researched novel. It isn't. And though it is perhaps unforgiving for me, as a fellow author, to take him to task for this, it is insulting to myself, to Ray McNally, to Radu Florescu and to others who have delved into the life of the Countess Bathori. Sadly, the actual facts would have made much jucier--and much better--reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"an interesting subject but a boring story","review":"I was quite intrigued with the subject of this story, and it started off with a BANG! But it then proceeded to dwindle away. None of the characters seem fleshy, (especially the victims!!!), and l felt that l should really care about the 650 odd murders, but didn't because it was too clinical. I couldn't even read the last 100 odd pages, only flicked through, because nothing seemed to happen. I looked forward to reading this book much, much more than actually reading it. One of those that 'could've been' a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book rubs your nose in the ugliest side of human nature","review":"This book is a confusing mixture. It tells the story of a rather fascinating human monster, but gives the reader no real understanding or empathy for any of its characters. The voices of the book are too removed, too cold. The countess tormented and killed her hundreds of young women with no interest in the reality of their lives and interests; the book chronicles the killings in the same manner, and thus fails to involve the reader. Even the parallel plot line of the modern-day Drake, drawn into the mystical world of immortal evil, fails to involve the reader closely. Too much blood, pain, and perverse excitement, not enough understanding. All in all, it was lurid and adolescent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historically Inaccurate","review":"Just to give a brief example, the Peasant Rebellion led byGyörgy Dózsa took place in the year 1514, forty-six yearsbefore Erzsébet Báthory was born. Yet Codrescu has Dózsakilling family members of Countess Báthory in front of hereyes.The book is nothing more than anti-Hungarian propagandawritten by a (Romanian) with a politcal agenda.An earlier book by Codrescu, \\"The Hole in the Flag\\" was anoble effort, but \\"The Blood Countess\\" is disappointingto say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda Sleazy","review":"This book was a huge disappointment. I was looking forward to an informative historical novel about a truly terrifying woman. Instead what I got was a cold, dull, mildly pornographic tale.Don't get me wrong, I expected some pretty graphic stuff given the subject matter, but there were a few too many completely gratuitous sex scenes seemingly randomly thrown in. Even secondary and tertiary characters were given perverse romps in the hay. I know Codrescu is an intelligent man--you can't be an NPR commentator and be a dummy--but I can't help picturing him rubbing his hands and grinning lasciviously as he wrote this stuff.This is not the scholarly work you might expect--consider yourself warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gruesome yet truesome","review":"I actually thought about quitting midway through the book, but i was compelled to finish it through. The book's content is very gruesome, yet the accounts of it are true ... what gets me is \\"how on earth could she have done what she did ...\\" Well, towards the end of the book, it started to lose its luster ... the ending could have been better. However, I do recommend the book despite bathory's dreadful acts. In fact, it gives a person a little insight into d/s (lol)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, weak ending","review":"Wow, this book was really good, yet the ending lacked something. The book goes seamlessly back and forth between the past Countess Bathory and present day Count Bathory. I really loved how Codrescu got inside the characters minds. The part about the notorious Blood Countess went into depth from her childhood, and how she became the psychopathic sadist who gained sexual pleasure from causing pain. I didn't feel he did as well with the story of the modern day Count, though. The ending should have lasted another 100 pages, rather than one chapter. The book built up to a climax then just stopped, which I found to be a major mistake. It built up to the Countess' murder of hundreds of women then just mentioned a few things in just the last chapter. I was quite disappointed in that, as I found the book to be excellent until the weak ending. I should put in a warning, though, as this book is not for young readers or for those who get offended easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I bought the book!","review":"Although I read the book from cover to cover, I never really got into it. Everytime I saw the word \\"BESTSELLER\\" on the front cover, I wondered why! Maybe it is an excellent book for some to read ... but I found it boring and long.

Well, I guess my first mistake would be hoping to find out information from a \\"novel.\\" The author confused me to no end, shifting back and forth, spending far too much time making up scenarios that I'm pretty certain never happened. While he claims that information contained in the book is \\"based on historical events,\\" I think shock value was the real aim here and based simply on that, the author does not fail.Many times I wanted to simply put the book down, but me, always a champion for the underdog, thought it would get better. It never did. If you want to find out about Elizabeth Bathory, this is certainly not the book to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Turnoff","review":"This book has an interesting subject (Countess Bathory) but the author seems to use the entire premise of the countess' life as a classy excuse to write a bunch of fictionalized and -- in my opinion -- badly written pornography. It seems that the author just had a few fantasies he wanted to get out of his system and found the countess and her descendents as a convenient, vicarious outlet for these feelings. Most annoying of all, however, are the \\"current day\\" portions of the novel where the main character recounts his adventures to a court judge. The main character's language in these portions seems too contrived, rehearsed, and purple-prose to be the kind of spontaneous things a person would actually say in court.

Madly in love with her uncommonly good looking husband of two months, she finds that it's just as easy to fall head over heels in love with the state department worker who has been assigned to give her the bad news about her husband's untimely death.

Aside from the flimsiness of the fabric, my major gripe is the darned thing won't stay put on the bed -- some part or another is always sliding up or down. Forget trying to make the bed. No amount of tucking seems to keep it in place.It's on a standard queen bed with a rather thick mattress, but the depth of the mattress shouldn't matter.

Parts of the skirt ride up in between the box spring and mattress, leaving that part of the ruffle several inches off the ground. Other parts slide down on the box spring leaving the bottom dragging on the ground. It's impossible to keep the whole thing in place and equally level to the ground. I'm always tugging it down in places, or pushing it up in other places. I guess the idea is for the weight of the mattress to keep it in place, but it doesn't on my bed. Also, the material is thin and looks cheap. And it doesn't go around an entire full size bed, so you better have part of the bed against a wall. I wish I had sent it back during the 30-day return period."},{"rating":"1","title":"dust ruffle","review":"Everything about the delivery and packaging was just fine, however, I don't really like the product.

Overall is good, the author shows you how to setup your spidering tools -- Perl modules. Yes, Perl, if you're Java folks, too bad. He shows you how to use Perl modules on crawling web pages, logging on to systems, extracting specific contents, and massaging data to your needs, across 100 different scenarios. Most of them are practical, but they don't cover much of the details, you have to read the programs listed in the book, which is quite painful for non-Perl people like me. In addition, it doesn't provide much of resulting screen shots after running the sample codes. Most importantly, the author tries to avoid the copyright questions by delegating URL links for readers to reference. In general, it's still a good tool book in spidering field."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enter the Spider","review":"I've always wondered what a spider was and now I know what a scraper is too.

By seamlessly incorporating Yiddish-English dialect into his prose and describing both cityscapes and internal psychological landscapes in painstaking detail, Pulaski draws me into most of his stories.I thought that the stories depicting his wife's side of the family fell flat, took confusing turns, and were generally less believable. The early sexual experiences of a young girl and the inner workings of this other family seemed to me beyond his knowledge, and thus beyond his considerable ability.All in all, it's worth reading and I look forward to reading more by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolute trash","review":"did the geeks that programmed this [software] ever do any landscaping ?? i bought this to plan the landscaping for my new home and after several hours of wrestling with this have decided i would be better off with graph paper and a pencil. rubbish..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back","review":"I have been struggling with this for 3 days. it is very difficult.

The pot arrived severely defective, there was a HOLE in the bottom edge, daylight shows through! The metal is thin and was machined too closely. Very light weight, not substantial like a true Demeyere pot. The quality and styling is not the same as that found in the authentic Demeyere pot I ordered at the same time from Amazon. The advertising copy on Amazon does not say where the product is manufuctured which is misleading to the consumer. The packaging identifies the pot as a Resto by Demeyere. This is not a Demeyere pot.It is troubling that Amazon does not offer free return shipping for such a blatently defective product with misleading advertising copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"If it were just a little taller","review":"On balance this is a good product. It is well made and does the job. I wish it were two inches deeper though. The normal length of the long pastas such as linguini are just about 1 1/2 inches longer than the depth of the pot so you have to keep stirring it until the pasta softens and sinks completely. If you don't, you end up with a short end of the pasta not cooked sufficiently when the rest of it is.Having said that I still think it is a very good piece of cookware and I use it frequently for various boiling tasks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just an asparagus cooker","review":"Versatile pot with small base Fits perfectly on my small burner.

Not this time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glass redeemed by performance","review":"I used to be a Glass fan, eagerly awaiting each new release. Then I discovered that Glass, like any other composer, can produce mediocre music as well - something I believe Glass is especially prone to given his style. However, this recording shows what Glass can be, not so much that the composition is inspired as that the instrumentation is inspired; instrumentation is based on instruments constructed by Uakti and traditional instruments - glass marimba, pan pipes, xylophone, flute, tabla, keyboards ...This particular work is intended as the score for a ballet company; it certainly would work in the intended context but it also works as a piece in it's own right. If you don't listen carefully, it may fade into the background as what I think of as \\"generic new age\\" - however, if you truly listen to the work, the changes in instrumentation and tempos will convince you this is not generic anything but an innovative rendition well worth your full attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"It seems that 60% or 70% of the CDs I purchase turn out to be losers, but this is definitely a winner!

Their live \\"act\\"-or whatever it was-was something that belonged in a circus or perhaps in a Las Vegas hotel, rather than in the real musical world. In fact, I remember some kids in school who were huge fans of this abomination, and they all seemed to be in true need of psychological help. And to hear Gene Simmons, who sounds more like a Jewish accountant than a musician, which he barely is to begin with, go on the Howard Stern show and take credit for virtually everything and anything in music makes he and his band all the more absurd. He even claimed that Kiss were better than the Who live. Excuse me? In fact, I wouldn't have been surprised to hear him claim that Kiss invented the Who. And he should keep the makeup on all the time-he looks better with it on than without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop at commercial!","review":"Heavy metal to disco to hair metal! Thats commerical!

Since these tired old warhorses insist on throwing these same old songs in the public's face, it's high time they get a brutally honest appraisal stripped of nostalgic haze.Kiss was a band that couldn't funk like Aerosmith, couldn't muster the pop smarts of Cheap Trick and couldn't crunch with the authority of AC/DC. The band was a one-trick pony -- whose trick was thudding, unimaginative at that -- and this collection proves it.Without the grease paint, fire and blood to hide their musical deficiencies, the only songs here that stand on their own are \\"Rock'n'Roll All Night,\\" \\"Shout it Out Loud\\" (key to the sound of the '80s hair bands) and a few more. The fact that the band can't come up with anything new only demonstrates their limitations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Welcome to earth....meet KISS!","review":"If you have been orbiting the earth for 30 years and have finally made it back to the planet and didn't know a thing about what's happened in the last 30 years of music then you might want this as an intro to KISS.Fortunatley most of us haven't...we've already heard these tunes and have paid for them a bunch of times over on various KISS CDs.I dont like the cover!

If you really want \\"the very best of KISS\\", buy Alive. If that's not enough, get Alive II, or possibly Destroyer. Their live stuff is better than their studio stuff anyway.

Where's \\"Heaven's on Fire,\\" which epitomized the band's 80's sound? Or, \\"Tears are Falling?\\" While not their best song, it was a well known 80's track ( I didn't want to say 'hit'). How about \\"Domino?\\" These tracks would have balanced the collection while still maintaining a core set of tracks from the makeup era. After \\"Greatest Kiss\\" do we really need another collection primarily of seventies material? Point being, there's more to Kiss than the makeup era. True, the late 80's Kiss era (\\"Crazy Nights,\\" \\"Let's put the X...\\", etc.) was the low point, although \\"Forever\\" is classic.

Ace Frehley is an example of a musician with a heart. That dude man, he wails on his guitar because he LIKES to. He does what he loves, and thats music. I am getting the feeling that Gene Simmons does what he loves, money. He doesnt do it for the fans or \\"by to people for the people\\". this CD was all intentional a corprate CD, sold ONLY for money, and had nothing to do with them having a good time in the studio doing what they love.

From the high-energy hard rockers to the lovely, acoustic ballads, this song is a FANTASTIC way to get to know the band KISS. Think, 21 tracks, and it covers the '74-'92 era (well, not really an era), but all the same, it will be a valuable addition to your collection, especially if you like classic rock and pop-metal like me.If you liked this album and want to build a KISS collection, I would also suggest: ''Destroyer'', ''Rock and Roll Over'', ''Love Gun'', the original ''KISS'' and ''Creature of the Night''. So...ROCK ON!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT ANOTHER ONE?!!?","review":"C'mon and KISS MY ASS!!! (If there's no other way to finally open your eyes) Money, money, money - this isn't for the fans!

What Kiss fan on earth would have any need to buy this CD? They released a massive box set just a few years ago, for crying out loud. I'm a Kiss fan, it'd be great to own every Kiss album for the sake of having the complete catalouge, but I mean come on already. They're not just beating the dead horse now, they're holding it by the hind legs and thrashing the carcass back and forth into a pulp. If you want to milk the last of the diehards a little more at least throw them something they don't already have, if there's even a scrap remaining, that is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compilation after compilation...","review":"Go to the Studio once in a while for Pete's sake.

She will really enjoy this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sampler for the casual fan","review":"If you are a lover of all rock music, but don't have a stack of KISS CDs, this is your best bet. This CD will give you the songs you want, the songs you forgot about, and the BEST live version of Rock & Roll All Night that I have ever found. In fact, I bought this CD over other compilations just to get that live track. The rest of the CD gives a nice selection of KISS from the 70's era and the 80's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Have loved KISS since 1978. Am over yet another Greatest Hits package. Just how many albums have Rock and Roll All Nite on them??"},{"rating":"1","title":"I just didn't get \\"into\\" it","review":"This book entails a lot of highly politically charged post-colonial science fiction. It felt a lot like reading a poetry from an annual collection for people interested in post-colonial literature. The works in this book are more serious, mature, and anchored in the real world than most traditional science fiction. If your a fan of most western science fiction, brace yourself for a very different style. It wasn't my cup of tea - again too political for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome book","review":"This was a great book.

Their recordings from the 1940's through the '60's, both alone and in support of great Ranchera stars, are treasures of Mexican music history. While the ensemble remains one of the best for theater performances, this recording doesn't feature a single *real* mariachi piece, nor any compositions in authentic regional *son* style. It's pretty, but it's not real mariachi music. If you would prefer something with more roots sensibilities, buy older Vargas CDs, or anything by Mariachi Cobre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worthy Of....","review":"This book is not worthy of the \\"Unleashed\\" series, which typically has stellar books. Mostly just marketing level advice with very little in-depth information. You can get more information out of a Google search."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Book","review":"When I first started working my current job, I was given this book. I have to say that this is an extremely boring book. It didn't engage me in any shape, form, or fashion. Learning SharePoint is already difficult and this book does not make it any easier. I am glad I didn't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Print out the Administration help file instead of buying","review":"This book is a long winded explanation of the features of SharePoint 2003. It provides redundent how tos with little explanation of how to do anything that is not vanilla out of the box. I suggest simply becoming familar with the Administrative Guide that Microsoft produced. You'll be you degree closer to the source and 33 dollars richer in the pocket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a developer book","review":"I will have to put myself in the same corner as a few of my fellow reviewers, this is not a developer book, by far. It also has a lot of repetition in it. You can explain the different security groups twice, but 5 times seems like a little too much... The fact that web parts and customisations are not covered is like the biggest dissapointment to me, because that is what I am looking for in a book. How to use Sharepoint is something you can learn in the online help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Project driven instead of learning or reference book","review":"The authors take a project management approach to SharePoint. The book takes you through all the steps necessary when starting a new SharePoint system. My issue with this approach is that unless you have a reasonable understanding of SharePoint first, it's difficult to grasp the concepts they are explaining.This would be a good book as a guide to creating a SharePoint system from scratch but you'll be better off getting another book to actually learn the software first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Errors everwhere","review":"I've purchased both this book and the Resource Kit and tried to use them like lifelines because my company is going ga-ga over SharePoint (and I mostly agree). While this book has a lot going for it--it's well written and has a good teaching point of view, I've found a ton of errors in it that have caused me to lose my confidence in it. I still refer to it as a tutorial, but it's an awful lot of money to pay for a book that I can't trust. My advice is to rely on the Resource Kit as a reference and only buy this book as a teaching guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly written, Not that informative","review":"As someone that reads alot of books, both technical and non-technical, this is definetly the worst written book I've ever seen. It seems it has not been read by any editors.You can find typos, spelling mistakes, grammar errors and such all over the place. The authors just copy-pasted some of them over and over again. The text is boring to death, and for some reason, the least needed parts are repeated several times. For example, the meaning of \\"Description\\" of a field in a list is explained more than a dozen times in less that 5 pages.All of this, even before touching the content and subject of the book itself. The order of the content was not well thought of, the style of writing is boring, and the content itself is not very informative.As a developer, I did not expect to find much on the development side of SharePoint, but I doubt that even technicians and solution architects will find much help in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes you half way there--not the whole way","review":"(actual review is 2.5 stars). Even though this book has a lot of pages, the content is pretty shallow and it suffers from an apparent desire to address to many different types of reader, from the developer to the administrator, to the technology decision maker. The result is that the book is weak in two key areas: development and administration. For readers who want reasonable depth in those areas, I suggest finding another source. For readers who want a broad brush, the book is a fine work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless for developers, administrators and users","review":"I do SharePoint administration and development and own the other five SharePoint 2003 books currently on the market. This book is useless from any perspective except perhaps as a doorstop. It just repeats the same content chapter after chapter about the features of SharePoint while offering no insight as to installing, configuring or developing. You would get more insight about SharePoint reading a product brochure or just cruising Microsoft's web site. Avoid this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How big a vacation home do you want?","review":"I was dissapointed with this book, from a title standpoint. \\"Vacation homes\\" are not how I would categorize the plans in this book - although there are some nice plans. I would consider almost all 500 of them to be regular home plans - there certainly wasn't much available here that was less than 1200 sq ft. Not quite the cozy lakeside cottage I was looking for!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works of John Wesley","review":"This set of books was an interesting combination of a history of the author, his actual sermon's, hymns, etc. This recopied and compacted set has all the detail and exactness of the original set, with the minor flaw of a random missing letter in the midddle of the text, intermittently. I have not found this to cause any great difficulty. The set is very informative regarding the thought of early Puritan Christianity. It is also a handsome set and well worth the price. echance"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete, Yes. Useful, not really.","review":"This product is indeed what it advertises. The works (journals, letters, sermons and comments) of John Wesley on CD. The problem is that it is all one long text file. It is trapped inside the Folio Infobase software that was out of date 10 years ago. You can export the entire text to either WordPerfect or RTF (no PDF or MS Word option) but even then all 7 (or 14) volumes are contained in one giant file. You can search for particular words, but I haven't found any topical search (ie - I want a sermon on sanctification). And the worst for any $50 product, there are misspellings in the text!! I wish I had bought the 7 book hardcover edition so at least it would look pretty on my shelf. This just isn't going to be as useful as I had hoped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paper Weight without function or use","review":"I purchased this item, since it is rather difficult to find a physical copy of the Works of John Wesley and I did not care if they were not in pristine condition; however, I did not anticipate that I would not be able to read the books without fear of them falling apart. They remain a paper weight, without function or use. Selling these books was tantamount to theft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incoherent opinions","review":"I was searching for a biography of the Bronte siblings. What I found was this incomprehensible mash of random feelings and impressions the author seems to have had about previous biographies of the Brontes. There is little biography here; it is simply her agreements with or refutations of previous biographers, often not even explaining what those biographers had stated to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves to be desired","review":"Another attempt by an outside oberserver to understand conflicts that are peculiar to South America and its political culture. Accordingly, the analysis does not grasp the intenal dynamics and psychology of the conflict. This book leaves much to be desired."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Generous Revelation","review":"I was a close student of Trungpa Rinpoche for 16 years. I never closed a door in Diana's face; I did spend a bit of time caring for Taggie, yet even though I was \\"close in\\" to Rinpoche's family, I did not appreciate or have much empathy for Diana's challenges or for the fact that she was facing them at such a young age. Now at 60, having raised 4 children and being grandfather to 4, I humbly beg her forgiveness and bow to her strong Dharma Heart.This book is a generous and bold revelation of life with a rare Great Being. It will help any spiritual seeker break out of their limited notions of spiritual life and practice.The way in which Diana perservered in preserving and strenghtening her own spirit under extraordinary circumstances will be an inspiring example for any reader. It with help you develop a mature relationship to meet your own challenges on the path."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok...","review":"Picture quality is ok, nothing spectacular. DVD features and usability is pretty substandard; less features than a fischer price toy. The real let-down with this lcd is the audio. The speakers are just horrendous. The sound quality is poor, and doesnt carry very well. What made me laugh at this unit was the included digital audio out. 15\\" LCD...with a digital audio out and no rca stereo jacks. There is a headpone minijack, although its cheap and easily introduces static into whatever it is feeding. All in all, a pretty poorly designed and executed product. When you look at the price in relation to the features, and add to this the poor audio and average video performance...it isnt any wonder why there are no Toshiba products in my home. Cheap hardware for an exorberant price."},{"rating":"1","title":"heres the downside","review":"I paid almost $600 for the 14\\" version of this TV last year, and liked it fine until the DVD player (lightly used) eject function failed. The 1 year warranty has expired, and Toshiba customer service tells me it will be $350 to remove my DVD and repair the player.

Novice runners might like it and get more from it than experienced runners."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not War and Peace, but I liked it.","review":"OK. So this isn't a deep, weighty book about affairs of the world. It's a light, easy-to-read novelette - played out in mini-chapters - about the affairs of a few generally disfunctional young people. They do have, however, some redeeming qualities, though I'm not sure what they are. That is to say, they seem to suffer from the usual angst of young people who are looking for love and, hopefully, once the hormones have settled, someday will move on to more important aspects of life. But who cares. This is an enjoyable read. Funny. Couples and individuals on New Year's Eve - all bound for the same party - interact at bars and in the streets, their lives intertwining without their knowing they're headed to the same place. Two women friends vie over one man, who they both proceed to drop, who finds someone else - all in one evening. You get the drift? Try it.

These \\"dummies\\" books give the authors almost unlimited opportunity to explain something in detail, yet make it interesting and enlightening. What I would have wanted to see was more history on the story of Siddhartha and how he became Buddha. I also thought the book was biased toward the Tibet way of Buddhism and those looking for more about Zen are going to be disappointed. The book almost reads like a college textbook and that is just dry dry dry. Yuck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Introduction","review":"This book was an excellent introduction to the major concepts and schools of Buddhism. It is written in a warm and engaging style and was a delight to read.

It touches on many aspects of Buddhism, inviting the reader to turn to other resources, listed in Appendix B, for more in-depth information.This book covers the main themes of Buddhism without becoming too overwhelming with technical terms.While some people may not like the 'For Dummies' books, I appreciate the blend of serious information and touches of humor found in them. This was true in Buddhism for Dummies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the Right Amount on Information","review":"This book makes it easy for a non-Buddhist to understand the general principals of Buddhism without going into so much detail that the reader gets lots. More than just the \\"story of Buddha\\", the book explains the different kinds of Buddhism, the practices, etc. A perfect primer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-rounded overview for beginners","review":"As with all of the other books in the \\"Dummies\\" series, this book was written very well for people who have little to no knowledge on Buddhism and its concepts whilst not bogging the reader down in too much technical jargon. It is easy to understand and flows well from topic to topic and has elements of humor, which is always a nice touch in this series. This book would be good for people interested in learning more about Buddhism and steers the reader to further expand their knowledge with many references in the back of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"O_O","review":"This is an awesome CD.

The abridged editions are not much better. It was highly influential in its time, so it's standard reading for history-of-philosophy courses. This is one of several excellent reasons why you shouldn't take history of philosophy courses.For the voluntary reader, the fact that Locke was highly influential also means that his ideas have been developed into something clearer and more interesting by the intervening generations.

The only compaint I have is that simply opening this book to read it split the cover away from the pages. The book is effectively coming unravelled. I have other books from the Prometheus lineup which have no such problem, however, they are all relatively short books of less than 150 pages. This one is over 600 pages and from what I can tell it appears that the binding just isn't up to task for the amount of pages in the book. I'm not sure if this is just a fluke or not.

And although I did read the shoes were a \\"shoe cover\\", I thought perhaps (partly based on the picture) that there was a \\"bottom\\" to the shoe... not just an elastic cord, which for my daughter, could be come an obstacle while walking - she's 3 and pretty stable on her feet, but walking ON an elastic cord is somewhat awkward . Also, the back of the shoe has a velcro portion, which I'm not sure why, considering the shoe is not adjustable, but it was poorly made, doesn't lay flat, and \\"pokes\\" her when she walks.

They are all humorous and lively, with just a touch of romance. Back in Society is a fitting end to the sextet The Poor Relation. I found that it was probably ranked third best of this sextet. I preferred Vol.no.3 and Vol.no.1. Volume 6 refines on Lady Fortesque's character and brings out Miss Tonks, who had otherwise been a Nobody in the previous volumes. The humour is definitely provided and the romance is very sweet, as it is in all of her books. However, like most of Marion Chesney's books, this one is missing that certain something. The something that only experienced readers of this genre could find important. I began my reading in the genre with Volume Number 3 of this series, so I must confirm that Marion Chesney is a wonderful author to begin romance with."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE: Cheap media.

I couldn't find carbohydrate powder at the local nutrition store, or just protein powder. It was all combined and VERY expensive. The mid-morning snack bars are also not cheap. The book gives excellent guidelines, but you really need to know how to create and cook or to buy the cookbook for ideas how to prepare the various food selections.

There is a different musical chemistry than before; such as the absense of the tamborine that I was use to in Mazzy Star's, \\"So Tonight That I Might See\\". However, that tamborine seems to have been replaced by sparkling cymbals and triangles. The accoustic guitar is smooth and the chords are clear. Of course, the only reason I would listen to this album is because Hope Sandavol's vocals are the most seductive, intoxicating sounds I have heard from any female lead vocalist. Although a different shade of grey from the three previous Mazzy albums, it is the mellow sounds this genre expects. Best songs: Around My Smile, On The Low, and Butterfly Mornings. This album is about two more songs away from getting five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just lovely!","review":"This album is so great - not a mediocre track on here.

Definitely a mood cd. One for rainy days, and Sunday mornings with your coffee. Hope does have an amazing and soothing voice, and the music is similar to an acoustic Sundays, or mellowest Cowboy Junkies. Though a bit different, one could call it the fourth Mazzy Star album. It's close enough. I can see how even fans of Norah Jones might enjoy this. She also covers the Jesus and Mary Chain song \\"Drop\\".

The man known as Roeper didn't write this, and I suspect, much of the rest of the book was swiped from the internet.I never did like this guy as a movie reviewer.

The book has several incomplete sentences and sentences that are so poorly constructed that the reader really has no idea of what the author is trying to say, no matter how many time the passage is read. He also used the wrong word in several instances, were for we're or, there for their, for instance.This book could be a useful tool for anyone who is seeking to become more creative in their approach to problem solving, but it is in dire need of a good editor to make it not just readable, but to bring out the author's ideas so they are much more clear and understandable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good one.","review":"I run an ad agency.

I have loaned it to several friends over the years, all of whom benefitted from the easy to read insight. Unfortunately, my copy was lost on loan recently, and I decided to replace it. The newer edition, however, is about as poorly produced as books come. There are too many grammatical mistakes and the clumsy book jacket design betrays a much smarter message contained within. If there were two categories for rating, I'd give this book 5 stars for content and 1 star for production quality. I'll keep my eye out for the next edition, which will hopefully find its place back on my shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was expecting more.

My husband said it was a complete waste of time, but I feel it would've been okay to watch on cable or if you had a chance to watch it for free. Any type of charge to watch this would be money lost. The music has all been heard before and even though I love Sir Elton John, I wasn't impressed with the soundtrack. Visually it's appealing with lots of bright colors and the voice acting is pretty good. The storyline falls flat though and I feel like I just threw money down the toilet buying the blu ray with all the additional disks and digital files.

There are so many awesome kid movies out there. Don't mistake this one for one of those. I kept wondering why it played so much Elton John music. Really, what does that have to do with a gnome or the storyline? Turns out Elton John's partner produced the flick. Characters are just plain stupid. Would rather have watched Beauty and the Beast or Monsters Inc. for the thousandth time. I honestly could not wait for this movie to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"I lost $3.99 on this movie","review":"I watched the short (two minute) preview offered by Amazon, and thought it was not bad.

The idea sounds good, but this movie did not work for me.It is not that the movie did not follow the original story. I can not tell you exactly what the problem was, but after maybe about half an hour, I stopped watching and so did my five year old daughter. Maybe the problem was with animation, maybe it was the script, maybe it was the story. Some of the children movies are appealing to adults as well as the children. As an adult, this movie for me was just boring and lame, really lame.Sooo hit me, kick me, or spit on me if you want.

If Pixar were to do a remake of this, I bet everything would be different and the movie would at least earn a B. From some of what I saw in the movie, it almost feels like the movie should have been rated PG. Reason is because in a G rated movie, most of the time the characters don't get destroyed or killed.

It looked really cute and colorful and vibrant and energetic and just a total distraction, which is what I was hoping for. Instead, I got something remarkably bland in moments, boring almost, that didn't add enough variance to create something special. This is sad, because this really could have become something truly epic; instead it settled for mediocre. That isn't to say that the film doesn't have some merit. The voice work is nicely played by the entire cast, and that Elton John/Lady Gaga original song (Hello, Hello) is fun and plays at the right moment to create a dash of charisma, but in the end this film fails to live up to my expectations (which were, arguably, too high). The age old tale of Romeo and Juliet has been tampered with numerous times; countless times to be honest. Maybe it's time we let it be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"What a horrible movie!

I add Gnomeo and Juliet to the list. I loved it. Very colorful and uplifting (opposed to several darker films), followed main plot of Romeo and Juliet..Being a kids film, I did not expect it to go deep into Shakespeare anyways.Instead of the female being portrayed as fragile and delicate mainly, it gave a more realistic portrait of Juliet as a strong and independent, yet loving and loveable,woman.

I was excited when I found out that it was from one of the creators of Shrek... I had such high expectations. But it was just not my cup of tea... and it severly ruined my glass of wine.I realize that we each have our own preferences. I am not saying this is a absolute NO for everyone.

Even my thirteen-year-old enjoyed it, which really surprised us. Anyway, it's a fun little diddy, not to be taken too seriously but to be just enjoyed.

It is written as a first person narrative and describes in grisly detail the story of a stowaway on a whaling ship. I must say that I learned more about life at sea in those times than I ever wanted to know, especially the horror of near starvation, cannibalism, mistreatment and death. Every sentence seems to bring another repulsive incident and life at sea seems a serious and perhaps too realistic description.Good thing the book was short because it was difficult to read even though there was no doubt of the writer's skill. Basically, it was an excellent book, but it's difficult to recommend unless the reader is willing to thrust himself or herself into a this sad and painful world which is based on how things were in those early whaling days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horrifying","review":"The cumulative horror this work builds is almost unimaginable.I had incredible feelings of anguish throughout. There were times I really didn't think I could bear to read any more. The more detached the narrative gets, the more haunting the story becomes.I can only give it 4 stars because I'm amazed a piece of writing could make one so uncomfortable and so disturbed. This is not by any means psychologically appropriate for a young person to read. Even for an adult, I would not sit down to read this unless you're sure you are prepared to face the literary equivalent of torture. Of course, it's not that it's not well written. In many ways, it's ingeniously constructed. However for those with an imagination capable of projecting this story as it happens.. You will find your psychological limits greatly tested."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dark, American Tale","review":"America's literary fascination with the sea has created a wonderful collection of historic works.

However, there are some problems that need to be discussed. Firstly, only 4 tracks are new-the rest being live renditions of some of Day and the Time's best material. This Isn't a bad thing, as all of the live material is excellent.Two inexplicable and regrettable alterations to the live tracks include muting of expletives(even the benign \\"ass\\" is removed) and the muting of crowd noise. The live stuff still rocks, though. Only two of the new songs are above average: \\"Ain't a Damn Thing Changed\\" and \\"In My Ride,\\" which features the can't-miss flavor of Day plus equally quirky rapper E-40.

But then i pondered, was this cheesy rip off on Taxi Driver supposed to be serious, and if it was iyt failed on all points. It is the most corny film I've ever seen, which isnt so bad for a film which doesn't take itself too seriously like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but when it tries to be clever like this (and henry: portrait of a serial kiiler) it just fails."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst film I have ever seen","review":"I read the dossier for this film and thought it would be good, unfortunately it is so bad that I really appreciate other films now. Perhaps I didn't understand the arty approach but if a film is going to be clever (as the guy kills the homeless people because he doesn't want to become one of them by not getting paid for his art) then there must some clue to it. The plot is hidden beneath badly styled, monotonous events that make you glad that there are other similar films that are better. If you want a good film of a similar genre buy, 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gritty, controversial but hollow: 4/10","review":"It's hard to imagine how this film gained its notorious status(especially in the UK). It is poorly shot(reflecting its miniscule budget) and is really no more violent than any other horror film. True, when the disgruntled artist Reno(played by first-time director Abel Ferrara) first goes on a rampage armed with a drill and 'porto-pak', the film does manage to touch a raw nerve, but soon it descends to laboriously-paced repetition and struggles to hold attention.Will be remembered as the debut feature of director Ferrara, who has since never been afraid to court controversy with films like Ms. 45 and Bad Lieutenant; and probably as one of the films that sparked off the 'Video Nasty' hysteria in the UK in the 1980's; but for little else."},{"rating":"1","title":"I know \\"Dalton Briggs\\"","review":"I've seen only scenes of this film because they star my old Film Analysis teacher Harry Shultz!!

The plot was weak and hidden between large amounts of tedious and poor punk rock (Don't play the film loud as the cover suggests!). I had absolutely no sympathy for any of the characters and did not feel sorry for any individual that was killed with the poor gore effects. If violent bloodshed is what your after then I would recommend the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

It's just as bad as The Nostril Picker, there is nothing in this movie worth seeing, there is violence but it doesn't matter the movie is just far to boring to care, I can only say please, whatever you do, DON'T rent this horrible movie, words can not describe how bad it is or how boring it is, this movie is just so bad I can't give it any star rating at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"all i can really say is \\"no\\"","review":"Ferrara is obviously a required taste and this film does nothing to prove against that point.not only is he a horrible actor, but he's also one of the worst directors with an undeserved cult following. his camerawork is atrocious and wreaks of a bad home movie.the back of the DVD says that Abel was trying to make a film in the vein of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre but in the end wound up making a film more like that of Taxi Driver. now, even before i watched the film, i knew this was an incredibly gross overstatement, but now i think the DVD company that made such a horrid claim should be forced to remove that from the synopsis.oh, and the band in the movie was terrible. hell, everything about this movie was terrible.

Donna Hanover uses her own happy reunion with her high school sweetheart as a clever springboard to a wide world of romantic topics -- ranging from the effect of romance on brain chemistry to inspiring and original insights about modern happiness. How great to read a book about finding love that doesn't dwell on superficial makeovers! Instead, MY BOYFRIEND'S BACK focuses on the deeper attraction that stands the test of time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Read!","review":"Donna Hanover beautifully conveyed to the reader how important love is in our lives. These delightful stories of reuniting with someone from the past serve as a beacon of hope for so many people who are alone.

With so much negativity in our society today, it was a positive, hopeful read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lightweight love advice","review":"I expected this book to be about Donna Hanover's life but it is actually a collection of other people's lost and found love stories and advice on how to find a lost love. The format is very similar to \\"Lost and Found Lovers - Facts and Fantasies of Rekindled Romances\\" by Nancy Kalish, Ph.D. The stories are charming but after the first few become rather repetitive. Ms. Hanover's attempt to discuss the lost love phenomenon is unsatisfying and incomplete with only random references to research and comments from friendly psychologists. She is advocating that single women/men look up their old boyfriends/girlfriends without fully addressing the deeply emotional and complicated dilemmas that might arise if such a reunion doesn't work out."},{"rating":"1","title":"why do you like this book??","review":"I can't understand why this book is getting good reviews from amazon readers. It's vacant. I expected her love story, and that would maybe have made a better book. But she sure didn't share much of her story (or maybe she's not much of a writer; she's an actress afterall).

There's a better book on this topic, that actually TELLs you something."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing, but wait...","review":"I was interested in the topic of rekindled romance but I was not interested in the author's personal story. The book is not well organized and the stories aren't particularly interesting.

Skip the celebrity and read the professor."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappearing reviews","review":"[...]As a reunited couple, we looked forward to reading another book on this topic. We had read Kalish's research in Lost & Found Lovers and bought several copies for friends. So I thought this new book would be good too. I was all set to like it. But I didn't. It was so disappointing.It's just a few light stories, and some interviews with therapists. What did she have to contribute herself? Her story was fun to read, but that could have been a nice, short magazine article. There's not enough here for a book. I finished it in an hour and a half.DH interviewed Nancy Kalish - she says so in the acknowledgements - and this sure sounds like the kalish book without the research that made that first book worthwhile.I think the people who give it 5 stars just haven't read any other books on this topic and so they don't know the difference. It's a fun topic but it is not a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nauseating","review":"I picked this book up thinking it might be a fun, light read.

Personally I'd rather read about their divorces and struggles."},{"rating":"1","title":"He is back, but what about everything in between?","review":"This book is a disappointment.

And I enjoyed a lost love book by Nancy Kalish, so I thought I'd read this one too. But Donna Hanover's book is just a collection of other people's work and ideas, including Kalish's, and the stories are ordinary. So I'm glad I had the opportunity to read the Kalish book first, so I could see the difference.Celebrities shouldn't write books on topics they don't know anything about. I'm married, but that doesn;t qualify me to write books about marriage. Just because Donna got divorced from Rudy and married her lost love doesn''t mean she's become an expert.

Anyway, it's about a girl named Dorothy from the great Kansas prairies. One afternoon (or earlier than that), her house (with her inside it) is blown to the Land of Oz by a sudden cyclone. There, she finds strange people and surroundings. Strangely, all the people think she is a sorceress. She also meets the Witch of the North, who tells her to go to the Emerald City in the center of the city to ask Oz, the terrible wizard, to help her get back to Kansas (which is what she wants than to stay in Oz). She listens, and goes off on the Yellow Brick Road that leads to the Emerald City. What else happens? Find out by reading the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Silver Shoes, lost amongst the desert","review":"I believe one of the reviews earlier said it best when its writer explained the true context of the entire novel. The novel was not really meant to be a fairy tale for young children, instead it was a Populist book on the issue of bimetalism and argrarian discontent with Industrial Tycoons and Robber Barons. The movie really did a horrible job with this book, changing the \\"silver slippers\\" into ruby slippers to show off the impressive Technicolor. The book however is a classic, for its subtle references to politcal issues and the immagination of the mind. The oddity of the book; however, lies in the fact that Baum portrays the Farmer (the scarecrow), the eastern laborers (the tin man) and Bryan (the Lion) as characters who really had what they needed all along, slashing the idea that agrarians really had something to complain about."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantasy which still transports me to a place I want to be.","review":"Ahhhhh. Freedom, and escape from the monotony of the high plains to the wonderful land of Oz. Safely surrounded by the deadly desert, and overseen by Glinda the Good. This is not an insipid story for seven year olds, not an interaction of a child with adultoids, nor is it the call of the populist party for free silver. It is the gate to another place, the first ticket to a land that I have spent many hours gladly wandering in. To read the wizard without going on to Glinda, and tik tok, and the wogglebug, is to deprive yourself, and your children of a path, not unlike the path through the wardrobe into Narnia. Baum didn't set out to write \\"Alice\\". He wrote an American fairy tale. And Ruth Plumley Thompson continued it, leaving us with a rich set of figures which reach out of our own national heritage and which have, as all great liturature does, reached back and thus formed us.

This book makes you want to see if the Lion gets his courage, if Tin Man gets his heart, if the Scarecrow gets his brain and if Dorothy and Toto ever get home. The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is the one book in the world that I want to read over and over again and never put it down. The other books in the Oz serious are also the same way. The best Oz book in the rest of the serious is Glinda in Oz because it is so funny and interesting.

This version, by far, is the best. The reader actually travels to the Emerald City and beyond as its author L. Frank Baum intended. Mr. Baum put up the money himself to publish the first edition of \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" because no established company would touch a \\"modern\\" American fairy tale. As a result, few books were actually produced, but rarely has an author had such control over his finished product. Here's your chance to own a reproduced copy of his original vision!

America has, unfortunately, produced fewer true \\"fairy tales\\" than Europe.

When I first read this book at 7 years old, I was disappointed it was so different from the movie, which I loved then, but as I've grown older I've found the book to be superior, because it depicts Oz as less of a benign candyland. Despite this the book (and its sequels even more so) is seriously flawed. These are flaws of imagination: like the works of Roal Dahl many of the people who read the Oz books see them as unbridedly imaginative. They arent. C.S.

But the rest of the songs are completely worthy additions to the XTC oeuvre. And Andy Partridge is sexiest when he sounds mad, as he does pretty constantly on this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album.","review":"Man, I can't seem to keep this cd out of my player. Partridge is the master. This is some of his best work. \\"Are You Receiving Me\\" can't be listened to unless the volume is at least at 8. Great stuff. Not even close to the band's worst album. Has anyone been aboard the Big Express lately? I didn't think so."},{"rating":"2","title":"XTC @ Their Best","review":"The songs here are very much the epitome of what \\"New Wave\\" is supposed to sound like, with the possible exception of Elvis Costello's early work. Barry Andrews' plastic organ was essential to XTC's flavor at this point in their history. This is a much darker album than their debut, WHITE MUSIC. Darker because Barry and Andy Partridge were fighting for dominance within the band. The tense competition between these two made for some really exceptional tunes. Unfortunately, Andrews was to leave the band after this record.The first track, Meccanic Dancing, alludes to \\"a disco song from Germany.\\" It is followed by the second track, a mechanical sounding Battery Brides wherein Partridge tips his musical hat to German techno-heads Kraftwerk in tribute.Barry Andrew's two tunes, Super Tuff & My Weapon are good enough to be on the album, but he would later make a much bigger mark for himself as a songwriter with the band SHRIEKBACK."},{"rating":"2","title":"the gamplay stunk","review":"the gamplay maid me cry!!!the graphics were fine and it was pretty easy,but you should be able to make a car or pick your avretisments,other than that it was an o.k game for me :]"},{"rating":"1","title":"just like old ea games","review":"I went by the reviews and rented this game, lucky i didn't buy it, it's almost exactly like the old ea games, which are nothing, especially compared to the sierra computer games.

The gameplay is great. The options in champ mode are good. The graphics look almost like watching it on tv. The Problem lays with how long you can play it with out getting bored.

Nascar Heat just can't measure up to the amount of playability, and realism that Nascar Thunder 2002 offers. You can't build your own car. You must race an established car, (sorry but what fun is bein the substitute driver??) I wanna be the STAR!! The head to head feature wasn't that impressive. Yeah great Kevin Harvick can beat me on his favorite track? I paid 20 bucks to find this out??The graphics looked washed out on my tv, and the car gets too squirelly in the corners. The music, and the intro is better then NT2002, but the spotter's voice is too garbled to understand clearly. Overall very disappointed with this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Play it before you rate it!!!","review":"I happen to pre-order the Nascar Heat and once it arrives I will give a proper rating. I do know with what I have seen it does out perform the Electronic Arts version of the game.

I read every book in the series probably 6 times (and Ramona Forever, probably about 12...) Recently I started my 5 year old cousin on the Ramona books (she reminds me so much of Ramona - funny and wild and creative and cool)- of course Ramona the Pest - and she loved it. I must say that reading it aloud it seemed a bit dated (and certainly was not as exciting, or as good, as Ramona Forever, which I read recently to make sure it was as spectacular as I remembered it). Still, I think that Ramona is a GREAT friend to have growing up - and I still consider her a friend (and idol :) This book - though not the pinnacle of the series - is a great way to start kids off (and is probably easier for a 5 or 6 year old to associate with than an 18 year old)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real classic","review":"This classic by Beverly cleary is about Ramona, A sweet but spunky little girl who just started kindergarten.

My teacher read this book to us in class, and I liked it so much I read it myself. It's about a little girl who is always doing everything wrong. A lot of parts are funny. One funny part was when Ramona stuck her tongue out at her neighbor because she asked if her tongue was glued to her mouth because she wasn't speaking. She has an older sister Beezus who is sometimes a big tattle-tale.

I realized that the dust jackets were different when I ordered them; I don't like it, but I've learned to live with that. Then I opened Ramona the Pest and realized that they've replaced Louis Darling's marvelous illustrations, with those wild, exuberant, inky pictures of a Ramona who practically leaps from the pages, with drab, dreary, bland, anodyne, pallid and uninteresting things. What an awful thing to do to wonderful books. (And I know all the arguments about \\"Oh, children today are *different*, and they must have new new new pictures that look like everything else they've ever seen because otherwise they might not read the books...\\" Bilge.)The story deserves five stars.

Have fun reading!A young reviewer"},{"rating":"2","title":"There's a reason we all grew up reading this one :)","review":"Beverly Cleary has a real gift. Although her books span a period of decades, they all read as though they were written today. There's a few odd details in some of them, but mostly they rely on good storytelling and... well, very real-seeming children.This is the story of Ramona's kindergarten year. It can be hard to find chapter books that are worth reading to kindergarteners, but this is it - Ramona actually seems like an actual child who is actually, really, truly in kindergarten! When she's told to \\"sit here for the present\\" she does, waiting for her present. When she struggles to refrain from pulling perfect Susan's curly \\"boingy\\" hair, you can feel how hard it is. And it's easy for all small children to understand why Susan's trying to act like a grown-up is annoying for Ramona.I would really suggest this as a first read-aloud chapter book for a young kid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ramona the Pest","review":"Ramona Quimby has started kindergarten and is learning new things each day. Ramona is not only learning how to write her name but is learning life lessons. She is also making new friends.I enjoyed the book because it was humorous.

Well, it's more than that. The author does take us into the mind of a kindergartener, but Beezus (the oldest sister) has a reason for calling Ramona a pest. She is! First of all, Ramona is spoiled and thinks that everyone's against her, and anytime she wants something, she knows--if she cries--her mother will listen to her. Ramona Quimby is a brat and I'm glad to see she's grown-up, because Ramona Quimby is nothing but a whiner and spoiled brat! Consider this before handing it to your child. I'm 13...I know these things. My little sister agrees with me.(Remember, this is just an opinion)"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad choice","review":"I remember reading this as a little girl, as a mom, BAD CHOICE!!

Cleary is so accurate in rendering the child's perspective and writing about it in a way that young children can identify with, that this book can't fail to appeal to everyone, now and for years to come.

Of course it's impossible to include a poster from every musicals in any given year, but the selections Bruce Hershenson made are excellent.

The records sound warped, the tapes sound warped, and the sound quality could be what you might have expected back in the 20's. The tape deck doesn't open or close well and sometimes has to be pried open. What a piece of junk! It was such a great idea - too bad the quality doesn't match the appearance.

Wrong! Granted, it does what it says it does, and is pretty user-friendly, but that's where the bargain ends. The sound is very tinny and 'Mickey-Mouse' and, on the one we ordered, one of the CD channels didn't play at all. When we tried to patch this thing into our higher quality stereo system, we still got an awful sound quality because it records based on the sound quality the component itself produces. I guess there are no quick fixes where this is concerned; if you want to make quality CD's from your old tapes and albums, go to an electronics store and get the components the store recommends. It may be considerably more complicated, but the quality will be well worth it. The Crosley CD Songwriter is nothing more than an expensive piece of garbage in an attractive cabinet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Wear and Tear On Your Records","review":"This turntable and most if not all the Crosley's turntables are overpriced for what it gives you. First off, the sound quality is not very good and the tone arm does not have a weight control to prevent the stylus from severely damaging your ablums if accidently kicked or knocked. Also without weight control on the tone arm, more pressure is applied on the sound groves and your albums won't last very long. You can definitely get a better deal for a turntable equipted with tone arm weight control so the stylus will ease up your fine albums and still give you excellent sound quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased, overall.","review":"This item was purchased as a gift for a friend / co-worker who was retiring. Had a lot of old, one-of-a-kind albums, and we thought this would be the perfect gift for him. I was concerned because of poor reviews, but found out that the ones manufactured now (since April 2007) are considered 'second generation' -- more reliable and trouble-free than the earlier ones. The recipient of this one is extremely pleased to be able to put his older, over-played albums in CD format. Easy to use, other than having to insert breaks between songs. I've listened to a couple of the CDs he's made, and was surprised at the decent sound quality, especially considering the music source. After talking with him and listening to these CD copies, my fears about this product have been releived. I am now considering buying another one ... for myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"almost.........","review":"This is a great idea for all of us with vinyl and tape to convert to CD.

For that purpose, this device excels. I digitized about 100 old (mostly spoken-word) cassettes.By that time, I was no longer able to return it; and when the first LPs came out sounding tinny and slightly fast, I found myself seriously wishing I could do so.I must say, this device was a snap to use. The reviews that refer to the controls as confusing may reflect a lack of willingness to RTFM (which I'll admit could be a bit better-written). It's well-constructed and sounds at least average.If you have *lots* of tape (comedy, books-on-tape, radio programs), and you're not particularly tech-prone (read: computer-savvy), this device may be worth it. If, on the other hand, your main goal is digitizing LPs, I'd recommend you pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed with the whole experience.

Well, yeah, it doesn't sound all that great compared with other systems...but the buyer should already have something better for listening. As a recording device, it was pretty good, and that's why I bought the Crosley...to transfer old cassettes and records to the CD format for preservation purposes. It worked fine. I thought the design of the front panel was a overly complex and hard to read, but I got used to it. Crosley might have added a VU meter and adjustment to the recorder, but that would have jacked up the cost. All in all, and for the recording purpose, it's a pretty good tool. The object CD-Rs sound just like the original cassettes and records."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"The Cr248Songwriter CD Recorder is without a doubt the biggest lemon of it's time overpriced.

I also have to use a flashlight to see the markings on the faceplate to select the proper button to push. And the instructions for the turntable are so sketchy I can't figure out how to start it. If I can find my purchase record, I will return it for my money back.

I ended up giving it to a friend,who ended up throwing it in the garbage.1. The cassette player always played the tape faster than what it should have. Always sounded like I was like I was listening to the chipmunks.2. The cd recorder always left off the first few seconds of the song if I pushed split track.3. It didn't matter what remote I was using. It would end up turning on. If I had a cd left in the tray it would start playing. The volume starts out at 15 every time you turn on the unit. I was startled a few times.4. When I would try to put the arm of the turntable on a record. The whole turntable would move around like it wasn't being held in place.I have another Crosley that I paid $99.00 for and doesn't have anything fancy on it.

And while I was at it, record that vinyl to CD. However, it has all the fidelity of a AM transistor radio from the 70's, and while the resulting CDs sound good on a different system than when the vinyl is played, the CD recording process requires you to sit by the machine in order to manually enter the track breaks and to stop the recording process manually. So I find myself recording sides of an LP or cassette onto a CD/RW disc, ripping those onto my PC and using some MP3/WMA editing software that allows me to split the tracks manually and drop the silent space at the end where the record ended, but I was in the bathroom. So now I'm scratching my head thinking I should just put all the money this costs into a USB turntable and some software that automatically does track splits and noise removal. I definitely do not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crosley Radio CR248 Songwriter CD Recorder","review":"The Crosley Radio CR248 Songwriter CD recorder is great when it works. However, after 2 weeks, I had to return it for repairs. The tape cassette did not work and I couldn't record anything onto the CD. It is now at the shop. I had to call twice to get them to give me a return authorization and there was no indication in the packaging telling me to contact Best in Home, the place that shipped it to me.

Also on most of the 45's the stylus would come up before the record ended and return to its rest position, resulting in not getting the complete song. I called Crosley on Dec. 31, 2008. I was told someone would call me back in 48-72 business hours. (No holidays or weekends.) It is now January 24, 2009 and I never did hear from them.

It's not as though I'm a sour puss, I loved Dumb & Dumber and Kingpin. The only time I laughed is when Warren starts beating Ted because he touched his ear. I thought the whole masturbation thing was disgusting and the dog thing cruel. Not funny. I just hate Ben Stiller. His T.V. show s***ed, every movie he is in s**ks (except Cable Guy, and that would have s***ed if not for Jim Carrey)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb & Stupid","review":"Well, I thought this was a reallly stupid movie!

There's a lot to laugh at here and some good writing and acting as well.

There are many extremely funny sequences, especially near the beginning of the story, but there are also more serious passages about real issues and calling for reflexion. The actors are all doing great, especially so because they are playing very difficult parts (the characters themselves and their interactions are complex and deep). Ted, Woogie, Pat Healy, Warren, Joe Montana are all interesting characters, and of course Mary is part of them ; Cameron is really superb and is just perfect as the central character of the story; she has an aura and her beautiful smile simply casts tons of light out of the screen !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak-minded humor with few laughs","review":"Some professional friends that I work with said that this was one of the best and funniest movies they had ever seen. It's depressing to think sometimes how dumbed down our pop culture has become. Yes, there were some laughs here and there, but the filmmakers' insistance that crude and tasteless is funny only goes to show how much wit and inspiration is missing from most comedies nowadays. People like Chaplin and the Marx Bros., who helped to define movie comedy, would be outraged to see what their art has evolved into. I guess my opinion is in the minority though, since I understand this film became a big hit. That's more scary than funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"why waste your money","review":"Why waste your money on renting this movie? All you have to do is watch the trailer. There are no funny moments outside of the trailer. And why does America have this fascination with Ben Stiller. Everyone of his movies, especially Reality Bites, stinks.

And Cameron Diaz is one of the homliest actresses around."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid, gross, and not funny","review":"This is an awful comedy.

Am I supposed to laugh because the girl put the \\"hair-gel\\" in her hair? Give me a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny...no class humor.","review":"A waste of good acting talent. It has to be one of the worst movies I've seen. The only reason to watch it is if you have to see every movie Cameron made. I only watched the whole thing to see what my step son was subjected too. He said the movie was lousy, but Mary is gorgeous. I feel the humor was tasteless. Could have been a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"This could have been a GREAT movie instead of just very good","review":"I laughed as hard as anyone else when I first saw this film, so hard that at first I was able to overlook what was missing. Only later did I realize where the movie missed its mark; there was very little social commentary, an error makes the movie merely fluff instead of one of the best comedies of all time.Let's face it. Every single one of Mary's suitors is a stalker. At a time where sound bites are confused with political leadership and \\"Titanic\\" confused with entertainment, this film could have made a powerful point on the confusion between love and obsession without sacrificing its hilarious, tasteless humor.It's so rare, however, for a movie to consciously cross every bound of good taste and do so with a good heart and a broad audience appeal. You *will* laugh out loud, but you'll also wish the movie had had the courage to go that last step."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gross? Yes. In poor taste? Yes. Extremely funny? Yes.","review":"I saw this movie at a sneak preview, so the word was not out yet. Missed quite a bit of the dialouge following several gags because the audienece was still laughing long after the gag/scene was over. Whatever you think about this movie, I don't know how anyone could sit there and not laugh. Cameron Diaz was perfect, Matt Dillon hilarious, and Ben Stiller was made for his role. This is a movie to see more than once, because you will pick up things the second time that you missed the first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie but the format is lousy","review":"Why doesn't the studio make this movie in a standard format instead of the widescreen version?

The laughs were stricly \\"high school\\" and distracted from the sweet love story that was going on inbetween silly jokes. Some of the jokes were beyond silly, bordering on sick. A \\"Daytona Beach Party Crowd\\" will love this movie, but serious movie fans would like to be warned to stay away from this 'camp fair'."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT EXTRAS!","review":"This funny, slapstick movie from the Farelly brothers has Ben Stiller hunting down a long lost High School love, with the usual crude gags and sharp turns along the way.Get the widescreen 2-disc director's cut, because it's loaded with special features like gag reels, behind the scenes stuff, interviews, etc.Rated R (contains language, semi-nudity, crude humor relating to sexual content, slapstick violence-- no blood and references to drug abuse)Starring Ben Stiller, Matt Dillon and Cameron Diaz"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"The first time you see this movie, you will laugh until your gums bleed. The Farrelly brothers have supplied us with a great comedy that would even make your grandmother laugh. You will for sure enjoy it the first time you see it but upon viewing it again, you'll have known what is about to happen and may not laugh as hard. This is not the type of film that you can watch over and over again expecting to be satisfied. Ben Stiller's best role and this contins as well the best ensemble cast for a comedy in years. The DVD was somewhat disappointing, but it was put on the market a long time ago. The Outtakes are pretty funny, the cast/crew info is terrible and the trailer and film are good. I Recoomend Me, Myself & Irene if you loved this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"Even a rental fee is a waste of money with this video. If you insist on seeing it to perhaps quench your curiosity, wait until it comes on one of the cable channels. A senseless, inconsistent tale of a nerdish male searching for his long-lost high school sweetheart with a lot of tasteless, adult humor thrown in. I hope the key players in this film eventually land decent movie roles in the future that add some kind of distinction to their careers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fat drunk and stupid is no way to go through life,boy.","review":"This movie is just not funny. It was as if it was made by Republicans. Republicans have no sense of art or joy of life. (They try to get by on Regis and heavy doses of prime time tv.)

If people actually enjoyed this movie, it really tells me that my neighbors have no sense of dignity or taste. This is one of the MOST dumbest movies I have ever had the misfortune of renting. Cameron Diaz is over-rated as the silly, smiling blonde who falls for the nerd who can't even zip his pants. Do you people allow your children to see this movie with such graphic and crude scenes? Don't buy this video. If you want to see a funny movie, without the unnecessary crude scenes, watch a Laurel & Hardy movie or Chaplin himself -- those actors really knew how to make people laugh, the classic way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget the hype...... this movie is horrible.","review":"This is one of the most atrocious attempts at filmmaking that I have ever witnessed in my life. This movie was even worse than, \\"Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion\\". That is saying alot since I would rather have my face rammed into a brick wall 100 times than see that again. Anyway, this movie is just dumb. The jokes and gags are not funny, the characters are annoying and basically you can get more entertainment from staring at a blank wall for 6 hours. I don't know why everyone keeps dumping out their love for this movie on me. Just stop it. Now."},{"rating":"1","title":"very WACK!","review":"skip this mess.after all the hype surrounding it i finally saw it.and basically even though it came out in the 90's it could have easily been mistaken for a 3rd tier Spring Break movie.remember those films of the 80's? the zipper scene is the most talked about.yeah that sums up the film stuck.Diaz,Stiller have no skills and Matt Dillon never had any."},{"rating":"1","title":"See this movie (if your IQ is in negative numbers)","review":"A movie for morons. This movie represents the depths to which our culture has sunk. If you have progressed beyond third-grade sniggling at \\"pee pee\\" and \\"poo poo\\" jokes, have an IQ which exceeds single digits, or can walk and chew gum at the same time, avoid this movie like the plague. I literally did not laugh a single time. I will be glad when all the social taboos have been broken on film so that the mere breaking of a taboo cannot serve as a substitute for wit and humor. You want funny? Any episode of the Simpsons is funnier than this piece of garbage. The ten minutes of Raising Arizona before the credits is a comic masterpiece but probably too clever and too subtle for TSAM's audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most over-rated movies in years!","review":"Funny?

I didnt laugh once during the whole movie and cant figure out what all the fuss was about. I can appreciate raunchy junior high level humor, but while this movie had the raunchiness, and the junior high maturity, it seriously lacked in the humor department. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because the actors did a good job.. everything else about it was completely dissapointing. After a long while, I even tried to watch it again to see if I had just been in a bad mood the first time, or somehow didnt get it, but I couldnt make it through it a second time without turning it off. Obviously lots of people loved it, so all I can say is dont buy it if you havent seen it, rent it first, and then decide whether or not you want to waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK!!!

If you want to see her in a good dark comedy, check out the quirky comedy/mystery/suspense movie Head Above Water.I did like how the characters in TSAM were such extreme over-the-top slimeballs, losers, etc. Matt Dillon did a good job in his role. The problem was, I expected the funniest movie in years and I didn't find it quite that good. Kingpin and Dumb and Dumber were funnier movies.This is a romantic comedy that's not too concerned with the romance. So, there's not much heart in it and the cheap yukks seem like cheap shots. All-in-all, a forgettable movie I won't want to see again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The comedy of the year. Great fun.","review":"Diaz and Damon were the mainstay of this movie. Diaz was suitably sweet and desirable to make one understand why everyone is pursuing her. Okay you hardly beleive she's a doctor but this is a lighthearted comedy (we're not talking about 'ER' here). Damon's sleazy, cheating character contrasts well with Diaz.Too much has been made of the 'Hair Gel' scene. It is rather juvenile but the film should be judged in it's entirety and not on one scene in dubious taste.Diaz looks like she genuinely enjoyed making this movie as the viewer feels that she wants to join the audience and burst out laughing. It is with Damon though that the real funny moments of the movie lie. The scene with the dog is hilarious and who could forget Damon's and Diaz first meeting where he informs her ..'I look after retards....Isn't that politically incorrect...yeah maybe, but I don't care,I'll look after who I want..\\"Recommended for those who enjoy a good laugh"},{"rating":"1","title":"But what IS it about Mary?!","review":"I don't get it! Did all these people who gave There's Something About Mary four and five stars see a different movie than I did? I found nothing clever or groundbreaking about its sexual humor; it just lowered the bar for everyone else! (For example, compare 1997's mildly racy Austin Powers to 1999's [post-Mary] excessively raunchy Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.)

It's 10 out of 10 on the comedy scale. Anyone and everyone who has a sense of humor will laugh uncontrollably from beginning to end. I do concede the fact that supposedly \\"cultured\\" viewers will combat their laughter by blowing off the humor as disgusting, childish and stupid, thereby destroying the whole point of watching a comedy. For individuals who decided not to enjoy this movie and denied their joie de vivre, it is unfortunate that you passed on the opportunity to laugh harder than you've ever laughed.

A comedic Masterpeice.","review":"This was the funniest movie ever. It just MAKES you laugh. You have to laugh. It doesn't have as many funny scenes as some comedies, but the scenes that are funny are UN-forgettable. The thing the makers of this movie did, was they brought on one funny joke after another, so while your busy laughing your head off and hitting your chair as hard as you can, you miss the next joke. It's great. Not only are the jokes as funny as hell, but at the same time there's a very interesting story to watch. This is a cult classic comedy.

I'd buy the move ten times over if only that whole disgustingly graphic sequence had been left where it belonged - on the editors floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another horrible movie to go on a scar for cinema.","review":"This is another movie that is just plain gross, unsympathetic, and STUPID, STUPID, STUPID."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time. This one is bad...","review":"Cameron Diaz is wonderful. She manages to be charming, funny and dignified all at the same time. But she is the only good thing about this movie. The rest of it is bland, boring and juvenile. Frighteningly so in fact. If I was 14 and still thought body function jokes were funny, I might have liked this movie. As is, it is one of the stupidest, least clever, biggest wastes of time to come out of hollywood in a while. Don't go see it unless your sense of humor got stuck in your pre-teen years. This movie is a big, big waste of time. And an insult to the fine actress who fronts it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remember the Porky movies?","review":"Yeah, those movies about a group of teens who 'discover' their sexuality. There is a scene where a woman grabs one of the boys by his genitals. When I was eleven, I thought this was very funny, even after watching it many times. Ten years later I saw the same scene and I was bored.Comedy is not intended to be deep, it is primarily for amusement, and I have no problem with 'physical' comedy. I love Laurel & Hardy, The Three Stooges, and the Zucker/Abrahams team of Airplane and Naked Gun. But TSAM is not a good movie.Take away the faeces, sweat and semen and you have almost no story, no creativity and no acting. Come on let's face it. Cameron Diaz would be outacted by an ironing board, and you must have been stupid if you didn't see every joke coming from a galaxy far far away.I know many people enjoyed this movie, but I think it was a bummer. I wonder if those who are laughing now will still be laughing ten years from now?"},{"rating":"1","title":"rude crude and a one hell of a bad career move babe.","review":"Certainly not my idea of funny, it was mean, crude and had only moments when it was genuinely funny. It was a reasonale success so I guess that proves that it is some peoples idea of a good time. eg. Who would laugh at a dog having the wires of a power cord pressed into its stomache or a man being shot for singing or a down sindrome man be smacked down by an egotistical mean spirited #@!%& for playing a game, try telling me thats all in good humour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obnoxious and embarassing","review":"This has got to be the most over-rated comedy since The Birdcage. Actually, it's much worse than The Birdcage, due to its total lack of comic timing and its embarassingly awkward and tasteless \\"humor\\"--e.g. guy mistakenly tossing some semen in his date's hair and her rubbing it in, thinking its hair gel--STUPID! I couldn't even finish the movie, it was so terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucked.","review":"Funniest movie of the year? You have got to be kidding. Cameron was so snobby.

If their was 0 stars then thats what i'd put it under."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Farrellys miss one","review":"This is not funny. Sure you have the tacky (intended) hair gel scene...but that was not funny enough to save this boring film. I mean what is the point....middle class America is boring and tries to get thru with a little juvenile wit....we know that already...no need to waste time or money to be told again by a couple guys that can and have done a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's Nothing about Mary...","review":"Nothing funny or sexy that is. This movie had one funny scene and that was when the cop bounced Stillers head off that table. That's it, nothing before or after. It was way over hyped and so is Diaz. She is not the Goddess everyone seems to think she is,there are alot more prettier actresses out there than her,Julia Roberts for one. And Roberts can act too. If you want a movie watch this,if you want a Funny movie,see Deuce Bigalow,it's worth the hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can bad taste be so funny?","review":"I asked myself that question over and over again as I went for the second and third times to the theatre to see \\"There's Something About Mary\\", a comedy that pokes fun at every conceivable sacred cow there is. Cameron Diaz is Mary, the girl Ben Stiller has been dreaming about ever since they didn't quite make it to the senior prom years ago. He hires Matt Dillon, a sleazy private eye, to track her down, with the unforeseen outcome that Dillon decides to put the moves on Mary himself. Many scenes beyond risque, \\"There's Something About Mary\\" manages to amuse scads of folks--well, not everyone, I guess. I rented this finally to show some family members, who were SERIOUSLY less than amused. The basic take on it was, \\"Why have you brought this into my home?\\" So \\"Mary\\" is not for everyone, but if you choose your co-audience well, you should still laugh till you cry and then be ashamed of yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most unrealistic film I have ever seen...","review":"What...It was supposed to be unrealistic? It's a comedy...and escape? Well, just to make sure we're all on the same page, he would have never (never say never) gotten the girl in real life. Humor galore, but you have to be able to relate somewhere along the line in order to fully enjoy this movie (just like Dumb and Dumber). This one's hair-raising fun to say the least. End."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny and vastly overrated","review":"This movie is plodding and not funny. Each gag is stretched beyond the breaking point, and there is no crackle of comic energy anywhere in the writing or acting. I am bewildered by the continuing fan base this movie has created. It is a witless and tacky movie. Renting it was a waste of money, and buying it would be even moreso."},{"rating":"2","title":"The original with old-fashioned pictures","review":"For those who want the original poem. I don't specifically like the picture on the cover, but made my purchase based on the reviews. I'm buying Christmas books to keep the kids busy during the holiday season. I started withHistory of Santa Claus - Book 1 (Santa Through the Years)because I just loved the look of the book and it also had good reviews. That series is interactive, this book is not.

There are illustrations on most pages. They are a little smaller than I would have desired, but my kids were captivatied by the details in the illustrations.

A great heirloom for the future.","review":"I plan to give this as a gift to our grown children to begin their Christmas traditions as a new family.

The palm-size book is about 3 inches by 3 inches, and probably \\" thick. I don't have to tell you about the story; it's universally known. This will probably be a great stocking-stuffer for one of your children, or maybe a clever table card for everyone attending your Christmas Eve dinner; a hanging bookmark with someone's name will add to the beauty of the table set before the guests. You might even slide a thin festive cord around the book, and hang it as an ornament on your family Christmas Tree; I did just that!The illustrations look Victorian, and the text is done in calligraphy. While this edition by Running Press may no longer be available, no doubt some entrepreneur is quickly working on a similar type book which can be used in many ways. \\"Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"rip off","review":"I bought this book before Christmas 2011, believing I was buying the best version available. After receiving the book, it is good quality, but in no way \\"antique reproduction\\". It has the look and feel of any other kids book you would buy. I had great expectation about better paper stock and binding to make it feel more like a classic book (and reflect the price paid).I paid $120 for it, and now see that the price has gone up about 50%??? - and I feel like I way over paid.Don't be duped!Don't buy this item!I just found a website called [...] that actually shows antique versions of this book, and look nothing like this version."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am so disappointed!","review":"As I always read the reviews before I buy something, I was so surprised when I received this book the other day and it was not at all what I expected. Of course the story is great, but the quality of the book is atrocious. The cover pictures are stickers! The back cover sticker that tells about the story is already peeling off. I guess being an heirloom edition and the high reviews led me to expect more. I have fairly realistic expectations when it comes to books, and even a dust cover over a plain cover would have been fine, but this is just cheesy and I will be returning it. If you are just looking for a copy of the book, it's fine, but if you truly want something to enjoy year after year, this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I ordered this book for my husband to read to our daughter on Christmas Eve - a tradition passed down through his family. When we received it, we read through it, and although the pictures are beautiful (classic Jan Brett illustrations) the illustrator decided to add her own \\"twist\\" on the classic poem by depicting trouble-making elves wreaking havoc in Santa's sleigh. The main pictures don't match the story, and the illustrations that do go with the words are shown in the small side panes. I suppose it might be a nice copy for an older kid, but for young children this seems like it would be confusing. We will be returning this book and continuing our search for a beautifully illustrated, classic version of the poem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value, acceptable quality","review":"We were looking for an over-sized \\"Night Before Christmas\\" book to read to our little ones on Christmas eve.

The illustrations are vivid and traditional, and the binding is durable. The animotion is a bit dark, but that is ok, as it is detailed and there are some on almost every page.

First of all, the organization of the chapters of the book is quite confusing: the different chapters don't seem to fit together or leverage each other. Perhaps due to several authors involved in the book or bad editing. It makes this book *very* difficult to read.It also merely scratches many important details about the WebSphere server. If you're writing a J2EE book, that is one thing, but there are so many much much better books available for that. One that specializes to a single server should show how that server works in detail. This book seems to completely miss its target and audience: neither a good generic J2EE book, nor a solid WebSphere book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life on heavenly roads","review":"This book is a magical gem that transports the reader to the mythopoetic era, when angelic beings interact freely with ordinary mortals.If you want to gain vision into paradise, lost or found, read this little beauty.

It illustrates visual management (or visual communication; VC) as a very important issue to boosting the factorys' or companys' productivity through increasing the effectiveness of the employees' from head management to the shop floor workers by the effective sharing of information and by encouraging the workers to participate in developing these information. In addition; VC helps in building a sense of belonging to the factory or company within the workers themselves which will work in the factory (company) best interest.The book introduces guide lines for applying the VC. I think that the real cases covered along with the many different graphs and pictures really helped in clearing out many points."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad book","review":"it lacks of what it preaches no visual book at all. very few examples much history. might be good for school but not for lean manufacturing professionals"},{"rating":"1","title":"How Do U Edit Luda?","review":"How do u edit Luda?

It has 5 tracks, which, below, i have given track-by-track reasons not to buy \\"Word Of Mouf\\" edited (clean):1. Rollout (My Business) - Cuts out a lot of the words, ...?2. Saturday (Oooh Oooh!) - WAY better explicit, you can listen to this one on the radio too.3. Go To Sleep - This is awful, you can't hear [anything] they block so much out.4. Freaky Thangs - Once again, awful!5.

Growing Pains is a bangin track, but only real hip hop heads would know the beat was jacked from Dilated Peoples \\"Worst Come To Worst\\". He just made the beat real slow. Roll Out is hot, but then the rest of the album suffers from poor beats and horrific guest appearances. JD ruins Coming to Atlanta, while the one wit those Memphis Three 6 Mafia just is not good.

Ludacris' only talent is his ability to flow fast as hell, which he didn't use as much as he should've. There are plenty of other better CD's, like Busta Rhymes-Genesis, Fabolous-Ghetto Fabolous, Nate Dogg- Music and Me, and Big Boi and Dre Present, Outkast.

Ludacris has the potential to be a great mc. He just needs to get with some underground, talented producers and quit working with people like JD.

The doubts were quickly erased after I heard the first track \\"Coming 2 America\\" a sure to be single. Right after that you hear his second single \\"Roll Out\\" a decent song but no way is it the best on the album. Same thing with \\"Area Codes\\" (should this have actually been on his album?). \\"Move B*tch\\" and \\"Block Lock Down\\" are the sleeper hits of the album. And \\"Greatest Hits\\" is one of the funnier skits Ive heard. The album ends off with the hidden track \\"Welcome to Atlanta\\", and great song by Ludacris but damaged by JD's rhymes and consistincy of saying \\"Yo\\". The Album is worth the ($), for his funny rhymes and great beats."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tired document of rap mediocrity","review":"I was completely let down by this record. I think Ludacris is a talented rapper with some crazy style but this record's got uninteresting synth beats, tacky skits, way too many guest rappers(to the point where Ludacris at times seems like a guest on his own album) and does nothing that hasn't been done countless times before. I'm surprised all the reviews here are so positive! I guess kids who don't know any better like this stuff. On the plus side \\"Saturdays\\" and \\"Freestyle\\" are okay and there are some funny moments. \\"Freestyle\\" actually has some of that Jungle Brothers energy to it but they only keep it going here for two minutes...

Track One's repeated thumping bass is reminiscent of almost anyone of X's cuts; seconds later, when Luda rhymes about bein' \\"shorter than five Danny Devitos\\" you know he's got the lyrical power to back up the thug mentality. I like to call this music OutKast on crack. \\"Word of Mouf's\\" only downfall is in its poorly written hooks. Don't get me wrong, the lyrics or bangin,' and Luda's performance on Track One is enough to boost this disc to the top of any hip-hoppers a-list; \\"Move B***h\\" is tight, but the repetitive chorus does nothing to advance the track, much like many of X's cuts. Luda lacks the poetical strength and restraint of OutKast, but he makes up for it with \\"Growing Pains,\\" a sentimental cut that showcases the rapper's softer side. My advice: Buy this album, but don't expect an \\"Aquemini.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"sigh...","review":"Misogynisim is an ugly thing. I hate the fact that guys like Ludacris champion it so.

This, and all the other songs not mentioned, can be SKIPPED. The best part of the CD, however, is the GREATEST HITS Skit. Funniest thing EVER!

They shred constantly and require way more floss than the regular kind. It feels like you are just pulling out tons of extra floss, trying to get it to stay, having it shred, repeat.

Even if the inspiration for them is fairly obvious, Jordan does some impressive things with them, and with the reaction of the western \\"wetlanders\\" to their latest incursion.Other than that, this book has simply added to a series that is becoming top-heavy, and in danger of crushing itself under its own weight. Since of all of the characters in the book, it is Egwene who develops the most, I would rather have had Rand's tale wrapped up long ago, and had a (concurrent?) story about her instead.But no, the Last Battle is yet to come, and I'm sorry to say, the sooner the better"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality","review":"The book arrive a little earlier than I expected, but looks practically brand new.

Yes...Robert has lost his touch. HE OVERUSES DETAIL. No, I do NOT care about what dresses Elayne and Egwene are wearing...I care about the characters' feelings. Robert beat the series into oblivion (eight books and still counting?!), unlike David Eddings, who had The Belgariad be only five WONDERFUL books. Robert was great in the beginning, but was unable to hold on, and lapsed into repetetiveness."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOT Fan","review":"I gave it two stars because, other than the big battle about 3/4 of the way through, it was too slow!

Only because it's a Wheel of time book I kept on reading. I must say: the scenes with Rand in it while fighting the Shaido's and the scenes with Nynaeve and Elayne were very borin. Only the parts with Min and co. and Liandrin were cool, but as you know, this is about 100 pages long. Too bad, but book 6 was one of the best, so don't stop reading after having read Book 5!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best ending yet!","review":"This book was great! The way Jordan will send some kind of twist to the story and get you excited is magnificent. Jordan loves to hit you with the excitement when you least expect it, then let you calm down and hit you with one again. As with all of the books so far you do not know what to expect until it happens. The only thing I did not like about this book was the absence of Perrin anywhere in the book. Other than that Jordan gives the characters old and new more depth and life. So far I have been quite pleased with the series as it becomes more interesting with each book. Hopefully, book six will be just as good, if not better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much battle of the sexes","review":"I like the Jordan series, but the battle of the sexes is becoming fastidious. It's commendable the way Jordan has cast women into powerful roles in the series, but he has done so to a fault. It seems to me that women are not only equal to the men, but superior. The women can hardly say anything at all about the men without some dispariging remark. If the roles were reversed and the comments about the men were made about women, the series wouldn't survive. This book seems to be the culmination of predominant sexist theme in the book. The sexism is the antithesis of what we see in the real world, and it is just as irritating. The book itself is good if you can ignore this feature, or if it doesn't bother you. The idea of Elayne bonding Rand just seems absurd to me and it castrates what should be the most powerful character in the series. Of course I'll keep reading, I have too much time invested in the series to stop now."},{"rating":"2","title":"1000 pages in the life of the Aiel","review":"This book is long. I don't like starting any kind of review like that, it simply states the facts. It is a series for people who like long, descriptive books. Still, most long descriptive books contain action. For most of this book, I was waiting for the events of the previous book, which was incredible, to be followed up on. There were the accepted on their journey after the Black Ajah, there was the new army in the Two Rivers, and there was Egwene learning about dreams. None of that was resolved until the next book. Instead, this is all about Rand travelling with the Aiel, occassionally stopping on the increasingly uninteresting travels of Nynaeve and Elayne. Still, all of that changes suddenly, when the book pull an about face, and a memorable battle occurs, leaving a suprising number of victories for the ta'varen. Like any good journey, the Wheel of Time Books are long and tedious, but the end is always worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I am sorry; it must be me, not Mr. Jordan. I could not finish this book. I tried to read it three times, skimming most of it. I listened to the abridged book on tape and the unabridged, losing interest both times. I did read two interesting scenes but the rest left me wanting to move on to the next book in hopes that it could hold my interest as the others have."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fires of Heaven","review":"I really like the book and the series.BUT ... the publisher is outrageously overcharging for the electronic version of this book ... and others in the series. The pre-order price is $9.99 and the trade paper back is $7 and it can also be ordered NEW for as low as $4.99.There is no reason but ripping off the consumer to charge this much. There are virtually no costs in the ebook version, but there are production and distribution costs in the hardback, paperback and mass market paperback. So, if the publisher charges more that the lowest print version price, they are making a higher profit. There is no indication that the author (or in this case, sadly, his estate) receives more royalty than for the print version. So, this means higher profits for the publisher.I have written to the publisher about this and the lack of their books in ebook format and they have chosen not to respond."},{"rating":"1","title":"Man bashing galore","review":"If you like man bashing, arrogant women. This is the book for you. I thought that the women would get better as the series went on, but it's much worse. I don't understand what they are so angry about. It's bizarre.This entire book is basically dedicated to these snippy, condescending, man hating women. I don't know if I can continue the series. About 900 pages of this is too much.

If you want a book/series that manages to craft an entire world and its peoples to an extent that, at times, it could be a history book but that manages to do all of that while also using a plot that is second to none in complexity/entertainment then this book and the Wheel of Time Series is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch, not close to TSR","review":"After coming off a great like The Shadow Rising I expected something much better than what was delivered by the long and boring Fires of Heaven. In TFOH Rand searches for the Shaido and the False Car'a'carn, Couladin. While Rand is going mad Mat is puzzling over what to do about Aes Sedai, what happened to him in Rhuidean, a hot Aiel chick, And two dorrways into different worlds. Egwene continues to be taught of dreamwalking and Aiel customs by The Wise Ones while Elayne and Nyneave hunt Black Ajah and hide from one of the Forsaken. One of the worst parts of this book is that one of my favorite characters, Perrin, is only mentioned in passing and plays no other role. Bottom Line: suffer throgh this book. Hopefully Lord of Chaos will be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Despite Flaws, Remains Above Average!","review":"Compared to Shadow Rising, FoH's predecessor, Fires of Heaven is amazing. Compared to other novels, it is barely above average. Still, you do manage to find yourself enjoying the novel. It moves faster than SR and has better plot lines, too. Two bad points: the characters Perrin, Faile, and Loial are never brought in, and Mat is still here. Can't that whining, immature brat ever leave? Rand's character does manage to improve and I also began to like the characters of Aviendha, Nynaeve, Elayne, and Egwene more so than before. Some ideas are either bit redundant or just plain ridiculous, but it still is a book you can enjoy and still be ready to read the series' next installment in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd really like to get to the end of the series...","review":"I love Robert Jordan's books SO much...they have all the detail of Tolkein. In fact RJ IS the new TOLKEIN. BUT, Tolkein knew when to wrap a story up, and Robert Jordan hasn't got a clue.

That's GREAT service!! Thank You Very Much!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Actions would speak louder than all these words....","review":"This volume is where I gave up on the \\"Wheel of Time\\" series. The scenes became too repetitious, all the characters started sounding alike, and the overall story had long since lost its direction. Strange, but I recall being impatient during the first 100 pages of volume I, \\"Eye of the World.\\" That was just a hint of the frustration to come. Jordan created what could have been a fascinating world with a well-imagined matriarchal society, and hinted at many intriguing things about its past... then drifted off into endless scenes with the female characters b***hing about the men. If the series ever ends, the publisher should hire somebody to boil the whole thing down to 1,500 pages or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"The start of the downhill","review":"After the well paced, throughly enjoying start of this series, The Fires of Heaven shifted Robert Jordan's overrated series into a new, slower gear...a gear that it still has not shifted out of, as any reader of A Path of Daggers will tell you. It is here that he decided to fragment his epic story into several hundred subplots, peopled by several hundred minor, flat characters, and written with several hundred repeated phrases and descriptions.Rather than continue on with a focused, interesting tale, Jordan instead decided to create the never-ending Melrose Place of fantasy, with characters popping in and out at a head spinning pace. A terrible waste of paper.Read the first three books in this series as a trilogy, then, for the love of god, stop their before you get sucked in..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I lost my lust for this novel","review":"I don't know what happened.

I do hope that will change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, as always, but not quite as strong...","review":"Robert Jordan is incredible... This is by far the biggest, most complex fantasy series I've ever heard of.

A truly great series that everyone should read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A step down from its predecessors","review":"I begin to get the sensations that many other reviewers have outlined from my reading of book 5. The pace seems to be slowing down, apart from the obligatory speed-up in the last 100 pages, there seems little in the way of action in this book. My interest level is ebbing, and book 12 looks a long way away from here. I start wondering if its time to quit, while Im ahead, so to speak.I believe around 500 pages could be cut from this volume.100 pages cut from Nynaeve's introspection / anger50 pages cut from Aes Sedai gossiping70 pages - the entire \\"circus\\" episode cut50 pages from Rand's repetitive thought processes50 pages from Elayne50 pages from EgweneThe remaining 130 pages could be cut from random clothing descriptions / minor characters who serve no plot purpose.This is not a good book. There, I've said it. Books 1-4 were good, but this is the first truly bad one. I will read book 6... but the jury is out."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most boring book I've ever read.","review":"Quite simply, the most boring book I've ever read. I thought Lord of Chaos was ten times better, but this is only my personal opinion, of course. Many people list this as their favourite and LoC as the most boring one, so I guess everyone should read them and make up their mind :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Volume Fulfilled My Growing Suspicions","review":"Yes! It was actually possible to write an entire, lengthy novel that is part of a long and ambitious series, and not substantially advance a single basic plot line. Just a string of overly descriptive chapters that moved characters around on vaguely defined or just unfinished business. What a depressing concept.I decided Jordan had essentially run out of ideas, yet he still seemed determined to stretch \\"The Wheel of Time\\" past ten or more titles.Willing to give the man one more chance, I confess I purchased \\"Lord of Chaos,\\" but gave up for good shortly after reading 100 pages when the paperback's binding failed and the book disintegrated. Since two of the previous books had shed their covers before I finished them, I decided this was a trend towards very cheaply made paperbacks stuffed with filler and fluff.Sadly, the series had become a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"I thought this book was pretty good. The pacing is pretty good and everything is described in detail. Sometimes it gets annoying since there are a lot of pages keeping you away from the action, but it does lend that extra bit of richness to Jordan's world. There are some surprising developments and a couple plot twists you won't see coming unless you read between every line...and even then you will probably miss it. All in all, the book is an enjoyable read for the most part.The only thing keeping me from giving this 5 stars is that @*#&$ Nynaeve. I wish Jordan would use Balefire on her and remove her sorry thread from the entire series PERMANANTLY. She has got to be one of the biggest @*#&$^% of all time in the genre. Egwene and Elayne I can stand, and Moraine has always been the best female character in the series, and perhaps one of the best ever created in the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Battle is approaching rapidly- NOT!","review":"The story rolls ponderously along, gathering characters like fractures. While I like intricacy, and this series has it, the details are slow in coming- especially as this is yet another 1,000 page book (here editor, editor: come out come out wherever you are!). You often can skip whole pages and not loose the story thread. Character interactions reinforce my conviction that Jordan's philosophy is: trust no one, have no friends, and those you do you cannot confide in, and if you love someone, torment them mercilessly. The book jacket says he's married, but lists no kids... no wonder!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Will It ever End?","review":"Although I love this series, I want it to end. I am finding myself more interested in Mat and Perrin, rather than Rand. I had to read another book, after I read this one, instead of Bk. #6, just to clear my head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This book, just like the others in this series, is so totally cool, it's colder than absolute zero. The characters are very dynamic, and continue to change as time passes by, evolving from simplistic characters to well-rounded and powerful parts, capable of evoking emotions in any avid reader. The only problem I have with this book is the same one that I have had from the very beginning: All the women in the book act as if they are far superior to the males. I realize that reality, despite the best efforts of most people, is the exact opposite, but the book is still ruined by Jordan's repetitive use of this twist on his reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Question Of Pride","review":"I have never put down a book (actually, I have, once)I Have never left a series unfinishedI am leaving my third decadeI have read this book one and a half year ago.

I didn't find out about the series until the eighth volume, but when I did I couldn't put them down. Just when the story gets you focused on one character, the perspective changes in such a way that another character is the central figure. I especially enjoy when they interract. I am also looking forward to the illumination to the allusions of this world perhaps being a time in our own very distant future (light bulbs, airplanes, even the original names of their notable historical figures). I can't wait to see where it's all going and am looking forward to ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is simply great!","review":"In this book (as well as in his previous books) Robert Jordan really shows his writing skill. Not only is he creating a interesting and exciting world full of magic, he also provides us with interesting details of the people living there. The Aiel are simple the best and their strange customs and Rand's struggle to get along with these is sometimes really funny.A very good element of the story is also the rebirth of the heros and so their memory of long past lives. Therefor Mat is for me nearly the most interesting caracter of Jordan's novels. His unnatural luck and his strategic skill he shows often accidentely do not let the others understand him.I am really looking forward to the next book. I hope it is as great as this one!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"It's been 2 months, and about 4,500 pages now... :) I don't know how I get an education since I'm going through this series without being able to put it down.

There are some really great scenes in the fifth book of the series and, from what I've heard, great things continue to happen in the next book.

The next installment continued the plot well. After that, however, the Wheel of Time spun slowly and stayed in one place.Now, it wasn't the length of the book that put me off - I love longer books. But when the storyline just drawls on, the bulk of the book makes you groan. The descriptions are vague, and everything seems to repeating itself. Nothing gets anywhere! The women are mad at the men for trivial things, the men are mad at the women for even stupider things, and all of the books seem to end in the exact same place as the previous installment. I nodded off before Jordan could draw breath for his next rant.Best to just cut the books off quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too expensive!","review":"This audio book can be ordered at most book stores for less than $100 new.

I enjoyed the 1st-3rd book in series. Forth book sort of dragged. By the middle of this book I had to make a decision...keep going with an endless supply of boring pages and books ahead or throw in the towel. Let's face it, life's too short.

I just finished it, and book 5 was everything that I could have imagined and more. The only explanation I can think of is that it takes a more mature/experienced reader enjoy amount of detail that Jordan puts into every page. In the Fires of Heaven, Jordan unleashes the best tactical combat scenario of the series, and uses each character to their fullest with the exception of Perrin, which seems to be absent from this book. All in all, an extraordinary effort on Jordan's part. I highly recommend this book/series to anyone who wants to jump-start their imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"I love river stories and this a great story and funny at the same time.

I'd argue that the least interesting thing about it is the actual Top Ten. That's not a surprising list, and considering the math used to get there any Top Ten list by any group of people (from a similar pool in terms of nationality and ethnicity) would look pretty similar.What's fun about this is checking out the individual lists by individual authors. I was often surprised by some of the picks, and actually came away from it with a slightly altered opinion about some of the recommenders. I think it's more interesting to start at the bottom end - the books that only got one recommendation - and move forward from there.Interesting. But it's not meant to be definitive.

As well, he devotes a chapter to the pre-Platonic inception and transformation of the term. His thesis, even 7 years later, is quite radical as it challenges much of the predominant and conventional ways of understanding Plato as a philosopher seeking a science of moral knowledge. He engages with such promiment scholars as Marthat Nussbaum and T. Irwin. Roochnik's book is a significant contribution to the recent attempt to re-appreciate a philosopher so often seen to be a footnote to modern thinking. Finally, anyone interested in the question of technology will find this study worthwhile and very illuminating of the difference between its ancient form and the current understanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"clear but shallow","review":"Roochnik's 20 years of study has revealed a clear but shallow book on Plato; he forges his \\"techne\\" glasses on everything he touches leaving the reader with no clear understanding of what Socratic wisdom consists of.

If you have a chip on your soulder about the church, write about that, but not church history. Also, you misrepresent western monasticism and Saint Benedict, either purposely, or through neglect. Likewise, you misrepresent St. Therese of Lisieux, comparing her with Luther. Are you unaware of her devotion to the Blessed Mother? Mostly, the book is on the politics of the papacy, with a sprinkling of other developments in church history. You don't seem to be outright anti-Catholic, but obviously infected with a lot of negativity, which, unfortunately, overshadows what truth you would present."},{"rating":"1","title":"Editorialized History","review":"This book could be a valuable addition to the student's library if it wasn't for the obvious editorializing which punctuates the chapters and betrays the author's anti-Catholic bias.A much better source for serious study is the more scholarly work: \\"A Concise History of the Catholic Church\\" by Thomas Bokenkotter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rude Customer Service","review":"I was impressed with the online reviews and the specifications of this handy external drive.

Christians and non-Christians alike would be very well served to read this book. My only complaint is that it is written with the assumption that you already believe, to an extent, its main thesis: that Christ's teachings were not exclusivist. I happen to agree with this thesis, but I feel that the book did not argue it thoroughly enough to convince someone who disagrees."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the original?","review":"Emmet Fox wrote the original and it is truly an amazing book. There's nothing wrong with having to read and re-read each paragraph to get the meaning of a text and it can be very satisfying. His writing style is to cover several very complex ideas in one heck of a long sentence with a huge impact, when understood. This \\"Sermon on the Mount According to Vedanta is much clearer and more to-the-point, while still delivering a message that shakes your foundation. I don't know anything about Vedanta, but I do know people who do and I admire their dedication to seeking the truth. Is this version better than the original? No, because it starts from a different place, but it certainly rocked my world and deserves a look if you are a \\"seeker\\" too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeply evocative and spiritually comforting","review":"I'm not the kind of person who generally reads these types of books.

It says a lot about a book and the way the author saw the world, when you can pick it up almost 40 years after it was written and still relate to most of the material as if it were written yesterday.Breakfast of Champions is precisely that type of book. Both hilarious and morose because it's true, Vonegut's masterpiece is a little too down-to-Earth for comfort, as he shamelessly insults the American (and Earthly) way of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling and Nonsensical","review":"Notwithstanding my wife'e love for Vonnegut and his many successful books I struggled through Breakfast of Champions and finished it without having any sense for what it was about.

(Not this edition, I'm thinking of 30 years ago.) I had never seen anything like it: the various measurements, the line drawings, and Kilgore Trout. Is it about pollution and the end of resources? Our obsession with sex? The contemplations of an omniscient narrator? The meaning of categories like \\"science fiction\\" and \\"pornography\\"? Or just another of his wacky stories that turns out to be about what he did and saw in Vietnam and what it did to his later life in New York?I still love this story.

It runs a close second to his inspired \\"Cat's Cradle.\\" The book focuses on a used car salesman slowly going mad, Kilgore Trout, and Vonnegut himself. The book sees the meeting of author and his long-time character Trout. This book was supposed to be Vonnegut's last. Thankfully, it wasn't, it was just one of his best. JW"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vonnegut has no subtlety","review":"I'll admit I only got about 50 pages into this book, so I can't offer the most informed opinion. But from what I read, this book is little more than garbage. I read \\"Cats Cradle\\" and enjoyed it. I didn't agree with everything in it but it was very clever and subtle. This on the other hand, has no subtlety. It reads like the lyrics to a rage against the machine song. Just pure liberal ranting about how everything established in America is wrong. Also, his drawings seem like a cop out, an excuse not to describe something. If you want to read good satire, read Heller, or John Kennedy Toole. This book is a lemon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I feel I must be missing something as there are so many positive reviews for this book. I did not even finish it. All of the reviews say it is smart and funny. I suppose I'm not bright enough and don't have the sense of humor it takes to appreciate this book. To me, it appears to be nonsensical stream of consciousness dribble. Just writing with no real clear direction or organization. I am a fan of Vonnegut's other works. Unfortunately, this one was not for me. I'm not sure what others saw in it that I didn't. Maybe they're just very loyal to Vonnegut. I don't know. I cannot recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with the other 1 star reviews.","review":"Despite what others would have me believe, I do not remember chuckling, much less laughing, at any moment while reading this book. I just kept patiently waiting for a story, or even a point, to surface, but after finishing the Epilogue I didn't find either."},{"rating":"1","title":"so it goes, and so on, and so on...","review":"Kurt Vonnegut is a snake oil salesman. His writing is so pretentious, self-referential, and nihilistic that you can't help but despise Vonnegut personally and despise even more the intellectuals and professors who praise him religiously.Breakfast of Champions is no different than the rest of his work. He randomly inserts inane facts to be funny, like the size of male characters' organs once he introduces them. These can come at any moment, so you have to be prepared for them. The book is extremely vulgar in that the obscenities have no redeeming value. There is no genuine emotion behind them.The plot? There is none that makes any sense. Furthermore, Vonnegut partakes in America bashing for the first 10 pages and comes across as a Communist, which made me nearly put the book down, but I muscled through the rest of it on a long airplane ride.Completely unenjoyable. No redeeming value. One of the worst books I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"No longer relevant","review":"This review is for the audio CD version of the novel. I read the book for the first time 20+ years ago. At the time, we lived in a different world. As a teenager, I thought Vonnegut was cool, and I devoured this novel. 20+ years later, I can no longer stomach it. Back when it was hip to bash American and all it stands for, this book seemed important. I can see now that it is not. Don't bother reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book really IS RACIST","review":"I was sooooooo dissapointed since I am a big fan of Vonnegut's and love his writing style (except in this book), not to mention my favorite character Kilgore Trout. I read some of the reviews and decided to ignore the negative ones since there is so many people out there who clearly miss Vonnegut's point. It is racist, sexist and towards the end he just rambles on pointlessly about things ... that have nothing to do with what he is talking about. I am used to being shocked by Vonnegut but this was too much. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK, it is a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...what a racist book!","review":"One thing about the author is, he loves the \\"n-word\\" and he hates blacks. I never could understand how people who call themselves imaginative creators take such pride in alienating select audiences. Don't you want people to buy the darn book??? You effectively killed your black audience, Kurt. Now, I'm a smart man with a high tolerance for stupidity and wacked opinions and am often able to find art in the sublime. From another black man's promptings, I bought the book and read it. I was disgusted. No doubt, Quentin Tarrantino is clammoring for the rights to make the film. If you don't like blacks and you're the type of person who feels that nobody ever gets your jokes, this \\"book\\" is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"You can tell a novel is by a liberal for liberals when it adds nothing, is odious to the extreme, and tries to be morally superior and morally relativistic at the same time.

(Whether they ever read it is problematic.)But KV's pseudo-intellectual pap offers yet another draw for readers---those who read it can pose as great thinkers merely by praising it with a few big words. Impressive thinkers, they.I must admit that even I saw some deep, dark, hidden meaning in this steaming offal: the large asterisk drawing in the book was obviously the author's self-portrait."},{"rating":"1","title":"SEE THE MOVIE","review":"I didn't read the book, but I saw the movie (which by the way filmed near my hometown). It stars Bruce Willis as the wacky Dwane Hoover. the movie to me was OK"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breakfast of Champions","review":"This was my first experience of Vonnegut.

One of the few books I could read over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"martini anyone?","review":"read this one before cats cradle. i enjoyed this book very much but cats cradle blows it out of the water"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great book about the French Revolution!","review":"France was in revolution at some point, and some bad things happenned; needless to say someone died and some other people probably starved to death.Vonnegut is the Wesley Willis of literature, except not crazy and schizophrenic, and he makes a lot more sense...and isn't dead!This book was great.

Pretentious comes to mind. Vonnegut trying so hard to be a literary genius that he goes the way of Pulp Fiction or Naked Lunch and just tries to make sure it doesn't quite make sense or have a point. Not impressed. For context, I love the books Ishmael, The Fountainhead, The Wheel of Time, Venus in Furs, The God of Small Things..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't get it!","review":"Sorry, I just didn't get it. I liked Slaughter House Five. Vonnegut shows many signs of being a brilliant writer, even though I didn't understand the story. I knew much of it was satire, I just wish I could understand it. Since this is a very simple book to read I would actually recommend it, despite my low score."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not recommend this book","review":"Anyone who thinks 'Breakfast of Champions' is \\"outright hilarious\\" has a strange sense of humor. Not once was I even mildly amused. Was it the crude humor for shock value? The blatant attempts at teaching us lessons about our messed up society? If you are desperate enough to read this book, I recommend just looking at the pictures, that's about as good as it gets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother Wasting Your Time","review":"It's amazing how Kurt Vonnegut has been able to hornswaggle readers for so long; and that he's finally being accepted as genuine literature by the elitist critics and professors demonstrates his thimblerigging proficiency. That said, I will admit \\"Breakfast\\" has the most accessable story of any of his books I've perused. The structure is at least interesting, the way he's managed to chop the narrative into sound bites and nevertheless make it coherent. What first puts one off this novel, though, are his windy pontifications. It seems almost a contradiction in terms to find a nihilist egoist, but somehow Vonnegut manages. I grew tired of the author long before the story itself grew tedious. If you enjoy Vonnegut's smug tendentiousness, I would recommend this book as one of his better efforts. If you're looking for mature fiction, pass by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preface >> Rest of Book","review":"I disliked the book mostly on the way it was written. It was suppose to be funny or something, but I didn't find anything that funny. The part that turned me off was the writing style. Donnie did this Donnie did that, it was cute for a little bit, but I got very tired of it. I am unsure of what Kurt Vonnegut's style usually is, but if it is anything like this, I don't believe I will read another one of his books. I am a fan of ranting, and get to listen to a lot of good ones, but the style got in the way of all the fun. Yeah and it only took like 2 hours to read the entire thing. I normally don't review, but this one bothered me enough to.If you do read books only for the preface, this is your book. I thought the preface was quite entertaining...too bad it wasn't longer and the entire plot of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pokes fun at Magazine Scfi","review":"Sarcastic take on the perception of early magazine scfi writing before Vonnegut moves onto other stuff. Strong on irony and as it written in 1973 quite environmental as well. Appeals to my twisted humour anyhow - best judged by reading the Sirens of Titan.Story: Dysfunctional society and how some make it, and others go crazy seen though Dwayne, a car dealer and Kilgore Trout famous author to two fans on a trip to an arts festival across America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avid reader","review":"I have read every work Vonnegut has written, and this is by far one of his best works. The characters are all very real, and allow the readers to get to know them. Illustrated by Vonnegut himself, this book is definately easy to read, yet hard to put down. The main character, Kilgore Trout, a Vonnegut favorite (perhaps Vonnegut himslef?) appears in yet another tale. As an aside, some of the books Vonnegut describes that Trout wrote, would make excellent sci-fi books. I'm surprised Vonnegut (or some literary plagarist or hack) hasn't expounded on any of the themes. The book is great, and if any reader has never read Vonnegut, this is a great one to start with. You'll be hooked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Breakfast of Champions is far and away the best book I have ever read! I would recommend it to anyone, especially those who have never read Vonnegut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breakfast of Runner Ups....","review":"This novel is one of Vonnegut's more acclaimed works, although I would say, in my un-experted opinion, that The Sirens of Titan, Mother Night, and Hocus Pocus are better in many ways than Breakfast of Champions. Sure, Breakfast has many comical sections, however, it fails to answer any real question about human nature, other than the fact that we are innately dumb. The plot twists and turns, leading the reader through Vonnegut's \\"reality\\" of modern day society using Kilgore Trout and a used car salesmen as tour guides. Vonnegut plays on all aspects of society, from race, to industrialization, to the fragility of the human mind, and finally to the ability and far reaching possibilities of the imagination. Breakfast is witty and comical, but I recommend some of his other novels if you are looking for the better side of Vonnegut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Vonnegut","review":"This is a good book. I'm rating this five stars because I got it at a great price and it arrived earlier than I expected. It's in great condition and I'm happy I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long but unique","review":"A very good read, never read anything quite like it. Way too long if you ask me but the first half is great. Then Vonnegut kind of gives you more of the same. Read it and make up your own mind, you are sure to laugh a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truely excellent book","review":"Vonnegut, justly nicknamed one of the greatest satirists of the time, is truely magnificent in this book. 'Breakfast' proves to be a terrifyingly accurate description of society while at the same time is so obscure and comical... I enjoyed his style very much, especially towards the end of this book when Vonnegut introduced himself into the story. Anyone can benefit from reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing compared to his other work.","review":"Though I typically find KV's books very entertaining, this one just didn't do much for me for the first 9/10 of it. Vonnegut usually has some phrase or idea he repeats extensively in his novels; you may remember \\"ting-a-ling\\" or \\"So it goes\\"; well, in this novel, which is excessively badly pornographic in passing, Vonnegut feels the need to tell you the size of every male character's member upon introduction; It really doesn't serve any central purpose to the story.Two of the key characters, Rabo and Kilgore, are served up much more fascinatingly and entertainingly in other books. He also includes a TON of drawings, which are only necessary maybe one fifth of the time. I guess I believe he has a problem with moderation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Breakfast of Champions is one of my favorite Vonnegut novels. His works are poignant, hilarious,honest and page turningly addictive (when I have kids I'm so making them read Vonnegut)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This being my first ever experience with Vonnegut, I don't think I was ready for the incredible words written within it(not to mention the pictures drawn). This book not only made me more interested in other Vonnegut novels, but also changed the way I looked at the craft of writing and the way I look at the world.In between bouts of gut-busting laughter, I found insights into the human race, society, politics, sex, and lonliness which were all very well expressed and honest. Vonnegut shows all that is egregious in America and the world, and presents it to us in a humourous way. Read this book...it may change your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves six stars!","review":"Probably the funniest book I've ever read. Vonnegut always has something worthwhile to say, but this is probably his best work ever! A must-read for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"it was really, really swell...","review":"Don't waste time reading some pretentious, pompous, and all together boring review of BOC--just read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Medley of Vonnegut","review":"Breakfast of Champions is a gift Vonnegut gave to himself, granting him power over his characters and the ability to spit out some of his views by way of ultra-analysis. Vonnegut's style is dripping throughout the pages, an irreverant showcase of wit and perspective.Some of the work IS dated, but the clever viewpoints and wit still remains. His style of explaining things, such as fried chicken, completely and honestly, is amazingly addictive. If this novel were better editted (with Vonnegut's style, some things fail) it would earn from me that fifth star.Better than Slaughterhouse-Five in my oppinion. Read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good but I'm guessing there is better","review":"This was my first Kurt Vonnegut book. For a first it was good but not great. I'm sure that if I had read other books and understood all of the references it would've been better..."},{"rating":"2","title":"What are words to say about this book? Life changing.","review":"From the time I was in high school and given the opportunity to read one of Vonnegut's books, I was inspired. My view of the world was and still is changed. This BOC or \\"Blue Monday\\" is an eye-opening, shocking, and truthful book of a picture of our society post-Vietnam. KV is a true philosopher and honest fellow of our century. Not only is this book wonderful, the characters and the side stories for each of them are captivating for the reader. Once you read BOC or any of KV's novels, you will become enchanted and hooked.KV changed my life and put into words so many abstract thought I could never had vocalized on my own. I never met the man before he passed, but in my eyes and my heart, I know him as the man who gave me something to believe in. Other People."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"This is the first Vonnegut book I have read, and I was blown away. 'Breakfast of Champions' definitely belongs among the list of books that will change the way you think about everything. On top of that, 'Breakfast' is a light meal that split my sides and made me burst out laughing more than once. Paradoxically, however, its subject is the meaning of the Universe, and you can't get much heavier than that.Read it in one sitting, and you won't regret it. (Unless you happen to be like these other blokes who wrote negative reviews of this book. To those people, I have one sentence for you: Go back to Fairy Land -- and take your KFC and Pontiacs with you.)God bless you, Mr. Vonnegut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I am a grade 11 student and I had to read this book for an assignment.

At first,I found the narrative a bit pedantic but then it really started to work for me. \\"Hardly(anything) is sacred\\",Vonnegut writes in the foreward.,and while reading his pot-shots of all things (absurdly) American you realize he's right. One of the best satires that I've ever come across.."},{"rating":"2","title":"breakfast of \\"champions\\"?","review":"Many times one reads a book for an intricate plot and brilliant character development. Breakfast of Champions does not quite live up to these conditions, but it is the amazing wit and poignancy of Vonnegut which really makes this book a must read. Whether it is about racial prejudice, economic lust, the problems with American society, or simply the stupidity and ridiculousness of the average person's life, Vonnegut has something to say. As an American who knows what it is like to live in a society that is overwhelmed by ignorance and greed, I advise those who have not realized the true state of the country to read this book and to contemplate their previous beliefs. Social satire is utilized at its best in this worthwhile book which I recommend wholeheartedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my Top Ten Favourite Books.","review":"I think what stands the most about this book, after all these years, is the intrepid, and literal, author intrusion throughout the story. Vonnegut's cameo character near the end was both unpredictible and welcomed. Truly a brilliant book--and one of the few I truly blame for getting me to write my own. --Darren Jame"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm baffled.","review":"I really meant one star, but I didn't want to be immediately labeled as one of those idiots who gives great books a 1 merely because everyone else threw 5's. Breakfast of Champions, though, was self-indulgent, insubtle, rambling drivel that does not deserve any of the applause which people have so eagerly and richly supplied it with. The attempted irony in the book is distorted and monstrously misapplied. I groaned at each new meaningless illustration or transparent and overwrought attempt at novel, unorthodox narration. The whole book is directed at the lowest common denominator. Style over substance. I admire Vonnegut, and have enjoyed his other works, but Breakfast of Champions belongs in the same trash bin with A Prayer for Owen Meany (John Irving's only garbage novel, yet it is tremendously loved)."},{"rating":"1","title":"lagsalot","review":"Vonnegut's anti-modern world narcissism is a boring journey into little minds.

As a result, I subsequently really question this person's credibility. This is one of the most pointless, self-indulgent, absolutely unnecessary books I've ever read.

His best role till date. Would have been greeat to have seen him develop the character in the sequels. And furthermore, James Earl Jones aka the voice of Darth Vader makes his presence in all 3 movies felt though his air time's brief.

And, the quality was consistent throughout: I didn't notice any sudden grainy-ness in some shots like with the recent Indiana jones blu, etc. if you love the film, or don't yet own it on DVD, then I recommend this blu ray.

The compression scheme leaves other scenes so pixelated it looks like you're watching the movie over the internet.

Despite an excellent cast, including some small roles for quite well-known actors, this film just didn't seem to work. I haven't watched it enough timesa to remember what it's about, because it's just too boring. Maybe, there are one or two small tense moments in the film, but not many. I thought the jump from the helicopter to the sumbmarine scene waas good and the last ten minutes were quite good, but I feel the action gets rushed.But, if you like submarine movies you will like this.

It there any information you can provide regarding this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible transfer to BluRay","review":"Not commenting in ANY way on the movie itself, this is a terrible transfer to BluRay. As noted by other reviews, the audio remix is awful. Very often, ambient noises overpower dialog. When you go from an action sequence which is loud, to dialog, you need to turn the volume up, and then turn it back down when action resumes. I spent the whole movie with the remote in hand. An example being early in the movie when the Russian sailors are signing on the Red October. You go from the Dallas with the radar operator hearing singing, to the bridge with the signing, and Sam Neil and Sean Connery talking. The volume difference is way too much.Video quality gets a little better, but the DVD was already pretty good. Overall, this is a terrible transfer and not worth any money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for a Clancy movie","review":"I am a fan of Tom Clancy somewhat but it seems when his books are made into movies there is something seriously wrong with them. THFRO of course has some discrepancies with the novel but it's still an enjoyable movie IMHO. I was at one time a submariner so I know where the realism ends and fiction begins in regard to subs and the cast is great as well. If you're a fan of Clancy, military strategy, or would simply like to hear Connery do a semi-poor Russian accent then I would recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"very poor quality, one dot very slow to buffer as well, as well as random stops to buffer some ."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hunt for Red October.","review":"An outstanding story, one in fact that I watch over and over, every few months, as I do with with so many of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic thriller of a film, well done story all together.","review":"If you like action and a really good flim to watch this is it! great flim. a classic movie to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Love this movie.

Grrrr..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie. Average Download.","review":"The movie itself is awesome, but these reviews aren't about the movie but the package they come in. The digital download package is below average. While the streaming and PC download may get by, the portable video file is horrendous. You should really be given the option to decide how large the mobile file is. If your video screen is larger than 3 inches expect to be extremely disappointed.You're really better off buying the blu-ray and encoding the file yourself. PC blu-ray readers are going as low as $30, after all.Amazon's DRM system is also draconian and a huge pain. While it's probably the movie industry's fault more than Amazon's, Amazon did agree to it didn't they?In short, avoid purchasing the download versions unless you don't mind sub-average quality, 2 downloads for the PC and 2 downloads for your portable device. Just avoid it entirely so perhaps the consumers can force the industry to grow a brain and stop hurting the hands that feed them."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS THE BEST FILM OF ALL TIME","review":"Well, maybe not the BEST, but certainly my favourite. I have probably seen The Hunt For Red October 20 times, can call every line and still enjoy it. Nobody can deny that the last 20 minutes are seriously suspenseful. If you haven't seen this movie - you need to. I now own three versions of it and the Collector's DVD is by far the best - the transfer is great and the soundtrack (well done in its own right - I own that too) is far better presented than on the old DVD edition. I cannot stress how much I like this movie - buy it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best sub film ever!","review":"I can't think of a better sub movie than The Hunt for Red October. It has great under water affects and a great story line. While I did find ONE inaccuracy on the capabilites of a submarine, it was just one. This movie was far better than Crimson Tide, due to the fact that Red October was more about submarines. Crimson Tide was about nuclear war and would have had the same affect taking place in a 1950s missile silo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie","review":"I liked everything bout this movie.

Maybe Clancy got his idea from those events!If you like naval history, submarines, and good action flicks, you're in for a treat with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great submarine film, comrades","review":"Life on a submarine is cramped, dull, and tough. In a film, submarines can either make for a dull film or a great film. This is one of the great ones.The characters are fairly well developed. There are numerous stars in here: Sean Connery (of course), who plays the best role in the film, Alec Baldwin, James Earl Jones, Sam Niel (my favourite!), Tim Curry, and some others.But the best part of the film is in its storyline. It is a basic story but with a suspenseful and interesting plot.I guess that's really all I can say about this film. There's no specific thing that I like about this film; it's just good."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Old tigers are at their fiercest when it is time for them to die\\"","review":"The above quote is spoken by the master, Sean Connery, in THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN, a film released well after this one, but it sums up his acting career as it has drawn near to its close. This may well be his best of them all. A fine script and excellent performances by a brilliant ensemble cast, including Sam Neil, Tim Curry, Alec Baldwin and James Earl Jones doesn't hurt. If you blink you'll miss her, but there is also a brief appearance by Gates McFadden, Star Trek TNG's strikingly beautiful, red-headed doctor and a personal favorite of mine.

While the sound of the DVD nicely met expectations, I found the video quality of the DVD version disappointing...color saturation was anemic in many places, downright poor in a few.

Overall, the DVD menus are fine (though lacking in any sort of comprehensive background material which would be expected with a DVD that carries a label of \\"Special Edition\\"). The audio is also fine; however, even that should have received the DTS treatment rather than just the Dolby Digital.The main crime committed against this film was the horrendous film-to-DVD transfer as it is presented. Frankly, with the sheer graininess and tendencies towards pixelization, I can't help but think that this is a VHS-to-DVD transfer. Not even a pristine VHS tape, but one that has been played daily for over 10 years! The video quality of this transfer is the worst I've seen of any movie in a very long time. Shame on the production company that made this transfer!This great movie deserved a lot better (Special Edition???) than what it got!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good starter map","review":"I bought this map on Amazon and it was a good basic starter map for our 10 day trip to Kauai.

However, if you really want to travel around Kauai and are going to be looking for specific streets, you need something much more detailed then this map has to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest","review":"With apologies to the author -- I've been to Kauai many times, and this is the one map I would not have taken into my car.

A part of Voivod died when Blacky left...but the final nail in the coffin was the departure of Snake on vocals.

Death Metal does not fit in with the Voivod profile and should not sound this way. This album is too different from the previous albums with Snake and Blacky. Eric Forrest is a joke!

It works well as some other reviewers on other sites have said up to around 6k packets, after which packet loss starts to increase. Additionally you can find analysis of this switch online showing blocking after about 4.5k packets, with a performance cliff around 7k packets. This is exactly what I saw, and would cause my fairly expensive Intel e1000 NIC to reset its own port back to 100 mbps. According to what I've found online there are actually two models, so it could be this problem is only with the original model (which I purchased in 2007). Anyway, I replaced this switch with a managed gigabit dlink switch and now have no problems.

It pretty much served as a really long public service announcement. Now the show has gotten ridiculous!! This person is having sex with this person. The younger sister is trying to hook up with the father of her nephew. The boy who was supposedly so in love with Amy got another girl pregnant!! I mean come on. So now the show is pretty much saying that getting pregnant at 16 isn't so bad. Granted not the worst thing that could happen but 16 is too young to become a parent in my opinion. The show needs to make its point and be done with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great corded phone","review":"This phone has worked out great for us, the only problem being that I could wish it was cordless. Unlike previous reviewers, I haven't noticed any squealing noises or in fact any problems at all with the sound (maybe those who have noticed this should take their phones back and exchange them). It has a ringer control volume, with settings Hi - Lo - Off, which was key for not waking the baby during her nap. It has three instant-dial buttons (M1, M2, M3), and space for storing 10 more numbers (accessed by pressing Memory + digit). My only complaint (other than wishing it was cordless) is that it eats batteries. It takes 4 AA batteries, and I have to change them about 3 times a year. That's as often as my digital camera!

First off, a minor flaw is that it is hard to pick up the reciever as it is locked in there, I don't like that. Another flaw is that while you are picking up and putting back the phone, it makes a VERY high and LOUD screaming pitch. This makes it almost deafening for someone on another phone in the house.

That being said, I am glad that I went ahead with my plan to read the book, as it has much to offer. Especially interesting to me is the historical account of the making of Key West, the Spanish War, life in China during the Japanese invasion, and World War II intrigue.

So bad, it reminded me of the movie \\"Pearl Harbor\\" from ten years (or so) ago, in that the viewer can tell there was a great deal of money spent to create the special effects and pay the salaries of the big-time stars in it. However, the script, directing, and overacting ruins this film. I believe that some of the stars in it are undoubtedly embarrassed they agreed to do it.How to describe it?

Nevermind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow, Unrealistic, Immature","review":"The two main characters--Hemingway (Clive Owen) and Gelhorn ( Nicole Kidman) are supposedly supporters of the poor commoners of Spain, yet they are portrayed as royalty themselves. This is evident in the very first scene in the bar. It's as if the proles in the bar are ignorant dirtbags who defer worshipfully to the superior wit, intelligence and physical beauty of the two main characters.

If you already have all the books ever created on human anatomy that are needed to put together the information that is required to have a comprehensive knowledge on how the human body is constructed and moves then get this to finish your collection, but if you are looking for a clear understanding and accurate information on human anatomy for the artist look elswhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE, VERY POOR REPRODUCTIONS","review":"I have several Bridgman books, and I absolutely love him.

It also is somehow made with inferior machining (or mine are bad luck) because for 1st time this one doesn't provide steady light, but occasionally flickers a bit like the connections are iffy. Which is more irritating than it may seem. Not like a candle, more like a constant reminder to swat your head and see if the thing gets fixed.

The camera only comes with a partial owner's manual and to obtain the full length version you have to download it from the CD and it is 103 pages long. Another problem is the batteries discharged in a couple of days although the camera was in the off mode. If you buy a PDR-M60 be sure to immediately buy some rechargeable batteries and a charger and an AC adapter as battery life is very short when you connect the camera to your computer.

The camera has 2 reoccuring problems. First, the tabs in the battery compartment are weak. Extreme care must be taken opening and closing the compartment to prevent wear and breakage. Second, the mode dials on these cameras fall off in normal use. The plastic pins which hold it in place break off no matter how gently used. Toshiba has stopped supporting the camera with replacement parts. If the dial falls off outside the warranty window, your only option will be to trade the camera in for a refurbished camera. The price of the trade is not justifiable considering the problems, and you will be better off buying a new camera from someone besides Toshiba.

You can take plenty of pictures at the BEST resolution.(about 1meg/pic.)I printed my pictures at home on a Epson Stylus Photo 870 and you can't tell them appart from 35mm pictures.

Buy it from......After all of the additional expenses, I used the camera and was really delighted with the results. It is very easy to use and I don't mind having the manual on disk.

It does picture the beginnings of modernization in old Tahiti, while hearkening back to earlier times when the only way to Papeete was by boat. A keen insight into the reactions of the Polynesians to the modern world and the beginnings of a hybrid culture that moved from gratis open-sensuality to tourist profiteering, with some rousing tales of an assortment of adventure-seeking free-spirits who sought their own unsullied Eden. The reader is left with the impression that it might have been better if the jets had never arrived and the French had never come--then again--who can keep the handsome beauty of Tahiti from the rest of the world.

Bad things - the story of the book did not happen in the order it made it seem like on the cover. Typical Hannah. The jacket says that Angie and Lauren would go through this big thing and I was hoping it wouldn't be the cliche (I don't want to totally give it away, but you can get the clues from the jacket).

Through mistakes and unfortunate circumstances, situations we cannot control~just live through ~ Krising Hannah once again moves us with her words and lets us see that love finds a way every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Things We Do for Love","review":"Story line was okay but was disappointed with the ending. End of story was somewhat unrealistic; however, the author did a good job of building the story and then I felt like I was left hanging and expected a better closure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Egh... Not very good","review":"I wouldn't recommend this book. There wasn't much of a climax to it, just kinda kept going on and on. A bit predictable as well. Of course the teen living with her would get pregnant, it's kind of a given in a book like this. I also felt like it was unrealistic that she was able to save a failing restaurant so easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"***Spoiler Alert**** Tugs at your heartstrings","review":"Lauren and Angie, the two main characters have very tragic backgrounds. Lauren was born to a teenage mother, who the readers will learn to hate after a while. Lauren is completely on her own, and then the unspeakable happens with her boyfriend, who is a doll. I can't tell you about Angie without completely giving up the plot. All in all this book really tugs at your heartstrings, as both main characters are broken individuals when the book starts out. The plot was a bit predicatable, but if you don't mind that you shouldn't mind this book. I love Kristin Hannah, and The Things We Do For Love doesn't disappoint. Highly Recommended! The title is very fitting to the story too, which is unusual."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read........","review":"Kristen Hannah has given us another wonderful, touching story to read and enjoy. I'm already looking forward to reading her next book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of a good summer day!","review":"My library has a cart out in front where you can pick up and drop off a book without checking it out- that's where I picked this one up and I sure am glad I didn't pay for it. I thought this book was awful. It was formulaic, moralistic, and full of caricatures and stereotypes. Kristin Hannah really missed an opportunity to write a genuine book about the pain and frustration of infertility. I have never read any of her books before this one and will not again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.","review":"Cant even really tell what the book looks like. Place my order 23 days ago and have not even received yet.

Hopefully will get that lucky, huh? ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Things We Do for Love","review":"I found this book to be very enjoyable. It held my interest and kept me questioning the whole time. I do think you will enjoy it also."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Easy Choices","review":"Kristin Hannah's book, What We Do For Love, is an inspirational look at the issues of love, faith, and teenage pregnancy.Seventeen year old Lauren Ribido had her future all mapped out. She'd carefully crafted a life to help her reach the lofty goals of a good job, love, marriage and children. In that order. When life steps in with other plans, Lauren has to make decisions that could have repercussions for the rest of her life.Angie Malone is struggling to find her way back to love, family and peace of heart after a series of life's difficulties. Returning home to her widowed mother and sisters may save her, or break her.These two women need each other in ways they'd never imagined. Healing old hurts and finding answers to a future neither wants is what makes this story a good, solid read. I'd highly recommend What We do for Love to anyone who enjoys women's fiction with a reality bite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"This book was such a worthwhile read. I was looking for a book and came across this on my Amazon account and thought I would give it a try. What a wonderful choice. It was one of those books that you feel sad when it is over as the characters are so well developed that you become immersed in the storyline. In the end, you feel like you are walking away from \\"friends\\" instead of just ending a good book.I always enjoy books that have some kinds of happy messages that are relatable and take you to a place in your heart that life sometimes scars. It is a beautiful story of love and family.Although the storyline is a little too perfect, it is nice to sometimes read about bad events that end in a happy outcome.I very much recommend this book for someone who is looking for an easy enjoyable read that will leave you feeling good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Things We do for Love","review":"I stumbled onto Kristin Hannah's books as it was listed as a suggestion. This is my 16th in her books that I have read and each one is wonderful He reminds me of Nicholas Sparks, one of my favorite authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty cool CD","review":"Generally, I do not like compilation albums. They always have a bunch of [junk] along with one or two cool songs in there that I don't necessarily want to listen to. But I gave Global Hits a chance yesterday when it came out and it actually manages to be a CD that I can play the whole way through. Dance hits such as IIO's \\"Rapture\\" and Modjo's \\"Lady (Hear Me Tonight) are awesome club songs. People I have never even heard of, like Sylver and Ian Van Dahl are cool and even Craig David's on the CD, which I found really impressive. There are some songs which become a little overbearing such as Superman Lovers who's got a really annoying song on it, and that [darn] ATC song \\"La La La La\\" which gets played way too much. But the fact that Daft Punk's \\"One More Time\\" is on there makes it all worth it. I wouldn't say every dance music lover will like this CD, but it's really fun and poppy and hell, I like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A LOT of old stuff....2002??","review":"This album has a lot of good music. Problem is most of it has a lot of songs that have been out for more than a year or two. Not very current, then again no US compilation is."},{"rating":"2","title":"The master","review":"If I had a time machine, one of the first things I'd go see would be John Hammond's 1938 \\"Spirituals to Swing\\" concert. I would have given anything to be able to see Sonny Terry alone on the Carnegie Hall stage with just his harp.This album is about as close as we'll get to that wonderful image. With minimal guitar accompaniment, Sonny showed here why'd I'd rather listen to people like him than any other harmonica player you could name. Sonny Terry may not have had the musical dexterity of some later(OK, white)harp players. He may not have played the harp like Charlie Parker played the sax. But his music had something in back of it that was far more important. Real life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great entertainment for fans","review":"This DVD was fun to watch. My husband and I are big Disciple fans and this was funny and entertaining. The seller was also very curteous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, but overpriced","review":"Okay book if you wish to go with no glue, no staples etc. Feel overpriced in listed sources.

Good luck for those who desire acopy of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Techno-thriller Nail Biter","review":"Tim Rizzi has written a terrific military techno-thriller in Eagles of Fire. The plot synopsis given above is accurate so I won't repeat it here. The characterizations vary between 2D and 3D, with Gen. Duke James as the most fully realized member of the cast. Rizzi has done something quite unusual for this genre (one to which I am devoted despite my better judgment), which is even the odds between the armed forces of Good and Evil. Bad things happen to Good People and good things happen to Bad People. I am looking forward to the sequel (so many ends are left loose that there must be one in the offing) with eager anticipation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously SUCKS","review":"You may as well throw your money directly down the drain, at least that'd save you some time. When I opened the box upon getting home, i was astonished to find it was simply a fan over a container for water! Despite my initial misgivings, I decided to try the product overnight and to no surprise, it did NOTHING towards humidifying the room. Its a waste of money and electricity."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would rate it at zero as in DONT BUY THIS","review":"Not a good design for a humidifier. There is no mist and the water really doesnt get used up as the others say. Holmes should be sued by somebody if they dont recall this product and give compensation for people like myself. I used this on a DRRRRRRRRY wintry night for my kids and there was no relief for them from the cough they had. I called the number that was given on the product (for Important Use and Care Information) and all I got was an automated voice to which I had to give all my address and phone no. information and after doing almost all of it I couldnt get it to understand my last name and it wouldnt let me get the IMPORTANT use and care instructions! Of course, I am returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.","review":"I just bought this, and I completely agree with the other reviews. this is completely worthless... I would do a better job by just flicking water into the air with my hands. If you are thinking about buying this, either save your money and just drape wet towels around the room to evaporate (it works better than this useless thing) or buy something else. I returned this and bought the crane frog humidifier and it was great, for about $12 more."},{"rating":"1","title":"It does humidify, but loudly and not a lot","review":"This one works with water evaporation through a sponge inside, and a cheap, noisy fan at the top draws the somewhat moist air up and out. A much better choice is a humidifier that works ultrasonically, which is very quiet and puts out a lot more moisture. The vibrating membrane that creates the mist does get clogged over time with minerals if you have hard water. It can be cleaned to a point, but eventually it might stop misting. Small rooms may get too humid with the ultrasonic types. We have a Holmes HM495 that works very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Simply\\" wonderful.","review":"I'm sorry the others haven't had a good experience with this model. Our experience has been great! I took this out of storage eight hours ago, inserted a clean filter and turned it on low. The waterline is down an inch already. (The humidifier is still on low.) We've been through several types and models of humidifiers. Don't let the simplicity of this one fool you: it works well. One note: It's probably safest to use it with distilled water. The same holds true for ultrasonic humidifiers. Otherwise minerals are dispersed in the air as well as humidity. Steam vaporizers don't warrant distilled water, but they present burn risks if used with children, the elderly or clumsy adults.The best feature of this humidifier: It is simple to clean, and cleaning is so critical to the healthy use of humidifiers. Water basin, filter and a fan. What else were you expecting from a humidifier?"},{"rating":"1","title":"good price, bad product","review":"My husband and I purchased this and within two weeks the filter had mold growing on it despite daily care. When I called the company, they only told me to purchase a new filter and also buy some kind of water treatment product. This is a waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"I agree with the other reviewers- this unit doesn't humidify at all. Our room is pretty small and I don't notice a difference. The reservoir doesn't empty... even running for two days straight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the faint of heart","review":"This is a wonderful book, as is its prequel, Jerry of the Islands. It's a great dog story. But be warned, if a child is to read this book it should be under the guidance of an adult prepared to explain the extremely racist characters and situations. The story is no fluffy puppy story. It is exciting, the locations exotic, but some of the situations are brutal - it's a Jack London story after all, and the 'N' word appears at least a million times. Still, I'm not one for censorship, and it is a great opportunity to talk about just what happened to people of color, how they were treated, and why they might be justifiably angry about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"life through the eyes of a dog","review":"JL was great at writing from the animal's point of view. you get the feeling he knew what he was talking about. there is no way you can read this book without feeling that the dog is a person, but also that this is a very realistic way of describing the dog's life. a dog gets kidnapped by a man, who turns out to be a rather nice fellow. adventure in this story, great dog psychology which always amazes me. i won't give away the dog's adventures but they are interesting, there is a lot of lovely details and particularly detailed descriptions of how the dog thinks, and the story is touching on a very human level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all as advertised.","review":"I just re-read the description, and the above seat cover description is a gross misrepresentation.

Some don't even have a picture of the project. A better title is \\" Some stuff we built on Monster Garage\\".

The attempt to cover so many bases at once causes it to fall short in all of them. Being a Monster Garage publication one might reasonably expect it focus on custom cars, but it frequently digresses with such projects as a tool caddy and bizarrely, a log splitter. Further, if there was less emphasis on the stars of the custom car industry and more on the \\"how to\\" this would be a much better buy. As it is, it doesn't even make the grade as a Monster Garage souvenir book as Monster Garage barely makes a mention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading title","review":"I checked this book out from my local library with the hopes of gaining some useful info on metalwork techniques.

I'm not sure if the author has built any really useful add-ins either. There's certainly a market for a good book on it, but this isn't it. FWIW, I have the same author's book on programming Word, and I didn't find that any more useful than the online documentation, so perhaps this author just needs to get more into the material and then share what he learns. This book is probably too short, and perhaps the space to properly expound on the material was limited by the publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Intro, waiting for Part 2 ..... I guess.","review":"With great excitement I purchased this book, when thumbing through it in the store it looked really promising. It truly does give alot more information than MS does, but it still leaves you confused a bit. The object models are shrugged off to very little commentary and figuring out the complexities of manipulating objects within a large program is not even touched. I had hoped that this topic had finally gotten serious consideration, it appears that this was only meant to be an intro book. I would highly recommend it if you only want to know what an add-in is, but if you want to do some serious programming with addins, you'll need alot more than this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear, concise and to the point","review":"Like others, I purchased this book because I was tired of screwing up my face at the pathetic Microsoft documentation.Dr. Roman's explanations and sample code got right to the heart of the matter.

Naturally, this lead me to believe that this book would be just as good. It wasn't.I try to suggest other books in my reviews, but there aren't many that cover this exact topic.

Distant from his father, Munch finds sustenance in a short-lived affair with Mrs. Heiberg (Fraas), a married woman from whom he draws inspiration.

Now the bad part: you might be asking why did I rated only four stars. I'll tell you why: because I'm sure that there are many more fantastic scenes that were not included in this release. In my opinion everything should be released at once: rehearsals, the 6 complete live performances, etc. I'm only 20 years old but I knew I lot of older people who didn't have the oportunity to watch this fantastic movie. In 1970 Elvis is better than ever, I can't see any reason to hold the footages of the best of the best.

The Special edition is excellent both sound and picturewise.The Theatrical version is just horrible. The sound recording level is extremely low (you'll need either very sensitive speakers or a very powerful amplifier to get normal volume). Also, bass is practically nonexistent, and it's mono too. This sounds worse than old VHS versions. Picture quality is also inferior to the Special edition. All in all, the widescreen laserdisc sadly remains the best way to view the Theatrical version.The outtakes are interesting, but they are too plagued by the very low recording level. The sound on them is much worse than on official or bootleg cd's. Picture quality varies, and is generally poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elvis great - package poor","review":"If you already have the previous special edition do not buy this. The first disc duplicates exactly that release. The 2nd disc whilst having a few interesting extras is the original release.

The range of his voice, the work he would put into a show, the perfection he demanded are all there. I came away thinking what a tragic hero to have died the way he did.

Followed by lots of laughter. It may as well have been bleeped out. When this movie was on TV in Canada years ago, the sound was great and one could hear everything. Everything! I was hoping the live Little Sister would include Get Back, but no, we are sadly disappointed. Again! Maybe someone in the know could tell us just exactly what outtakes are being held 'in the can' and why. Is Elvi$ still the meaning of Elvis? Elvis On Tour in our future?

It would be acceptable if the only flaw was that performances look as though they were shot in Super-8. But what really ruins this movie is that for some unknowable reason the filmmaker inter-spliced positively banal and truly boring interviews throughout, with the most peculiar Elvis fans a person could find. An example: We're treated to watching to English fans ride around on a bicycle that Elvis donated to their fan club. The interview segments have the inadvertent effect of making Elvis fans look absurd and making the rest of us wonder what could be wrong with a star who has such pallid followers. It's just too bad that these otherwise wonderful performances are marred by such bad judgement and lack of direction on the part of the filmmaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful picture and sound quality--needs remastering!","review":"Elvis fans waited a long time to get this on DVD.

Unfortunately this was not my experience with YELLOW DOG. I felt at times he was trying to emulate Burroughs' cut-and-paste technique with the plot, but I didn't empathize enough with the characters to want to go back and retrace my steps.

Sorry, Martin, but you lost me on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written for the Dogs","review":"Martin Amis' Yellow Dog is essentially an unreadable, pretentious, and painful book. You'd have to be a masochist to go beyond page 23, and believe me, I tried but the sheer confusion and boredom brought quick sleep to my eyes. Amis wants to become this century's James Joyce what with supposed innovative use of verbs for nouns and adjectives for verbs. He attempts to play with language the way a child plays with the mud that has formed in front of his cottage after a day or two of rain, and then comes back to the clean kitchen. The sad effect is the same. Get real, dear Martin, for God's sake. I turned blue in the face trying to make head or tails out of this dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my first 5 star review","review":"I don't know why people (including Amis fans) were so down on this when it came out.

Their latest record in particular should make American punk, garage and hard rock folks hang their heads in shame. This is a great album - heavy without being metal, raucous without being sloppy, superenergized without being punk. Plus they're fully cognizant of both halves of the equation for great rock 'n' roll: great guitar riffs + great songwriting. Real songs, kids, with melodies, lyrics, brains, etc., not just excuses for guitar solos or screaming one's brains out.

Payin'the Dues followed with stronger production and tighter song writing. Grande Rock the latest full album may have some of the writing talent but lacks any of the beer swilling ear splitting excess of their earlier efforts; let's face it this is all Kiss and no Motorhead. A more recommendable release would be Disappointment Blues, a compilation of some of their b-side and compilation material where they do indeed cover Motorhead's 'Speedfreak' to perfection. May The Hellacopters rise again after this flat record like a burning, blaring Phoenix!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as previous albums.","review":"The Hellacopters have cleaned up their sound. Gone is the is the processing on the vocals, and the distortion on the guitars is much lower. As a result, the sound is less harder and less interesting.Commercial sellout?

This doesn't hold a candle to them. The singer can't sing, they don't write catchy lyrics, and the lyrics sounds too influenced from the singer's Entombed days. And even the album title and cover lack creativity. Check out the new Tight Bro's From Way Back When album for real rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the MC5/Stooges Sound","review":"I've never read so much hype about a band before and then been as disappointed as I was when I listened to this album. I keep hearing the comparisons to the MC5 and Stooges. And I keep reading about the Detroit Rock mentality and Trans-Love Energies. However, when I got this over-produced slick sounding CD filled with highly polished guitar rock, I discovered that this band is much more akin to bad Van Halen, or some poop that a guy like Vince Neil might release.Perhaps they used to sound like the MC5, and have the energy and soul of the Stooges. Maybe one of their other relases has that sound. Not this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice pictures rotten cd","review":"This CD needs some work.

It started off well - an independent, smart woman, and a smart but arrogant lord. She'll change him, right?Wrong. For the ENTIRETY of the book, she gets mad at him, plans to tell him how she feels, and somehow can't keep a coherent thought whenever he's around. So they have drawn out sex - and then the scene changes. Why doesn't she ask him after they get the physical stuff out of their system? Argh! He stays arrogant the whole time, and she accepts \\"he's arrogant but I love him anyway\\" instead of \\"I finally got him to admit I'm a valid person too.\\"All in all, I'll probably keep this book around because it's by Stephanie Laurens and I have the rest of hers, but it's not going to my \\"read this again\\" pile. Her Cynster books are much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Had Potential","review":"This book had a lot of potential. In the beginning the heroine Kit, was very funny and I loved her wicked side. She was one of the first historical heroines that I read, who was sure of her sexuality. The book was off to a great start, but half way through it just died. Kit lost her vivaciousness and wild streak. I ended up skimming through the end. I recommend this book though, because the beginning of their relationship was a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not Laurens' best","review":"Oh, dear. So many people recommended this book, saying that they had delayed reading it because of the cheesy title, but it was wonderful. In a word, no.Sure, Laurens is the queen of the panting, highly explicit sex scene, but this book took even that to the point of ridiculousness. Not that that's too hard to do. My biggest beef with this book is that the strong, independent heroine became a total wimp every time the hero came near her. Their relationship was about sex not love; I can't see them making it as a lifetime couple. Jack always has to have the upper hand and Kit always gives in the moment he touches her.Silly.The first books in the Cynster series are Laurens' best -- you know, the ones before she starts getting repetitious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very HOT!

I wish I could have got into the plot - smuggling. I didn'tfind that to be very exciting. I did like the rest of the book,though. One of my favorite parts was the night of the masquaradeball (which I wish had been longer than it was), where Kit iskidnapped by Jack and is sitting under a lover's bench, where a couple sits and all the lady can talk about is -- you guessed it --Captain Jack! Another passage I liked was when Jack bought Kit a riding outfit for their reception ride home. I also got a kick out of her grandfather, when Jack came right out & told him what wasgoing on. Jack really didn't have to say anything -- her grandpappy was very perceptive! I made sure, after reading about3 or 4 books in a row where a redhead was the central character,to find a book about a brunette."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After stumbling onto the Bar Cynster series (which has his moments but overall I love it) I was really disappointed with this book. I thought it had a very thin plot and characters and the girl disguised as a boy has been done to death. This one has gone into my recycle pile. I'm looking forward to the next Cynster book which are on my keeper shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good enough","review":"This book is a disappointment in many ways. It begins rather well, but the characters are not allowed to evolve, and the plot - which could have been excellent - fails miserably mainly because ms. Laurens time and again has her main characters jumping into bed instead of working out their problems. Don't get me wrong - I enjoy reading those scenes as much as the next person - but in this book they really get in the way. Frankly it feels as if the author tries to put as much erotic action into the story in order to avoid expanding the plot. Jack's personality also irritated me to the point of dislike. Obviously(!) he enjoys going to bed with Kit. But to do it constantly to avoid talking with and listening to his own wife? Sorry - \\"that don't impress me much!\\" In addition there is a certain feel of anachronism to the whole thing, which is very dissapointing considering ms. Laurens' other work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, reused plot, paperthin characters","review":"I really disliked this book. I felt manipulated by the end.

Unfortunatly the name doesn't hold true in this book. 2 chapters in I find it to be poorly organized with information that is otherwise useful but in this book so out of place as to be confusing. Even for someone who is relatively familliar with Apache. I'm going to buy the Apache Bible and hope that it is put together with more forethought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your Money...read online documentation","review":"This book is nothing more than the existing online documentation with a little extra information. I did not find it any more informative than the documentation at the Apache web site. Extremely disapointing.

So when I wanted to learn basic virtual host configuration on a Redhat Linux 6.1/Apache 1.3.9 system I was encouraged by the apparently in-depth treatment given to the subject. There were numerous examples given. Too bad the one for name based virtual hosts was apparently wrong, at least for my version of unix and apache. As I have only been through the first 70 or so pages of the book, perhaps it is too early to fairly pass judgement, but on the ONE question I primarly bought the book for help on, it failed me."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's good for linux user","review":"This is a very good book for apache. When I first got the book, I agreed with other readers' complain of poor organization. However, after 1 hour of reading it, I began to realized that I was wrong. The unique part of this book is that instead of teaching you about install and configure apache on the first shot. It actually teaches you the more detailed configuration by trying different option one at a time. This way, you learn more about the internal of the apache instead of compile and install based on the original options set by apache.org. This way, you can avoid many problems that might occur later on. By the way, if you don't know much about linux/unix, don't bother to install apache on a linux/unix machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only good for very casual newbies","review":"Other reviewers are right, this book doesn't deserve the O'Reilly reputation. This book organizes information loosely, and if you are clueless about Apache, reading this book wouldn't really benefit. Though, if you treat this book as a story book, maybe you can still read it, but don't expect much.If you want to spend your time better on the Apache subject, try the \\"Professional Apache\\" by Peter Wainwright by Wrox, which is a really \\"definitive\\" guide. (With that book I finished my domain name and virtual hosting within a few hours, marvelous by my standard.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Intro Book","review":"Apache the Definitive Guide 2nd EditionHallelujah!I think this book was exactly what I needed. Coming over from the M$ world where everything is a GUI, the httpd.conf file was a bit frustrating. Apache's online documentation was not newbie friendly. This book bridges that gap. I liked the way they begin with NO conf file and explains the Apache errors, and how to fix it in the conf file. The book then goes on adding additional functionality and options.This book does not explain every configuration option available to Apache, and it is a bit outdated (covers up to version 1.3.n). The book did come with a CD with sample conf files, but I found that I didn't even need to use them. The book is NOT a complete desktop reference, but it helped me understand Apache conf files so now the Apache online documentation makes sense.This book showed me the ropes and I'm successfully running Apache as my web server, which is all I was trying to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Big Picture","review":"The authors jump in with an example configuration, but never explain how each element of the configuration relates to the rest. For example- do alias statements take precedence over <directory> blocks ? Does it matter what order an alias or scriptalias directive appears in your file ? We are never told. In addition, there is a lack of continuity between one experiment in configuration and the next. As other reviewers have pointed out, it's unclear who the intended audience is. I'm sure at some point I'll get some value from the API documentation, but as a newbie to Apache, I've learned considerably more through trial and error on my own than by reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated and Poorly Targeted","review":"This book is targeted at the wrong people. It's written at a level of detail that falls somewhere between what you'd need if you already know how to work with Apache and that you'd need if you've never worked with it before. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to provide the information that's really most-needed for either end of the spectrum. There's little more than hand-waving over how and where to set up webs on a server or how to deal with configuration differences in Unix flavors. And the organization appears to be a weird hybrid between the \\"read all and understand\\" and the \\"do as you read\\" models for software books. My advice: Look for another book, or look this one over very carefully to make sure it's suitable for your level of experience and learning style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apache-The definitve guide","review":"I've bought 'running Linux' from O'reilly before and its indeed a good book for linux novice and I bought 'Apache- The definitive guide'in turn.

This book is not up to par with other O'Reilly editions. It is a good reference, though not worth the price considering the on-line docs are free. Also, there is something about the tone of the book and the writing style that seemed inappropriate for a technical book. Attempting to be funny in a private sort of way, poking fun at sales types and company motives. It gets old pretty quick.The book repeatedly stresses that Win32 is not a serious platform for securing web sites. This is true, but many of us have no choice. The authors refuse to cover Win32 security, and make repeated claims that Win32 is poorly documented and understood.

Not much there.","review":"If you've used Apache without even reading about any detailed configurations, you'd still not see anything new in this book. I can see this book being a little useful for beginners, but even then, it's not really getting into very detailed information about the configurations and whatnot for module installs/additions. I can see someone new still getting frustrated with this book if they run into a problem.I picked it up, well, because I buy every O'Reilly book that comes out (seriously) and thought I might be able to find something interesting, useful or that I wasn't aware of or forgot... maybe even a little tip about efficiency, compiling options or just anything of interest.This is no more useful than the README and INSTALL files that come with Apache's source code.

A let down coming from O'Reilly."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'd Be Better Off Printing the Apache Online Help","review":"This book, unlike virtually every other O'Reilly book I own, almost completely fails in its effort to educate the reader. Each chapter starts out with a page or two of well-written text, then, just when you become interested you're faced with page after page of configuration settings, with very little explanation of what each setting does or, more importantly, why you would ever care what it does. Worse, the authors tend to use a lot of words where a few would have been better. For example, instead of just saying that Apache would report an error they say \\"you have a problem that's signaled by disagreeable messages at the client end, plus equivalent stories in the log files on the server...\\"Huh?As I said in the title, you'd be better off printing the Apache help, because at least it's free."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works!","review":"It works perfectly! it's definitely a bargain.

Some things are explained over and over again and others a little bit more complicated are mentioned as if they had been explained earlier. I wouldn't recommend this book, because for a beginner there are a lot of things not clearly explained and for an expert it is not really useful, because it's not very compact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"I have collected quite a few linux books and this one ranks as one of the top 5 books.

Some mistakes include answers to the chapter end tests not coinciding with the questions asked, index items not pointing you to the right pages(look up the print daemon, commands in the index). The mistakes left me with the feeling that this book was rushed out with out being proof read, leaving me with little confidence that the material I was reading was a good reflection of what would be on the exam.

But that good schema looks very confuse when the author starts to make suggestions or tips that aren't sorted by any kind of category (and they often takes a lot of pages)... Those comments are very good, so it needs a bit of more organization.I recommend this book for instance and database tuning, but not for SQL tuning (the author has another excellent book on this subject).

This book is the text for an introductory computer science course I am taking. While I admire the authors' attempt at putting Objects First in the curriculum, they have only succeeded in confusing and alienating a number of my classmates with little programming experience. The most glaring weaknesses are the the relatively few, undistinguished examples, and the lack of rigor in teaching Java syntax and semantics. The authors' freely admit that they do not attempt to teach Java itself, but this ultimately leaves students stranded as they peruse the hundreds of Java titles at the local bookstore, looking for a decent language reference. Lastly, they mix a lot of software engineering practice in with the actual computer science. While topics such as programming by contract and software quality are important, I am not convinced that this material is suited for students at the beginning level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I'm unfortunate enough to use this book for my object-oriented software design class.

The attachments don't fit right, especially the blend attachment.

Too close to home, and his wife hasn't given him any reason to wander. Second, it's even harder to feel anything for Alex, who's strait-jacket ready almost from the git-go.

Glenn Close broke her long tradition of saintlike roles with her viciously effective Alex, the woman you do not ignore. Michael Douglas is perfectly cast as the husband, and Anne Archer provides an emotional warmth that makes the deception even more potent. Though the movie flashes with a bit of dated style -- tilted cameras; shocking slams and bangs; a bit too much gloss over all -- it nevertheless gets you right in the gut; the experience is visceral. I am not enthralled with the ending, because it seems over the top and from another movie, which makes sense --the ending is actually a re-considered finale; test audiences wanted revenge, and wanted it complete and with venom.

I had heard about the rabit scene from the two people who recommended it but was not impressed when I did see it. The wrist slashing scene was pretty good; the ending, with her bloated choked body floating in the water and that fako bullet hole in the end was also tasteless. I just don't see someone going that far. No good probing on the questions of love or adultury or marriage as social contract vs passion. THis is truly for audiences of the 1980's; I'll stick with more stuff out of the 1970's - at least we saw some degree of taste and plot and character dev. back then.

I liked the style of this piece, but when I received it I immediately noticed a number of dents and cracks in the wood. Not wanting to discount it just yet, and thinking I could work around it, I began to assemble the cabinet and found that while the boards were helpfully labelled, the instructions were less than user-friendly and several screws were missing. In addition, the drawer pulls did not attach completely, despite attempts from a professional carpenter to work with them. It's a big pain to have to return a large piece of ready-to-assemble furniture, and I regret the purchase. It's a good sized piece for smaller storage spaces, but it's not worth the frustration of a three-hour assembly time and disappointly flawed wood and hardware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed buyer","review":"I loved the design and functionality of this cabinet and I still do.

One part is written in Japanese/Chinese(?). My husband and I managed to put the cabinet together in about 2 hours not counting the hour to figure out the instructions. Overall, on close inspection, the finished product looks like a cheaply put together cabinet vs a solid construction because the junctions are not a tight fit.I'd rate the cabinet a 5/5 for functionality, and because of the labor involved and trouble to look for matching drawer handles I'd pay $50.00 for this cabinet and rate it a 1/5 with a recommendation of \\"Do not buy\\" unless you are willing to overpay."},{"rating":"1","title":"nopunctuationinthewhole5cds","review":"I have several Jeeves CDs and many, many, many Rumpole CDs.

It looked interesting, and I was right. If you're a fan of V.C. Andrews (Flowers in the Attic, Petals on the Wind) you might like this book. My only problem is that I wish this book could have been more detailed.Some of the plot points had a lot of potential to be used, but it wasn't really taken advantage of, since some parts felt somewhat skimpy. It would have been nice to see more of what had happened to Paul and Constance and Margaret. I also felt that Paul (Sr.) wimped out with what he did to himself - honestly, he should have just dealt with it.

Unfortunately, Flanders doesn't deliver. It is a large bloated, schizophrenic work that fades in and out of detail. It goes in depth on simple concepts and glosses over the complex, interesting ones. Besides a few undocumented interface calls, I got the impression that Flanders knew just as much as anyone did about the internals of ASP, and without seeing this \\"mystical\\" source code he refers to often, have to take his word that he really did do something and did not just smoke and mirror his way around the rest. A reader remarked that this book is at least better than MSDN documentation. While this may be true, it is hardly a redeeming quality for a book with the ambitious and lofty title of \\"ASP Internals\\" and from a developmentor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource to get you thinking","review":"My attending on Gen Surg in 3rd year clerkships required that I read this before i started.

The characters are kind of interesting, but sometimes it seemed the author was having problems trying to figure out what the character was doing,which could of been better, without trying to give away too much.

After checking a couple different versions out from the library we now make sure to always get the books with the original illustrations by John R.

The depiction of American manufacturing in the pamphlet is getting old. American managers have grown tired of hearing how a Japanese approach is superior and of needing to use terms such as kaizen and poka-yoke when talking about lean thinking. If the Japanese approach is so superior, why are many manfacturing companies have trouble competing in today's global market? This approach can get in the way of adoption of lean thinking. Many of the terms in the glossary are not used in the book.On the positive side the book does provide a number of bad practices, management and production."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent intro to lean thinking using a practical story","review":"I work in operations and am using this as part of some leadership training in our business.

No one but them can possibly produce anything properly. Oh, wait, did this book mention that it was AMERICANS who showed the Japanese modern production methods immediately after WWII? By golly, they left out that little detail.. you probably don't hear that too much, but look it up if you don't believe me. For all of the 1950's and most of the 1960's, \\"Made in Japan\\" was not a good thing to see on a product. Only in the past 30 years have they gotten good. I won't deny that American companies have gotten sloppy, and they need a cold hard slap to wake them up. But, I think that some of these books go a little overboard heaping praise on Japanese methods."},{"rating":"1","title":"BASIC....","review":"This book is a situational review of a back yard application of manufacturting.

Instead the book focused on the virtues of the Linux development community and jokes about free pizza. These may be great, but not what the title and intro said the book would be about.In my opinion, this book is not for CIO's, IT consultants, or technical readers.The book did have interesting, although completely technical, examples of large companies that did use Linux. It also had approx 100 pages of consultants listed in the back if you are looking for that sort of thing.My advice, keep looking,Mike"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heinous","review":"This is pretty low-grade stuff. While I applaud the credentials and spirit of the writer, I was saddened by the tone of the book. It read like a summary of how Linux will instill peace,love, and happiness the world over.A little less worship of Linux, a little more Strategy would've helped immensely. 100+ pages of resources and consultants ? An entire chapter on \\"Care and feeding of a sysadmin\\" ...good lord.As an IS manager, if you took this book to me to prove Linux a viable solution, I'd laugh you out the door.

Of all the books Ive read on music its crazy what little mention this band recieves (if any mention at all). This album further proves there abilty to to mix different styles of music almost flawlessly creating a unique fresh sound that is so hard to come by nowadays. Each member of the band handles there parts exceptionally and although this is a long album I was rarely ever bored. Chicago has delivered some of the most enduring pop rock of all time! They may not get critical praise, but there still the seconed most succesful american band ever! the people have spoken."},{"rating":"2","title":"How could it happen?","review":"How could it happen that Chicago became a pop-hits machine after Chicago VII? After listening the remastered version of this fantastic album I just say that this was the last excellent music they did.The songs \\"Aire, prelude and Devil's sweet\\" songs are performed in what I consider the peak in the chicago musical career.\\"Byblos\\" is one of the most introspected songs of Tery Kath and I have to say that the new version included in the bonus tracks is better than the original one. It's more vivid.One of my favorite life time chicago songs is \\"Call on me\\" maybe because I'm a latin from Mexico City.As Danny Seraphine (the excellent original drummer) has stated, after Chicago VII, they lost a legion of loyal fans that hated the ballads.If you are a new musical searcher of excellent bands from the 70's, this band and this New remastered version of Chicago VII must be in your catalogue. An incredible band always rejected by the critics. Just listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply their Best !!","review":"This is Chicago's best album, quite simply. The pop is hip and the jazz is real. I just came back to it after many years away and found it as enjoyable as ever. We all know that most music does not demonstrate such resiliency. This recording can be put on a level with Chicago II and V, which is also saying a lot. As always, a love of a phenomenal horn section is key to the full enjoyment of this band, and this selection does not disappoint. But Robert Lamm's keyboards and Terry Kath's brilliant guitar (I still miss him) are amply featured to full effect. Sadly, they never again sounded so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and a half","review":"In general, Chicago became more commercial as they went along. By the mid 1970s, they were mainly a singles band.But you would not spot the trend listening to this album. It opens with an excellent side-long jam which at times reminds me of Santana's jazzier excursions around this time.There is also fantastic, sophistcated pop, such as \\"Happy Man,\\" and \\"Wishing You Were Here.\\" Bossa nova, spanish guitar and layered writing and production put this work on the top scale of Top 40 70s pop.James Gurrcio's production is even tighter here. He is smart enough to seperate the pop from the jazz, and this worked better when this was a doulbe LP set. The genre leaping that marred some of those early Chicago double sets is cut away here, leaving this a tight, coharent yet diverse album--probably Chicago's last stab at early 1970s progressiveism before they became a singles unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"The album I miss the most I think......","review":"In my long lost collection of early Chicago. I grew up totally impressed with the brass, and loved their live concerts in Seattle in the Mid 70's. Just read the previous reviews on VII, great observations and comments by all. So much of this album is just so rich. Byblos, Song of the Evergreens, Devils Sweet (first half at least)and of course the incredible Call on Me. I mean, I don't think I've heard a more creative endeavor or a break from a groups main groove than when Chicago did this, although Pat Methany has put out some rather unusual stuff between his standard fair (which I prefer.) Interesting that Peter Letheby considers it his all time favorite album of any artist. That is the ultimate review. You ain't alone Peter, however obscure an album this is so many years after release, as you can see, it captivated a few of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"yes, the last Chicago album worth listening to","review":"As several people have said, this was the last interesting Chicago album (unless you like the sappy ballads that made them so much cash during the 80s). At its best, this album is really exciting and fresh. The instrumental music holds up better than most of the jazz/rock fusion of the 70s, and the pop songs are among their strongest. On the negative side, there are, as on most double albums, two or three weak songs. The other negative is that, in listening to the pop songs--even the good ones--you can hear the direction they were headed in. No more experimentation, no more fun. Maybe it was unrealistic to think a band could continue being this schizophrenic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely comfortable.","review":"Bought a pair of these a couple months ago.

I understand it's out of his age range, but even his 33 year old mother (me) could not play the songs on the music sheet included because the puzzle sometimes makes the sound, and sometimes it doesn't and it requires skilled movements to have them going at any kind of speed.

Bouncy numbers like \\"Gold\\" intrude on the consistency of what is otherwise a dark, sprawling masterpiece.A work of art in the truest sense of the word.

A short overview: The acoustic guitar driven/cleverly arranged \\"Love On A Farmboy's Wages\\" and \\"Me And The Wind\\"; the Beatles-influenced \\"Great Fire\\"; exercises in synthie-pop (\\"Wonderland\\"); Dub at the end of \\"Human Alchemy\\"; instrumentals that aren't afraid of dissonances (\\"Procession Towards Learning Land\\" and finally an attack on music-industry which is as apt as fiteen years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite strong yet underappreciated","review":"As most reviewers have already noted, this is an unsung entry in the XTC oeuvre. The whole album is more than solid, but the first eight songs can hang with most of XTC's best material. Despite what I've been reading though, I quite enjoy Frost Circus.

Is is a shame that GE put repair of RCA (Excellent products) under the care of Audiovox, because Audiovox looks for reasons not to repair the products. After speaking to nine prople within their \\"pass him on\\" system, I got the impression that it was not the attitude of the people I talked to, it was the attitude of Audiovox. They sell over priced products and when the break, which they always do, they do not stand behind the repairs.

I read the book in two days and found the information I was looking for. It is an excellent introduction to a truly great faith. The lifestyle is too restrictive for me but I can see the benefit and reasoning behind it. My only real complaints about LDS beliefs is the churchs positon on breeding and tithing 10%. Over population is a serious problem and it does not help the environment for people to have seven, eight or nine children even if they can afford it. But I really like the LDS emphasis on family and family values. I support Mitt Romney as President and will gladly argue with anyone that his faith is not a reason to vote against him. This book has given me some useful knowlege to use in support of that cause."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating book on the early Vietnam War","review":"I realize that for the last ten or fifteen years, there has been a flood of Vietnam War-related memoirs. However, Jim Morris' WAR STORY is an historical account you do not want to miss. In the early years of Vietnam, the author was an Army Special Forces Captain and advisor to both the South Vietnamese army an the indigenous Montagnards. WAR STORY chronicles Morris' adventures--some rather precarious--with these two groups. The battle scenes are vivid, and perfectly capture the chaos of a running gun fight in a jungle. What is best about WAR STORY, however, is Morris' ability to study himself, his comrades, and the war, without flinching. Part of this is due to the author's training as a journalist; also because the book was written in 1979, while the war was still fresh. All in all, this book will show you what it was like to be a soldier in the early days of the Vietnam War, when victory was still attainable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rucking in the Jungle with Morris","review":"Morris' book is first-rate. Although somewhat dated in the sense of who SF are today, this piece offers unique first-person accounts of what Vietnam was like. I felt the best parts of the book were his philosophical ruminations of policy, the truisms of counter-revolutionary war, etc. Specifically, he hit a bullseye with why we lost. I derive many similarities from his book to the situation brewing in Colombia (without the Cold War spin). Its a great primer for Vietnam readers and all those interested in SF. Only two areas that I felt were lacking: not enough background material to make the reader connect with the situation or \\"time-space\\" in the book, and his style was somewhat erratic. I don't remeber coming accross any dates for a couple hundred pages. From a military historian perspective, it lacked clarity and seemed to drift into \\"free-thought\\" of his experiences. However, I thought he provided excellent narratives of his bravery and heroism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed","review":"From a literary standpoint, War Story is very disjointed and rambling. Side bars are frequent and often pointless. The book starts out with the author arriving in Nam for his second tour, then goes into a flashback of the first tour that lasts a third of the book, without telling what's going on. There are very few dates and no maps. There is not near as much action as most of the popular Viet Nam books, and the story is largely one of the author's frustration at not being allowed to command a combat team for more than a couple operations. The book may be of value for its unique content about Montagnard advisors before regular troops arrived, and the author certainly speaks from the heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I found the book to be a boring read. Not much action experience by the author. It was just very boring and I couldn't wait to finish reading it so that I could read another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Detailed Chronology with Little Analysis","review":"Bill Quandt's volume on the American role in the Middle East peace process reads more as a chronology of events than a real analytical piece of history. The author devotes an extradinary amount of detail to minor events and actions without really explaining the motives of the players behind the actions. The strongest part of the book is the Presidential Crisis decision making model, in which he explains how he feels US policy on the issue is molded. There is little to judge against, however, since the author does not really do justice to the other theories of US decisionmaking on the middle east. Whether or not he agrees with them, he could at least tell us why he thinks they are incorrect. And finally, the amount of minutia the author goes into ends up leaving the reader wishing he would just decide to highlight a few important events and motives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend!","review":"I highly recommend this book for all Christian women.

After reading all the sections on configuring the web server, I had no idea which way to go to configure it correctly. It contains mostly 'fluff' on basic web page stuff and covers unnecessary material all throughout the book. Did not have anything on how to install as an FTP server or how to configure the ftp services. It needs to go into much more detail into the cfg files because these are essentail in getting the web server to operate correctly. This book covered nothing on those files.

Each of Streisand's films is given its own chapter, complete with lots of photographs(some never before seen). Spada soft-peddles some of Streisand's more chaotic battles with co-stars or directors, but many are present in interviews to give their thoughts. As with Spada's \\"Barbra: The First Decade\\", Streisand's music career isn't quite as fully explored as her movie work, and some of Spada's details are askew(David Bowie didn't write \\"Space Captain\\", for instance). Still, this is a very fine collection of photos and stories and must be included in any Streisand collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious.","review":"I can't believe there aren't any reviews here, yet. At any rate, this is an absolutely fantastic book -- it's more performance art than anything else, really. The narrator's sense of humor captures the reader almost immediately, and there's enough jumping around to keep you interested.This is the Seinfeld of 18th century novels: it's about nothing, and yet it's hilarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Note About the Oxford World Classics Edition","review":"I just wanted to note that pages 29 and 30 of this edition are supposed to be black, not blank. Whether this was a simple mistake by the publisher or just a way to save money-two black pages must take alot of ink-doing so alters the possible interpretation of Sterne's work. Given the fact that Sterne closely watched the original publishers to prevent deviations from his intent, I expect that Sterne would be appalled that the black pages were not included.Otherwise, I have no negative comments about the work. While many complain that the narrator jumps around to much and it is difficult to understand, that is part of the fun of reading the book. The narrator essentially makes the reader a character in the book-ground breaking methods which are way before his time. Excellent"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Birth of Postmodernism","review":"With \\"Tristram Shandy,\\" Sterne invented postmodernism 200 years before it supposedly was initiated by the likes Joyce, Burroughs and Pynchon. The book is hilarious. It is supposed to be the life and opinions of the narrator. Instead, it takes about fourhundred pages to even get to when he was born. The book radically changes tone in the last hundred pages (as, I think, Sterne was nearing death), and the then present day Shandy is finally presented. Some of these scenes are touching, but the final chapters become redundant. The book is completely inconsistent, the narrator interrupts at all possible times ... But it works! Read this book, but be advised to possibly skim the last fifty pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine Basic Edition","review":"This Dover Thrift Edition of The Life and Times of Tristram Shandy, Gentlemen, is a handsome package in terms of size, cover, and ease of reading. It's one drawback is a paucity of the sorts of introductions, timelines, explanatory notes and addenda you find in Oxford Classic or Penguin Classic versions. In fact, there's only one brief introductory note, then you're on your own. But it's a fine way to read the novel itself, and a great value even at full cover price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fascinating Read","review":"I had to read Tristram Shandy for a class on eighteenth and nineteenth century novels, and I found Sterne's novel to be the most interesting and entertaining of the bunch. I was overwhelmed by it at first, but, once I got into it and realized that plot was not the point, I really enjoyed the many characters and the unconventional structure. I would highly recommend this novel to anyone who appreciates the postmodernists...I had to read Flann O'Brien's At Swim-Two-Birds at the same time and noticed how similar these books (though centuries apart) were in wit and style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy!","review":"This may a portion of the book, but I found out that it is not the whole thing.

Yes, there are moments of great wit. However, they are lost within a mass of verbiage so dense that it makes your mortgage agreement look like a Little Golden Book. It's not the sublime non-linearity of Joyce's writing or Ornette Coleman's playing. It's the amplification of the self to an unbearable degree. Certainly a unique achievement, I guess. But so is Lou Reed's \\"Metal Machine Music.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Left me Flat, better things out there","review":"Having read a fair amount of 17th and 18th century European literature I looked forward to another good experience. Unfortunately Trisham Shandy did not live up to its reputation. Reading others review I saw words like Comical, Capricious and Deceptively Frivolous. I could find only a few pages out of the 500 that would justify these high praises. I found the book to start out slowly and then fizzle out altogether.My advice to those thinking of reading this book is to make sure that you have read all of the Voltaire and Swift that you can lay your hands on and then think of this one again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpectedly Funny!","review":"I'm a college student and chose this book to read for a British Lit project. I was not expecting much and the book seemed to start off slow, but it takes a little while to get used to Sterne's writing style. Some parts of the book are hard to get through (like a long, seemingly pointless chapter about a tour of France) but you will be rewarded with the many funny scenes and dead-on observations on life. And I love Sterne's \\"visual aids.\\" Uncle Toby, Trim, and Walter are, to me, unforgettable characters. An odd novel, but surprisingly funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"It may be famous but its not worth struggling through","review":"Having tried so hard to finish this I have become convinced that its reputation comes from people who have, somehow, managed to read it and didn't want to feel all the effort was for nought. It really isn't all that good either as satire or entertainment. Swift or Fielding are infinitely superior. I have met others who, after a few drinks, were willing to admit that they too couldn't read this balderdash.

Laurence Sterne seems more concerned with his erudition than with telling his story. The novel is a sort of intellectual tease, as Sterne intorduces storylines, and then announces that he will complete the storyline later so that he can digress onto some topic that may have been of interest in 1760 (such as the description of fortifications) but which is of little interest today. By doing this, Sterne builds up and then frustrates our expectations, revealing Sterne as both vain in his self-indulgence and disrespectful to his gentle readers. One would need to be a classicist to understand the classical references littered throughout the book. Sterne could have told a story; instead he gave a lecture."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST Book I Ever Read!","review":"(One star because zero was not an option.)I had many accomplishments during my years at university, but I must say that I have no idea how I got through this one.

While I am a great defender of the right to read, and the need to read books that are detestable as part of the study of literature, I so strongly disliked this book that I keep it only as a reminder of the torture that my students face as they read literature they would never normally choose.

I understand that the author was introducing a new technique (stream of consciousness). But if you want to read a good example of stream of consciousness you should move towards Virginia Woolf's \\"To the Lighthouse.\\" Also Margaret Laurence's \\"The Stone Angel.\\" The only good thing I can possibly say about \\"Tristram Shandy\\" is that it may be a golden turkey.

I have never heard 7 angels 7 plagues. But i'm sure they were as good as these guys.the first two tracks i heard were: \\"The year the summer ended in june\\" and \\"Five Years\\". after i heard them, i had to get it. The drummer knows his stuff, the guitars and bass were incredible. But what really got me were the vocals. Such raw emotion, and rage. By far the best vocals i have heard in a long time. the album stay heavy the whole way through. the break down track \\"worlds & Dreams\\" was quite a refresher. \\" Difference of Vengeance and Wrongs\\" is one of my favorite tracks. Its shows his ability to sing, and be emotional. overall, a damn good album. if you want to hear something great. Pick this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD, needs more breakdowns","review":"The other reviewer said it best \\"this CD is not very breakdown heavy and that is something I look for in a \\"hardcore\\" band\\". I couldn't agree more, this CD is very good and very intense but if they just threw in more breakdowns this CD would get the five stars. This sounds like a lot of metalcore but with such few breakdowns in the music, the songs start to blend together and get monotonous. Word of advice to Misery Signals: throw more breakdowns into your next CD, your fans will appreciate it. Anyone who is a big fan of Misery Signals, I recommend checking out On Broken Wings, a far superior band in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"good stuff","review":"The first few times I listened to this album I didn't like the vocals very much, but the more I listened, I realized that they fit perfectly.

Overall a very pleasing debut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This album is terrific. Every single aspect of it, from the guitar work to the drumming and vocals, is sheer perfection. This band is one of the few new hardcore bands that can cater to many different types of heavy music fans and maintain their musical integrity and musicianship at the same time. The polarity of this album is excellent and well executed; some moments of this album make you want to cry and some parts make you wanna break a few noses. I highly suggest picking up this album if you're a fan of emotional hardcore such as 7 Angels 7 Plagues, Poison the Well, SkyCameFalling etc. Standout tracks include: The Year Summer Ended in June, The Stinging Rain, Worlds and Dreams, and Five Years."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing in every aspect","review":"this band has so much talent not just in the way they play but the way they write and organize their music. awesome guitar playingwith some brutal breakdowns, and their singer sceam every word with such passion that it can just overwhelm you especially on the eyar summer ended in june, you can tell he isvery passionate about his music and what he is writing about. this band should be so much more popular then they are. they remind me of scars of tomorrow but heavier some pats more melodic in others. the last track on this cd comes completely out of left field but it is so amazing i kinda wish theyd realease a whole album of material like that sometime in the future but then again it might creat a huge backlash but i found it very enjoyable and moving to listen to. amazing record best hardcore cd in a long long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"High's and Lows.","review":"This full length from Misery Signals has lived up to my expectations, but I feel it is way overproduced (like most modern music).The Stinging Rain is a highlight on the CD showcasing the abilities of M.S. to make good ol' melodic hardcore.Five Years and the Day Summer Ended in June are also good tracks to checkout.World's and Dreams has some nifty guitar work and cool sounding synth effects. All in all, I feel like Misery Signals has done a great job exhibiting how much they have grown as a band and musically on this CD.Some of their older stuff is just classic though and always will be.I feel that the 7 Angels 7 Plagues style has definatley come out in some songs on the CD.World's and Dreams is quite reminiscent of Jhazymne's Lullaby or Dandelions.In the end,I highly reccomend this CD for diehard M.S. fans such as I,or even newcomers to the melodic hardcore genre.Misery Signals is definatley at the top of their game."},{"rating":"1","title":"boringest band ever","review":"I have seen these guys twice, once opening for six feet under, and the other for strapping young lad.

That's censorship, and it's BS. A work of art isn't complete if you remove 1/12th of it, and it was one of the best songs on the album.It's a time capsule of 1988/1989, and should be taken in context. I'm a conservative republican and I think the fact that they removed that song is absurd. You can't change history, and you can't censor art.You also shouldn't advertise this album as being an original reissue when it isn't.

The packaging has an index as well which is helpful in remembering which episodes are on which disc (it's a two disc set). The image and sound qualities are good.Most of the episodes have some very funny moments, and some episodes are great. One or two are duds that seemed to have been slapped together at the last moment.The few bonus features they have included aren't very entertaining. The commentaries aren't funny or informative and aren't really worth a listen. The producers come off sounding conceited and taking the show's popularity for granted.Overall, I would say the set is a good value because there are some really classic episodes, such as the musical one and the one of Zorak's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's No Talk Show Like It","review":"\\"Space Ghost: Coast To Coast\\" is a neat late night time talk show that you can watch whenever.

This album is definitely a departure from their previous efforts, experimentation is not always welcomed by fans, but the record is an overall good listen, I went through the whole thing on my way back from work, and never did I feel this wasn't a theSTART record, there's not one track that is awfully disappointing, misplaced maybe, but yet there's not one that is devastating to the album as a whole.Not great, not their best, but a solid experimental record, if you are new to theSTART I recommend their older stuff, specially the Death Via Satellite EP and Initiation, unless you are really into dance rock, then you will really love this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have","review":"This album is amazing and I can't stop listening to it.

I love everything they have done, and consider Initiation to be one of their strongest albums. I liked the fact that they tried a different, darker approach to their sound; it worked with Initiation. This album, though, is just flat out dissapointing. It sounds like one of two things happened:1. Aimee has become theSTART's equivalent of Gwen Stefani and spent too much time listening to No Doubt's Rock Steady album.2. The band wanted to try something new/different and this is the unfortunate result.I'm personally hoping that the latter is the true scenario, but I judging by the cover, I wouldn't totally dismiss the former.

I tried listening to this album about 3 times, and on the third i just stopped it after the third track. I dont know how they managed to make this album so plain and boring, but they did.Oh yeah, if i wasnt told about the guest appearances on the cd, i wouldnt even have noticed they were there.

First off the song \\"the new black\\" isn't that bad it gets my head nodding a little bit but the rest of the cd is just spazzcore riffs that don't go anywhere(unlike the red chord)and the singer sings in exactly the same annoying tone for the ENTIRE cd.

The solution must be realized to fit within the organization's information technology infrastructure (domain or space).\\" [p16] should be taken out and shot with the bullets from the neighboring pages.

I bought it when I needed to understand UML for the first time and I am afraid that it failed my expectations. In the end I forced myself to speed read through the whole thing just to get some kind of overview. I suspect some of it penetrated my subconscious, but not a great deal, since a large portion of the book is bulleted with incomplete sentences.

It literally took me three months to get through just chapter two. I kept falling asleep every time I tried to read it! Most of chapter two consists of cut-and-pasted bulleted lists each one defining a zillion terms w/o justification. So, we don't say 'acquired', we say 'captured'. Great! Can you say 'pedantic', boys and girls?Bottom line is that when an author keeps using big obfuscated words for no good reason where simpler ones would do (e.g. 'facilitate' v/s 'ease') you know you are in trouble.

The author's attempt at describing the basic O-O paradigm is possibly the most convoluted explanation I've ever seen.

The terminology used deviates from what is commonly used in all other books on the subject. I disagree with the sequence in which the author presents the material and find his introduction to OO one of the worst ones I have ever come across. Trying to capture all of the UML in such a small book resulted in the book containing information that is only mentioned and not explored, leaving the reader confused rather than enthused. Finally, what does not help at all is the heavy use of bullet points throughout the book, which is a characteristic of the bad style this book is written in.

It is a fine example of a pedantic, overly qualified academic book; almost comical in its lack of clarity. Vague diagrams followed by long lists of overly precise bullet points are the preferred mechanism of imparting knowledge (one can imagine the author sweating to impart maximum exactitude in the minimum word count). I'm sure the author knows the subject, however, I would defy any generalist to make head or tail of it.

I don't know why it took me so many years to discover it. It was written almost 100 years ago so the language is a little different. Don't let that stop you. The descriptions of the landscape are beautiful and if you have been to the West you will really appreciate that. The book is a mystery as well as a western with plenty of twists and turns to hold your interest. I had some unanswered questions when I finished the book but they are all being answered in the sequel, The Rainbow Trail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, but engaging","review":"This book could be the script for an Aaron Spelling Western Soap Opera. Grey's women characters are supposed to be strong, but their beliefs never seem to match their actions. His research on Mormons (if he did any) must have come from a really disgruntled former member of the religion. Taken for what it is, a romantic old western, it's good entertainment. You'll roll your eyes, but you'll keep reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb \\"theatre of the mind\\" audiobook experience.","review":"The St. Charles Players turn their considerable talents to creating an Audio Theatre production of Zane Grey's classic western tale Riders Of The Purple Sage in this two cassette, 165 minute, multi-cast dramatization. Here the listener will thrill to the echos of gunfire on the western plan, loyal riders for the brand, a stranger who rides to the sound of the guns, beliefs and passions intertwined with betrayal and violence. Zane Grey was a master storyteller who set the standards for the western novel. This Monterey Soundworks production is flawlessly recorded and offers up a true \\"theatre of the mind\\" experience that offers a true saga of enchanting excitement and intrigue set in the days of a mythic western frontier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Riders of the Purple Sage was a little tiresome","review":"I had high expectations when I first got Riders of the Purple Sage.

I couldn't get through it.I would highly recommend The Cowboy & the Cossack & Lonesome Dove."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLASSIC BUT DIFFERENT","review":"Grey's best-known novel is a page-turner, but different in at least one detail- the female lead character is a Mormon. It is also unusual because the book was written at a time when Mormons were still unpopular, even though their practice of polygamy had been outlawed for over two decades. The story is plausible, there's plenty of action, but I found the dialogue to be dated. Given the setting, it's probably accurate, but I would have liked to see more western slang."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to finish","review":"The dialog in the book is old, so it's distracting, and not a quick read, because of it. I read the entire book (book club selection), but I had to force myself to complete it.

Apparently working \\"Mom's\\" don't have the right to have a dog. I didn't even read past that part and I wish I could have returned the book. Most people don't have the luxury of staying home all day.

The book is totally unforgiving about ANY reason what so ever you may have, without exception, in regards to having your dog or puppy relieve him/her-self indoors. It basically states that if you cannot take your dog outdoors, then don't bother getting a dog and get a cat instead.

But who's chasing whom?More than a cleverly woven story, Portland Laugher intertwines its twisted plot with the bittersweet emotional complexities. On all fronts, this book kept me spellbound until its devastatingly brilliant conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Un chef d\`oeuvre!","review":"It was my favorite movie when I was a kid. I recommend it to any parent who wants his child to watch intelligent and sensitive movies. The characters are memorable and the music enchanting. I watched it over and over and still have chills while watching it. Bastian is a model for others because he has feelings of his own and thinks of the consequences of his actions. This movie truly is enchanting!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming","review":"This movie is charming. It has fantasy elements, real life childhood struggles and a real personable touch. If you are an avid reader you will relate to the lead character in this film. While I did not experience the bullying the lead character did as a child I definately related to his love of books and the escapism they represent. It's a thrill that this movie really puts you back in touch with, in only the way a child can experience. That is probably my favorite part of this film. Books were exciting worlds as a child, complete mysteries to be revealed; this movie captures that and brings it to life in a fantastic way. I thought it was clever and charming and very entertaining, fun for all. I still enjoy this film all these years later."},{"rating":"2","title":"80's 80's 80's","review":"As a child growning up in the 80's I have to say this one one of my favorite movies to watch! Flying Luck Dragons, Rock Giants, and Magic all balled into one. Any fan of 80's films will appriciate this film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Imaginary Tale","review":"Absolutely one of my favorite movies as a child growing up. I was 8 years old when I first saw this movie and it captivated me. As an adult I find it amusing and still a great imaginary tale. This movie is awesome for children or anybody with a wild imagination. It's about a young boy who gets caught up in reading a story and somewhere along the line he actually becomes a part of the story in turn thrusting his imagination and the audiences into overdrive. A must have for anybody with kids. Fantastic movie!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgia at its best....","review":"I saw this movie for the first time when I was about 5 and have never stopped loving it.

A very sweet movie with interesting characters,music,and of course a good lesson to be told.. Over all a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"NeverEnding Nostalgia...","review":"If there was ever a work of art that personified the imagination of childhood- all the joys, the fears, the dreams and sheer wonder of life and all its possibilities - one would need to look no further than \\"The NeverEnding Story.\\"Looking at this film through older, more cynical, world-weary eyes, it's easy to discount it and point out its many faults. YES, the acting is unbearable at times. YES, the last twenty minutes are overly preachy. And YES the narrative progresses aimlessly with no rhyme or reason. But you know what? I don't care. I even found myself getting teary-eyed at some points, something I rarely do.I agree with the other reviewers. If you didn't see and love this film as a kid, you won't enjoy it now. I watched the DVD with my (now ex) girlfriend, who yawned and groaned and rolled her eyes throughout the whole thing. A shame, really. I felt like she missed the boat. If this movie captured you as a kid, you owe it to yourself to let it capture you again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully evocative childhood story","review":"Neglected nerd Bastian Bux (Barrett Oliver), fleeing from bullies, enters a mysterious bookstore and picks up \\"The Neverending Story,\\" about another boy, this time the mighty hero Atreyu (Noah Hathaway) charged to save the kingdom of Fantasia from the encroaching darkness. As he becomes engrossed in the story, he realizes that he can manipulate the events, and that the events can manipulate him. The metaphors become slightly heavy-handed, but the fantastic landscapes are beautifully realized, with magical beings quirky enough to be interesting without becoming tiresome, and a Princess who wisely remains an archetype rather than becoming one of the boys' prom dates."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic from Germany...","review":"It might look a little cheesy now that I'm older, but is still quite a fun moview.

The special effects were unrealistic and the main actor could not act. The fantasy characters were decently played but because the main actor could not act everything else did not make sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for a remastered release","review":"Putting aside the fact that the subtitle (DUTCH!) issue is a pain in the neck, the PQ of this title leaves much to be desired. It is only marginally better than the DVD release. While the movie itself is still pristine with excellent writing, effects and direction (for its time), I think we will have to wait awhile for the North American release for a decent blu-ray master. There were times when I was watching the movie where I felt like I was watching the DVD! Spots here and there, edge enhancement is not what it could have been, and with films many decades older looking light years sharper, there simply is no excuse to rip off the customers time and time again with lackluster blu-ray titles such as this."},{"rating":"1","title":"WB screws up a very good movie","review":"While I truly enjoy this movie, this DVD rendition is very poorly considered and executed. First, WB chose to take the widescreen movie and only offer it in 4:3 TV aspect ratio, rather than offer an alternative to see the movie in the original widescreen 16:9. So, the vistas are narrowed and pan and scan is the order of the day. Second, at one point in the DVD there was a very visible fiber on screen for quite some time. So, they were cheap, and did not have good quality control. Hopefully, WB will release a better rendition of this fine movie onto DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Neverending Story- A critcal analysis","review":"I have only a few words to say- The Book was WAY better.

Do you know how hard kids try to make this happen? Let this be a cue to dad's out there to watch the movie and, if there's ever been a time when your relationship with your kid wasn't great, to go to your kid and apologize and get some professional help for both of you to really work it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I really enjoy this movie, but what I am starting to realize know is the extraordinary symbolism of this movie.The Barret Oliver character literally escapes into the book and you see his adventures of the indian boys quest to stop \\"The Nothing.\\" The Nothing is an excellent enemy: formless, unstopable, it's only goal is to destroy whatever is in it's path. It represents the gradual disentegration of imagination and fantasy. But within this world there is still hope represented by the princess, Falcor, and the characters scattered throught the film.Amazing work by Wolfgang Petersen and his crew. It blew me away to find out he had directed this movie considering I had known him as the director of some of the best and most intelligent action films I've seen: Das Boot, Air Force One, In the Line of Fire. He did this incredible job of making the film appeal to kids and adults at the same time without being, well, sappy!:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"great blu-ray! buy it!","review":"This movie was obviously restored before the transfer to blu-ray.

The hero's quest to save his world is seen through the eyes of the reader of a fantasy book, in this case, young Bastian. He skips school in favor of reading this 'neverending story,' and eventually finds himself so much in the book that fantasy and reality collide. Visually, this film is beyond words. All of the creatures and characters that occupy the world of Fantasia have to be seen to be believed. The story is timeless, and the film is great. But don't see the sequels.

It took nowhere near an infinite amount of time to watch it. If they call it never ending, it really shouldn't ever end. I just heard they have a sequel out, so I'm going out to buy it tomorrow.

I mean it ended right. Isn't that called false advertising. I am very dissapointed, I was expecting to have a continous on going story. The title mislead me from the start. Ok so they marde part 2 but where are the rest of the parts. If it truly is the Neverending story then there should be an infinite number of parts, coming out at regular intervals.

I reccommend the The neverending Story II The Next Chapter but the third is better left unsaid. I love the Auryn and the shape that it is in. As far as I know, Stephen Spielburg has it hanging in a glass cover in his office. I it just so amazing.

Since I was really into Fantasy movies.

I suggest this movie to anyone who has young children."},{"rating":"2","title":"The NeverEnding Story","review":"One of the greatest motion pictures of all time! The Special Effects were so ahead of its time that you would think that this movie was done by using CGI (Computer Generated Imagery). In fact Steven Spielberg loves The NeverEnding Story so much that the original Auryn prop is in a glass case at his office. Hope to see a Directors Cut or Special Collectors Edition someday! I need to point out a very important fact on this DVD. The picture is presented at a 2.35:1 aspect ratio and not at a 1.85:1 ratio as stated in the Technical Department!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be owned by everybody","review":"I had the profound privllege of seeing this movie in it's inital theatrical release and have enjoyed it ever since. I am normally not a science-fiction person, but the theatrical special effects in this movie are so well-constructed and implemented that I am always entraced by this particular release.Essentially, a lonely boy faces a humdrum existence until he gets a hold of a magical book and discovers the amazing story inside--and his role as an active participant in at least saving the Empress from the clutches of the nothing. Again, what microscopic holes do exist (how the Empress and the boy are standing in the end if Nothing really has decimated all but one grain of sand in her world) are overshadowed by the vastly superior bulk of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"incredible family movie - a classic!","review":"This is a classic movie to be enjoyed by everyone in the family.

Now that I'm older I've done something that many people feel to be boring or useless. I've actually READ THE BOOK and it is glorious! For one thing, the book is much more in depth, Artax can talk in the book, Falkor looks \\"leonine\\" (it specifically states \\"leonine face\\"), Atreyu is much more noble, and the southern oracle is way more than just a couple of sphinxes. One thing I want to clear up forever: FALKOR IS NOT A GIANT FLYING DOG! HE IS A LUCK DRAGON AND IS SUPPOSED TO LOOK PEARLY WHITE, DRAGONLIKE, AND LIONLIKE AT THE SAME TIME! Also, the book goes way beyond Bastian just saying the child-like empresses' name. The second, and especially the third movies are even worse! They should each have -10 stars! This one is lucky to get one. All you people so enthralled with this horrid scrap of screentime you call a movie should read the book. It is much better. The books always are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of a Blu-Ray disc","review":"I picked this up out of the bargain bin at the local big box store, where it was only one of two Blu-Ray titles on sale. I love the movie, but even paying bargain bin price I felt cheated after buying this disc.I have a 1080p HDTV and a Blu-Ray player connected by HDMI cable. The back of the box says it's 1080p, but it looks awful for a Blu-Ray movie. They didn't bother with any picture enhancements AT ALL. The colors are off, and there's noise and artifacts, which are inexcusable on BD. Not only is the transfer extremely LAZY, there are NO extra features. Not one. The sound was OK but I can't judge the 5:1 because I don't have a surround sound system.If you have one of the DVD releases, don't bother getting this one. Shame on WB for the cheap money grab."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will your child like a 26 year old movie?","review":"Without a doubt. The graphics and special effects are pretty good for a movie this old. My 9 year old was a little scared the first time they watched it, not knowing what was comming next, but after that first viewing couldn't wait to watch it again, and has many times since. I was in my 20s when this movie came out, and I think I was more excited about watching this movie again than my child was. It's a great family movie that can teach parents that it's ok to let your kids be dreamers, and kids that great adventures are just a book away. You just have to open them."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Classic Fantasy!\\"","review":"Noah Hathaway and Barret Oliver star in this 1984 fantasybased on the book.

It has a GREAT choice of people to play the characters. My favorite, is Noah Hathaway. I totally fell head over heals for him in the movie!

He was the \\"void\\" of all that \\"people\\" wanted and wished for...And I think that his character deserves a little more respect than we have given him...There cant be Fantasy without reality...And I think that the Gamalk was the link between the two as well as Bastian, I sort of view the Gamalk as a part of Bastian as well, Atreyu was the good part of him and the Gamalk was the evil part of him...Does anyone agree with me???"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Story for Every Child Who Dreams","review":"Well, I first rented this movie as a boy--and boy did I ever love it! That was back in the early 1990s, when VHS was all there was. Hey, we all thought cassette tapes were great when that's all we had; audio tapes were also plentiful.This movie makes the ultimate example of getting caught up in an experience. Based on a children's fantasy by the German author Michael Ende, it is about a boy reading a book and then journeying inside that book to live in a real parallel universe. Fantasia is being destroyed by humanity's lack of imagination. To get home the boy must find a magical princess and give her a new name, thus restoring the status quo.Filled with fun and adventure--and a moral for you parents, that is to never let your imaginations atrophy.Enjoy, dream big, and dream on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Eternal Favorite","review":"I believe I was around six years old when I first saw this film.

Many of those films that stand the test of time are from the Fantasy genre, including Labyrinth and Dark Crystal. Would I add Neverending Story to that list? Hell no. The dubbing is atrocious (funny Germans), and the costumes and \\"effects\\" are flat-out bad. Labyrinth looks better than many movies released these days, and easily trumped Neverending Story when it was released two years later. The story and plot had the potential to be interesting, but the execution makes Neverending fall flat. And sure, Neverending Story may have advocated reading in the mid-80's, but Labyrinth advocated the use of psychedelics, which is the next step up for mind expansion."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little dusty","review":"Notwithstanding the greatness of the special effects, the whole content and message of the film have not aged terribly well. In today's world, children need a message a little deeper than: \\"Wish and it will come true\\". The ultimate irony of the film though is the fact that it has been outfoxed by a video game version known as \\"Final Fantasy Tactics Advance\\". In that game Sebastian's wishing turns on him creating a fictional world where he becomes a tyrant and no one grows emotionally. This irony is compounded because the bookstore owner in the film warns the audience against the \\"shallowness\\" of video games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love The Movie, Hate The Shipper","review":"I've seen this movie before, so I knew what I was getting.

The pre-digital style was amazing technology for the time, and still seems real enough that you can enjoy the fantasy. We enjoy playing this in the background at fantasy parties such as Halloween, dress-up or costume birthday parties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sensoring, really?","review":"I love this movie but give it 2 out of 5 stars, as I noticed on two occassions that dubbing was enacted to sensor the swear word.

So much so that I had to pull out the original DVD to check it out. Lo and behold, the standard DVD ACTUALLY LOOKS BETTER than the Blu-ray. I was able to \\"upgrade\\" to blu for only $5, but I thought it was necessary to let anyone else know to save their money...even if it is only 5 bucks. If you don't already own the movie and still want it, you may want to look for the DVD version instead as you can probably get it cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of the four.","review":"National Lampoon's European Vacation is just plain horrible. I hate this one more than Vegas Vacation, Vacation and Christmas Vacation are the most funny and original. I am surprised this second film of the franchise is directed by Amy Heckerling, all of her other films are brilliant. Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo reprise their roles and even though all the Rusty's and Audrey's are different actors, these two airheads are so untalented, where did they get these two kids from? Stay away from European Vacation, it's a piece of trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the vacation movies","review":"I've watched the original Vacation countless times and also Christmas Vacation. I've always enjoyed them both so I figured I'd check this one out, as well as Vegas Vacation. The humor is just horrible in this movie, none of it is even funny to me. The same can be said for Vegas Vacation. Chevy Chase tries to stay true to the original Clark character in this movie and he fails. The kids are very forgettable too. The series follows this pattern: Good movie, terrible movie, good movie, terrible movie. I kind of figured the sequel would be decent and they would go downhill from there but this is different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing trash","review":"Do not buy this movie! This is the most disappointing Vacation movie out there. Not only was it very slow, it included multiple shots of female frontal nudity, which wasn't expected as it was only PG-13! Buy Vegas Vacation or Christmas Vacation instead. Both of those movies are hilarious."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Griswalds take on Europe","review":"This time Clark Griswald and family win a European vacation on a television gameshow.The worst of the vacation movies, it's not that there are no laughs there are a few,mostly provided by Chevy Chase. The laughs aren't often enough, and there are too few of them. The scene were Clark backs into Stonehedge is classic. If you must see this, I recommend renting this instead of buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie, Bad DVD","review":"This was a good movie, especially for a sequel, and would be followed by two other sequels featuring Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo. This time instead of going to WallyWorld they go to Europe. The funniest part is when the Camcorder is stolen and it and a naked picture of the wife appears in Italy. The DVD is horrible there is no deleted scenes, commentaries, or anything. The Widescreen is horrible. If you really like this movie buy it on DVD but don't expect much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there done that!!","review":"I was in this film and I think it's pants. Rusty's dream sequence on the plane to London where he is in a \\"nightclub\\" surround by punks - that's me - 2nd punk on the left with a large red and black mohican, if you freeze frame you can actually see me!! Except for that split second there is nothing of merit in this dreadful sequel to a quite funny original.

If you're European and have watched Americans on vacation in Europe, then you may think it's a documentary. I watched this film with my (then) German girlfriend and two of her fellow history students, an American and his Belgian girlfriend. We two Americans laughed our heads off. The European women couldn't see what was so funny because, in their eyes, the film merely reflected the facts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical National Lampoon Humor","review":"I saw this movie, originally, when it came out in theatres.

They get to stay in several different countries over the course of there vacation.(Some include France,Germany, etc.)Towards the end , they run in to some trouble with \\"badguys\\", but get out of it eventually as they always do.This movie wasn't as good as the others in the series, but i do recomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"THEY FORGOT TO PACK THE LAUGHS","review":"This second entry in the NL VACATION series is pretty lame; it's like the scriptwriters forgot to pack any laughs to accompany the Griswolds. I kept waiting for something really funny to happen as it did in the first Vacation film. But in this one, the Griswolds win a trip to Europe, and wind up destroying the Stonehenge in England; doing absolutely nothing in Paris; causing a brouhaha at a festival in Germany; and chasing kidnappers in Rome. Ho hum...and it's all done with no verve or energy. Chevy Chase looks bored to tears and Beverly D'Angelo tries so hard it's pitiful. The kids, Dana Hill and Jason Lively, are even more obnoxious than the first time. All in all, a capital offense: a comedy that just isn't funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of the series","review":"Mildly amusing at times. But the worst of the Vacation series!

She is surrounded by a bunch of cliche males, allof whom are also pretty annoying. Her parents are played (written and acted dismally) by the usually great Bill Pullman and Debra Winger.

Well written and well-acted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky and original","review":"Greta Gerwig has become a bit of the indie it-girl lately, and Lola Versus is a perfect example of why. Her girl-next-door sexiness and quirky sense of humor make her characters lovable and relatable. Lola Versus is a fun film about a young woman in the big city facing the tribulations of love, sex, and life in general. It's an honest and heartfelt film that is as fun as it is emotional.

The very next sentence tells his employee to go home and clean up his damaged home but to be back 'first thing tomorrow morning with your tools and brothers to clean up his mess'.

The book carries you through what life is like on \\"island time\\" and the challenge of trying to be organized on an unorganized Caribbean island. You get to know the Blanchard's and their staff at the restaurant on a personal level.

Aside from providing a thoroughly enjoyable account of their move to Anguilla, the book is also a passionate description of how one can make a dream come true, and with not that much money at all. Having said that, their repeated references to the Anguillan \\"paradise\\" maybe a bit excessive when one considers the horrible red-tape, vicious hurricanes and logistic nightmares they had to deal with. But perhaps that is what makes this book really excellent: it is a realistic view of the pros and cons of the Blanchards' choice, devoid of sticky romanticism and with no trace whatsoever of the smugness and superiority complexes one often finds in writers who move to a foreign country and tell their story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Early Readers","review":"This has wonderful real life photos and short relatively easy to read pages for the early reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to give children an opportunity to learn both geometry and creativity.","review":"This toy is better than I expected.

Now, as I said this is for my four year old, it is cute, very cute for a child's room. If you are looking for a chandelier for something fancy, do not buy this one. This is fit for a child's room or playroom. It gives off great light and does actually sparkle. I love it and my daughter was so excited when she saw it hanging in her room. It's a great buy at a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby girls chandelier","review":"I loved this chandelier we bought for our baby girls nursery. Its small and the perfect size. We paired it with a small white medallion from Lowe's and get soo many compliments on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shabby and nice for the price","review":"This small chandelier can be hardwired or used as a mounted ceiling lamp. The product itself is very pretty to look at, a little on the small side but it is only 3 bulbs. It seems to give off quite a bit of heat for 3 - 25 Watt bulbs. All hardware for a basic ceiling mount or hard wired installation are provided. However, the instructions don't provide details on what to do with the ground wire if not hard wired into the house. Packaging Lamp does give off a slight ruby tint from the beads. Overall it is pretty and I am happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"Exactly as shown and very quick shipping! I bought this for my small \\"water closet\\" in the master bath and it looks great. Highly recommend. Make sure it is not too small for any area larger than a bathroom though.

What a waste of time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price.!","review":"Chandelier came in bent and it was shipped that way. Horrible material and cheap. Very small chandelier to be priced for $70.00 USD. Would not recommend. If they would sell it for $20.00 it would be in that catagory for cheap range.! The Picture makes it look so pretty and worth it. However, it is very deceiving."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful not entirely black","review":"my husband and I bought this light fixture for our baby daughters room, its lime green with black furniture, and I thought this light would be perfect but when its on if you look up at it from certain angles, its actually a reddish-purple tinted which Im a little disappointed with but over all it looks gorgeous in my daughters room!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good!","review":"Like most, I saw the movie first (died laughing), and expected the book to be so-so.

I had trouble finding the book but when I finally did I was totally impressed. I am only on the fourth chapter and have decided that I want to buy it. I will always love the movie and I make everyone I know watch it at least once. They all have grown to love it too. I hope they DO NOT come out with a sequel because then it will ruin the original movie. The first is always the best and always will be. Dont change what doesnt need to be changed. Princess Bride will always be my all time favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book to read over and over and over again","review":"This book has healed serious illness, cured the blues, substituted for the lack of a love life and generally been a wonderful companion through countless readings. Having purchased innumerable paper back copies of this book to give to friends (and enemies) it was with great, great pleasure that I found the hard cover edition. This 25th anniversary commemorative version includes the long lost chapter, \\"Buttercup's Baby,\\" which adds an unexpected element of spiritualism to the magic of this beloved tale.This is a book to read alone or read aloud. This book can be used as an antidote to excess cynacism, a polstice for a wounded heart or as a stimulant for an underused imagination. Share this book with those you love and use this book as a test for those you would love -- you wouldn't want to spend you life with anyone who doesn't just love it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"This is one of the best ever! I read this book over 10 years ago, right before the movie came out. While the book is better than the movie, don't miss that either. Both are wonderfully funny and whimsical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than the Movie!","review":"It is rare when a movie lives up to the intentions of the book, and Rob Reiner's The Princess Bride is a FANTASTIC rendition, but where-oh-where is The Zoo of Death???? Read the book, if for no other reason to know of Inigos' and Fezziks' journey through it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Princess Bride you remember!","review":"Ok, so maybe there is no \\"Princess Bride\\" book except this one, if that is the case I will just live without reading it. This was terrible, all chopped up and in the middle of these chapters this guy starts blabbing again about his \\"other\\" books he's written. I don't care! I got this book to read the story that the movie was based on NOT what thos golman guy thinks is interesting and about his dumb career!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameless profit taking and pablumization.","review":"I find this book quite offensive. Mr. Goldman is certainly not the rediscoverer of Morgenstern's book, which was never really lost. Rather he has produced a film edited version that is proof that modern publishers and producers have no confidence in the intelligence of their readership. Bypass this abridgement and seek rather for the original masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"What a load of garbage. First of all getting though the boring yuck of his life story is just stupid. Then the story, parts aren't half bad. Getting interrupted by his italics was maddening. This book was not worth my money,time or effort. Save yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"William Goldman's destruction of \\"The Princess Bride\\"","review":"This version of The Princess Bride annoyed me in many ways. For instance, William Goldman deleted whole sections of the original story. As if he knew exactly what the reading public wanted to read. I for one, would much rather read an original classic than to read a butched story and spoon fed only selected portions. The title of this book should read \\"The Princess Bride as written by S. Morgenstern as destroyed by William Goldman. Shame on you Mr. Goldman for destroying what could have been an enjoyable reading experience with your pointless cuts and intrusive ramblings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo!","review":"Was looking for the original version that would mirror the movie with a classic feel. This was NOT it. Returned. Disappointed. Can't find what I want anywhere. This book has some screen play from another writer inside. Boo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Suprisingly BAD","review":"I loved the movie, and perhaps it was that that ruined this book for me. I found the fact that he kept pointing out WHERE he was skipping over the princess going over her zillion dresses and whatnot EXCEPTIONALLY dull.... I know why they left all of that out of the movie, it is boring. I usually keep a hold of all of the books I read. I don't own this one anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"So incredibly overrated!","review":"This has to be one of the most egomanical books I've ever read. The forced cleverness and side bars are oh-so unnecessary! Can S. Morgenstern get his head through a door with an ego that big? I doubt it.A classic? Hardly. And it is basically a good storyline. It's such a pity that the author goes off on his self-aggrandizing chatter all the time.Do yourself a favor. Buy the movie! Peter Falk is worth the price of admission! Now there is a narrator!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a pathetic book!","review":"This book brought tears to my eyes because it was so... AWFUL!!! I was expecting a nice fairy tale-and instead- I got a boring, stupid book where the author comes in every page and a half talking about how golf was invented then. This book is only, ONLY for people for really, really, really, quirked senses of humor! If tyhe rating of zero was available I would give the Princess Bride a -3. Not a worothy book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buttercups Baby","review":"This was a tight book but I would like to know where I can buy Buttercups Baby please tell me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ripping!","review":"This book is set after the invention of blue jeans, but before the invention of Europe, and it opens with a history of the most beautiful women in the world. It is a mix of high adventure and sharp wit that is a delightful read, but it's also something more.The story is peppered with the comments of its \\"abridger\\" and it is in these comments that the true beauty of the book shines through. Behind the tongue-in-cheek story about beautiful princesses, strong men, fencing, kidnapping, miracle workers, devilish tortures, and let's not forget self-immolation, is a story about a boy whose life was changed by a story, and a man who who is desperately hoping that the same story can change it again.A must-read that will stay with you forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Fairy Tale On Planet Earth!","review":"This book is my all-time favorite. It has every interesting theme available in less than 250 pages. I would recommend it to every person with a heart, sense of humor, and love of fantasy. It is a timeless classic, and one would have to be completely insane not to recognize it for what it is: an incredibly stupendous work of art!"},{"rating":"2","title":"International Favourite","review":"I bought this book in a store in Perth, Australia when I was bored one day. I finished it within a week, and my copy has since been borrowed by friends from New Zealand, Australia, Thailand, Zimbabwe, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and other Americans. The consensus from everyone is \\"Wow - I knew the movie was good, but who knew the book could be this great?!\\"I've been fortunate to keep my hands on my original copy and anyone who's read it has signed their name to it - but enough about my copy. This is a book that must be read, and read often. Buy it when you're 12. Read it a few hundred times. Hang on to it so you can read it to your children in 20 years. But now that you've even looked at this page, you are doing yourself a GRAVE injustice if you fail to buy it. The themes are timeless. But the plot is realistic - no one really believes in \\"happily ever after\\" - this book makes you belive in \\"happily ENOUGH ever after.\\"I just want a t-shirt that says \\"Westley Never Dies!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairy Tales Abound","review":"I love this book...I had been a fan of the movie for many years. The book held magic for me, as did the movie...This is a book you can have fun with. I recently read it to my boyfriend when he had the flu. With fencing, fighting, revenge, true love, and miracles, who can go wrong? Plus it holds alot of background information about Inigo and Fezzick that wasn't in the movie. YAY!!!

This is different than the movie, so don't expect a word-for-word printed version of the movie. The book does do a better job of fleshing out the characters.The book starts with an introduction meant to lead the reader into thinking this is an abridged version of the childhood story the author heard from his father. The book is full of parts that have been \\"cut\\" from the story for our reading enjoyment. It can sometimes get a little confusing to keep straight, and occasionally the extra bits can distract from the flow of the story, but overall, the whole package makes for a very fun and entertaining read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The Princess Bride is one of my all time favorite movies, so when I saw the ebook, I got very excited! Sadly, it was a waste if $4. The narrative was boring and distracting.

Not only are you missing are more detailed description of the high adventure, but you are also missing the wit of William Goldman who narrates the tale throughout with little blurbs of his \\"experiences.\\"I've loved the movie since I first saw it when I was 12 years old and now the book just makes things so much better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really, really good.","review":"This book is great. It is, I think, the funniest book ever written, and Goldman has managed to capture the essence of true fantasy.

However, I recently spent a vacation in Florin where I was given the priveledge of reading the full story.

I loved the movie and thought that the book would be better, but I was seriously wrong. When they mean the abridged version, they were not kidding. I was informed that the original story is close to 1,000 pages and this book is probably less than 300 pages if you got rid of the author's commentary which hinders the story most of the time. The author took so much away from the book when he abridged it that I felt disappointed when I finished the book. I would never have bought the book if I knew that was how it was going to be. If you want to read the Princess Bride, try getting the original by S. Morgenstern."},{"rating":"1","title":"Upsetting","review":"I am appalled that starting with the title-\\"A Hot Fairy Tale\\"-was included. I am also appalled that this book has been okayed for children to read when the publishers have included in the introduction that there is a Little Sex in the story when there is none. It is misleading information such as this that has ruined this book as well as others by not allowing Junior High students to be able to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hats off to Goldman!","review":"Read it in a one day, the last time I read it.

If you read it, it will make you truly happy. The suspense, the humour, the comedy, the crying, the starlet and the psychiatrist wife all go to make this book probably the best collection of good parts that I have ever had the fortune to read.Life isn't fair, and this book tells you that but it also tells you that you should never give up trying for what you want. No matter what it is, if you want it badly enough, you have to keep trying. It took me years to find a copy - I have now bought 4 - I lend it out and never see it again!!If you haven't read this book, what are you reading this for - go buy it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great comedy; romance versus real life on several levels.","review":"Goldman works some great magic in this book! He tells a story within a story. And the comical and romantic fable at the heart of the book is truly irresistible, with, as he advertises, the most beautiful woman in the world, the bravest man, true love, absolute courage, and all the best and worst, brightest and darkest, and a ton of action and adventure. But beyond that, the book is full of witty commentary, and ironic observations, as well as a gentle moral lesson produced by juxtaposition with Goldman's real life. In addition, it left me with the burning desire to read the original by S. Morgenstern (yes, it is a real book!), although I know that will be hard to find"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wish I liked this more...","review":"This one is so hard for me to review. This is one of my favorite stories of all time, but it's not the book that I'm in love with. It's the movie. I am utterly obsessed with the film adaptation of this novel. The novel itself, however, is just not my favorite. I want to like it. I truly do. But I just can't. It is too long and drawn out and the characters just get confusing. The story really needed to be pared down a little more before being published in my opinion. I'm so sad to give this a negative review, but I feel like I just have to. I really didn't enjoy the novel at all. But I HIGHLY recommend the movie!!! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have to say I'm a bit disappointed by the book. I saw the movie first and then read the book. The fact that he jumps in all the time with this fake back story really bugs me, as well as a lot of continuity errors.

(It's MILES better)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I watched the movie when I was little, and then read 1987 edition later in high school. The book is missing Cary Elwes as Westley imo, but the movie is missing the *narration* in the book. Half the book is in the narration.Good books have multiple layers. This book has three:1. It is an excellent tale of True Love and High Adventure2. It is an excellent satire on True Love and High Adventure3. It is an excellent satire on satireI second the recommendation to skip the 25th anniversary intro until you've read the rest of the book.

The book is even better than the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful story no personal library should be without","review":"I was introduced to the story, like many, many others via the movie. My husband and I (just dating then) fell in love with it so much that we even have a line engraved in our wedding rings--\\"As you wish...\\" For our anniversary one year, I bought the book for him and we really, really enjoyed it. It was probably the most romantic gift I ever gave him. There's something for everyone in this book--fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, true love, you name it. I do not enjoy romance novels, but even someone who indulges in something as trivial as that genre will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adventure at its best","review":"The story in this book is excellent, one of the best in its genre. However, I don't like the way that the author toys with the readers regarding the supposed origins of the book. Clearly Goldman wrote this book himself, not the misterious Morgenstern, and it's not at all abridged.Anyone living in Europe knows that Florine and Guilder are not countries, but Dutch currency. It was fun at first, but after hundreds of pages of clear lies, I got fed up with it. He goes way too far, involving Stephen King as supposed abridger for the followup, and lawyers suing him for profeting on the non-existant Morgensterns work and so on.If he would have left out the abridgement parts this would clearly have become a classic book, and I would have given it a 5 star rating.Buy it - read it, but skip all the abridgement comments."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WHAT I EXPECTED","review":"THIS IS AN EDITED VERSION WHICH I GUESS I WASN'T AWARE OF.

THIS MAN IS THE SAME MAN THAT WROTE THE SCREEN PLAY FOR THE MOVIE SO ALL THE THINGS HE FOUND INTERESTING ENOUGH TO PUT IN THE MVIE ARE ALSO LEFT IN THE BOOK. EVERYHING ELSE HAS BEEN REMOVED. HE'S ALSO A SPOILER. IF YOU'RE READING THIS BOOK AND DON'T ALREADY KNOW THE STORY YOU WILL NEED TO SKIP ALL THE INTERUPTED EDITOR NOTES THROUGH OUT THE BOOK.

There is only one good thing about this book: the characters are so unrealistic that they are funny. Many times, I found myself laughing becuase of the stupidity of it all.

I was a little skepticle about reading the book because I didn't want to ruin my love for the movie. Boy, was I ever wrong.This book is just what the doctor ordered for any fan of the movie. It has all of the character background information that the movie lacks, not to mention continuing past the end of the movie....until the birth of Buttercup's Baby. It is true that the book is much darker than the movie (i.e. Pit of Dispare = Zoo of Death), but it's not distasteful. After finishing the book, I put it away with a new love for the story, but I did not loose any love for the movie since it is so different in mood and detail that the book.I have read the book a few times now and every time I do, I then immediately watch the movie with equal zest.

Maybe you had to read this book in the pre-ironic mid-70s for that to be a big deal, but it was for me. This book and its followup, \\"Marathon Man,\\" were my literary \\"Revolver\\" and \\"Rubber Soul\\" in my late teen years. Just phenomenal."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only person in the western world to not like this book","review":"I bought this book based on my love of the movie and universal raves from everyone. I haven't been this disappointed since I bought The Natural, (another screenplay that out did the original). William Goldman wrote the screenplay so I have no fault with him but where the movie was sharp and crisp, the book was too wordy, and (apparently only to me) lacking in virtually all I found romantic and exciting in my pre-reading the book experiences of The Princess Bride. I'm sure no one will find this review helpful but atleast I know that Mr Goldman can write a damn good screenplay from a subpar original story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Morgenstern's version is way better","review":"OK, so am I the only one who's actually been to Florin? It's a lovely country with the most beautiful women in the whole world.If you are ever there, go to the library and check out Morgenstern's original. Since every Florinese person has read the book hundreds of times there are a ton of copies at the library and you can always get one. Unfortunately, there's not enough demand in the US so they won't export it. The original is SOOO much better. Goldman seems to think he has all the answers to what's good and what isn't. The long section of all the festivities before the wedding is dripping with sarcasm and hilarity and yet Goldman feels we Americans can't read it because we'd be bored. Well boo on Goldman! I loved that chapter!Anyway, the original would get 5 stars if they'd ever export it to the US. Save yourself the anguish in this shameless abridgment and spend a few hundred dollars and fly to Florin, you'll thank me later."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Love","review":"The Princess Bride is a book about plain and clear love. It tells the story about how much two people can love each other. A young girl named Buttercup becomes the most beautiful girl in the world. She can have any man she wants but she chooses a poor farm boy named Weasly. It may sound like a silly choice but she loves him as he loves her. Then a tragedy occurs and her love is thought to be lost forever. She dies in her soul and decides to marry a rich but evil prince.What has happened to her love, Weasly? Will she marry the evil prince? What lies ahead in Buttercup's future? This book is about a giant, a swordsman, a six fingered man, a torture chamber, an evil prince, a zoo of death, hate, revenge and true love. It will make you laugh and make you cry. The author blends humor with love to make a wonderful and touching story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"This is one of the most increadible books I have read in a long time.

If you like good books, read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just rating the quality.","review":"Haven't read the book yet, but as far as the quality of the book, it is absolutely beautiful. However, I'm a little frustrated with Amazon for how this purchase went. I had a discount which I used on this book, but it said the book was out of stock and they would ship it as soon as they could. Well I got an email a little while later saying that they couldn't fulfill the shipment and cancelled the order. The book I ordered was replaced by a newer (and more expensive) edition. Well since I still got to use my discount, I still ordered the book, but the whole process was annoying. I'll deal though because the book itself is beautiful and it will be a wonderful addition to my library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the movie","review":"This book is interesting, and is recommended if one has not seen the movie, but unlike most books, it is not better than the movie. Much of the movie comes straight from the book, and no imagination can come up with a better giant than Andre the Giant. The parts of the book that deal with the same events as in the movie, but differ in details, are inferior to the portrayal of the events in the movie.The book certainly is humorous, but the constant interuptions of Goldman discussing the fictional Morgenstern get old quickly. Maybe some people find this great, but in my opinion, it just takes away from the story.Still, the book contains a lot to holds one's interest. It deals with pirates, dueling, torture, love, and many other things. It is full of action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother,","review":"I am glad I checked it out of the library and did not pay for. I read the abridged version, but really don't think it made a difference. The book was choppy, but long at the same time. This version used so much of the book's pages to self promote Goldman (I skipped most of it) and his new Buttercup's Baby. I agree with the others, watch to movie, don't read the book. It's a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"to book or movie that is the question","review":"I like the book better than the movie personaly, because the book has such things as Zoo-of-Death. The albino in the moive the got clubbed over the head and did nothen else, but in the book the albino showed them the way and gave them his wheelbarolw. the only good part of the movie i though was that the maricle man was played by Billy Crystal, and his wife (The witch) was really really scary looking. On the cliffs of insanity the horses weren't white like they were suppose to be and Prince Humperdink wasn't a big masculine guy like in the book he was and could switch horses wile he was riding so no one horse had to bear all of his weight all the way through the ride. In the movie the albino was pushing a \\"hand-cart\\" , wile in the book he had a \\"Wheelbarrol\\". Again i felt that the book was ALOT better than the movie. In the movie Westly wasn't very well played amd look alittle \\"odd\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"huge disappointment","review":"I had such high hopes. I love to read and had never gotten to the book after enjoying the movie repeatedly for so many years. Except for the middle of the book which has the actual story that was used for the movie, it's all BS. A bunch of stuff that means nothing. It doesn't even set up the story like another more favorable reviewer said. It is just a huge waste of time. And though I love to read, I do read slow and I felt like this author was just playing a big trick on me. So kudos for the part that was an actual story. Big fat boos to the rest of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Princess Bride.","review":"The book was in great shape when I recieved it. The only problem was it was a little late. It took about 13 days to recieve it. Otherwise, it was in good shape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good at all","review":"I feel very cold towards Mr. Goldman, because now that he's made the abridgement, I can't seem to find an original copy anywhere, and most of the information he left out could have been very important to me. Even if he cut down 1,000 pages to 300, he left out some parts I would have enjoyed reading, for example, I am interested in medieval etiquette, and can rarely find that without at least one hundred pages I'm not interested in."},{"rating":"1","title":"The original was much better!!!","review":"W. Goldman has abridged this classic by omitting over 100 pages of the original. If anyone has an available copy of the original by S. Morgenstern or knows somewhere to get it please email me!!!

Thank You Very Much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am not amused . . . . .","review":"I was expecting to read the book \\"The Princess Bride\\", not visit some egomaniac's playground.I didn't know I would have to wade thru (actually, skip over...) nearly 100 pages of \\"foreword\\" to even GET to the book, & then dodge all the \\"excerpt\\" explanations. Which, by the way, don't help, all they do is interrupt the flow.No, I'm not a \\"movie\\" type of person, I would much rather read a book than watch a movie. But in this instance I will make an exception, watch the film & forget the book . . . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Princess Bride","review":"A timeless classic that has an additional \\"Introduction to the 30th Anniversary Edition\\". The book is also missing the amazingly detailed map of Florin and Guilder. All else is the same from the 25th Anniversary edition published by Ballantine. HB size is a little larger than the previous edition. Before storming the castle one might want to check both editions out for verbiage or map preferences. True love is not inconceivable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Book","review":"This is the best adventure/pirates/princesses/magic book ever. And undoubtedly the funniest. For those of you who didn't like Morgenstern's comments throughout the book, you are insane. They were hilarious. I have loved this book since I was 11 or 12 years old. I had lost someone close to me and somebody suggested that I get this book to cheer me up. To that person, THANK YOU. Now I'm a freakishly fast reader and have read hundreds of books. This is my favorite of them all. One problem though, if you loan this book out, it won't come back. I'm purchasing my second copy as I have given up waiting for my own to return to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming","review":"It's hard to read \\"Princess Bride\\" without thinking of the wonderful movie adaptation of the book. But the movie just enhances the experience of the absolutely charming book.It's a classic adventure-and-love story. The most beautiful woman in the world, the strongest man in the world, the best sword-fighter in the world, the most fearsom pirate in the world, the world's greatest torturer, and the world's greatest hunter. And the world's deepest love.It's fun and funny in many parts, with sly asides about that mock the conventions of the adventure story. But it also has pathos, especially during the numerous interruptions that bedevil the ultimate lovers Buttercup and Westley and during Westley's torture.Finally, it's a book for almost all ages -- just as is claimed in the wrapping story that frames the book. It can be read to a 10-year-old, enjoyed by a high schooler, and zipped through by an adult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I've been in love with the tale of The Princess Bride since I was eight years old and just hope that William Goldman sees fit to finish \\"Buttercup's Baby\\" one day for all of us die hard fans who still wait to hear the story of Waverly and her protectors."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mess of a story about a fairy tale","review":"This was a story about a story; however, both present and the past were not consistent. I don't understand the high ratings. I never saw the movie and didn't like the missing parts of the present author. The fairy tale had too many happy endings and the very end was very confusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"Princess Bride - one of the best movies and books of ALL TIME.ONLY fault: William Goldman has this weird third voice threading throughout the story meanwhile being the pseudonym of CS Morgenstern. I don't know if its annoying or the insanity of genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book ever","review":"I read The Princess Bride a couple of years ago, and it was the best book that I have ever picked up. The only thing I didn't like about it was that it spoiled all other books for me since nothing has ever come close to The Princess Bride. Brilliant book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everybody cracks me up!!!!!!","review":"Who cares about the \\"real\\" author?!?!?! Just enjoy the book and the movie and get over it!!!!! It is the best book ever written and everyone is too concerned about the author. No one is paying attention to the greatness of the book and movie. I have read this book at least 50 times and watched the movie even more! I grew up on The Princess Bride. Back then we did not care who actually wrote it. We knew a good thing when it came along!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Story","review":"William Goldman describes his book as 'The Good Parts' and makes you believe that he abridged it from another author's work. I think that is so funny, because it is so easy to believe that it's true! His writing is hysterical. It's so modernly comical, and to think that the story is meant to take place a century ago and have such behavior and commentary is so very humorous. You'll almost believe in Florin and Guilder and some things in the book that were not included in the AWESOME film are just as funny to imagine as if they had been in the film. I loved this book so much because it was such a change for me - usually I read the book, love it and wait for a film to come out, but this time I saw the film, never realized there was a book to go along with it, and then read the book and really enjoyed it. Highly recommended, you might laugh out loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read.","review":"If you like me grew up watching the movie, you need to read the book. Not sating the book or the movie is better then the other but it would be a disservice to yourself on not enjoying both of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Pleasure","review":"To anyone who seen the Princes Bride movie - it will show why the movie is so good. And for all the rest - I wish a pleasure reading. You will enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just an all-around great book.","review":"Fencing. Fighting. True love. Adventure. What's not to like?Plus, it's really funny. The humor's sly, told with a totally straight face, but it's in there all right, on every page. Also, this book does have some truly touching moments as well. I just...really liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading by anyone","review":"If you liked the movie, you'll love the book. If you haven't, no doubt you know someone who has seen/read it and can't say enough about it. I fall into this category.I think the book is a bit \\"smarter\\" than the movie; the movie left out a lot of the themes that are in the book. It is these themes: love, revenge, the fairness/unfairness of life, and so many others that make it an intereresting and thought-provoking read. All the while, the fun plot keeps you wanting to read more and watch the characters on their adventure.I have never met someone who didn't like the movie or book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, Amazing Book","review":"The Princess Bride is a hilarious satire. To anyone who is tired of romance novels, daytime soaps, and sappy chick-flicks, this book is a must-read. Everything about the book -- from pretend author S. Morgenstern to Buttercup's Stupidity -- is calculated to make readers laugh and remind them that fairy tales do not exist and life is not fair. The Princess Bride is a true classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book I've Read","review":"This book was absolutely amazing. I had seen the movie and wanted to read the book to see if it compared. \\"The Princess Bride\\" truly is a Classic Tale of Love and High Adventure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I think this book is a great novel. I am not usually interested in longer books, but since my class was reading it I was kinda forced to! Now that I am almost done I am loving it and I encourage people everywhere to read it! If you have any interest in books at all you will love this one written by William Goldman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expanded journeys","review":"If you are as huge a fan as I am of the film princess bride, you will most defintalely enjoy this. The book is more of an expanded version of the film. It has more of an involved romance between Wesley and Buttercup while on the farm. She is more bratty. Also there are large back-stories for the characters. (I enjoyed Both fessik's and inigo's. It seems Fessiks parents profited off of his size. And inigo's dad was infatuated with making the perfect sword.) This falls into the great and expansive category of fantasy. But, what a hot one. It takes a lot to make me laugh out loud while reading a story...this one does the trick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I LOVED the movie, but didn't like the book much. I read the book several years ago and wouldn't waste my time on reading it again! The writer makes Buttercup sooooooo stupid that it was really annoying. There are only a couple movies where I would say the movie is way better than the book, this one and Forrest Gump! Don't waste your time on it there are many other great books out there to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abridged","review":"The story was great. I would give it a five star rating. But it was abridged, and the abridger tried to make the book his own. He kept poping in here and there throughout the book to explain why he cut certain parts of the story. But the worst part was that he was also telling his own story at the same time. He claimed that his father read The Princess Bride to him whenever he was sick. Anyone who has watched the movie will immediately see that his story is the same exact one as the boy in the movie's story. Even most of the dialogue is copied from the movie. Another thing the abridger did was tell the story how his father read it to him, which was wrong most of the time, and then explain why his father told it that way, and then he would put the correct version in. It got very confusing. I did not enjoy this book that much. Keep your money and buy an unabridged version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to the movie for the classic tale","review":"Oh man, was I disappointed when I received this. First of all, the author who has abridged the story will not shut up during the story telling, he's constantly interrupting with his comments, that, while vaguely amusing about ten percent of the time, are just rude interruptions in a story. I, for one of the first times in my life, prefer the movie over the book. If only I could rip out the portions where the abridging author interrupts the original author and have that abridged uninterrupted version, then I would be happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book","review":"William Goldman did way better with the screenplay for the movie. This book was actually pretty bad except for die-hard fans of the movie, who might want to see where movie came from. It's hard to believe the same man wrote both the book and the screen play."},{"rating":"2","title":"How quick people are to dismiss Morgenstern","review":"all those who claim that moregenstern doesn't exist obviously don't realize that it happens to be part of william goldman's middle name. just as morgenstern exists as part of mr. goldman's delightfully warped tale. bravo to his book and his screenplay."},{"rating":"2","title":"All-time favourite","review":"I was looking for my copy of this book last week and was very disturbed that it was no where to be found. How glad I am that the publisher has re-relased the book in hardcover. I will never tire of this book. What a shame that the movie left out my favourite scene in the book where Fezik and Inigo descend into the Zoo of Death. All the brilliance of the book can be summarised with the tension and humour of that scene. Loved this book![regarding discussion about abridged v. unabridged versions: Are there really SO many morons in this world?!]"},{"rating":"2","title":"What more could you want?","review":"I found this book highly readable and almost completley captivating. I say almost for one simple reason - the stylistic conceit of pretending to abridge someone-elses work started to get a little silly. Come on people out there, you cannot seriously believe there's an original out there, being jealously guarded by the Shog lawyer clan? Style complaints aside, it's got rapiers, princesses, silly one liners, and it's actually better than the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, exciting, and a great sense of humor.","review":"I originally read the Princess Bride when I was 14, immediately fell in love with Buttercup, Wesley and Inigo. The book reads just as exciting, and just as witty now that I'm 31. Fun, exciting, and a great sense of humor that I don't find in most other adventures, or most other books for that matter. When it comes to a good, fun, adventure of a read, this books ranks as one of my favorites of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book's great, the author's silly","review":"I tried to find the 'original' Princess Bride by S. Morgenstern---the genius William Goldman gives credit to constantly, only to discover (I think) that S. Morgenstern never existed and William Goldman wrote the book himself. Fine--didn't he think we'd like it? Frankly, I find the whole device silly and boring, and I don't enjoy the book as much as I used to. I still do enjoy it, especially the fencing scene, but I hate William Goldman for the stupid way he told the story. And, of course, the charming history of him as a sick boy reading this that never happened. Grow up, Goldman! But the book itself is really, really good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"satisfied","review":"The story itself is wonderful. A definite must read. Just as every book it differs from the movie. The only negative part of the book is how much it is interrupted but the authors thoughts. Regardless it is still a classic and would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLassic","review":"Anyone who loves the movie won't be disappointed by the book.

I was so pleased with his comment \\"better than the movie\\".And we all LOVE the movie.So there we were quoting funny lines to each other and laughing. Imagine three generations all loving and laughing at thesame book. I warned him about sharing, always have a loaner because you might not get it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somehow even better than the movie","review":"As awesome as the movie \\"Princess Bride\\" is, the book is even better. It's funnier, even more clever, and convinces you that there really is a language called Florinese. You won't want to put it down once you've started it!But, what I love most about this edition is that it has three priceless additions: 1) the 25th anniversary introduction; 2) the 30th anniversary introduction, and 3) the GENIUS first chapter of the sequel, \\"Buttercup's Baby\\", entitled \\"Fezzik Dies\\". (The section about Inigo's youth is brilliant and enlightening.)One of my favorite books of all time! The only bummer is that William Goldman never finished the sequel. And, if you're listening, William Goldman: I am one reader who noticed the incremental increases in the amount of time we have to wait for the rest of the sequel! Heartbreaking..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you could ever ask for in a book","review":"This book is astounding, it is written in a unique form and touches every emotion of the reader. It is funny, romantic, adventerous, whimsical, deep, sad, lighthearted and passionate. It touches every aspect of what makes a book good, wether your into adventure, romance, humor etc. or anything for that matter, this book is for you,The characters are one of kind, and you get a great sense of who they are.This isnt just your average fairytale, its one with a brillant twist.This book also conveys many indepth messages to the reader, about the concept of life, death and pain. How life isnt fair, and that if you put your heart and sole into a cause you can triumph, There is always hope.I believe the book is 10 times better then the movie, not that the movie isnt good, but the book has so much more to it then the movie does.If your looking to read a REALLY good book. Pick up \\"The Princess Bride\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHARE THIS BOOK","review":"I first read this book as a teenager, in 1978. I loved sci-fi/fantasy, classic swashbucklers (I read all of Dumas, some in french, and some of which is really awful), fairy tales and puns. Well, this combines them all, pokes fun at them all, and has witty, wonderful dialogue. I laughed until I cried. It is both a fantastic spoof and a classic in the genre it spoofs. I appreciate that it is wonderfully well-written, doesn't take itself too seriously, but lets you have serious insights if you are in the mood. Read it, read it again, share it with adults and children in your life. Oh yeah, then watch the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"I've read many good reviews for this book, so naturally, I had to see for myself how good it was. Well, I was disappointed. This book is definitely for very very very young kids. In fact, it may even bore some of the fantasy loving kids out there in the world. I liked the character of Westley, but I didn't really liked any of the other characters all that much. Overall, big big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Princess Bride","review":"I have not yet read the book but I have seen the movie which was pretty good I am giving four stars to the movie and the book was made after the film so im guessing that they are alikeu rock amazon"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mean-spirited, misogynist, and tiresome","review":"Given all the rave reviews, I feel the need to register a dissenting opinion. I found this book mean-spirited, misogynist, and tiresome. Not funny. Searingly dull in parts.This is the only case I can think of in which I read a book, then saw the movie based on it, and liked the movie better. The movie is cute and funny. (Actually, I'm surprised that I ever went to see the movie, given that I loathed the book so deeply.)Anyway, if you don't like this book, you don't need to feel like a freak: you're not alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but wasn't memorable","review":"I know many people will terrorize our neighborhoods for saying this, but it wasn't the number one book we have ever read. Sure it was okay but it was predictable and shallow. The characters weren't endearing. So we could care less about them.This book is a mockery of romance, adventure and drama. But if you like parodies you have our blessing dive right in. Don't waste your money, borrow it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Edition is uglier than a sack of dead cats.","review":"I just purchased the Kindle edition of the book. Unfortunately, it is in Amazon's execrable \\"Topaz\\" format, which means that it essentially looks like an ugly, pixellated scan of a paperback. No antialiasing, no font smoothing, and terribly, hideously ugly.In other words, avoid the Kindle Edition of this book as if it had head lice, and the head lice were themselves infested with fleas that carried the bubonic plague and which, after giving you the plague, jumped into your food and pooped on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like the Movie?","review":"I love the movie... the book puts it to shame.

Very much. It is funny and charming and well written (whoever did write it!). However, I only gave it four stars because of the \\"abridgers comments\\" which I found very irritating, often giving away the next plot twist, and distracting you from the book just when you were getting caught up in it. Do read the book: just skip the commentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books ever written!","review":"I first heard of this novel when I saw the video at the age of 12. I didn't actually read the book, though, until I taught it to my high school English class last year. I found the synopsis of the book on the back cover to be misleading if you didn't know about the book before reading it. It would make you think that the book contains rough language and sexual content when it doesn't. This story of high adventure has just enough romance and sadness to interest any reader. The subtle comedy is carried throughout the novel and keeps you laughing all the way through. Many of my students said it was the first novel they read all the way through. It definitely is a favorite of mine, and I enjoy re-reading it every year. This book overwhelmingly deserves all five stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Liar! LIAR!","review":"I love this book. It is very complete but very easy to read. It is very true to the movie but with extended dialogue and more information about certain scenes. I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining tale","review":"If you've seen the movie, don't think that this means that you don't need to read the book! There's quite a few differences, and the narrative style of the book includes the author's own comments (which were not included in the writing of the movie)While the story contains various elements of a fairy tale, it is made unique by said author's comments which intersperse the text for a bit of humor and comedy relief, as well as passages of information that were not included in the film. This actually doesn't detract from the story, and I must say that I actually liked the book more than the movie (but the movie IS good nonetheless, mind you!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT! It's now a family tradition to see the movie!","review":"I love this book! Especially the movie though. Ever since my mom showed me it, I can't live a month without watching it!

After I did, I enjoyed the book even more.Fun, light, delicious summer reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Princess Bride","review":"Who knew the movie is sooooooo much better than this book. I was sadly disappointed when I read it. It does resemble the movie, but I actually skipped over the parts where Goldman digresses when telling the tale. It was not the same way Peter Falk digressed, and for this reason, the print version left me cold. I know some of the reviews loved it, check and you will see others feel like I do. If I read this book first, I doubt if I would see the movie. So, for those of you who have not read book or seen the wonderful movie, skip the book, rent the flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Princess Bride","review":"Although the language is stilted and the situations tend to be somewhat hokey, the story is a timeless classic.

Fun for the kids, who realy enjoyed it and read it in no time at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh, laugh... and laugh some more","review":"This book is hilarious on several levels. There's the fact that the \\"good parts\\" is all a joke (if you don't know the truth, go searching; it's very fun/ny), and the funniness of the book itself... Really, this book is just brilliant.There are great, dramatic, and funny characters, all of whom have their happy moments, and their sad, dramatic times. The storyline itself is about a girl who gets chosen to be princess. She is meanwhile mourning for her love, who died at sea. Then she gets kidnapped, and everything really starts there, with hilarities and lots of interesting adventures. Every once in a while, Goldman will cut in with his \\"notes\\" on various bits of nonesense, sticking in lots of very weird stories that leave you thinking, \\"Oh... kay?\\", and ultimately result in a very short and abrupt giggling fit.This book is totally worth reading. It's fun, exciting, and does have some excellent sword fights. It's true; what more could you ask for in a book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Movie, Incredible Book","review":"I read this book when I was in middle school (quite a while ago now) and loved it. I can't wait to read it again. I had seen the movie at that time (it was new) and have seen it many times since. I loved it then and still love it now.I remember being pleasantly surprised that the book was as enjoyable as the movie - more so. Sometimes it's hard to read a book after seeing the movie since you already know the outcome but it didn't matter with The Princess Bride.The book in no way diminishes the movie or vice versa. The book fills out and enriches the story for the movie-viewer. It provides additional detail, background, backstory. And the way \\"reality\\" is injected throughout both the book and the movie is so entertaining as well.This book can (and really should!) be read after the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever and Enjoyable","review":"A fun, intelligent read.

My boyfriend (now husband) heard me say that and read it too. But it's not a \\"romance\\" novel. Instead, it's a comic adventure novel / fairy tale. I'm going to read the \\"good parts\\" to my 7-year old son. The movie's good, the book's better. I love the \\"story within a story within a story\\" structure, the wit, and the oh-so-quotable dialog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!","review":"Do you like romance? Do you like action? Do you like adventure? If you like all three of those then The Princess Bride is the perfect book for you. My teacher read it to us and we all loved it.

This book is about Westly......the handsome, heroic, and brave man who is deeply in love.....Buttercup.....the most beautiful girl in world who is kidnapped......Prince Humperdinck.....the evil ruler of Florin who is upsessed with war, torture, pain, suffering, murder, and Buttercup.......Count Rugen......the Prince's sidekick and the king of torture, agony, and pain.........Vizzini.......the brains of the operation......Fezzik....the giant Turk who is very strong.........and Inigo.........the wonderful swordsman who lives to revenge his father's death.

So when my cousin let me borrow the paperback copy of the book (which she first read in her novels class), I gladly took it and read it. I loved so much that when I saw the 25th anniversary edition, I bought it (even before I had finished the reading the one she gave me). Goldman does an excellant job of making you believe that S. Morgenstern is a real person, Florin and Guilder are real places, and that there is an unabridged version. I just wish he would finish \\"Buttercup's Baby.\\" I can't wait to see what happens in it! I loved this book so much that I am buying copies to give to friends and family.

I was so impressed that I will be ordering a copy for myself!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!","review":"As a fan of the movie, I figured the book must be even better. I was right! It's amazing. The dialog, humor, and overall wit of the author blows me away. Worth reading more than once!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the movie","review":"As a die-hard fan of the movie, I wanted to read the book. The book is good, but the writing style trips over itself at times and can get a little annoying. For instance, the \\"in-joke\\" about the edits to Morgenstern's original version (which doesn't exist) starts to get old pretty fast.Also, there wasn't quite enough new stuff in the book to fully justify my reading it. I'm glad I did, but the movie is definitely paced better and has some of the more boring stuff cut out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the movie, inconcievably great!!! :-)","review":"This probably sounds a little corny, but the Princess Bride is my most favorite book. 500 pages of exitement, mystery, romance-anything you would ever want in a novel, I couldn't put it down. Just imagine yourself as one of the characters and you can go down to the most bottom level of the animal cages in Prince Humperdink's castle or through the firey swamp as Westley and Buttercup escape once again. I highly recommend this book to people of all ages who are willing to go on a wild adventure"},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful fairytale","review":"This is my favorite young adult book. It's a grand adventure and it's full of sarcasm and wit. I admit the female lead isn't quite as strong as I'd like her to be, but still, this is a fun, light hearted, book. It's a good book to read when you want to relax and unwind after finishing a political or religious book. The Princess Bride is worth reading over and over once every summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"A fantasy joke wrapped in a joke, wrapped in whatever material the covers are made out of.Perhaps you could call it a double satire, as the author makes up a framing device of falsehood to insert inbetween the adventures of the over the top princesses, swordsmen, giants and the like.Definitely funny, in parts, but not hilarious.3.5 out of 5"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it almost as much as the movie","review":"I only got this book from the library because I had seen the movie in my childhood and I wanted to experience it again in a different way. I realize my opinion may have been swayed only because I saw the movie first, but I liked the film a bit better than the book. However if I had read the book first, I assume I would have liked that better. But don't take this the wrong way, it's a wonderful book, and well worth reading.

The book is very light reading and very similar to the movie, which many people have seen. If you are looking at this because you liked the movie chances are you'd enjoy the book. However, don't expect too much extra detail or chapters more of new information. To the reviewer complaining about the \\"abridged\\" version-- there is no original version by S. Morgenstern, so really the problem is not an over-abridgement but perhaps not as much development as you would have liked."},{"rating":"2","title":"heart warming","review":"I loved this book! I didn't want to write a review but I felt I needed to because some people didn't realize that S. Morgenstern ISN'T real!- and gave bad reviews because of it. People- why don't you research things before you write your opinions- so you actually know what your talking about!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but...","review":"I liked this book a lot, but I really think it would have been better if Goldman had dropped the \\"Morgenstein\\" idea. For the record, there is no Morgenstein (haven't you ever wondered why you have never seen Florin on a map of Europe?) It is bad enough he wastes the introduction with a fictional story about how his father used to read him this story as a kid and that he felt it his duty to \\"abridge\\" the work of the fictional author S. Morgenstein. Then he really detracts from the story by adding these pointless editorials throughout the book. (One last time, there is no Morgenstein. Goldman made him up).So how good is the story? It certainly is worth the five stars I gave it. But I would like to one day see a version of this book with just the story and Goldman's pointless introduction and remarks abridged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fond Memories","review":"I first encountered this book when my grandfather read it to me when I was ill.

I am broad-shouldered with a wide chest. This jacket fit me nice zipped and unzipped.(I previously had this same jacket as a XL and found the sleeves too short and the jacket was snug on me when zipped up.)Order 1 size larger is the best advice I can give.

The flaccid porn pushing was first a surprise then an impediment , to coin a phrase, to take the humor seriously. The overall persona of the film story became VERY dark which gave a feeling one should be wearing a grungy raincoat and sitting on slightly sticky \\"art theatre\\" seating. Reflecting, the porn stuff had the flavor or the behind the scenes ones in \\"Death At A Funeral\\" if you get my drift. I have walked out of one or two films in my time - difficult to accomplish at home - we looked at each other, said \\"why\\" and turned it off 1/2 into part two.

It was horrible, it was boring, but worst of all it was disappointing ! It (to me) was not even remotely funny, the first episode was largely pornographic, the mystery was shallow and predictable.

Vanbelle sent the foreign policy establishment in a stir earlier this year w/ his publication of press yaddah yaddah... The impact of this book could be felt in toilet stalls around the globe as veterans of the beltway summarily wiped themselves and then proceeded to flush. From the compelling thesis which reconfirms the groundbreaking work of little known tautology expert Raymond Nixon circa 1960, to the novel's anticlimactic finish, one can't help but get goosebumps in awe of van belle's intellectual prowess. Those seven years of undergraduate work really paid off!

That is, of course, assuming that you already knew that countries with freedom of the press tend to have (dramatic pause) a free press..? Complementing this mind-wrenching thesis are mounds of statistical data which all point to one major conclusion: Van Belle has no idea what he is talking about.

The first album, an unlikely but successful collaborative effort between Wilco and Billy Bragg, rekindled the words of Guthrie with music that ranged from whimsical pop to somber narratives, and they always delivered. However, this album felt very much like the scraps on the cutting room floor. Don't bother, the first album said well what needed to be said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Woody's great, but Bragg and Wilco need to get it together.","review":"In \\"Blood of the Lamb\\" Woody writes: \\"Have you learnt to love your neighbors? Of all colors, creeds and kinds? Are you washed in the blood of the lamb? I've learnt to love my peoples of all colors, creeds and kinds. I'm all washed in the blood of that lamb.\\"Apparently, Bragg and Wilco can't say the same even though they sing the lyrics. The hard feelings they developed during the cut of the first alblum can be heard on this alblum. Most of these songs are the out-takes from the first session that they fought over including on the first alblum. This taints and limits the CD in my mind.On Woody's deathbed (just before succumbing to Huntington's Disease) he was asked what religion he was. Guthrie replied \\"all.\\" When told he couldn't answer that way, Woody said \\"all or none.\\" Bragg and Wilco would do well to practice the message that Woody wrote and sang about all his life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great overall","review":"Excellent album; would have preferred more with Billy Bragg as lead vocals, but ah well. Solid overall.

Mermaid Avenue II is a huge disappointment. The sound quality is poor and the songs are worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"I liked all the Wilco songs, but Billy Bragg wasn't all that great. The former still makes it a worthwhile purchase. Interestingly, a lot of Intellectually Important Music Critics feel that Wilco doesn't do the songs right - that they don't sound like Woody Guthrie songs - whereas Bragg is true to the material. Whatever. Jeff Tweedy sings great on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it for the Poetry","review":"The most intriguing thing about this album is the sheer range of the artist -- and I'm speaking here of Woody Guthrie. The scope of subjects is ambitious -- from love to racism to workers' rights -- but the sincerity of the words never ebbs. Even if you are tepid on Wilco or Bragg, consider buying the album for the lyrics sheet -- practical poetry at its most human and accessible."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sequel that Works","review":"This followup to Volume 1 finds Bragg and Wilco continuing to do their best work (Bragg, especially) with the help of Woody Guthrie's great lyrics. Wilco have the best moments: the combo of \\"Secret of the Sea\\" (which is the albums best pop moment) and \\"Remember the Mountain Bed\\" are their peaks. While Bragg doesn't get anything as classic as the first volume's \\"Way Over Yonder in the Minor Key\\", he nevertheless gets off 2 great ones with \\"Hot Rod Hotel\\" and \\"Black Wind Blowing\\". As they were on MA1, Natalie Merchant and Corey Harris are back. Merchant's contribution is on the melancholy \\"I Was Born\\" (w/Bragg on acoustic guitar). It's a must hear. Corey Harris' \\"Aginst Th' Law\\" is a jaunty blues piece pitted against a politically charged Woody lyric. If the initial discovery of volume 1 is lost at first listen, give the record a couple of more spins (and then play it back to back with volume 1) and you'll then find that this is indeed a worthy sequel.

His research was in-depth and made you never question its validity. I lived in the Washington D.C. area for eight years and have visited the Ford Theater and the Boarding House Lincoln died in--after reading the book--I go visit those places everytime I return--and picture Jim Bishops clear explanation of events. After reading this book and visiting the Ford Theater--you will envision the actor John Booth jumping from the balcony and tripping as he took his last step on a theater stage. Not only will you sit in the low lighted rooms and learn of the intricate details behind the assassination--but will also learn many facts about the city of Washington D.C. during that period of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Read. History Written as a Good Mystery","review":"Bishop writes a good book. The story is well researched, full of fascinating details, fast paced and never dull. Although you know the ending, the tale is constructed in a way that has you hoping someone will make a move in the story to avoid the awful destiny that must unfold.My only quibble is that the author takes a lot of license with what the various players were thinking. This certainly helps flesh out the story but does the history a minor disservice by going beyond what can be known with certainty. Still, enjoyanble and recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating - You will live that day by reading this book","review":"I truly enjoyed this book.

It is well worth this re-print edition. An absolutely relentless march of the men, women and events of the last 24 hours in the life of Lincoln. The detail here does not slow the history. Indeed it is the life blood of this enthralling book. Meticulous research brings the story to full color. You will feel the heartbeat of Booth as he approaches the President's box. You will suffer the shock of Mrs. Lincoln when she realizes her husband has been wounded. You will weep for Abraham Lincoln. Seldom is history as truely revealing as this.

I know everyone has heard this before, but I could not put this book down. As you read the hour-by-hour account of Lincoln's last day, Bishop makes you feel as though you are there on the fringe watching as the minutes tick away.

Just an idiot move on his part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Get Until the End of the Movie","review":"This futuristic, post-apocalyptic thriller/ comedy/ romance tries to deliver some clever ideas about the power of dreams, memory and its manipulation and control. One should always praise a film that dares to raise thought-provoking questions, yet in this case I can\`t help but give it one star. Despite the gripping premise, this movie is too long, unfocused, slow and disjointed to deserve a higher rating. Director Wim Wenders has an interesting concept, still he seems uncomfortable with the material here and the result is a failed attempt. The plot is contrived at best, the characters\` motivations and attitudes don\`t make much sense and the story truly is a test to one\`s patiente and good-will. Ok, so the soundtrack is alright and the directing is competent, but that\`s it. Maybe a remake could give a better life to this concept, since this effort is pretentious, incredibly boring and seems unfinishable. It just drags endlessly.One to skip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bah!","review":"Bought this movie based on current reviews. Watch it, Long, Slow, not very good much less great. I guess you have to justdisregard the reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking and stylistic","review":"I concur with another's (from Tel Aviv's) comment that this needs to be made available on DVD. The U2 Actung baby soundtrack and the world geographic and futuristic visuals are very engaging.While some commented on finding the story line jumbled and/or implausible, they are probably used to having all of their questions answered. The story made me wonder what is truly important (given the finiteness of life, time and the planet) and made me question whether technology and communication's untethered advances will lead us to advances in civilization. Or steer us to become more hedonistic and individualistic.It's fun. It has action and romance, and as such makes a great after-dinner, couples kinda' movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please Please Please on D-V-D","review":"Please persuade the distributor to release the fully restored 3-5 hour version on DVD - better yet, Make this the first film on HDVD as it was one of the first filmed (partly) in HDTV!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A film unlike any other ever made - pure Wenders","review":"I've been enjoying this DVD of one of the most fascinating movies ever made for years now. To have this full director's cut, with the extras, is a real treat for Wenders fans and fans of this incomparably unique film. For those of you in USA you'll need a region-free DVD player (go to dvdoverseas.com), and unfortunately there are no English subtitles for the non-English sections of the DVD (my only complaint of the DVD). But if you've enjoyed the shorter version of the film, you owe it to yourself to see the whole thing. Some viewers say that they prefer the shorter film, and I can understand their point, but this longer version allows you to totally get lost in the world of the film. Get it while you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD, Please","review":"This is also one of my all time favorites, haven't seen it in awhile, have the CD and the VHS buried here somewhere; and hoped it would be easier to finally get a new DVD version - But I don't live in Germany, I live in the Bronx for chrissakes.

It's time for a Region 1 release!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A SF masterpiece with a great soundtrack","review":"Until The End of The World ia a journey into the future (1999) from a 1991 perspective. Glimpses of technology that has happened mixed with a compelling story of real life sacrifices and choices provides a strong thread that travels around the world in 120 minutes.Unfortunatly the movie has been edited to 120 minutes from an original 3-5 hours in the Directors cut. This editing leaves the video viewer with a few continuity problems at best. Phrases like \\"I still love you broken ladder\\" have to be decyphered in discussions on the internet.All this does not take away from the fact that UTTEOTW is an wonderful escape into another world filled with some very interesting people. Escape is just what movies are for so enjoy the ride and the tunes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible journey into the near future","review":"What an under-rated movie this is! It is not common to find a futuristic movie that strives to remain believable. In UTEOTW, the past, present and future continually mix to produce a realistic not-too-far future. Its combination of locations, music (what soundtrack!!) and plot make it an adventure not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great escape, great story, great film","review":"This film doesn't fit into a box; but today this is a good thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay movie, low quality product.","review":"I enjoyed this movie. It is a bit dated, but okay. However, I downloaded it to my PC, and I was not impressed with the quality.To be fair, it does not look like a great deal of effort was put into this release, but the download to my PC was not very good. It was not my PC. I have Windows 7 64 bit with 8 gigs of RAM, and my monitor is a 24\\" 1080p LED. The video way choppy none the less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging, but best taken with a pot of coffee.","review":"The movie is a long one, and it has the feeling of a TV miniseries due to it's manifold segways from disparate situation to situation. The director doesn't seemed concerned with the fact that the movie seems to be contantly roving. Good performances and the story was interesting.I'd like to gripe about the fact that the soundtrack, although impressive, was not remixed to keep the vocals either subdued, or more preferably removed completely. It causes some aggravating moments where you're not sure what you're supposed to be focusing on, and makes this seem even more removed from conventional cinematography.If this is rereleased onto DVD I hope they remaster the sound to accomodate this. Also, I think this movie would be best cut into two or three parts. This would make a good TV series-in fact it seems tailored for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"casting@ev1.net","review":"Hmmmmmm I am really tired of professional critics! None of them got the sense and idea of this movie at all. What we saw in 1991 release, was almost as far as I am concrened exactly what we may just get in the by 1999 and beyond. Sony just released a Vid Phone, Duhhhhhhhh I am sure it wouldn't be hard to get it hooked up by wireless internet, Duhhhhhh Well as much as the producer knew in 1991 about the future, they came as close as possible as anyone else. Today we do have a majority of the technology displayed in the movie. If anyone deserves to take credit for inventing the internet, it is these guys. I think, the movie is really a rememberance of what happened to each character rather than a third person version, as noticed by the end of the movie. We remember in levels of excitement and suffering, so that is how this movie was constructed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Until the End of the World","review":"I bought this movie at a place in city. I watched it. And it didn't went up to my expectetions. First, I think Wim Wenders did put this movie too close to his own time. He did not consider research what would happen until the real 1999. And what was that thing about the atomic satellite? It wasn't mentioned so much in the movie. You can see that the Soviet Union is actually still intact, even though it ceased to exist the coming year. Secondary, much of the picture was too much centered on Clarie (Solveig Dommartin). You do not get to see the plot real close. And what IS the plot? A man who invent a machine that can record real life and insert it's memories into another human, and the US govenment trying to find it? For their own purposes? I recommend seing Blade Runner if you want to see a future thriler/sci-fi.Mind that this is MY rating for this movie, and should not be taken seriously.

I am currently learning VB and neither the teachers nor the books I previously read explained anything about how to write decent code, and in many cases gave examples of bad code.

This book has really opened my eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok for beginners","review":"There is obviously a need for such a book. However, Microsoft Press suggests this book for intermediate to advanced users. I would target this at beginning to (perhaps) intermediate users. Others will be disappointed as I was.Lots to disagree with here as well. A recomendation is made to only place ByRef in parameter definitions if the user INTENDS to change the parameter while in the routine. ByRef parameters which the user does not intend to change receive no prefix. Not the best advice. Another section suggests branching to a graceful exit point if input data is invalid. Since invalid input data generally suggests a problem elsewhere in the code, a better suggestion is assertion (a subject not discussed and perhaps out of scope) and/or raising an error. Some of the treatments seem pretty shallow - for example, the section on error handling is more a tutorial on the basic error object."},{"rating":"2","title":"highly recommend this book","review":"If you are seeking more freedom, or are interested in ministering healing to other people, this book is for you.

Cut to this summer, I was vacationing in Maui with my husband, right there, at our hotel was the girl from the pictures that I had read about for all these years. We spoke and she told me that she was on her honeymoon and that she was doing and feeling great. I told her that I loved her articles in Glamour. She then told me she had written a book.

They come from virtually every major research institution in the country and there are several entries from other countries.I particularly enjoyed the look back over sixty years of medical genetics written by Alfred Knudson. In medical school during World War II, he was in at the beginning of the modern era of genetics research and specialized in cancer research.The other articles are all of high caliber.

The villa's ownership is attributed to Poppea, Nero's second wife, based on an inscription on an amphora found in the bathroom of the excavated villa; however, it is known that the property was not inhabited at the time of the explosion, undergoing either expansion or renovation, perhaps work still required as a result of the earthquake of 63 AD.In any evemt, the villa's layout, luxury, fantastic frescoes and decor, are all lovingly reproduced in this short book in stunning color.

It is a solid unit that lives up to its ads. I am quite pleased with it overall. The only issue that prevented a 5 rating is that the handle on the end opposite the wheels must be removed so that the material support can be properly adjusted, a minor but irritating design malfunction. This is a great addition for those who must both move their tools around as well as conserve floor space."},{"rating":"1","title":"DchAnderson","review":"I purchased this stand to support a 12\\" Hitachi sliding compound. On the third occation that I used it, the right rear leg lock gave out. If I hadn't been thinking quickly it would've cause serious damage to a $700 tool. Now since the lock doesn't function at all this thing is worthless to me, even if I repair it I'll never trust it. And, forget about trying to move your saw aroung with that cheap little wheel, the extending roller assembly or leg brackets will dig in, it really is a useless feature.I'm a union carpenter with 30 years of experience and a fondness for quality tools. Anyone reading this should consider any stand on the market other than this one, you'll be happier and perhaps save yourself some money.OK, after I bashed this product in my review, I contacted the folks at HTC and they were more than happy to send me the parts to fix it, free of charge.

Soft white (yellowish, dull)2. Bright white (not toooo bright, provides nice light)3. Daylight (very bright, for spaces that get little\\\\no natural light)Another nice feature is that the bulb that shipped with this fixture appears to be a Daylight bulb. It gives off a terrific amount of light. At 14 watts it lights up nearly my entire kitchen!Only negative are the instructions, which mention something about a 'diffuser' that's not found in the package or on the light.

For someone previously familiar only with De Palma's more popular works (which I also like quite a bit) this lesser-known movie was a terrific discovery.

I did not like the music. The satire of the sick rock music scene had no subtlety. The improbabilities seemed careless rather than inventive. The visuals were pretty good but not well edited. The story was a bit tedious.Ed Wood meets Ken Russell and they can't think of much to say to each other. Sad. Too bad. I normally appreciate experimental and strange films.But there are a lot positive reviews and a strong following. I am about 178th reviewer. So I feel the problem may be with me. I am wondering, does \\"great cult movie\\" mean \\"drugs\\"? I guess this film was just not my cup of tea.

But noooo, after Kim spends all this money on this wedding, Shonda comes in and ruins it and feels she's got herself some sort of prize or something! And then they never show Malik interacting with Shonda's daugther Bree. Instead of Malik breaking up with Kim and finding his own place, he moves in with Shonda. A man making good money like he is should be able to find his own place. Is this what Ms Poole defines as healthy relationships? A man going from woman to woman?

And as short as the book was (244 pages), did the author really think it was necessary to use the opening chapter again in the last as if we'd forgotten it? For those of you who felt the female characters were \\"trifling\\" in their tug of war over a man, remember that although this was fiction, stories like this do happen in real life and to constantly read about strong, independent women would truly be boring.

First off the writer's style is a little too junior high for my taste. I have to agree with the reviewer that said if you are over 30 then DON'T BUY this book. Ms. Poole uses elementary school vocabulary, short sentences and tends to repeat herself (Ex: I hate Malik, he's so stupid I wish he would die, I hate Malik he's stupid\\".

Tight construction and easily configured dividers to fit whatever lenses you might have. Max lens about 80-300.

I don't think I will dig up the others in the series, but this one worked really well.I have always enjoyed Nancy Drew mysteries - no, this wasn't exactly one, but a very similar formula: beautiful, talented girl, jocular fellow, layers of mystery... this threw in some erotica and mysticism...but otherwise -I mostly appreciated learning a little history at the same time. Greeley did a nice job of illuminating a little of the Civil War's ugly side - and telling a story at the same time.I even ran a few of the expressions by Pat - and he confirmed them - he also filled me in on some of the names of IRA folks...It was clever and fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much stereotype","review":"Enjoyed Irish Gold so there was no question about following through with the sequel. Rather disappointing. Nuala is just too perfect and wonderful. The immigration officials are too mean (I can't believe they wouldn't have better immigrants to worry about rather than perfect Nuala?) Greeley's political opinions are introduced a little too often. (Republicans continue to be rather evil, mean-spirited folk). And who says Bill Clinton is a big hero with the Irish?

I have not read the first book in the series, and I probably won't. Usually Greeley tells a story well. In this one, he contorts the storyline by spewing far too much unrealistic and personally felt verbage about politics. I feel he lets his political views poison the storyline. I also agree that the two main characters are a little too perfect. It is hard to develop empathy for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"The first book in the \\"Nuala Anne McGrail\\",series, \\"Irish Gold\\", was entertaining, and engaging. With this in mind, I moved on the second book in the series \\"Irish Lace\\".This book is not in the same league. It is mainly a vehicle for Greeley to voice his political views....as in Democrats are all good, honest, generous folk and Republicans are the devil. \\"We drew the worst possible judge, Dermot. Thomas Winthrop Manley. He is a supercilious, egotistic, fussy, mean-spirited Republican.\\"This quote is just one of many voicing that opinion.He loves the term \\"xenophobia\\" and uses to OFTEN.The story line is cumbersom, and uninteresting.

It didn't!I won't bother with the rest of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple and non-memorable","review":"While this book was written in a simple and easy to read fashion, it was not memorable or particularly engaging. I never actually connected with any of the characters. Nuala was too perfect and Dermot was too stupid. I found the language idiosyncratic and the plot trite and boring. I never got into the book; I was always checking to see if I was close to the end. I would recommend this book to someone who does not like stories that are too complicated or clever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Greeley's Own Hatreds Get In The Way","review":"While the interaction between Nula and Dermont were excellent, the simplistic political undertones got in the way. It read more like a hit piece on anyone who dare hold conservative ideas. Those sections dealing simplistically with complex political issues were full of more vitriol than Irish charm. Of course if you are somewhat left of Kennedy you will love it. So bad I threw it away before completing it. I hope Mr. Greeley sticks to the wonderful courtship/relationship and a good historical sleuthing in future Nula mystries."},{"rating":"2","title":"great collection of country Christmas tunes","review":"This is the label's third country holiday CD, and it could be their best yet.

Today things were taken to another level, when an Optima battery I purchased from them started leaking out bubbling battery acid when I began to charge it to prepare it for installation. Thank goodness this happened on the floor of the shop and not in the car. Their idea of properly shipping a battery involves slapping a shipping label on the side of it. Zero packaging, no box, nothing. After calling Optima they told me that this has happened before with Amazon. I called Amazon and they promptly issued me a full refund but that still left me with no battery. I needed a model 25 redtop and after calling around a bit on the forth call I located a 25/75 model that would do the trick.

Her \\"Just Breathe\\" attracted me, and I bought it. Couldn't put it down. Now, I look for any and all of her books. Reading her earlier book \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" was not a disappointment either. This provided an escape into another era with interesting young ladies in swishing silk skirts waltzing around a dance floor with elegant gentlemen, forbidden liaisons, and an independent thinking young woman struggling with a personal sadness and functioning in an era before her time. Susan did not disappoint by providing endless intrigue with a \\"feel good\\" ending. Susan just gets better with every publication."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new favorite - utterly charming","review":"Just when I pick a favorite by this author, she does it again--writes a story that surpasses all the other wondrous tales that came before. I adored THE CHARM SCHOOL, and the others by this author, and now this one is equal to or even fresher and funner than that one. Abigail is so warm and human and flawed--a girl who has brains and a big heart and is totally unappreciated by Society. Along comes the perfect man who has no idea how perfect he is for her until he finds himself falling for her no matter how hard he fights his feelings. What a beautiful story, an affirmation of all that is good in the world. And I can't wait to see how the sister turns out. Get this one--it's a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a 5 Star read at all","review":"This was an somewhat enjoyable read, but not 5 stars. The characters were stock characters, the history minimal, and the plot predictable. The world of late 19th c. Washington and the Chesapeake were not illuminated. And a minor point, chesnut horses never have black manes.The main character's issues (her scholarship and her foot) were so quickly solved by some new dresses. And, of course, the sister's love affair and marriage are just fodder for the next novel, when her husband dies or is murdered and her professor comes back on the scene.... See what I mean... so predictable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Susan's best!","review":"While I have always enjoyed Susan Wigg's book, especially her Chicago Fire Trilogy, Halfway to Heaven was somewhat laborious for me to read. In fact, it took me six weeks to get through it. Unlike some of her others that were real page turners where I could not wait to sit down and read, this was a book that I put down for a few days and then maybe only read a half a chapter at a time. I kept looking to the end pages to see how much was left.The characters of Jamie and Abbie are very endearing and they are not the problem here. It just seemed that we knew the point of the story right in the beginning. The road to the conclusion seemed contrived if not predictable and it took way to long for me to get there.It's not that it is a bad book, but it was a disappointing one considering some of her other wonderful works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not THAT bad...","review":"I would not purchase this book then expect to automatically pass the exam(s), but you will not find 300 exam-style review questions spanning 2 exams for this price anywhere. I wrote and passed exam 70-029 which was my last for the MCSD designation. If the core exams for the MCSD are considered difficult, then 70-029 is near impossible. No one single studying source will get you through it. There are some errors in this book, and believe me, you will never get a question on the real exam testing your knowledge of the SQL syntax for simply creating a table. But those are minor complaints paired against the value this book brings in its explanations for each question, and the sheer number of questions contained within.I must give this book a high rating simply by virtue of the fact that I used it as one of my studying resources for the 70-029, and I passed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Riddled with errors","review":"Definitely the worst I've seen in the Exam Cram series. It looks like it was rushed to meet a dateline and I cannot believe that there was any technical review.

Why not just help the parents. Do you know how many small town kids who lived in trailer or worst make it out of that. Or a ghetto. Or even the rich kids who commit suicide or kill others. This film is a slap in the face to every hard working. Mother every hard working family who hasce some troubles but still love there kids and try to give them everything. Let social services do that job by this movie saying someone should kidnap someones child because rich society does not feel like they are raised right is wrong. By the way I'm middle class.

Not a bad movie but in bad taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not what you think....","review":"This movie is reminiscent of The Village (only with a much lower budget). Acting? meh. Plot? nada.

In the Great Depression days this sort of thing really went on and it was not justified by any means. Although it wasn't exactly what this movie depicts... its was done for profit in the great depression days. I would like to elaborate but I'm afraid I'll give up the big surprise ending. This movie seems to be trying to give some sort of justification or virtue to the act. But as I said I think it gives more insight into the perverse minds of Hollywood elitists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling, entertaining, and scary!","review":"Okay, this movie wants you to believe that it is a horror movie.

In addition, as a high school counselor, a lot of discussion could be had after watching this movie.....Remember, I absolutely LOVE movies that make me scream.... keep me on the edge of my seat..... and keep me totally engaged while I'm trying to figure out what is actually going on, without being subjected to Scream-esque bludgeoning with squirting fake blood! This movie does just that.The Tall Man is a movie with a lesson... one that we have discussed over lunch at school.I recommend this movie.... it will leave you satisfied at the end.....Let me know what you think after you watch it! That's all I'm going to say so that I do NOT give too much away....

I liked the movie because it did cause some thinking and had a interesting twist."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT a Serial Killer movie guys!","review":"This movie is not what the trailers portray it to be. I'm on the fence about this movie... seriously. It's not a Serial Killer movie. However, I will say as a credit to this movie, the cinematography was absolutely stunning! The storyline is very interesting and gripping. As it may be, I was very disappointed in the final summarization and or ending of this movie. This movie was (NOT) what I expected! However, don't buy it. This is NOT and Ideal (buy it) kind of movie. I'm afraid it's best to RENT this movie. But for the sake of just \\"pure entertainment\\"...it's ok, but not worth buying.

Just . . . weird.","review":"This movie turned out to be the weirdest that I have seen in a while. However, the originality of the unpredictable plot twist was a pleasurable relief from the common mediocre blueprint that many movies seem to be following these days. The Tall Man addresses issues of child rearing by unappreciative or at least incapable parents and the effect it ultimately has on society as a whole. This was a strange one indeed, but I liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"I did not like this movie....who was the Tall Man? Movie made no sense and was a little confusing.

This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Just absolutely senseless, and honestly kind of insulting. This movie grows increasingly ludicrous as it goes on, starting of as a fairly interesting thrilling, and then it is revealed that the \\"Tall Man\\" is actually a small group of people kidnapping children from people they have deemed to be unfit parents, and then miraculously placing them in wealthy homes. At the end we see a few clips of these \\"rescued\\" kids enjoying their new found upper class existence, while their real parents are left devastated. After all of that the movie tries to paint the kidnappers as martyrs to their cause, when they are really monsters. This was a truly bizarre movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE TALL MAN COMES UP SHORT","review":"Don't let the marketing fool you. THE TALL MAN is not a horror movie. Its really a pompous and contrived social commentary on the haves and the have-nots and not a very good one.Set in the Pacific Northwest in a dying mining town called Cold Rock, the story focuses on the disappearance of several children, possibly the victims of the town's resident boogeyman, The Tall Man. Jessica Biel continues to prove she is an actress of limited skills, wandering through the film like a wayward zombie. Even good actors like Stephen McHattie, William B. Davis, Jonelle Ferland and Samantha Ferris seem listless and disinterested. Even after suffering the film's plodding pacing, the supposed \\"twist\\" at the end doesn't pay off.

Take for example the following sentence that occurs on page 82. - \\"Why to Perform Capacity Planning Prior to Design\\".

However, in my regular use this has not been much of a problem and so has not prevented me from using this regularly.

At the core of this theft lies Fain and these events set the book in motion. Rand, Mat, and Perrin go after the Horn because it summons the Hero's of the past and ironically can be used for good as well as evil. Another reason for Mat to go is that he can sense the dagger when it is close, not to mention his life depends on it. In the search for the Horn, Rand starts to learn how to use the One Power.

I understand that Macmillan wants to charge a higher fee for new releases but this book is several dollars cheaper at your local bookstore and that price takes into account the printing of the book, transportation to the store, profit for the publisher and for the book seller. The electronic version shares almost none of those expenses yet they have decided to charge the consumer an extra $2.00? Shame on you Macmillan. Much like the music industry that failed to accept the future before it was too late, Macmillan seems focused on scalping the consumer for a few extra bucks now at the expense of a long term relationship with the buying public.

I trudged through the first book despite its lack of direction, but I can't do it anymore. What is the point? Nothing ever happens! This is not good fantasy, it's not even mediocre.I suppose the entire series will be saving me some money. Thank you Mr. Jordan.:^)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as #1","review":"I sorta liked the Eye but when I read this book I was sorely dissapointed. Sure it was a great plot but with nothing happening it just plain bored me. The ending was OK but nothing exceptional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the first book","review":"This was a good read, not a great read.I started reading this series because it was oft compared to the works of Tolkien, which I would not do. The only similarities I see are that it is a work of fantasy and it is epic (is big). It does not have nearly the richness of history of the Tolkien books. Maybe it stacks up very favorably against modern day fantasy series (McAffery, Anthony, Donaldson, Brooks), but still does not come close to Tolkien."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wheel goes on","review":"Book 2 of the series by Robert Jordan, the Wheel of Time, continued to hold my interest with as much intensity as Book 1. I have since moved on to books 3, 4, 5 and now 6, so I guess you could say I am well and thouroughly hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite book in the WOT series","review":"My favorite used to be Dragon Reborn (Book 3), but after a recent re-read of the series the Great Hunt has replaced it. There are so many outstanding moments in this book: raid at Fal Dara, Rand encountering a Forsaken (and being trapped in an alternate world temporarily). There are several great emotionally-charged scenes: Thom's scenes in Cairhien, the alternate realities with the portal stones, Egwene with the Seanchan, Mat realizing his destiny...and my favorite-the redemption of Ingtar. What a tremendous book this was, how this wasn't my favorite before is beyond me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun ride","review":"Re-reading this book for the first time, and still loving it. Jordan just writes a good story. It took this one a little bit to get going, but once the Hunt was in full effect, I couldn't put the book down. I was glad for the breaks into the other plot lines once in awhile to give myself a breather from the main plot of the Hunt for the Horn of Valere. I loved to hate a few of the characters, and the Seanchan were excellent villains! Can't wait to read the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Second book in one of the greatest fantasy epics","review":"The Great Hunt is a compelling book for the Wheel of Time epic. Robert Jordan's skill at both storytelling and convincing the reader that he is part of the story is unparalleled in most books that I've read (the only execptions would be Issac Asminov and Anne McCaffree) This novel continues the epic seamlessly and continues with Jordan's hand on building each character into seprate, yet unsepreable characters that you can't help but have feelings for through out the entire epic saga."},{"rating":"2","title":"And the story continues","review":"Well I read the 2nd book and I feel it was as good as the 1st book. Rand still wants nothing to do with the Aes Sedai, but he tries to help his friend Mat and find the Horn of Valere and at the same time saying to himself and to any one who will listen that he is not the Dragon Reborn. Menwhile Egwene, Nynaeve, and Elayne are training to be Aes Sedai and end up in trouble. this book like the 1st one will keep you up late at night untill you finish. If you enjoyed the 1st one you'll enjoy this one. This series is so good I'm about half way through book 4. When I'm done with book 4 I'll give my review on the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book has a feeling of tolkien.","review":"This book, far overshadows the first book in the series, by the mere fact that its beggining and end is not nearly as rushed and excited as the in the first.

Brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"This series is awesome so far","review":"For anyone who enjoys fantasy, this series is incredibly entertaining. This book in particular really steps the pace of the series up and was a pleasure to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same characters, new adventures.","review":"The story in this book is obviously the search for the horn of valere. the action and storytelling are great, but what makes this book so special is the ending. i didn't even want to blink!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Eye of the World","review":"This is one of Jordan's best books, in my opinion. The pacing is excellent (one of the few flaws of EotW), and the climactic battle was absolutely beautiful. Getting a closer look at the Ogier was a real treat, especially since Loial is one of my favorite characters. Having a glossary at the back that included new names was very helpful. Now, on to Dragon Reborn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story with characters that grow with the tale.","review":"Jordan continues his tale of the wheel with a timeline to die for.

The tormented protagonist (ala Rand). The supporting characters who fear their companions (ala Mat). The notion that prophecy was not fixed...that working towards it was noble but couldn't guarantee safety.Looking back, reading on my KFHD, I have to say that TGH has met the match of time. On my re-read, I felt the same connection with the characters, the same fear that things were not as they seemed, and the same eager hunger to read the next in the series.

The whole book is very in depth down to the last page. Will they be able to find the horn and at the same time be able to defeat the Dark One."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, drawn out, with ignorant ,boring characters.","review":"This is the second Robert Jordan book I have read and will most likely be the last. The first book in the series was somewhat slow and didn't hold my attention too well but I thought I should give him a fair chance so I bought The Great Hunt.His characters get more and more whiney, they make stupid, ignorant decisions, and the constant denial of Rand that he is the Dragon Reborn is more than annoying.All in all, the book could have been about 300 pages less - less would definitely be more as far as Mr. Jordan is concerned. He is not a particularly talented writer, sticks with cliches quite often and creates his characters' voices in such a way that I just wanted to slap every one of them.For a good fantasy read, read Terry Goodkind's 'Wizard's First Rule' and the rest in that series. Phenomenal writing, beautifully drawn characters and a fun, nailbiting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I dont like this book. It takes one page to write that they are taking two step forward and there is more like this. I dont know how people like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH PLEASE","review":"The first was good, but this was a very, very, very bad book. Yes there is such a thing as TOO MUCH detail. I mean, how can an author write such a great first novel and then screw up so completely in the second installment? I won't even bother to summarize this 700 page bore, but I will tell you one thing about the plot of this book. The legendary Horn of Valare was stolen from Rand, stolen back by Rand, stolen from him again, and then recovered at the end. Talk about a space waster. That book could have been 300 pages shorter and been classified as excellent. I guess he was trying to make this book as immpresively long as his first, but the result was TRASH. If you liked the first one, don't dicourage yourself, get a discription from a poor friend who had to suffer trough this book. Jordan does try to emulate Tolkien, but with this book didn't even come close. A Very Disappointed Reader"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stolen Ideas","review":"This series hardly promises to be new or unique. Unlike others, I don't care that Jordan rips off Tolkien (trollocs, anyone?). Instead, I'm furious that he has stolen characters straight out of Eddings's Belgariad: the sturdy blacksmith with down-to-earth values, the haughty, blue-clad, imperious sorceress, the vagabond old man storyteller, and even a connection with wolves. The opening of the first novel, where Rand suspects some shadowy figure following him is also straight out of Pawn of Prophecy. Why hasn't Eddings sued this poser? Also, the boys vs. girls theme that Eddings began to take a little too far by the 8th book (in the Mallorean) is already overdone obnoxiously by the end of book 1. Surely we can find better authors that don't steal their ideas straight from better sources. Read Eddings and compare for yourself. Jordan is a thief."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible writing style, and geared towards younger readers","review":"I made the unfortunate mistake of purchasing the first 4 books all at one time, based on the strength of the reviews on Amazon. Mistake! I found that I really didn't like the author's writing style, and the plot is very predictable and geared towards very young readers. Not what I expected, and a very disappointing read. Did my best to stick it out, thinking that it HAD to improve, but bailed about 2/3 of the way though the second book. Torture..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sequel","review":"Unlike the first book which was mainly about traveling to a certain location and learning about things as we went, this one jumps into the action. Our characters are more confident, have grown and learned new skills and are overall more heroic. A great relic is found that our main character needs to defeat the dark one, but it is stolen right off the bat. A group of knights is formed to get in back in a holy quest. Our lady Aes Sedais in training move on to Tar Valon for training, but nothing happens as it is meant to. New twists and new characters pop up in the book as well as a new enemy nation that was only spoken of in rumors. The book doesn't disappoint, Jordan is a masterful writer that writes nice descriptive narratives that kept me deep in the story and visualizing our character's locations and actions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product, Fast Service","review":"I was very pleased. Able to order and pay through Amazon, and received the product even faster than promised. I'd buy from this seller any time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Hunt","review":"I absolutely love this series and I've been waiting a very long time for the last book to be released.

I look forward to reading the rest. Highly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"great hunt proves to match its prequel and more","review":"This book has a lot of really neat original ideas, i really like jordans stlyle, but sometimes it gives too much of an overview of the first book, and there are a lot of references to the arthurian legends. Lots of names just changed a little bit. overall though, ive always been enthused by this book and i reccomend it to anyboldy. awesome"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a Great Read","review":"I have to agree with one of the 'critics' below me -- the beginning and the climactic ending of the book were great, but the book had too many pot holes, places where the it was just the story and developement that the book depended on. Well, that's me; I look forward every time to the romance between the characters (especially between Lan and Nynaeve!) and the parts where the training takes place in the White Tower. Overall? A good book, although plagued with story developement at times. The Seanchan suddenly mixed 3/4 through the book was a little more than bewildering, leaving you wondering about who they are and why why why? I can't wait to get my hands on the next one (grumble ... can't believe I have to go through 6 books to get to Path of Daggers)."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK book, but great ending!","review":"After reading the first book, Eye of the World, I couldn't wait to get the seond book and read it. I liked the opening scene, but from there it got a little boring. The test Nynaeve took in Tar Valon was and Rand's adventures with the portal stones were probably the best parts of the book until the last 80 pages. By that time, all of the different plot lines in the book came to a head and started coming towards one spot. For those people who have not read this book I will not spoil the ending, but if you are bored in the middle it is worth the read until the end. Everything that happens in the book, however tedious, comes together in a huge climax. It completely surprised me, and unless you cheat or you just don't like this type of writing, it should surprise you too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most complete novel in the series","review":"I am currently going through my Wheel of Time Re-read in preparation for A Memory of Light, and The Great Hunt still remains one of my favourite books, if a little frustrating. Rand and Perrin are finally starting to mature (does Mat ever mature???), the story moves along at a much faster pace, and we start to see the magic and politics of the world become an integral part of the story as Jordan starts positioning all the pieces for some big action scenes. Also a very nice reference to the Towers of Midnight in this book, its amazing to think how far out Jordan managed to foreshadow the big events."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book spoiled by poor production","review":"The p-book version of The Great Hunt is great, and part of one of the best-ever fantasy series. But this e-book version contained hundreds of incomplete words, sentences, paragraphs, lots of nonsense punctuation, in general quite amateurish quality throughout. It looked like there had been absolutely no proof-reading done after scanning the original content. It doesn't detract from the original, but made the e-book reading experience very frustrating. It's hard to become immersed in a book if whole sentences make no sense and you have to go scrambling for the original p-book version to see what is wrong!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lot of Fun","review":"The Great Hunt is a lot of fun, even though it doesn't match the complexity of the more recent books. The plotting may be a bit formulaic, but it's still better than anything Terry Brooks has ever written.Also Recomended: The Harry Potter Series by J.K. Rowling, The Left Behind Series by Tim LaHayn and Jerry B. Jenkins, The Shannara Series by Terry Brooks, The Saga of Darren Shan by Darren Shan, The Lord of the Rings by J.R.R. Tolkien, and the Remnants Series by K.A. Applegate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another one with same formula","review":"This is the second book of the Wheel of Time series. Its only a bit, I repeat, a bit better than the first book and thats because there's more action in it. On the whole, this book was useless.The Horn of Valere is stolen in the beginning by Darkfriends and so Rand & Co sets out to retrieve it. I still doesn't understand why the villian waited for 3 months for Rand to come and take the Horn back. He should've used it for himself in between. At the climax, Rand finds out where the Horn is kept, enters the building and picks it up without any difficulty?? Comeon, we're speaking about the greatest weapon of the world, which can bring back the army of dead. And I've even found other reviewers claiming the final battle sequence to be a masterpiece in literature. Unfortunatley, I didnt find it a bit interesting to hold my attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soooooooo Looooooonnnnnnnnngggggggggggggg","review":"I read tons of books like this all the time. It takes me little time to complete them. But this series is so slow and reading it can be such a drag that I just can't do it anymore. I give up on this author and this series which I hear he can't complete because he's written himself into a corner. It's a hard read because it's so slow paced and such a slow read. i recommend going someplace else despite the interesting story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Many Greats","review":"Another great book by Robert Jordan. I am a huge fan of the Wheel of Time series, though it does sort of bog down later on. But during the Great Hunt everything is still relatively simple and easy to take in. I believe this takes place after Rand's first encounter with one of the Chosen (in the first book). Very good character developement and a lot of intrigue. Highly Recommended.LennoX"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloated and Boring","review":"THE GREAT HUNT is bloated and boring. I'm not sure why this book even needed to be an entire book in itself. The plot is so slow and the developments are so minimal--so much of it is needless dialogue--that it easily could have been summarazed and folded into another novel as back story. Or at least much of it could have been. I loved EYE OF THE WORLD and read it in 3 days. This one has taken me more than three weeks to read. I hope THE DRAGON REBORN is better, much better. If not, I don't think I'll waste my time with the rest of the series. I've recently read George R. R. Martin's SONG OF ICE AND FIRE novels (the three that are available). Robert Jordan ought to take some lessons from him. Martin is a truly magnificent writer. Jordan isn't even a close runner up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Continuing the journey","review":"Ah. The wheel of time. A book to rival that of lord of the rings. If a director I would most definatly make this a movie. In fact i have some good ideas already as to how the movie should go. Maybe i should make it! Well for now, the book. As the 2nd in the series it most definatly has not lost any of its amazing touch. Truly truly a masterpeice.It picks up right where it left off. The troubles cenetering around the legendary Horn of Valere. A great read certaintly. But it has an interesting ending that makes you want to get the 3rd book right away. I strongly and highly reccomend this book. That is, if youve read the 1st one. Dont read out of order!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A smooth follow-up needing more character development","review":"The second in the series is not nearly as descriptive of the personalities as the first. Nevertheless, the different spin in presenting the saga only gives the series more depth. Rand's buddies deserve a bit more attention here as does the Aes Sedai culture. Maybe more will follow in the future books. Im planning to order the third book today."},{"rating":"2","title":"TWO ACCOMPLISHED VOICE PERFORMERS","review":"Two accomplished voice performers, Reading and Kramer, give bold, vibrant readings as they bring to colorful life the thoughts and actions of the myriad of characters author Jordan has so memorably introduced. Expressive and dynamic, their performances capture the thrill of adventure and wonder of fantastic happenings.Jordan has been quoted as saying that fantasy literature \\"appeals to a simpler time of life with recognizable good and evil.\\" Both of those forces come to the fore in his Wheel of Time series as listeners/readers eagerly wait to discover which will have the upper hand.In The Great Hunt. the sequel to The Eye of the World, an onerous theft occurs. Gleemen have long related the tale of The Great Hunt of the Horn, and now that very Horn is discovered. It was believed to have been only a story, a legend but here it is, the very thing that will raise the dead heroes of the ages.Now, it has been stolen and the hunt is on.- Gail Cooke"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another amazing tale by Robert Jordan","review":"The travels of Rand, Mat, and Perrin continue, but now they are after the fabled Horn of Valere, said to raise dead heroes from the grave to fight for the one who blows the Horn.

Though he also needs the dagger to survive, somebody evil, worse than a mere Darkfriend, wants the dagger as his own, and will do anything to get his greedy hands on it. This book is extremely good, but I only recommend it to those who have completed the first book in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"More must reading!","review":"I really love this series! In this one we learn that Rand Al Thor is the one that was being sought in the first book. I don't want to give you any more spoilers than that.

Freaking Fantastic!","review":"The Great Hunt is even better than the Eye of the World, if you could believe that! I strongly suggest continuing on in the series OR starting it if you haven't already. You will have no regrets whatsoever! I've read a lot of books, and this series is one of the best I have read, if not the best! This book is great for all ages. I'm only 15, and I suggest that anyone around my age have a good vocabulary or have the ability to assume the meaning of some words in context. I only say this because one of my subs asked if a 10 year old would be able to read this book, and I do not suggest anyone under the age of 13 or 14 to read this because you will probably get lost.

It follows our heroes from the first book, as they try and find the fabled Horn of Valere. It is very enjoyable, Jordan can tell a good story. It does however have one very large flaw that results in a sequel weaker than 'The Eye of the World'. Some of the character's are way too naive. Specifically I am speaking of Rand trusting Selene who obviously has way too much knowledge to be who she claims, and Nynaeve and Egwene blindly following Liandrin whom they had never trusted before. This level of naivete might be plausible in the first book, but not after all the adventures they have had. It weakens what otherwise is a good sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read but too long.","review":"I really liked 'Eye of the World' and the second part 'The Great Hunt'. Being a german reader I never had to grab a dictionary to read the books (for 'Lord of the Rings' I needed a dictionary all the time ...). I really like Jordan's 'Wheel of Time' world but I'm not very eager to read the next book. Why? 1. The life of the main characters changed totally in the first book. In the second book there were no more surprises. 2. The books are lengthy.

In this book, the plot grows increasingly more thick as it is divided down the middle when the women head off for the White Tower while the men run off to find the Horn of Valere, which has been stolen. In this novel, we become more aquainted with Rand, and we are introduced to many new and interesting characters. The ending of this novel is probably the best ending of all the novels in the series of seven that have been published so far.

You cannot breeze in to a chapter, you must work on them all in the right order. Once in there it's like being led through a maze. There is virtually no explanation of what you are doing. The theory is lacking. Terminology is thrust upon you ruthlessly. You learn a bit about the GUI in VAJ, and it helps with general familiarity with the software, oh yes, the bit you really want to know, you don't learn much about Java."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for a beginner with small Java Experience","review":"Book is well organized. It covers most of the features. The examples are easy to follow. Easy to read. However it only covers features in the Professional Edition as the preface mentioned. Would've been better if it covered a little more advanced topics like visual servlets, cookies etc... Overal is good for learning but not for the advanced. I think I learned a lot from the book which has prepared me for the next level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Excuse for a Learning Guide","review":"Whenever I see a book that has the product name as part of the title and is not preceded with the words \\"advanced\\" or \\"intermediary\\" then I am led to believe that it will provide an broad introductory prospective to the product. I was dead wrong with this particular book. It reads like it was written in a weekend with each topic hastily reviewed with a major emphasis on scantily provided detail combined with large font types to give the visual appearance of an impressive body of work. Don't be fooled, this book is not worth the effort. You would be better served using the Visualage for Java help panels than attempting to apply any of the aspects of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless, Utterly and Totally Worthless","review":"I am not sure this is one of the worst books I have seen on using an IDE, but it must be on the top of that dubious list. The authors should have called the book: Do This Enter That. There is hardly any material explaining what your doing, no overviews, just a flat out lousy book, can't damn it enough. Save your money and buy any other book unless you like endless typing and no explanations. The material is presented in such an uninteresting manner that one needs motivation of heroic proportions: dose up on Steven Seagal movies and no doze, or better yet just pass this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time + money","review":"The book is full of typo's and the authors are impossible to reach. Hardly any explanation during the exercises, just instructions. A better book for the beginner is \\"Enterprise Development with VisualAge for Java, version 3,\\" by Nilsson et al."},{"rating":"1","title":"In true redbook fashion - no explainations","review":"My main problem with this book is the fact that you are taken step by step throught the development process but with no explainations of why you are doing the step. They aren't teaching...its more like rote repitition. On top of this, there are several critical typos and since you don't know the what and whys, they are that much harder to uncover. This could have been a great tutorial if IBM didn't assume it was writting to super-techies. Next time guys...EXPLAIN THE STEPS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not good and terribly dated","review":"IBM really needs to get some more up to date books out there for newer versions of VisualAge. This book was a terrible reference and terrible at teaching VisualAge. I finally gave up and just learned through trial and error."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has Mr. Wong read the WSJ review?","review":"Mr. Wong, it always helps to read the book -- rather than just some Internet review from a minor Internet publication. But, if reviews are your thing -- read the Wall Street Journal review of The Chinese Tao. It was the only book recommended on Asian business last year by this illustrious publication.I really liked the book -- and I read it too. I have lived and worked in Asia all my life and have done business with China for the last 10 years. I learned a lot from the authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doing business in China","review":"Although it never talks down to you, this book is very helpful to outsiders who want to succeed in Chinese business. Written by 2 American experts on business in Asia, Chinese Tao provides a great overview of the cultural, legal, and economic differences in China's business environment that may escape most -- yet that affect business performance. With their extraordinary access to business leaders in China, and their insights into what it takes to succeed in the new Chinese economy, the authors have also written a book that should help Asian businessmen, who are rarely introspective or analytical. A must read for anyone doing business in China or studying business operations there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Know or Die","review":"I am a fan of George Haley's and Usha Haley's work. Both give straight forward, honest advise from the hip, and their many books testify to this. Yet, I am not exaggerating when I say this is the best book on doing business in China that I have read (and I have read them all because I do business there). This book is honest, it's grounded in theory and practice, its philosophically based yet beautifully written. George and Usha have written a must-read book on how to succeed in China. Read it or die!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read book on business in China","review":"Although loaded with theory on the front-end, this book is realy great on explaining why China remains \\"foreign\\" toWestern companies and what they can do to make profits.I really enjoyed this book. It is extremely well written and even the theory was palatable. Novices and old-China hands will find something they can take away from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Slow and No Real Plot","review":"I was very disappointed in this movie. Many, many of the scenes are way too long with no action or even narration. For example, there is one scene where the boy is looking out the door of a box car as the train is moving - and all you see are the trees and fields going by. Also, the story is very weak, if, indeed there is even a real story there. To me it was just a collection of encounters with various people along the way. The only reason I can see for one to watch this movie would be to get some glimpse of how the people live in Russia and the old Soviet Union."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely slow....","review":"I very much enjoy movies produced outside the USA and was very let down by this Russian movie. I found it very hard to complete the vieweing of it, even at 1.5 speed! Many scenes are extremely SLOW in pace with unnecessary video repetition of things. Acting was OK but not especially good and the story was not interesting. If you want to see an excellent Russian movie, please watch \\"The Return\\". There is a world of difference between the two movies in all aspects of \\"movie making\\". I feel that it is what making a motion picture is all about. Don't bother with Roads to Koktebel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Road to disaster","review":"I gave it two stars for cinematography only. Otherwise it's pretty bland, you'll regret watching it all the way through. Bratty kid and messed up dad traveling through Russian country side depending on kindness of strangers as they go. Some people are nice and some are less than kind, it has potential at first then it drops off precipitously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairly accurate model with nice details","review":"Overall accurate reproduction of the real thing. My platoon used the real thing in Iraq, and there are only minor inconsistencies in the model, such as the RPG cage missing from the rampin the back and lack of the external fuel tanks. Overall a very nice looking model that looks nice on my desk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sick as f*#@!!!!!!!","review":"yo this cd is straight bangin!!! the lyrics in this ablum are just breath taking and the beats go straight with it..!! pick this up, u wont regret it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy it if you must","review":"I bought this for my son and I am sorry. He likes it, but found the buttons hard to press. Little Leap is also a bit too pushy - if you don't press buttons for a while it keeps egging you on to play which is very annoying for a child trying to think or struggling to push the buttons.Little Leap now sits with all the other not very much used stuffed animals.Buy it if you can afford to take the gamble - it seems that some kids like this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son knows his ABC's at 18 mos.!!!!!!","review":"This toy is incredible...my then 18 mo. old son (he is now 2 1/2)learned ALL of his letters from this toy!!! He started playing with the letter sounds mode and eventually moved on to the random letter quiz...my husband and I were SHOCKED as he kept pressing the correct letters!!! My son is now able to identify any letter of the alphabet!! We highly recommend this toy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing teaching tool","review":"My daughter received this toy for her first birthday but started playing with it at 16 months. She loves anything that plays music and the song is very catchy... I hum it all day! At 18 months she can tell me what sound about 20 of the 26 letters makes! She can also point to many of the letters if I ask her to. We were amazed that this toy could teach her so much at such a young age. We highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got to have it","review":"I was impressed by how long my child played with little leap. I was also happy with the way the toy teaches her the A,B,C's. The voice was not only loveable, but I did not get sick of hearing it. The toy is not only a learning tool for my two small childrens it is also a buddy. I have since purchased 4 other leapfrog pals and my family and I enjoy them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Educational!!!","review":"I got this toy at walmart on clearence. I couldn't believe it since leapfrog toys are so educational and fun and cost way more than what I paid for this. I bought it for my boys and they love it. It teaches alphabets and comes with a book that help kids learn how to read along. I would highly recommend this toy along with many other leapfrog toys on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 21-month-old knows her alphabet!","review":"Between this toy and Leap Frog's fridge alphabet (and lots of time with her babysitter and me) my 21-month-old knows her alphabet. Not only has she been able to recognize all of the letters for about a month now, but she can recite from A-Z (only skipping W). We bought Little Leap for her for Christmas based on another review that I read and are very glad that we did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Taught my toddler the alphabet","review":"My in-laws gave this toy to my son for Christmas when he was 19 months old. I thought he was a little young, but he did enjoy pushing all the buttons and making the frog sing.To my amazement, this toy taught him all the letters of the alphabet well before he turned 2. After just a few months of playing with this toy, he could correctly point to any letter I named (\\"Where is X\\") and correctly name any letter I pointed to (\\"What is this?\\").The song to teach each letter is the same, so to an adult the singing is rather repetitious. But this doesn't seem to bother children. After several months of play, a couple of the letters became hard to push, but that bothered me more than it did my son.I was impressed with how effectively an electronic toy could teach such a young child. I never set out to teach my son the alphabet so early, he learned it all on his own by interacting with this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"great educational toy!","review":"My son received this for his 2nd birthday last month. He loves it! After playing with it for only a few weeks, he has learned his letters and some of their sounds. I was amazed! This is a great teaching toy. He loves to play with Little Leap!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Leap Frog Products Are Simply Amazing!","review":"It is truly amazing that in about 1.5 weeks, my 20 month old daughter could recite and point to every letter of the alphabet, not to mention consistent phonetic pronunciation, and identifying the color associated with each letter. It never ceases to amaze me how ingenious this product line is. Personally, I don't get the frog theme but it is obviously NOT something my daughter cares about. Simply amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Night safety","review":"This is a great product for walking your dog in the evening. It's handy, the light is just enough to show the way.

Except for...","review":"First of all, as far as content, it was perfect. After all, it's the Bible! The NIV (New International Version) is a great, accurate and understandable version.The print is very readable and the verse numbers are in bold type which makes it easier to distinguish from the regular lettering.It only comes in hardcover and I would like to see it in a leather or bonded leather soft-cover. Also, I was hoping for a \\"verse by verse\\" set up in a \\"Drill Bible\\" (as it is in the King James or New American Standard Versions) instead of the standard NIV \\"paragraph by paragraph\\" layout (the reason I only gave it four stars). Although paragraph by paragraph is more readable for other uses.All in all, it is a great basic Bible for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to use","review":"The sound is great, the features fantastic, and you'll never be able to appreciate them, because the controls are impossible, and the manual worthless.Quick! Change the volume level of the center speaker. Just try. You'll have to push a button on the remote, after you push a button on the remote that isn't documented, then you'll be able to get to the control. The buttons for changing between 5.1 and 6.1 on the front panel, as well as the remote, are easy to find, for all you folks that swap out speaker systems daily. If you want to change balance, make a pot of coffee and a sandwich."},{"rating":"2","title":"Immpresive sound output.","review":"I purchased this product a couple of years ago and its really amazing.

Great adventure movie for the whole family. The characters are well developed and you become quite attached to some of them.The series begins just prior to the French Revolution and continues over several years.

But, these miserable productions deviate so far from the original books that the character and storylines are unrecognizable. After A&E aired this excrescense, I emailed them thus:\\"You ought to have your grog stopped.\\"Why, oh why, when people turn books into movies or video, can't they stay true to the original?

Get these movies! Then sit down with a bowl of popcorn and your family and have a blast. If only there were more characters like Hornblower, and more movies like these. Our family LOVES this series, and has watched it more than once. You have to adore Horatio--the perfect action hero because he's not quite perfect and he knows it--if he were a real person you'd want your daughter to bring him home. Anyone who sails or likes military (naval) history will have a special treat watching these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hornblower is number one!","review":"I first saw these movies from the library and loved them so much I had to beg my parents to get them for me (no easy task). I have all eight movies and I watch them at least three times a week. I am a HUGE fan of anything relating to the 17th century british navy, and enjoy watching Hornblower rise from a nervous midshipman to a high ranking officer. You don't need to see them in order, though it would help if you are watching them for the first time. A thousand times better than masters and commanders. Lots of action! Good humor. An absolute must see!

It has a simple, yet charming quality to it. There isn't much said, but it has a beautiful message. The backgrounds are interesting at times, and the characters just look like dolls, but this add's more interest to the film. The only problem is that for the dvd I felt they should have inhanced the color/picture quality. Very faded, and warn looking. The extra feature is a George Pal short of John Henry and the Inky Poo. You can find George Pal on DVD on Amazon.com, and his Puppetoons.So in the long run I really enjoyed this stop frame animation film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jiri Trnka","review":"In my youth, Jiri Trnka was a ground breaker in the world of puppet animation and creative narrative. We watched avidly for his films as they were technically fascinating, extremely witty and had a depth which english language films so lacked.In viewing Trnka again after so many years it has dated in technique but is still as fresh in content.We have become so used to the marvels of computer animation that the labourious process of stop photography with its shortcomings sadly seems somewhat lacking. However Trnka, the master, can still show a trick or two as far as content is concerned.This film is a sentimental journey for many of us, but is well worth watching as a stage of filmic development."},{"rating":"1","title":"emperor and the nightingale","review":"The claymation on this is wonderful but my kids could not stay interested in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Quality Strong Rings","review":"The D-Ring picture frame fasteners are high quality.

I must admit, that this packaging job is outstanding. The booklet, the photos, the slipcase...everything about it, visually, is extraordinary and immaculate. However, what is it they say about \\"judging a book...?\\"The actual recording is CRAP. When this was originally issued on bootleg vinyl, the mix was recorded quite a bit too slow...which is the problem here. Unfortunately, the sound editors for this potentially stellar CD ignored modern technology completely, which is to say they did not download a sound editor for free off of the internet! Any freeware editing program could speed the mix up enough for Lou, Cale, and Nico to sound normal.I have a bootleg of this that not only sounds better, but has more songs! My 20 year old VHS tape of the concert sounds better than this.What a disappointment. Hopefully, this can be reissued after it is properly edited."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE CUT AT WRONG SPEED","review":"How they could release such a great, classic outstanding concert, which even Reed called 'a night of pure heaven' (or something like that) at the wrong speed is beyond me.

Yea, the boot CD is better, hard to find."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful sound","review":"I am a fan of Lou Reed and the VU but I have to warn you that the recording is terrible! Definitely the worst sounding CD that I have ever listened to and I am not one of those experts. I had to stop listening! Could not stand the way the voice and music of Lou Reed was terribly mistreated. Does Lou know about this? This CD should have a label warning people that it could affect your hearing sensibility! Besides that I think Lou was in a very bed mood, look at the pictures, he seems so depressed to be there, and could not care less singing. It can have a minimum value only for scholars of Lou and VU."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS!!!","review":"Okay, this show was excellent, very touching and intimate... beautifully sung... but I don't know what they did to the recordings! The voices are \\"low-pitched\\", and if you hear the original bootlegs (or even better, if you have the chance to catch the filmed version of it), you will soon notice that on this cd, the whole stuff is slower and the voices are lower. Reed and Nico may have already low voices but this is really annoying! Who wants to hear \\"Femme Fatale\\" in another key than the original one?I payed for it quite an expensive price, this cd being available only in import here in France, and felt like I was cheated. It's a real shame that some people will discover this show only by listening to this. Better stick to your old bootlegs... ;op"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent disc for those that just want one Oasis album.","review":"I can whine and moan and complain like other reviewers about which songs should have been included but were skipped or that Be Here Now was omitted altogether from this compilation, but everyone has to understand that this CD is merely a concise sampler of Oasis's career from 1994 - 2006. People that are interested in buying this CD probably don't want to own an Oasis album and simply want to own the songs they heard playing on the radio back in the 90s or are trying to see if spending money on Oasis's back catalog is \\"worth it\\" from a sampling of their career. If either is the case, this CD will suffice.

It does require assembly, which is the problem.As is the norm these days with everything I have bought that is made in China, the hardware is cheap and doesn't fit right. The screws are too long so that the base doesn't tighten enough to be stable and the metal is so soft that I very easily stripped the screw heads (and I am not a very strong person, so this is just silly). I need to go to the hardware store to pick up new hardware for it. Since my husband is out of town for 3 months and I work full time and have an 8 month old, that is unlikely to happen any time soon. So, the mirror is propped against the the wall and will likely stay that way for the next few months until I'll have time to replace the cheap hardware. It's a pretty mirror though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This mirror is just as pretty in person as in the picture. It arrived sooner than expected and in great shape!

Incroyable!But when you have a chance to make a film with two Academy Award winners, Juliette Binoche and William Hurt, set both in New York and Paris, who would pass the chance? Chantal Ackerman could not, the opportunity to make her first English speaking film a bonus.The film is a reminder of how difficult it is to cross the pond movie-wise. Nuance and sub-text is awkward or incomprehensible here-the threads on which the movie is woven are frassled.This artsy little film survives entirely on Binoche's vitality, her French innocence and enthusiasm dominates every negative New York influence her character encounters.It fails most everywhere else, sadly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of 2 good actors and your time.","review":"Hurt and Binoche are normally intelligent actors, and what they are doing in this inane, irritating formula film is beyond me.

Unfortunately, I don't really want to read it to my son (who asks for Toot and Puddle every day) because the story ends up calling one of the characters a \\"prima donna\\" and then proceeds to explain what they mean by that (which isn't any better than the name-calling was by itself).Maybe many parents wouldn't mind this book, but I am careful to try to avoid examples of name-calling.Of course, the pictures are incredibly beautiful as usual, and there is a nice lesson in the story, as usual. I just wish authors as well as tv cartoon writers would be more aware of name-calling. I wouldn't want to hear my little guy or girl calling one of their friends a prima donna, no matter how well the shoe fits.

True aikido rejects all forms of contests and tournaments. Only Public demonstrations are given or should be given to show a display of constant training, not of ego accomplishment from the likes of sports where there is a winner and a loser. Aikido is not about who wins, who's tougher, or who is better, it's about personal achievement of mind/body. I must ask all to be cautious of such writings involving aikido being made to look like a sport or any competition.

It seems to be a sturdy product though and I am thrilled with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for the price.","review":"You typically get what you pay for but I believe that this screen surpassed what I paid for considering most other screens I looked into were at least twice as expensive. The setup was not perfect and straightforward but it still only took me about 2 hours from opening the box to mounting on the wall. There was one bracket that didn't want to catch but it was a simple fix by folding some paper to the appropriate width and snapping the bracket in with the paper surrounding it. I have no ambient light in my room so the actual quality of picture is perfect (might not work as great for you if you have ambient light pouring into your room - where gray screens are supposed to perform better). All in all, I bought it over 2 years ago and wouldn't hesitate buying it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price, good screen","review":"Screen comes in a really tall box. Assembly was technically easy to do, but requires some strength to pull the screen tight and then to pull the frame into place over the casters. Screen arrived clean and once it was pulled tight there were no visible wrinkles. The frame is sturdy once it is hung properly because the casters are actually attached further apart than the frame and you pull the frame over them in order to make it a tight fit. The frame has a fake velvet cover which makes it look nice on the wall. I don't really notice any gain improvements and I wish they sold the gray screen so it would help the black levels, but the screen is a major improvement over my wall. Best of all, it was inexpensive and worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Value","review":"I ordered this screen on 1/12 and received it 1/13 from Amazon in excellent condition. For what it's worth this screen is amazing hands down. I've been in the HT / Tech industry for 20 years and I'm pretty impressed.

I have to say that the construction of this product is the worst. The framing rods go together badly and there are many other problems that are wrong with the unit. The actual screen quality was mediocre compared to the Elite and Da-lite. Even though they all had similar screen gain, this unit really had a significant loss in color reproduction.

The mat was a poor fit (e.g., holes did not line up with the vents). And the fabric retained a bumpy look; it would not lay flat even after I tried to steam it and leave it out in the open to flatten. In desperation, I tried to iron it, which was a mistake because the patch I ironed ended up with a melted look.

This book permitted me to understand what we westerner's often cast of as the \\"Russian personnality\\" and the complexity of the historical, social and psychological climate of Russia and the Russians shortly before the Bolshevik revolution. This novel does not ressemble any ohter of Conrad's as it has a strange feeling or atmosphere to it that can barely be grasped.

If you are familiar with the character \\"Patty Simcox\\" from \\"Grease\\", if she wrote a book, I would imagine it would be comparable.

Eloise Kelly is a modern day doctoral student searching for information on Napoleonic spies. The story travels between Eloise's modern day quest and the Napoleonic Wars.I'm a big fan of both Elizabeth Peters and Bridget Jones, and I thoroughly enjoyed the Pink Carnation and the rest of the series.

I highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"A weighty work of historical fiction this is not","review":"There were some clever parts to this novel and some of the characters were rather humorous and entertaining but, in the end, this book was nothing more than a romance novel masquerading as historical fiction. I was HUGELY disappointed in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous.","review":"I bought this expecting a little light-hearted, historical romance fun. What I got instead was a book full of cliches, stupid jokes, stereotyped characters, and annoyingly written, stupidly orchestrated, cheesy love scenes. The entire plot was completely obvious from the beginning. I didn't even waste my time finishing it, just flipped to the back to confirm I was right. It's going back to the bookstore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brown Paper Packages Tied Up With String","review":"This novel could have been so much more. It seems anyone from Harvard can get a book deal these days. The author may be a little too young to undertake such a series of books. I was lost in the unrealistic characters and the over used catch phrases like \\"brown paper packages tied up with string.\\" As soon as I would get the score of The Sound of Music out of my head she would say it again. Don't get me started on when she talked about Robin Hood wearing manly tights. Overall very disappointing. Leave this one alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche-laden","review":"I picked this up looking for something light to read in waiting rooms. What a mistake! Every chick-lit post-Bridget Jones cliche is there, with an overlay of \\"history\\". The pacing feels like the author hit her contracted number of words and suddenly realized that she had better wrap it up. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"too predictable but still good","review":"I finally got a chance to read this book, recommended by a local store clerk. Unfortunately, when I got to the chapter in which Eloise finds information that might help her find out who the Pink Carnation is, it was easy from then on for the reader to know who the Carnation was indeed. It was way too predictable. The story (of all these spies) *is* interesting, it's just too bad that Willig could not come up with other possibilities to tell the reader who the spy was. In the end, there was no twist, and the ending actually left me unsatisfied. No, I won't spoil it and tell you who is the Carnation, you will find out yourself when you read it. And no, I will not read the follow up of the book, The Masque of the Black Tulip.Despite this, Willig's writing is quite enjoyable, and the book reads very easily. If you like predictable novels, you'll definitely enjoy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zounds! One is all it's worth","review":"A light, light, light book. The best that can be said is that it's a good book for when you're totally brain-dead; it gives you something to look at that doesn't take much intelligence. Slightly escapist.Other than that, it's a mess. The characters are basically modern people set back in the 1800's, with token allusions to the era. The way they spoke and behaved, aside from overused exclamations such as \\"Zounds,\\" was much more 2004 than 1804. Others have spoken of sloppy history; I don't know enough to critique that, but it wouldn't surprise me. I grew increasingly irritated by the anachronisms.In short, I have a sneaky suspicion the author has good connections. To get not only this book published, but an entire series?? Zounds!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Return to \\"Chick Lit\\"","review":"I haven't been this excited about a books since I was eight, when I first read Anne of Green Gables. Willig's first novel in her series of historical fiction/chick lit works has become one of my favorites, of all time. After years of devouring the stereotypical chick lit novels, I thought I had exhausted the genre, and myself. Willig continually surprised me, with unexpected plot twists, charmingly crafted characters, and the academic requirements needed to write a really good and believable historical fiction. Plus, with the framing of the historical story within the subplot of a modern-day history grad from Harvard, readers are presented with two inspiring heroines with which to fall in love. I can't wait to read the next one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"R rated Scarlet Pimpernel wannabe","review":"Alas, what begins as a light fun read deteriorates to farce.The author tried to weave a modern search for a historical swashbuckler in with the period action. The current day tale is quite unnecessary and gets lost. As for the swashbuckling portion of the story, the French officials are the only ones who seem unable to determine who the cloaked figure is. He's busy saving England from the French, while groping Our Heroine. The author spends far too much time (and written detail) on the groping and panting, swollen this and that, bulging other. As for Our Heroine, the author cannot decide whether she is cunning enough to overthrow the French plot against England, or cunny enough to lure half the men in the story.An ok summertime beach read, but Scarlet Pimpernel is a much better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Dissapointment!","review":"Glib dialogue, run-of-the-mill characters.

You should apologize to the Italians and the Dutch at the first opportunity!\\"'\\"Mais zee Italians, zey invited me!\\" Bonaparte exclaimed indignantly.'I bought this book hoping for a delightful romp through the imaginary days of the Scarlet Pimpernel.

Unfortunately the author can't write dialogue and can only imagine romance blossoming from people who banter in unclever, unrealistic (even for a romance novel) fashions.

The premise is there (it had previously been written) but the story and execution fall short. The whole thing was entirely too slow and I was overwhelmingly bored with the story. I just HAD to stop.The characters were simply ludicrous. Why would some random senseless girl suddenly have the bright idea to go and ask the surviving ancestors about the Pink Carnation when hundreds of scholars just failed to even comprehend that idea? The whole idea just is unfathomable to me. Every fiber of my being screamed that Lord Richard should not have survived, to invade the French Secret service with how incompetent he was was a miracle in itself.

This had been a bookclub pick, so I didn't have a choice in reading this book. It was very hard to get into-seriously-the book got somewhat engaging at around page 300 or so. I felt that it was a step above a \\"typical\\" bodice-ripping book, but not by much. It was a very \\"fluff-filled\\" book. It was very easy chick lit and a little to blah for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply awful.","review":"Maybe, just maybe, this terrible bit of amateurish drivel can be attributed to the author's youth, but I suspect her purple prose and hackneyed storyline have more to do with far too much made-for-television movie watching than chronological age.

To be fair, it is easy to read (unless typos frustrate you) and the subject matter is light and entertaining.

It isn't. Just another bodice ripper. If you like that sort of thing. I don't so I'm not even sure if it's a good one.

I like historical fiction. I enjoy it even when it isn't accurate, so long as it is written well. But this book isn't even close. It's insulting, as in, I can't believe they publish this pooh. There's a place for writing that is this bad. The internet.To sum this up, Pink Carnation is comparable to bad fanfiction. Find some good fanfiction online and save some trees and money by not buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it's cracked up to be.","review":"The publiciity surrounding this book suggested that it was a well-researched historic novel. This book is pure romance and utterly predictable. The author has a good flow and is pleasant. However, the plot is weak. I think the author has a future in romance but, alas, this book is more of a rough draft than a finished product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"I can usually force myself to read a romance novel, not so, however with this. The constant use of simile, including the ridiculous love scenes, \\"She cried out her pleasure as a thousand diamond sparkles exploded across the back of her eyes...\\" (please) was annoying in the extreme. The author tried to be funny, but ended up being obnoxious instead. I did give this one star, and even if I could have given it no stars I would have given it at least one due to the author's effort to entertain her readers. Next time I would suggest she do a little more research, and give her readers a little more to chew on other than her one dimensional characters, and predictable, silly story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obvious, contrived, amateurish","review":"Gads, this is practically unreadable -- loaded with cliches, obvious hints, and all the other chick lit staples. I could not get past the first couple chapters, in which a grad student is simply given free reign with and access to a chest of invaluable letters by the letter-writers' heir. That credibility-killer was enough to stanch my interest, but i read on a little further as I didn't want to be hasty. It only got worse...Give this a wide berth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Potential Shelf Life","review":"I loved the direction Lauren Willig took this novel. It was like reading two books in one- a historical and a contemporary romance. Yet it still managed to blend seamlessly throughout the entire novel. It was actually one of the better romance novels by an unknown author [to me] that I have read recently. She is definitely an author that I will pick up again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining light reading marrying \\"chick lit\\" with historical fiction","review":"This book marries the \\"chick lit\\" genre with historical fiction - my two favorites. As with any \\"chick lit\\" book, you know you're not in for a novel worthy of a Nobel Prize in literature. However, I still found it light & entertaining. And toward the end, I couldn't put it down. To me, that's plenty to keep me entertained.A few historical accuracies I question, particularly in relation to authentic period dialect. And the racy parts rival a Harlequin series romance novel, which I hate, but in the context of a book with a plot that is much more thoughtful, the book redeems itself.Overall, I found it entertaining & have continued reading on in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenile and Historically Atrocious","review":"This reads like something a present-day 17-year-old might have written. I suppose as a light-weight, fairly brainless, romantic throw-away novel, it's okay, but I mainly found the characters to be unbelievable, unsympathetic and annoying. The historical aspects are so badly done as to be ridiculous. A young woman in 1803 who acted as Amy does would have been looked on as a trollop, to put it nicely, and the hero, Lord Richard, who claims to love her, would rightly have been considered a cad or worse. The dialogue and characterizations often struck me as anachronistic they're so wrong for the time period. If you like Jane Austin or the Brontes, stay away from this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"I'm always excited for a historical novel with a female lead, so I was very excited to start this book. However, I found it laughingly predictable (the cover gives away the secret), and I found the characters to be one dimensional. Napoleon is a cliched, noisy, little man, Amy is an obnoxious, perky, heroine who acts like she lives in the 21st century. For those of you who know the term \\"Mary-Sue\\" it applies here.For all the \\"research\\" done about historical events and places, Willig forgot to look into manners and social customs. She attempts a Jane Austen tone but fails.I was expecting historical fiction along the lines of Magaret George and got a tawdry romance novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I really wanted to like this book, and I did for about the first half. Towards the end the story just became too unbelievable. It seemed as though the characters were fully modern individuals who just happened to be wearing period clothing. The so called spies were as inconspicuous as an elephant in a china shop. The very end up of the book was really the last straw for me, it was incredibly cheesy and predictable, and worst of all entirely implausible.The dual storyline of the modern Eloise had potential, but never went anywhere and was therefore unnecessary and didn't flow with the \\"historical\\" (I use the term loosely in regards to this book) storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Book","review":"This is my first foray into \\"Chick Lit.\\" I really enjoyed this book and found the characters interesting and the writing witty and entertaining. I knew after reading the first few pages that this would be fun to read. I will continue on to the next four books in the \\"Carnation\\" series and see where this all goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misrepresented item","review":"This item was listed as a hardcover book. When I received a paperback version, I contacted the seller. He claimed it had been listed as a paperback. I sent him a screen dump which clearly indicated \\"hardcover edition.\\" I returned the book to him and have not received my money back. BUYER BEWARE."},{"rating":"1","title":"This kit was made for beginners to understand the basics","review":"I found the two books to be lacking in subject depth. Many times there would be a statement of fact which I knew meant nothing, but instead of following the statement of inference with the underlying facts the author would just go merrily on his way with the next subject. This collection of two books and a CD was worth about $19.95 instead of the $160 required to find out it's uslessness. If I could get my money back I would and if someone other than the authors immediate family had written in a review I would have never bought this kit. I think Microsoft Press should either rewrite this kit or take it off the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good study guide for MSSQL","review":"This is a good study guide for Microsoft SQL Server 6.5 MCSE exams. If you are looking for an elective to complete your MCSE, and you choose this one, be prepared to spend a lot of hours getting to know the technical content in this book.In the front of the book there is a chart that specifies which chapters to read depending on the exam you would like to take. I found 3 questions on the exam which were not covered in the chapters listed. If you are going to take both SQL Server tests, I recommend reading it all (900+ pages) and then taking both exams."},{"rating":"2","title":"carax at his finest","review":"this movie may come off as a simple love story, but let's face it, it's not. like most anything done by carax, it's more about film, and its semiological consequences, than anything else. this film, number three by carax, shows a strong truffaut influence, e.g. tirez sur le pianiste. though not as experimental as pola x, and not as indebted to godard as boy meets girl, there are clear tributes to vigo throughout. self-conscious, highly symbolic, intertextual. carax may be the finest director of his generation. just consider his very human treatment of lavant's character, for example. only truffaut, or maybe bresson, compares to that kind of characterization, though surely an ironic \\"realism\\" given the context of this film. all in all, this is a great achievement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly cr@ptastic!","review":"This movie starts slowly & drags on from there. There is nothing appealing about this film: even the lovely Juliet Binoche is made up to look horrible most of the time, & at best plain in some of the later scenes. Here's a clue for you: if the best thing that can be said about a film as shown in largest text on the back cover is \\"Inspired & original,\\" then you know you've got a real loser, since it isn't even \\"memorable!\\" OMG what a dog: take this thing back out behind the barn & shoot it to put it out of its misery!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Movies Ever Made","review":"This movie is loud, annoying and cliche. It romanticizes poverty and violence. Waterskiing on the Seine, and blind, coughing, limping amore-corniness to the point of pain. And bad acting! The giggling parts were cringe inducing, that and the \\"art\\". All in all, it made me dump the person who recommended it to me. I know that sounds like it biases me, but really, this and \\"Blame it on the Bellboy\\" were the two worst movies I have ever seen. ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable","review":"I own lots of French DVDs and watch them all the time so I am by no means trapped in a Hollywood sensibility. To be fair, my review is based only on the first quarter or so of this film, which was as much as I could stand. If you -- like me -- have a limited capacity to get down and dirty with psychotic street people living like animals, then you and I are thinking alike. Obviously many people have watched it and heartily approve. To me, it is unwatchable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most romantic movie out there!","review":"This movie has gone from easy to hard. The story is about a almost blind homeless girl played by Juliette Binoche and a homeless fire eater played by Alex Lavant. One day they meet at the bridge Pont-Neuf. Romance builds up and they fall in love. But living on the street is not easy and this is what the story is about. I don't want to spoil the plot for those who hasn't seen the movie. I truly recommend this to anyone familiar with Juliette Binoche works. A true masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good, don't buy it.","review":"This is more like a toy than a therapeutic massage device. It's advertised as two speeds, HA! The low speed was the only one you could feel at all. When I switched to high it just hummed. Six different heads do no good at all if the motor doesn't vibrate. It may be OK if you just want it for your face. But it absolutely will not relieve sore muscles or tired feet. Amazon says they will take it back, so you can always do that. But it would be better to not buy it in the first place. Save a trip to the Post Office. Look at some of the other massage units. One of them must be better than this. 'Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dr. Scholl's DR7512C Personal Massager","review":"I returned this product recently because it had virtually no power to loosen tight muscles even though it came with two speeds.

The snagless protectors work well, particularly when fishing through holes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Marvel Universe Game","review":"First off, I'd like to mention that I own both the PC and the Wii versions of this game. I purchased the PC version when the game was first released and this was the first game I purchased for use with my brand new Wii. As for gameplay, I didn't find the Wii controls hard to learn and I loved having the option to either push controller buttons for attacks or use the assigned remote movements. I also found gameplay with the Wii remote and nunchuck much more comfortable; I could play for longer without my hands going crampy like they can with a traditional controller.I really liked that the game follows the X-Men: Legends format in that if you've played either X-Men: Legends or X-Men: Legends II you already know the basics for playing Ultimate Marvel Alliance. My only real quip is playable characters. I'd really like for Rogue to be a playable character but that's just my little Wolverine/Rogue 'shipper heart wanting to play them on the same team."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marvel Ultimate Alliance- Not as Good as I Had Hoped","review":"I had high expectations for this game, but was Ultimately let down. Getting to work with all of the superheroes is great, but since you have four at once, they tend to get in each other's way, and you can become boxed in. It is also not always intuitive as to what your goal is for each level, and it is easy to get lost without a full screen map. I started out at the easy level, just to learn how it all worked, and now I can't change the level without restarting my game: kind of annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad controls, pretty repetitive","review":"the wii controls for this game just really feel like an afterthought, they really don't work well at all. it plays better with the more standard alternate controls. This is basically an isometric brawler, pretty fun using your super powers to beat up dudes for a while, but it quickly becomes repetitive. there are many better games for the wii."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not worth buying if you already have other X-men games.","review":"The graphic of Wii version is the same as my Xbox classical but it still looks good to me. The game play is not more interesting than the old X-men game I have on classical Xbox.The most disappointing thing is the Wii remote controller does not work well with action games. Many times, I moved the controller to one direction but my character moved to a different direction or it did not respond at all. To get accurate movements, I have to use Nintendo classical controller to play action games. This is where Wii loses its attraction because movements on the classical controller are not as \\"natural\\" as the Wii remote.The only positive thing about this game is it has more characters than in other X-men games.In short, it's not worth buying if you already have other X-men games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a rating","review":"Im not in the mood to write a whole review for this game because in my opinion, its not even worth that. The new Wii remote controls for this game suck and its just a copy of X-men from older systems. Not worth to be on the Wii"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I gave this to my 5 year old son, who is very into superheroes and he absolutely loves this game!!

I currently own it for Xbox 360 also. Reccommended for fans of Marvel comics/movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good game for a great price","review":"I read all these reviews before buying this game for my wii system. I was concerned about all the negative talk about camera control and and wiimote not responding, but I figured for 20 bucks its worth a shot. It is true that the camera control on the nunchuk makes it a little more difficult. After a fight sequence sometimes I would get turned around and not sure of the direction I was going, but it is a minor problem. Overall I think this is a fun game and well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crashed repeatedly, unplayable (wii, 2012)","review":"We were unable to play this 2006 game on our Wii console.

This box has indeed 17 DVDs and not 16. The 17th is the Bonus Disk mentioned in some reviews. It is tucked at the far right after DVD 16 in a plain white sleeve. It also took me a while to discover it.2. The Episodes are not in the airing sequence, which is usually the logical one but in production number sequence which is usually not the logical one.

When Space 1999 came out in the early 70's George Lucas claimed he woudn't have been able to make Star Wars without it. Even today the show feels very modern with its blend of gothic horror, the paranormal and science fiction. Many episodes are filmed in a neo-surrealistic style akin to Luis Bunel and Hitchcock. This mega set is the way to go, since it has year 1 and 2 episodes in order and bonus material. In a long run it will be cheaper to buy this set than the individual sets. This is the sci-fi release of 2003!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What the ... ?","review":"After buying the first 6 sets individually, I only hope that the special features announce for this MEGA Set will be available on the last DVD sets (number 8).

I have been a huge fan when I was a kid and looking at those fantastic Eagle spaceship again was a great source of fun and pleasure.If you have already started buying the first DVD sets individualy like me, you are probably feeling frustrated by the fact that we didn't see that MEGA DVD Set comming. I DO !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the first season was great , but the second one killed the show","review":"i give this set a 4 only because the second season of this fun show from my childhood, was not very good.the science was off but the show was fun and much more intense than most sci-fi shows. martin landau and barbara bain are the leads in this story about the moon being blasted out of orbit of the earth and sent like a spaceship into outer space. some great f/x and some good stories the first season. then someone tried to fix what wasn't broken and they re-tooled the show for the 2nd season and blew it. they cut cast members changed the sets and never offered and reason or told what happened to the people who left. plus to cash in on the spock/alien angle they added an alien woman who can change into any living thing she wants to. all in all though this is fun to watch the disc look great"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Campy but lovable series","review":"I was around ten when I first saw Space 1999. I loved it, even though at the time I thought the level of technology being attributed to humanity by 1999 was a little far fetched. Even my young mind knew we were not going to be on the moon in any substantial form in 1999. I always thought it should have been Space 2029 or Space 2039. This would have made it a little more plausible to begin with. However with that said, it's a fun series. Who doesn't love the eagles, the moon base design, and the color-striped armbands? Admittedly, some of the stories, especially in the 2nd second pushed even a ten year olds limit of imagination. Who can forget the episode when crewmembers regress back and forth to cavemen, yet every time in their metamorphic jump, their clothes change! One moment their cavemen wearing furs, the next modern humans, but now wearing space suits. Silly, yes, but fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 for show 1 for for disks","review":"Buyer beware, if you already bought the disks by set, this is just repackaging.

The situations seem totally random and the characters are inconsistent at best. OK, so a number of Star Trek episodes were ludicrous too.

His vivid character descriptions made one feel he was in a smoke filled, \\"expat\\" barroom alive with dreams and deals. However much like the Kee Bird herself, Mr. Hoffman's book failed to clear the runway and fly the reader to a satisfying landing. After the Kee Bird tale the author lapsed into a meandering style as he wrote of hohum tell-me-about-yourself visits with vintage aircraft collectors and relatively mundane (cf. the Kee Bird) aircraft recovery ops. Additionally, as noted by another reviewer, if you are a student of vintage aircraft you already know of the Hoffman tales via PBS, Discovey, and aeronautical periodicals."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing read about a fascinating subject","review":"My immediate enthusiasm for this story waned pretty quickly, under the influence of Hoffman's many errors of fact, so disappointing from one with his aviation credentials. Such obvious and simple errors, which should have yielded to even the most superficial research (You're standing there in front of the engine&#65533;Just count the cylinders, fer Chrissakes!), cast a nagging doubt over everything else he has to say. And why the hokey cloak-&-dagger act concerning the obsessive collector \\"somewhere in the midwest\\"? The Walter A.

You pretty much know who he's going to kill; it's just a matter of time.His voiceovers are as entertaining as ever, Debra is still swearing up a storm, and Jimmy Smits does a good job as an attorney who wishes to partner with Dexter in getting rid of anyone deemed to be a bad guy. There are also several close calls during which Dexter's activities are almost revealed.Dexter also tries to separate somewhat from Harry and the Code, with mixed results.I'd be curious to see what would happen if Debra, who is gaining power, ever gets too close to discovering the truth about her brother."},{"rating":"2","title":"great series","review":"Mr. Hall does great work once again, i love this show and couldn't wait to get it.

Showtime doesn't want you to.But didn't you PAY for this DVD? Doesn't matter. Shut up and watch the way Showtime wants you to watch. You may think you're a Dexter fan, but you're not: you're a potential video pirate. You're lucky to even get an actual DVD in the box.Plus, the extra interviews are uncut, and the quality is poor.

I was a little skeptical about the hype, but was quickly drawn into the first season. Season two was great up until the last couple episodes. Season three is pure crap, from start to finish.The powers that be have taken what was a well written and well acted show and transformed it into a second rate soap opera. I can almost hear the director yelling, \\"Anguish, I need more anguish!!\\" at the actors as they go to a close up of agony on the face of whatever actor is grossly overacting the cheesy and predictable drama that is unfolding in any given scene on any given episode of season 3.If you want a well written, well acted, well directed drama, buy The Wire. Season 3 of Dexter is a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Season Yet. Serially","review":"Season 1 was harrowing and chilling. Season 2 was tense and dramatic. Season 3 has it all. It seems the writers (bless 'em) really hit their stride in this season. Everyone gets their spotlight, and everyone shines like stainless steel in a hard spotlight. I cannot enthuse enough about this season of the series. If you haven't seen any Dexter, don't start here. You'll miss the nuances of character development. If you've been following Dexter you WILL find yourself captivated like you were on the slab in one of his killing rooms. I will not give away any plot points. Suffice to say that everyone from the directors to the actors to the writers have stepped up and delivered an epic plot arc. This is my favorite season thus far, which is a strong statement when considering how amazing the 1st season was.

Season 3 does a good job of transitioning from one story and scenario to a completely different one by the end of the season.There is an issue with the DVDs, however. The main title screen shows a background loop of scenes from the series. These scenes are from the whole season, not just the disk you're watching, and they contain major spoilers from later in the season. These scenes are unavoidable, they begin playing at the menu screen, and you can't turn them off. Its very disappointing, not to mention unnecessary.Verdict: Great show, love it. Skip the DVDs, though, grab season 3 through digital distribution if you want to watch all the episodes fresh."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Quality Viewing","review":"Another great season of Dexter! Its wonderful to have access to quality entertainment without commercial interruption. Amazon, you are the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the top 5 shows on TV","review":"First, @ SunWolf - Dexter's girlfriend Rita has been played by the same actress from the beginning (Julie Benz). No swap a-la Becky in Rosanne.Now to the show... Dexter is an incredible series. The fact that Showtime can put a harder edge on it than network TV could makes a huge difference. The freedom to up the violence, gore, nudity and sex has paid big dividends. HBO and Showtime have quickly become the mecca for anyone looking for quality shows. I believe Dexter leads an exclusive pack that also includes Weeds and True Blood close behind. I hope Dexter makes a long, Soprano-type run. I would love to see this series make it to 8 or 10 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Price but Video Quality Questionable...","review":"Don't know if this was a bootleg or what, but the video quality was poor.Kept pixilating during motion sequences.Other than that, we love the Dexter series."},{"rating":"2","title":"This show has me hooked!","review":"This show has me hooked! I rented season 1 & 2 and had no choice but to download season 3 at $1.99/episode. Worth every penny! You see Dexter start to transform from an isolated but mainstreamed sociopath into a husband and father. Dexter toys with the notion of having a \\"friend\\" and the trust it encompasses. I can't wait for Season 4. Just when you think Dexter is going to get caught, he doesn't - in a weird and twisted chain of events, he doesn't. Almost like devine intervention (or a creative writing team)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very thought out...","review":"The one thing I notice is that 'negative' reviews are not looked highly upon, especially shows with a following.And another thing about rating this. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to be rating the product (blu-ray dvd), or I'm rating this season of the show.More specifically I am rating this show's season.I am a huge fan of this show, but i felt this season was VERY sloppy. Very underdeveloped ideas, sub-par drama, followed by lousy resolution and following action.Compared to the first 2 seasons, it seemed like this season was a collection of random ideas they joined together that were rejects of the other seasons.The Shows acting was great, and the first 3-4 episodes were good/great. It led to some mystery and developing drama... But just became unfocused, and seemed like... the person who originally was writing the plot died and let some random person just try to finish it.Great Show, i love it, I just hope the next season redeems the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh yes.

As I continued to watch it though, I really began to enjoy it, and thought that just maybe it was as good as I had been told. Season 3 really made me ask myself what I ever liked about this show. It felt like a standard, joe schmoe cop show almost. Dexter's sister is now an ace detective, Dexter's exploits are not shocking and completely predictable, and the remainder of the cast provides one pointless subplot after another."},{"rating":"2","title":"great series","review":"absolyutely love this series been following it since it came out and i wanted to relive the magic by buying them"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps Getting Better","review":"This is a very interesting series with an even more interesting story line: A serial killer with a code.

If you're wondering how each season can just keep getting better and better, join the crowd. Each episode in season 3 is absolutely mesmerizing. The razor-sharp humor is there, of course, but wait until you see Jimmy Smits play Miguel Prado. You simply won't believe how amazing he is. The action is gripping, explosive, etc., etc. I know I'm gushing, but it is so very deserving of the highest rating I can give it.

And you know, that if a show adds a baby to the plot it is on the way down. Seasons One and Two were multi layered. Three was just predictable. The Ice Truck Killer was wonderfully developed. The Skinner was a pathetic parody with very little intelligent development. You knew right from the beginning what Jimmy Smits character was headed for. By the way what happened to Deb's previous boyfriend? Are we just to assume that he headed off for another Serial killer and Deb was just fine with that? Where is all that multi character interplay/tension that was so wonderfully developed in S1&2? Now everybody is nice nice? PS: to the person that thinks Dexter is the best show ever made television. I beg to differ: it was The Sopranos!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Show, Very Poor Quality DVD","review":"I LOVED the first two seasons and watched them through Netflix's streaming and then bought these discs to catch up on the third season.Apart from other shows' episodes, there are NO Special Features in this set.

I have a Mac and the disc locked up my computer twice--that never happens, but this disc did it both times.The video transfer is grainy and well beneath acceptable. While playing in my HD-DVD player, the video played at what appeared to be maybe 12 frames per second.

They would rather put all their computer resources / servers toward selling us this stuff instead of actually making it work. So, if you have a choice of buying on Itunes and downloading it you would probably be better off than going through the disappointment. Of course, if Amazon would give me my money back I might not have to tell you all these nasty things about them. They are like the Wizard of Oz, pulling all these little levers, but really they are just scared little people who don't know what else to do with their time. They live in a cold, dark place where it rains all the time, and even the Canadians won't go there.

I'm sure the season itself is good, as the first 2 were amazing, but due to technical difficulties I can't see the rest of it, and apparently I'm not the only one thats run into problems of this kind with it, so... The first season played fine on a PS3, but then it'd automatically reset the player if I tried viewing beyond that. I watched the 2nd episode on my PC, and then the 3rd episode would \\"skip\\" and become pixelated with every other frame or so, same with the 2nd disc when I tried it.

I would give the printed version 5 stars.The KINDLE version does not feature live links from the Table of Contents and lacks the Index all together.

The original publication date is 1895, not 1908.Offhand, I know very little about this book, other than its original publication date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for anyone working with SQL 7 DW","review":"This is an excellent book. It has three detailed chapters on MDX, good descriptions on how to build data warehouses with SQL 7, a discussion on DTS, and includes an introductory chapter on OLAP for those not familiar with it. Great chapter on optimizing a SQL DW, too. My only negative comment is that I found chapter 9 wasn't that useful, and read it after I read the other chapters. I also skipped the code sample in the appendix. Everything else in the book is good. I highly recommend the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can get the same thing for free","review":"I've actually recommended this book on two occaisions to OLAP beginners because it is the only book I know of that covers OLAP from star schemas to DTS to cubes to MDX to ADOMD. That is this book's one redeeming quality. So if you read this, you'll get a good idea of what is going to be involved in an OLAP project. But don't expect to learn much else, however. There is very little in this book that you could not learn from Books Online or MSDN for free. The book is riddled with typos, grammar errors, spelling mistakes, and technical mistakes. I wonder if the editors were paid--they shouldn't have been! Don't be fooled by the \\"Technical Reference\\" moniker at all--it is not going to be much help to a technician, especially one who has even basic OLAP knowledge. Bottom line: get this book for a beginner who needs a broad, sweeping overview.

I purchased \\"Ho Ho Hoey\\" 2 and 3 from amazon. Unfortunately this CD seems to have more than it's fair share of lifeless drivel. I guess I'll have to make a compilation CD of the few good songs and be happy with that.I guess it depends on what your expectation for the CD are.

In actuality, it is for children dealing with the stigma of bedwetting. The book emphasizes how it is OK to wet the bed and OK for Mom to constantly change the sheets and wash the PJs.

It also occurred to me that maybe the makers of this movie had just changed the ending in order to \\"change everything.\\" Curiosity piqued, I bought it. Nope, it's the same story of complacency.

The written short story is better with using your own imagination. This reminds me of a 20 minute long trailer for a pretentious art film. I find it more of an insult to Vonnegut's work.

I have not seen something as beautifully put together as \\"2081\\" in a long, long while.While this film, like all things transferred from text to screen, is not exact or perfect in its delivery, it doesn't ruin the story or hinder the message. Purists might disprove of the delivery but that isn't worth wasting time considering.The writing is appropriate for the production and doesn't bog itself down putting words into the mouths of the characters. It maintains the Dystopian environment of complete equality without having somebody preach excessively, bludgeoning you with the message.

I've heard nothing but good things--except that everybody wishes the film were longer, until I explain to them how short the original story is.The acting is impressive, the imagery is vivid, the music inspiring, and the message is timeless.

It has distinct meaning for contemporary North America where \\"politically correct\\" regression to the mean in politics, finance, religion, journalism and leadership appears to be gaining steam. With communication through the written word also on the decline it is short films like this that stand the best chance of comunicating to the widest of young audiences. Hopefully the producers of this film will also consider other, perhaps longer, films. This Perfect Day by Ira Levin would be another worthy candidate for them to consider producing. Show this film to your teenager and discuss it with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harrison Bergeron in 2081","review":"This dystopian vision of the future is portrayed with chilling naturalism, and for twenty-five minutes or so you are a witness to a father's nightmare as he watches helplessly his son's final act of personal freedom and ultimate execution by the forces of state 'normality'. Kurt Vonnegut's story is surely up there for being one of the best 'futuristic' tales of the twentieth century, and this short film does the story almost full justice(the dance scene in the story is not captured on film as well as it might have been). Overall this is well worth a look at, and, if you are a teacher of Literature in English as I am then this is well worth having as a DVD resource. Not a film to enjoy, but a piece to cherish nonetheless as a cautionary tale. J. Bourke (Ireland)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"A great movie. A must see for those who read Harrison Bergeron. Also a must see for students of film who want to know how to turn a book into a movie correctly.I cannot recommend it for general audiences though. Most people will find it lacking. However, if you know this is your genre or the trailer gives you goosebumps, buy this movie. Possibly twice. You'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sister is a Special Friend","review":"This is a lovely book of uplifting thoughts, poems and quotes regarding the special relationship between sisters.

Imagine my surprise and dismay when I discovered that it didn't actually cover version 10.1! I immediately called the publisher to complain, and to my delight, they sent me a CD-ROM containing an entire 10.1 PDF update to the book. What started out as a bummer worked out to my advantage in the end, and now I've got the supremely portable (10.1) edition. Hopefully they'll integrate this stuff into a future printing (which would earn it a \\"5\\").

I found it to be too squishy and when lying on it, there's no real noticable indentation in the middle. I think it's because they used foam rubber to fill it. However, it is machine washable.

The piece in the tailgate snapped off....and I cant get to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cool","review":"I purchased this item because I saw it installed on a friends truck. The purchase was no problems and arrived on time. Installation is much easier if you have 3 people (2 is a must). The installation process is fairly straight forward... be careful to get the bar set to exactly the correct spots (marked on the bar with white/red paint dots). In my case the hole in the tailgate bottom was about 1/16\\" off and had to be drilled out a bit more in order to get the tailgate back on the posts. Other than that it went smooth and I am very happy with the results. I installed on a 2007 GMC Sierra Classic with a 6' bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Item for the price!","review":"I looked at some of the more expensive choices and decided to go with the this one because of the reviews. Some people mentioned the challenge of the install. Now I'm the strongest man at 44yrs but I'm fit if you need a hand it would make it easier. I found it very easy to do all by myself. It only took me 5 minutes to install. I used the bed of the truck(use something between bed and tailgate) on a 90 degree angle to line up the hole on the tailgate. The trickiest part is when you have to rotate the tailgate to a 10 o'clock 4 o'clock angle to get the rod to the right placement. The instruction short and simple. Follow Them! It only takes 2 fingers to close. On the lowering it only slows it a little but feels very light if you lower by hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a huge difference","review":"I received one of these for my birthday. A buddy of mine and I installed it in around 15-20 minutes. Installation isnt a breeze but it wasnt too bad either. Drill two holes, then insert the metal rod in the side of the truck and the tailgate. It was a bit of a challenge and we ended up installing the tailgate end first and then the rod into the side of the truck second.. once in, the thing really works and works well. You can let the tailgate fall and it kind of bounces a bit. No more huge clunk if you let the tailgate slip out of your hand. A small child is now capable of opening and closing the tailgate of my 2002 Ford Lightning. I highly recommend it. One of the best bang for you buck mods ever.Dana"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy this item ,, not worth the chance...","review":"Bought this item for my dodge pick- up ..after I installed it.

The suspense and action are nonstop covering most of the last century and have amazing historical accuracy. The blend of history and action and changing timelines and locales made this a very enjoyable three day read. Only work and sleep interfered with my reading schedule.I was very fortunate to hear Mr. Suttle speak at a recent Dallas Public Library function and had the opportunity to hear a sample of a work in progress and this novel is not a fluke.It is such a refreshing change to hear a new voice that can eclipse the formulic story lines of books that litter the isles of every grocery chain in this country that are written by same type of name brand authors.A good, solid thinking man's thriller.

I am considering buying a business of great interest to me, but I have next to no experience with retail. He has his doubts about the whole \\"dummies\\" series, but thought maybe it would help me. We both found the text to be vague, as I was looking for concrete definitions to some of the unfamiliar business terms which the book did not provide. At the same time, the suggestions for running a small business were ridiculously obvious and downright condescending. The book went back to the store, and I ordered a copy of Specialty Shop Retailing (How To Run Your Own Store) by Carol L Schroeder from my local library. I would HIGHLY recommend this book, and once I finish reading entirely I'll take the time to provide a thorough review. But really, the book has a great layout and it's enjoyable reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"And Never See Her Again","review":"This book was particularly interesting to me because I live in the area where Opal Jennings was kidnapped. I often drive right by the road where her remains were found and I always offer up a prayer for Opal and her family.

I am a homeschooling mom and I purchased this for my oldest (early elementary grade level). It has beautiful drawings and the cover is great. However, I have to say that some of the content of the book would be too difficult for a young elementary student. For example, the page on Romulus and Remus shows them naked (as children) and they are nursing under a she-wolf. I just felt that this would be \\"too much\\" for my daughter to handle. Also, I purchased other historical coloring books from Bellerophon and they are much the same with nudity and odd pictures and caricatures that are INAPPROPRIATE for younger students.

She loves one of the three episodes on this DVD better than the other two, but she is happy to be able to watch any of them. The good thing about the Magic School Bus is that our daughter thinks of it as fun (who wouldn't want to go on an unconventional field trip?) while we know she is learning. It's clean, exciting education. Our favorite tape is Human Body, but this one is in second place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not about sports","review":"This is my first Magic School Bus tape and I am disappointed. It is not about sports but about friction,how the body system works together etc.If you are looking for an educational tape about sports this is not it.Also the teacher and students talk real fast in the tape making it hard for very young learners.I ordered the one on the human body and space adventures I hope they are what they say they are."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice bike","review":"This bike is everything we expected.

However, I have found that there are a few difficulties with this book. The author refers to PVA glue which cannot be found at local hardware stores and doesn't use a manufacturer's product name (come to find out this is actually close to Elmer's white or yellow glue). Also, there appears to be an error on pages 32 and 33 - please look at them as the instructions repeat themselves and there is no Day Two instructions so you can't finish the project- which is one of the projects I had planned on doing. As much as I love her ideas, I'm having a difficult time finding the products she uses and the suppliers list in the back were not helpful and some were no longer attainable on the internet. Someone needs to contact the author and ask her for clarification on the products that she used (especially for the fountain project)."},{"rating":"2","title":"look, it's abstract poetry","review":"If you've stumbled upon this book and know nothing about it, you probably won't like it.

The motor is much less stronger than Dr Scholl's past models, doesn't hold a charge as long plus the head rotates making it difficult to hold a massage in one area. Additionally, if too much pressure is applied to the head area, the massager stops. I have a Dr Scholl's older model that I've had for several years that still runs alot stronger, holds a longer charge and does the job better. I think Dr..

Don't believe me? Listen to the rich, layered harmonies on 'Gone For Awhile' or the gentle, psuedo-bossa nova rhythms of 'Mr. Diengly Sad'. This is incredibly beautiful music that needs to be rediscovered. I'm not saying that this particular collection is going to blow away 'A Hard Day's Night' or 'Pet Sounds' but it's a great starting point for a band. It's a shame that Don Ciccone was drafted before having the chance to carry this band on up the charts. If you like new music like The Cardigans, Saint Etienne and Ray Wonder or if you are a fan of classics like The Association, The Mama's and the Papa's and Peter & Gordon, give this disc a try. Fans of newer pop will catch a glimpse into where it all began and fans of the classics will see what could have been. Pick it up! It's more than worth the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creamy mid-60s pop-rock","review":"This import has the same 20 tracks as the out of print US \\"Anthology\\" and is filled with the sort of tuneful, harmony-filled pop-folk-rock that fans of the Lovin' Spoonful, Chad and Jeremy, and some of the better garage-pop bands will enjoy. Although the Critters had only three top 40 hits, there are several others that, with a little better promotion, could have joined them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"This is a nice introduction to developing a relationship with the Holy Spirit.

It would have made the book more instructional and less testimonial."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice power pop","review":"Hot Rod Circuit is a fairly easy band to overlook, seeing as they play just straight up, poppy rock and roll that seems to be so popular these days, but they're doing this much better than most of the bands on today's scene. These songs are ultra catchy, and the great guitar leads help them pull ahead of the rest of the pack. There are no pretentious stabs at being \\"emo\\" here, just good old driving rock. At times I'm reminded of Superdrag, which is definitely a good thing, and some songs have those bouncy hooks that Saves The Day crafts so well. This has certainly been done before, and there is not a great deal of musical territory covered on this album, but it is a fine work of power pop amongst a crowd of weaker bands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written with the best intentions","review":"This book illustrates perfectly how the best intentions, a good style and decent research efforts can yield questionable results.Half way down the book, I found myself skipping entire chapters (the ones with the items description, like many readers) feeling they were anecdotic at best, but ill served the \\"plot\\".As a matter of fact, by page 250, I was still wondering if there was a plot - and I wasn't sure I wanted to finish it to find out...Well written - yes.Captivating - not in the least, at least to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Won't Be Keeping This in MY Library","review":"On the front of my copy of \\"The Geographer's Library\\" is a blurb from the LA Times: \\"by a novelist whose surname and sensibility fit comfortably on the shelf between Umberto Eco and John Fowles.\\" Fasman belongs on that shelf in alphabetical terms only, I'm afraid.

A murder, mysterious artifacts, an interesting woman...sounds like a good story, right? Unfortunately the story never delivers. Instead the book describes various artifacts (which definitely captured my interest at first) but then failed to actually tie them into the story in any meaningful way. If you really feel the need to read this book, get it from the library or wait for paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea goes to waste","review":"The book starts out promisingly and expecatations rise. As the plot develops however, Fasman gets lost. He explains little or nothing about the objects'powers and the whole point of collecting the items by the deceased is lost on me. Also the so-calld most important item, the Emerald Tablet is barely mentioned except in the end and it is left hanging in the air, doing nothing.It is a pity that a potentially good plot was dropped by the wayside because the author did not know where to take it next.My advice: save your money and buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good ideas that never manage to come together.","review":"Fasman is a talented writer, and many aspects of this book were generally engaging and interesting. However, these elements are too disparate and never manage to mesh into a satisfying whole. The chapters about the objects are never well-integrated, and unfortunately the ending is extremely unsatisfying.Paul Tomm is a young reporter who finds himself into something big when he looks into the death of an Estonian history professor. The story draws him into the world of alchemy and conspiracy, bringing him into physical and spiritual danger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"What started as an interesting plot, with a appealing, guileless protagonist, just never went anywhere for me. The premise seemed less \\"Di Vinci Code\\" and more \\"The Eight,\\" but this book was no where near either. The hook of the artifacts was never realized in the story, and I found myself skimming huge sections trying to find out the point of it all. Unfortunately, there never really was one. Worst of all, not only did the protagonist not grow with the story, but he regressed. I basically couldn't wait for the book to end, even with it's very disappointing ending, so I could get on to something else. I'd say to give this one a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like Da Vinci Code","review":"This book was recommended for Dan Brown lovers and fully disappointed me. Half the book was a sub plot that was neither interesting or completely relevant. Main plot went nowhere. Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"should be zero","review":"only good thing this book did was encourage me to write since thic could be published!!!audio book terrible with plenty of bad words and bad story"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the last chapter","review":"Well written, very well written in spots, but the ending is so weak as to make you feel you've wasted your time. An ending that requires a previously minor charater to enter and provide a narrative to tie up all the loose ends is very disaapointing. The artifacts that are detailed throughout build to a climax that isn't there. These are never explained and in fact you never really understand who it is that is so diligently collecting these items and why. Some of the wonderful characters might be recycled into a story with a punch line."},{"rating":"1","title":"failed to go anywhere....","review":"Like other reviewers, I was excited about reading this book. I thought the plot and characters were great. However, I felt like I was treading water --- the story never went anywhere and the ending was a huge let down. Every other chapter dealt with certain historical artifacts, which were interesting to read about, but what was the point of providing us with so much detail? This detailed information was never used in the actual story.It's too bad, because it had so much potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umberto Eco? John Fowles? Try Franklin W. Dixon!","review":"I had never heard of this book when I bought it at an airport bookshop, and now I know why. The writing is sophomoric and the plot silly. The author seems primarily concerned with displaying his erudition, but this book has none of the wisdom of true erudition. Nothing ever goes anywhere, and none of the characters ever develop or hold the reader's interest. According to the book's cover, a reviewer from the Los Angeles Times apparently said this was a cross between Umberto Eco and John Fowles. Honestly, I can say the writing and plot of the average Hardy Boys book is superior. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Da Vinci Code\\" rip-off","review":"Like Brown's \\"DaVinci Code\\", Fasman's \\"Geographer's Library\\" begins with the mysterious death of an eccentric academic. The protagonist,a young reporter from the local newspaper, is unwittingly strung along on a chain of interconnected clues that ultimately reveal the goings-on of a secret society. This narrative is interrupted in alternate chapters with separate narratives of individual items stolen from the academic's house. Whereas in \\"DaVinci Code\\" the separate threads of the story played into each other and kept the Reader turning the page, Fasman does a poor job with these separate story lines and they merely interfere with the main plot. As many other reviewers have stated, the ending was unsatisfying. For me, it was too Deus ex machina, and reminded me of a \\"Scooby Doo\\" episode (\\"I would have got away with it if it wasn't for you meddlesome kids!\\"). Intriguing title, but I can't really recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting parts that do not come together","review":"The book consists of the story of a listless and rather uninteresting journalist, interspersed with descriptions of alchemical artifacts and fascinating descriptions of how they changed hands. These two threads never really mesh, and the book just ends rather than resolves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to skim over whole chapters to keep my interest!","review":"This book is neither the rattling good read that the Da Vinci code is, nor the cerebral intelligent historical work of Umberto Eco and falls somewhere in between.Not keen on these novels that alternate chapters in the past and present. The plot held great initial promise but the author isn't successful in tying both plot lines together. I ended up skim reading or just omitting chapter after tiresome chapter just to get the thing finished - as the historic plot wasn't going anywhere, I concentrated on the simpler modern day murder mystery plot. Would be interested in other works by this author though."},{"rating":"1","title":"and the point was...?","review":"it's amazing how well written back cover copy can get someone to pick up a book and give it a read. Such was the case with this book, whose deceptive description packaged it as some thrilling adventure story of lost treasures with magical powers. Granted there were some treasures with supposed powers but thrilling this was not, in fact it was quite dull, no action, no traversing the globe for our \\"hero\\", no anything. Even at the bargain price you should just skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea. Decent writer. Bad book.","review":"While the underlying idea for the plot--the intrigues surrounding the re-collection and protection of ancient, alchemical items supposedly possessing miraculous powers--has lots of potential, a cumbersome structure turns what could have been a page-turner into a snorer. The characterizations and the plot did not receive the development they could have, given the abilities the author possesses, and the interchange between the \\"modern\\" story, past events, and the encyclopedia-style introduction of confusing items nearly brought the story to a stand-still. In short, the reader spends a great deal of the time wondering what is going on (and not in the sense of a good mystery), and worse, wondering why anyone would have told this story in this way. I, frankly, couldn't wait for it to end; but it just went on, and on, and on. Read something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising","review":"I was trapped between flights in Dallas and had run out of reading material when I happened upon The Geographer's Library. It was advertised with references to Umberto Eco and Dan Brown, but it read more like a cheap (but well-written, if you're not looking for literary art) charicature of the best examples of the genre. The author tried hard to display a sweeping knowledge of history, but ended up seeming superficial and in places a bit silly (as when a Soviet agent responds to a comment about inequality in the \\"workers' paradise\\" by saying all are equal, but some more equal than others - a ham-handed literary reference if ever there was one). To be fair, I don't usually go in for light fiction, but The DaVinci Code was sufficiently interesting to make me reconsider - this novel has firmly reenfoced my preexisting prejudices. If you like a light read, this is probably okay, but if you're looking for The Name of the Rose you will feel totally ripped off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible - DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!","review":"I read a great deal; 2-3 books a week and have done so for almost 40 plus years. This said it is very rare indeed that my opinion upon closing the book is that the author literaly owes me my time and effort back. Comparing \\"The Geographer's Library\\" to \\"The DaVinci Code\\" is a direct insult to it's author Dan Brown. Even the CD version of the \\"TGL\\" which I also purchased; was the WORST read CD I have ever listened to. It was read soooo slowly at times I had to \\"read\\" portions of the book simply to get through it. Mr. Fasman's obvious constant thesaurus use is blatant. To use \\"big\\" words simply to edify one's ego ruins simply reading the book, and enjoying the story and plot line. Even in the end Mr. Fasman never completely answers ever aspect of the plot line questions he creates. He leaves many roads simply open and incomplete. Shame on this author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"I bought this first-time novelist's book based on its promising storyline about a murder mystery involving ancient relic and was crudely compared to the Da Vinci Code in my local paper. Oh, boy, it is not even close. It is intertwined with isolated episodes about how these relics were robbed in the past, which collectively takes up to half the book's volume and turns out to have close to nothing to do with solving the so-called mystery. There is no suspense, no climax and no twist. The mystery was not fully solved and the gutless protagonist ended up just quitting both his investigation and his love affair, which I was shocked to find out after enduring the uneventful story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not deliver on promises","review":"This book could have been so much more. Instead it grabs you with very cool short stories of mystical and possibly magical artifacts and their provenance only to let you down on the plot. It turns out that all those artifacts matter in the main story only as a collection. Not to use them in a story is actually a crime. You can't get people excited only to leave them abruptly in the cold, but that is exactly what the author does. The mystery is weak and extremely slow. And the resolution is even weaker and does not satisfy after all the build up of the individual artifacts. It is possible that the author was aiming for a sequel, but after such poor execution I, for one, would not be interested in a sequel in the slightest."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different kind of book.","review":"This book suffers the curse of the DaVince Code. Any book with a historical setting that came out after that novel is always compared to Dan Brown's book. It is quite unfair however to lump this book into that group.\\"The Geographer's Library\\" is a facinating mystery in a way that modern author's rarely write in. This is a book that I simply couldn't put down, and when it was over it left me with satisfying questions and wanting more.If you're looking for a good highly intelligent read that still works as a beach read, this book is a great selection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial","review":"This is the sort of book that gives software a bad name. It's superficial, doesn't support its claims with any substance, and resorts to evaluating products like IBM's CB without ever using it.

I'd love to see it, and then I might be able to understand where they're coming from."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 stars.wont let me change ratings","review":"bought this item, hooked it up and \\"NADA\\".

However I did have a water hose close by because this puts out some serious heat. I would not of been happy if it didn't. The hose is really long and I like that I can leave the tank pretty far away and keep moving down the fence line. I can see a lot of uses for this unit example starting a bush fire, melting ice off of steps, etc. Uses a 20lb propane tank like you use for your grill. No regulator needed. It was a good buy, and I am very happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"An okay book","review":"Well.... This book would be good if you happen to be ten years old. For me, even at age ten it didn't quite have the Star Wars feel, though I did find it interesting enough to want to read the rest of the series. Continuity though is important to me, and this book had none of it. However I will say that this series would be good for kids too young to read say, Heir to the Empire, but would still like to know what happened next. I personally thought that the characters did not act like they should, and the writing was somewhat cheesy. Older fans would definitly do better with Young Jedi Knights or some of the adult novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new characters","review":"The book has adventure in it.

They are simple stories and come illustrated in simple pen and ink. They are not relavent to the EU, but they are nice little stories about the star wars characters for younf listeners and readers. When reading to the young you need help holding their attention especially my ADHD son. Pictures help. That is also why I have turned to buying and reading the dark horse comics about star wars.Which is better? I like the comics better, but sometimes, with all those beautifully colored and inked pictures and the varying panels, it is hard for the kids to follow.

It shocked me. I am sorry, this is something that is compleatly unacceptable. Many allowances can be made for the romantic nature underpinning both of the characters relationship, but it doesn't matter how much romantic feelings there are, rape is rape, and to continue and have the two characters fall in love and live happily ever after is a sad and rediculous thing indeed.

Please ignore the front and back covers, which will have you convinced that this is an all-sex-all-the-time romance novel, or even one of those interesting and worthy historical romances, a la Bertrice Small.TRADE WIND, as it happens, is more along the lines of an adventure novel, featuring a smart but somewhat naive heroine (named Hero!), drama on the high seas, political plots, good intentions leading to unexpected consequences, an intriguing good guy/bad guy, and plenty of action. And, oh yeah, there's a little bit of romance in there, too. It builds slowly, gradually -- in fact almost imperceptibly -- and it's never graphic. The fact that it happens (finally!) is satisfying, but one leaves with the impression that just a bit more detail would have been nice!Still, I can't fault the book on much; it was perfectly enthralling the whole way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, inexpensive home accent","review":"I have these in dark wood.

It's mostly just a bunch of b&w stills from Lee's Hammer Dracula series that we've all seen 1000 times before (and not even reproduced very well, for that matter.) There are a total of 27 pages of text, most of which are plot summaries. I cannot too strongly warn experienced Hammer readers that you will feel more than a bit of anger upon purchasing this particular tome. I am going to be very wary of anything under the \\"Glitter Books\\" moniker in the future. Johnson & Del Vecchio's \\"Hammer Films: An Exhaustive Filmography\\" or the Rigby book are far superior on this subject, among just a few alternates to look for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another amazing creation by the god of guitar!","review":"Yngwie J.

I can't imagine who proofread or edited it. I'll admit that this review is based only on the first 5-10 pages but that's because there were so many spelling and grammatical errors in those few pages that I honestly could not read any further.

I loved the characters & dialogue, had been eagerly awaiting its appearance as/on a dvd, but, while it's here, the transfer/compression of it blows. The image quality's so poor & the colors incredibly bleached out. I wan my money back & or a better transfer (preferably). To whom do I bring my complaint to? Do the europeans lack for technology? A poor transfer was also done to another great (foreign) film, a Spanish one, titled \\"Vacas\\", which is a great film, though, not on dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible DVD transfer","review":"The transfer to DVD is terrible, and the video quality is sub-par.

Too bad, because I really enjoyed this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"And no sex in the whole three hours!","review":"What a disappointment! A formless first movie whose actors deserved better. Non-stop talk amongst intellectual types with all sex scenes, if there were any, edited out. Plenty of boy friend and girl friend talk but no romantic situations, and just a bit of nudity (by the actresses of course) in utterly non-sexual situations. The acting, especially by the women, was worth the couple of stars, but the hero and his friends are utterly charmless. The epiphany comes as a surprise without any rhyme or reason. The hero suddenly finishes his dissertation and voila, the girl of his dreams falls into his lap! No substitute for a good Eric Rohmer film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky Marker","review":"When I received the ordered markers, I tested them right away and they appeared to work fine.

For me, this isn't at all a \\"dark\\" novel in that cliched sense of the word that seems to be used whenever fiction attempts to peer deeper and truer into our lives. I recommend Elizabeth Merrick's Girly for its epic stretch and startling originality. It's a story told by seven separate narrative voices and is uncompromising. A book about sisters in an American Christian fundamentalist family, Girly enchants the reader while bringing them raw and scorching moments of truth and vision. I highly recommend this journey into sexuality, family, and the margins of our American life."},{"rating":"1","title":"the bottle leaks.","review":"Don't buy this bottle.

It is the only O'reilly book I have ever gotten that was not worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yep, everyone was right. Biggest BANG for the buck!","review":"I bought this book, because of everyones' comments, and they were right. If you're an experienced administrator, this may be the only book that you need. I personally used it with other study guides, because this book does not contain everything. However, it is a good concise, no nonsense review for the exam. The Sybex guides are just a mammoth.

By the way, I passed the 4 core exams in about 2 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"O'Reilly does it again!","review":"Think you're ready to take the NT exams? GET THIS BOOK. You will not find a better last minute review anywhere (think MCSE Cliff Notes).

Even if a trip is not on the horizon, it is definitely worth the money to buy this tape and see India."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but....","review":"Interesting, but overly emphasizes more fringe/exotic things and presents it as the soul of India. Also, kind of annoying that it's presented so much from an outsider's point of view - but I can see how that is useful to outsiders, also! He's such a tourist though - a tourist off the beaten path, but still such a tourist.

The quality, both technical and content-wise, is excellent. There are many really gorgeous frames, sweeping vistas and intimate portraits of individuals. But more than pretty pictures, this film is an excellent overview and introduction to India. It is very even-handed, not overly broad and light like many films of the travel-related genre.

I greatly enjoyed the first 5 volumes, but the 6th was a terrible disappointment. The plot was weak, the characters a joke and the storytelling was awful.

The sad fact of the matter is, that none of the tracks are particularly outstanding and understandably, they did not result in David Jones or his colleagues being catapulted into the limelight. However, if, like me, you are a fan of Bowie, then it could be no more than a bit of harmless fun to add this package to your collection.Incidentally, all the tracks crop up on various compilations which emerge from time to time, so unless you are a completist, it may be best to search around for a more complete compilation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mini-Masterpiece Worthy of Everyone's Attention","review":"I fell into this film quite by accident. How fortunate for me. Oh that I had a fraction of the insight, talent and brilliance Landreth has shown here. Buy it, watch it, think about it and then watch it again. You will be amazed at the art and animation, and you'll be equally moved by the novel ways in which Landreth depicts the scars of the human journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheer Brilliance","review":"This film immediately grabs your attention right from the begining, and not simply because it is animated. It really comes from the fact that its use of colour and imagery is utter perfection. The film talks about the life and works of the amazing Canadian animator Ryan Larkin and his works from the 70's, and the woman he loved.The aspects that make this stand apart from other animated shorts is the way Chris Landreth chose to evoke thought and emotion. The people you see are only partly complete, perhaps in reference that we can only ever know people so much and that the rest of them is a mystery. When their emotions become stronger their bodies will spike colours or contort into strange shapes.This film will mesmerize you and awaken your imagination with form, colour, and beauty. If you love film and animation, this is something you must not miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me!!","review":"This movie was in no way entertaining to me. It was decent visually; However, The story was short and pathetic. It tried to be deep and engrossing but failed miserably. It was rushed along and didn't improve as the movie progressed.

Too much dialogue and no action.If you skip the middle of the show you aren't missing anything. I've seen better plots in Star Trek Deep Space Nine. Watch some tried and true American Sci- Fi(live action shows) not this Japanimation drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie ...","review":"It's just sex,violence. No real plot.Even the japanese version would prove equally uninspired. I saw a live action movie following a similar plot called species. Species 2 is better than this mindless drivel.

Too predictable and dull. The story follows the \\"Species\\" cliche."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never watch this","review":"I gave this anime a rating of 1 star because I could've give it any lower. Those people who gave it a good rating are people who have never seen any real anime before and were impressed by the gratuitous sex and violence. It nothing special. The animation is sub-par, the plot is all but non-existant and the storyline will leave you shaking your head for days trying to forget it. If you have never watched anime before I recommend starting with Ninja Scroll or the Sailor Moon movies. If you watch anime frequently then all you need to know is that you will hate yourself for wasting a hour or so of your life watching this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"Im sorry but this movie was a disapointment, It really did leave you unfulfilled.

My issue with regular goggles seemed to be that sooner or later some water would enter the eyes area. Also the small window in which you are allowed to see. With the Mask I am much more happier. First, it covers a much bigger area and the seal aspect is more complete. No more aggravation in the middle of a lap when some unwanted water disturbs the flow of activity. Very impressed with the results and couldn't be happier. They adjust very well and actually pretty tight so no water is welcome. Like night and day from using conventional goggles to using this kind of mask.

I could definitely say that this is my favorite book. The next book I am going to read is the first Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul. I can't wait to get started! I hope my review encouraged you to read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is One Of Their Best Books Ever!","review":"This tells about many experences of teenagers.

EVEN IF YOU\\"RE not A TEENAGER, it's worth it!!!","review":"It's very inspiring, with great stories that describe the reality of a typical teenager's life. I doubt anyone will regret reading / buying this great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Second Turn!","review":"I loved the first Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul book, and this was just as good. The stories captured my attention, and ranged from funny to sad. I think a lot of the stories would do well as monologues in addition to reading them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken File","review":"I have downloaded this thing a dozen times. There is nothing here but a few lines of the table of contents and that is in Latin. There is something wrong with the file."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy of the annals of Priam!","review":"As usual, Chaucer has come through as the greatest poet of Middle English. This is by far the best expansion on Homer's epic poetry to appear since Publius Vergilius Maro's neid, and I'm sure Augustus would have enjoyed it just as much! Shakespeare's adaptation, Troilus and Cressida, is an excellent play but does not give this poem justice. I would definitely recommend it to any serious fan of English literature!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculously misleading!","review":"I purchased this expecting the original text, as the page stated, but received the translated version. Do not buy this if you want the original!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT the Shoaf Edition of Troilus and Criseyde, it is a collection of essays!","review":"Please be careful! Everything on this page gives you the impression that this is a hardcover version of Shoaf's edition of Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde. IT IS NOT - IT DOES NOT EVEN CONTAIN THE POEM. This is a collection of essays about the poem that is really only suited to Chaucer scholars. Don't make the same mistake I made. It should be subtitled - ESSAYS - or have some other clear description of the nature of the book. I can not evaluate the essays, because I haven't yet read the poem because of this mis-identification of these Essays with the Superior Shoaf edition of Troilus and Criseyde by Chaucer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully illustrated; Charming rhyming text","review":"My 2 year old daughter loved this book when we read it at a library program a couple of months ago, so we checked it out. She still loves it, so I'm going to buy it for her. The illustrations are realistic and capture the spirit of the text perfectly. I was quite surprised to see the recommended age listed as 4-8, though. This book should be in the Baby-Preschool range (maybe 18 months-4 years). It's too simple and short for any 6-8 year olds. This book is among our favorites and is highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lighting","review":"The size listed says this light is 18, yes I did say it says eighteen inches. That is the size I need. Now when it gets here it is only 12 inches. Misrepresented is the only word that comes to mind. I am contacting Amazon to find out about this. Since this is obviously not the same as the one I am replacing (too small) I am not unpacking this light till I get a response from Amazon. It is a nice looking light."},{"rating":"1","title":"bulb is awful","review":"This light comes with a bulb that is a terrible color. If you want to get a better bulb, they cost more than the fixture itself. The light works and it does link together nicely, but the yellow brown color of the light means it is turned off nearly all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing CD from two of my favorites","review":"I had never seen this cd before finding it while browsing on Amazon. After listening to it, I now know why. What a disapointment. Weak songs that sound like leftovers from previous recording sessions. Don't waste the time with this one"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back Trails Guide","review":"This is a worthwhile book if you are looking for quad, jeep or hiking trails. It isn't as complete as I would have liked but it is worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This is a great book to get off-road with. I haven't tried too many, but what I've seen is very accurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Arizona Trailbook Available!","review":"I have traveled countless miles of Southwestern trails, and I think these are the best trailbooks available for Arizona and Moab. Wells has selected the most scenic and interesting trails, with concise and simple directions. Some people may find the non-topo maps confusing at first, but combined with the written directions, GPS coordinates, and basic common sense anyone should find their way through without incident.The book is thorough, with relative charts for difficulty and overall enjoyability of a trail, as well as driving tips and preparation guidelines.As with any printed book, some of the info gets outdated rather quickly, but he does try to post updates on his website. No matter how good a trailbook is, always use an additional navigation source: topo maps, atlas, land management maps (BLM or USFS) and always check with local 4x4 shops, clubs or land management agencies for current conditions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding performance!","review":"Reiner's conducting and arrangement of this classic is, for me, the definitive version. The performance is stunning. The quality of the recording is such that its hard to believe that this performance is almost 50 years old. A must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound, One Of The Best Performances Of Scheherazade","review":"Legend has it that conductor Fritz Reiner had a very foul temperament. I'm sure there must be some truth to this, because what we have here is one of the best performances of \\"Scheherazade\\" I've ever heard. Like all great conductors, Reiner was had magnificent control over his orchestra. The Chicago Symphony Orchestra plays with a lot of passion and anyone with ears can hear this in this performance.This is a beautiful performance and should be essential listening to anyone interested in classical music. There is also a great version of Stravinsky's \\"Song of the Nightingale\\" that is noteworthy.I would wager that Reiner's \\"Scheherazade\\" is one of the finest I've heard so far. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Losers (Vol.1): Ante Up","review":"A review of this book in Wizard magazine, inspired me to buy, it.I'm very glad I did.I plan to buy the remaining 4 volumes"},{"rating":"2","title":"another amazing Vertigo title","review":"Every volume to date has been like a big screen action movie. The perfect comic gift for fans of action novels like the Jack Ryan series, the classic 007 novels or heck, even he perfect gift for Father's Day.If we had more comics like this instead of go-nowhere comics like Daredevil or Ultimate Spider-man, there might still be a market for western comics in the American mainstream."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Can Survive the Art...","review":"I've owned this book for several months now, but just recently read it. When I first purchased it I made it through about 4 pages and laid it down because the art is so absolutely horrid.I'm glad I eventually went back to it though, because as everyone else has been shouting...it reall does play out better than any heist film Hollywood could pump out.Interesting characters, cool plot and over-the-top action makes this a stand-out title.Just get ready to self-interpret a lot of the art though because of the absolutely nonexistent skill of visual storytelling.If the later volumes (which I've yet to read) snagged a better artist...this could easily be the best title on the market.3.5 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"You need the compass to FIND the thermometer!","review":"Brunton Compasses are GREAT. This one is no exception. Larger than the normal Zip o gage,but not too large. The thermometer is another story. I have bought 4 over the last year. The thermometers have fallen out of three of the four. Apparently Brunton doesn't think there is a problem according to the gentleman I corresponded with, since there is no plans for a re model. They were very friendly and sent me four new thermometers to replace the lost ones so their customer service is good. You'll need it.LOL"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap garbage","review":"This overpriced compass somehow lost its liquid a few months after I had bought it. It is cheap looking, as if from a dollar store, and smells toxic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Virtual Private Networks, 2nd Edition (O'Reilly Nutshell)","review":"I'm new to the world of VPN. This book laid some ground work for me to start with. The other reviews consider this book as usless, but now after having read this book, I now have a basis to gauge other work by. After all, as another review stated, there is not much new material out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been a lot better - 2nd Edition soon?","review":"Rather lightweight and banal. This book could have been a lot better; had the impression that it was rather rushed, perhaps in an attempt to catch the VPN/ NT wave. There are some technical inaccuracies which is just not on in an introductory book. The book just about saves itself with its \\"manual type\\" content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap for newbies","review":"I am badly suprised. I have 2-3 months VPN experience and know MUUUCH more than author of this \\"research\\". Waste of money, I will think before purchasing O'Reilly books in future"},{"rating":"1","title":"O'Reilly has succumbed to making $$$ versus making quality","review":"I agree with all the statements made by the reader from Atlanta. Several of the things mentioned in the book indicate that it was written at least 9 to 12 months ago. Chapter 7 is so full of errors on IP address assignments that the text is very confusing when trying to follow along with the figures. Through out the book the text is not aligned with the figures and in one case the figure is outright in error. When looking at the back of the book to see what background the authors have, they should stick to driving tanks and management. They have definitively proven they can not constuct a nework and shouldn't. O'Reilly had a good reputation with its Unix books. A damn shame they have destroyed it with this window oriented book. Perhaps O'Reilly should give up on Windows books since they did not even do a perfuntionary Quality Audit of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"I can't believe O'Reilly published this book. This book was published in March '98 and appears to be written at least 12-18 months ago. If you are looking to build a VPN using Alta Vista's or Cisco's product (older versions, of course) this book may be a good introduction for you. Otherwise, I would not recommend this book for anyone interested in learning about VPNs. You can find white papers that are better and more up-to-date on the Internet (and they're free). I wish I could get my money back for this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"I bought this book on an impuse. I assumed that since it was an oreilly book it would have some decent technical content and perspective. But was I wrong, the book starts with a minimal overview of VPNs one could pick up on the web in 5 minutes, a bunch of screen captures of setting up windows NT's VPN, a short chapter on using ssh, and a chapter on altavista's tunelling product.. I would have expected at least balanced and comparable results between each approach but, for example, the ssh chapter goes into the end performance of that approach but this evaluation isn't present for windows nt. In short there is no technical detail in this book and the information that is there would be just as easily (and much less expensively) found on the web.Boo hiss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well.. Almost Useless","review":"This book was a big disappointment. It does gloss over alot of the key VPN ideas, but there is not much substance. I've learned more from reading various tidbits off the internet.Also, before you even consider using PPTP you should read the CounterPane cryptanalysis paper on PPTP.http://www.counterpane.com/pptpv2-paper.html PPTP on windows NT is just not secure!For a total newbie, this book might give them an idea of what to look for on the internet, but besides that I don't see too much value in this book.I wouldn't buy it again, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone that I liked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Innacurate and old","review":"I didn't check out the publication date of this book when I bought it (1998) so my dissapointment is partly my fault. It is, unsuprisingly, very outdated (anyone actually remember the altavista tunnel?). However, much of the info that remains, even general VPN fundamentals, are flawed and innacurate. This book will hinder you if you are trying to understand proper VPN network topologies."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD book....O'Reilly! 2nd Edition!","review":"I so agree with \\"This book is a blot on O'Reilly's reputation. The editor(s) must have been asleep\\". I have many O'Reilly books, and they all are good...but not this one. I trusted the O'Reilly's editors. So I ordered this book before it was published. I wish I had the chance to read the reviews...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look for a better book","review":"What was O'Reilly thinking!! This is the first time I wasted money on an O'Reilly book (and I have plenty). This book was a rush job. There are many inaccuracies, a lot seem to be the editors mistakes. The authors seem to have the practical experience, but it is not communicated in a clear manner. The chapters on PPTP, AltaVista and Cisco PIX were organized in a good way and were helpful. Overall, the diagrams are poor. Better graphics could have salvaged this book. I give it two stars because there are not that many books on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price.","review":"Until now, all O'Reilly books I've encountered have been worth their weight in gold. Not this one! The very slim book focuses on simple tunneling systems (mostly from host to host) and cannot give sound advice or knowledge to any serious attempts at VPNs. Perhaps individual users with NTs might find some interest in the book, but for a network administrator its a total waste of money. Spend a few minutes browsing it and you've seen the best of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste!","review":"This book is not worth the paper it is written on. I expected more from an O'Reilly book. If you want to learn about VPN, go for a better selection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very poorly written book.","review":"It is a waste of money and time to buy and to read this book. I mean the second edition. There is neither clear architecture concept nor technical detail. Many concept can be illustrated in a very simple drawings and the author will not do it. After I read other books I feel that the authors don't know what they are talking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor.","review":"I have to agree with the majority of comments. This book is a disgrace to O'reilly. It is technically incorrect in many areas, e.g. \\"A SYN flood is a 'killer ping'\\" ...uhm, no, it's not. There's _no_ way this, and many other errors should have got past the editors."},{"rating":"2","title":"God Went to Beauty School- A review by Kelsey","review":"God Went to Beauty School is a very short and easy read. Although it is short it teaches us lessons about God and how he is almost exactly like us except the part of him being all powerful. God loves and he dislikes. He can shop and he can watch television. He loves dogs and all living animals.I really liked this book because i didnt think any one thought of God like that. I didnt really think God could be like that. I thought God would be a powerful man beyond human understanding. This book teaches you that all though someone may be powerful they are still like us. God did model us from him, to be in his image so why shouldnt we have similar personalities. This book showed me a new image of god i hadnt seen before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was looking for a new genre for my 5th grade daughter, and I picked this book, normally a huge fan of Rylant. I found the cover statement &quot;soft, reflective and often humorous&quot; to be totally untrue. The book was disturbing in an offensive way. I didn't find any humor at all. The God she tries to know is not the God I know. It seemed very disrespectful. I've read better books that touch on the attributes of God in a loving, funny, soft way while opening the reader's eyes to the possibility of being inside God's mind. Rylant missed the mark in a big way this time. I will continue to read her work, and I hope that it will reflect growth, especially in this area."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Is Just Plan Wrong!","review":"I came across this book at a local library where it was in the age group for 3rd and 4th grade reading. I don't want to read this kind of garbage nor would I want a child to read it. I found it offense and do not recommend it for anyone. The writer needs to get a life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a great book","review":"I loved the whole idea of God being \\"normal\\", that he had a cold, that he would like someone else to have dinner with (because communion is just not the same as having dinner) I read this twice, smiled, thought, grinned, giggled. what a neat way of humanizing the Man Upstairs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting!","review":"Through a series of whimsical and beautifully crafted poems about God, Cynthia Rylant creates an endearing, thought provoking and enjoyable book.These aren't your usual poems about God (as we think we know Him). God gets a dog, God gets cable, God goes to beauty school, God takes a boat ride, eats spaghetti and other random, but fascinating chapters. Just like the Joan Osborne song, this book asks \\"what if God was one of us?\\". How would he live and discover new things? It sounds silly, but it's anything but. It's short and sweet and different and everybody should read it.My only criticism is that it was far too short, especially to buy in hardcover. But it's still a worthwhile read, even if you're not Christian."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Author Deserves a Humanitarian Award","review":"This book and others by author Bart Hopkin, will greatly benefit people, young and old. These projects will especially stimulate young minds by seducing them away from negative activities, promoting creativity and a sense of accomplishment and artistry. Creating our own music does wonders for our souls, uplifts us, and helps purge our troubles. The author is exceptional for allowing us to share in this possibility. This book comes with a CD so that you can hear the author's designs and compare them with your own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genuwine","review":"This was an excellent tape.

The problem is that the tape keeps getting caught in the VCR player and when I can finally distract the tape from the VCR without ripping it, I have to bang the sides of the tape to make it go back in. I do not have this problem with my other VHS tapes, so I know it is the quality of this tape...which was the last one the seller had.

I've been using this type for over a year and I have to say that I am very happy with the performance. The only problem that I have is that it only seems to last 3-6 months for me as well. I don't think I over used them. And I'm very happy that the price is so low here on amazon! I really do think its worth it even if I do have to buy two a year, it'll only be 20 dollars a year for the best toy ever!
