It's not \\"hard\\", it's just a pain. We have two Honeywell Purifiers, this one, and a smaller one for our boys' bedroom. Neither seems to do anything to improve the air quality. Both boys suffer from allergies, and there is no difference with their unit. My husband and I haven't noticed a difference at all with this unit in our large bedroom.We turn it on \\"high\\" at night, and it's basically our sound machine. I had such high hopes after all of the great reviews, but it didn't change much for us at all. Wish it had. We also have Sharper Image Ionic Air Cleaning machine, and I've had that for over 10 years, and it STILL works better than this. We use that for our downstairs area, and we're looking for more of that type now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great but only on medium and high power","review":"This purifier definitely does what it's supposed to do. The filter is designed for big rooms, and it's more than needed for my studio apartment, which is about 450sq ft. However, I find that leaving it on low power doesn't have much of an effect. There's still dust that settles on surfaces around the filter. I usually leave it on medium or high during the day and switch to low at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordered twice because of defect.","review":"I ordered this Honeywell air filter twice, the second time hoping it was a one time defect.

Brand new the \\"High\\" worked once on both of these units.Will not buy again.

It's good only if you are not in the room.I got 2 years ago \\"Rabbit Air BioGS\\" - that is very quiet, I could sleep when is turned ON - you can not hear at all, but Rabbit is very expensive over $300 and I paid $55 for a new filter that you have to replace every 18 month. If you intend to stay in the room when is ON - forget about Honeywell. The manufacture and/or amazon should say what is the noise level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Air Purifier","review":"This air purifier gets rid of a lot of dust. It is a little noisy on high, but I actually enjoy falling asleep to the sound. It doesn't do anything as far as clean odors from the air.

Since, we've noticed many other complaints of this same nature across the web and here on Amazon. If the price is worth it to you to have a well-functioning filter for a few months, go ahead.

I adjusted it to med, low and off and this time it turned off right away. I called the manufacturer and they said to return it to Amazon. I called Amazon and received a replacement in 2 days. I received the replacement & powered it up and high, med, low & off worked properly. I left it on high for a hour or so & went to turn it off & this time it wouldn't turn off. This time I'm returning for a refund. I read a similar review & they had pretty much the same experience w/ their 2nd one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even Quiet let alone Silent","review":"I have no idea whether this product works because the first night we turned it on, on the lowest setting, we lasted about 10 minutes before agreeing it was too loud.

Now it howls all the time and it is too loud to run it. For an expensive air cleaner it is cheaply constructed.

Stay away from this air cleaner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty design","review":"Whomever put my air purifier together must have been drunk. The buttons on the front panel are so depressed, you can't press them with your fingers. I tried using a pencil, and one the the buttons disappeared under the shell! The pieces under the panel don't fit well together and have a huge gap in between them. Upon opening the top, I see that the screws are not aligned with the screw holes. The button panel have fallen into the abyss, and some of the plastic pieces of the shell don't fit well and are at odd angles with each other. I am very disappointed in this product. I believed in the honeywell name, and I feel like I've been given a piece out of their mistake pile. I will stay away from their products from now on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quiet? Hardly.","review":"I guess you all have a different standard of what \\"quiet\\" means.This thing is really loud. Yes the fans seem to be good quality so you don't hear any mechanical noise at all. The problem is just that even the lowest setting is blowing an awful lot of air, so you hear a \\"whooshing\\" sound. It's okay during the day, but for sleeping it should really have a lower setting.Also it is very large, about the size of a room air conditioner or mini-fridge.My guess is the sound volume of this thing is in the range of 30-40 dB , and it should be 20-30 dB. For comparison, a good quiet PC fan is in the 10-20 range."},{"rating":"1","title":"less than expected","review":"I'm not sure why this product received so many 5 star reviews. I was sold on this product after reading customer reviews but my experience has been less than expected. I needed an air purifier to reduce tobacco odor in my bedroom but it's not doing its job. I only smoke a couple of cigarettes a day. My friend has one that almost eliminates tabacco odor but it's an ionized air purifier which many reviewers on this web site discouraged me from buying. This product seems to reduce air particles but again you won't be satisfied if you expect to get rid of more than 50-60% of odor/dirt. There was a debate amongst many reviewers about its noise level. My vote is that it should not be called \\"Silent Comfort\\". It's definitely misleading. It's not too bad if you can have a little fresher air for $130 but you can probably get much more had you invested a little more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design","review":"I ordered this in March of this year for my bedroom (a 12x16 room) after my old purifier of 9yrs finally bit the dust.This purifier pulls air in from the bottom and returns it just above the intake vents... it's spinning it's wheels in mud per se.Unless you're sitting beside it or actually sit the purifier on a table to raise it (like we did), it's 'purification' radius is about 2ft.It IS quiet but I miss the soft 'hum' of the old one -a GREAT 'white noise'. I thought cleaning the filter would help but no,it's the design. By the way, you'll need to reverse the directions for cleaning the filter (clean the inside, not the outside).Also, my old one had an ionizer which I prefer... good for seasonal affective disorder.Overall, I wish I would've bought the newer version of my old purifier for half the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"awesome!","review":"have allergies and think- there is a lotta dust in my area;yes sir!i have this run all day long in my house and it works-it catches a lotta dust and we replace the prefilters every 2 months- there is a lotta dust this catches-HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR PEOPLE WITH ALLERGIES!GREAT PRODUCT!

High setting is too disruptive (noise-wise) to be a practical option. On medium, this purifier is ok but not really very effective at keeping dust/allergens out of the air. Another side effect, more so in the winter, is that the air flow makes the room cold, yet the particles tend to move around instead of through the purifier. Another downside is the size of this thing. Its an eyesore considering you are supposed to place it at least 3 ft from any wall/furniture.I do not recommend this purifier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honeywell 18155","review":"The Honeywell 18155 SilentComfort is truly Silent....Arrived as expected and in good condition.

You install the grey prefilter in the lower section of the unit.Have been running the unit nightly to rid air of smoke blowing from neighbors.The unit works on room up to 15'x15' and does the job.It draws the air in, filters the air clean and sends it out the top.Bought it because the description indicates the permanent filter can be vacuumed. So then you don't have to worry about it for a while. On less expensive ones where you may have to change to HEPA filter regularly, the filters are not cheap.The unit has no bright blue lights that others have mentioned on other models."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"love it! works great and is very quite I can't sleep with any noise like A/C to noisy but this is wonderful.

The first 2 months were great, but then a \\"moldy\\" smell started coming out of the unit. I changed out pre-filters, and vacuum cleaned the HEPA, but those results were fruitless.As a test, I removed the lid and ran the unit so the air exhausted up and away from the HEPA and it smelled great. Closed the lid, and as soon as the air passes the filter it starts smelling. I repeated this without the PRE-filter to make sure and got the same results.Called up Honeywell KAZ, and they offered to replace the unit and not the HEPA filter. I'll be out shipping and no filter device for 2-3 weeks. Bad deal on the sale price I got for the unit. My next recourse would be to find a third party manufacturer of HEPA filters compatible for my unit and try and have luck with that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job -- very quietly","review":"In less that a day, this had the air in my (large) bedroom clean and clear. I followed the instructions, to initially run it on high for the first \\"clean out\\". I used to have the type of Honeywell that required costly filter replacements So this for me is a replacement of a new technology with an older one. It does the job, my stuffy nose is gone, and it is very quiet - I run it at low all night long. I did a lot of research before I bought this brand and this size and read lots of online reviews. I think it is important to select one that is sized to the room it will be used in, and Honeywell has been making these for a very long time, so I think they have it right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super clean air","review":"No, it's not silent, but it's not terribly loud either.

Love it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Air Cleaner","review":"Nice and Quiet.The only negatives are the instructions which do not seem to match the machine.the diagrams (on Amazon too) show a large prefilter wrapped around the main filter.In fact that is not how it is set up. The small prefilter goes on the bottom of the machine. The main filter is in the top and they are accessed via different \\"hatches\\".The directions also show cleaning the outside of the HEPA filter. the reality is that the way the machine works you would need to clean the INSIDE surface of the HEPA.Otherwise works fine. My Asthma is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honeywell 18155N SilentComfort airfilter, thumbs-up.","review":"very quiet for sure. it's helping a lot with my allergies. i run it 24/7 on low and that does the trick. the only disadvantage is the suggested placement, 3' from any wall. however i've got it maybe 1-2 feet from any wall and it's able to suck air from all directions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Effective","review":"Great product. You can really feel (and breathe) the difference in the air when you turn this on in a closed room, although I use it with the door open, too. For allergies and asthma, with its HEPA filter system (doctors I've spoken to recommend HEPA as the best filtration system for these problems), it has made a big difference for me. I had an older model that made a louder, harsher noise. Even on high, the sound from this model is still balanced enough so that it does, as others have commented, create a pleasant white noise effect. Note that it is fairly large and heavy, so moving it around from room to room is not impossible but a bit of a hassle. I haven't yet had to clean/replace the filters, since it's still new. But I like that there is a filter indicator on the unit so I don't have to remember when to do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honeywell 18155 Air Purifier","review":"Recently purchased two of these units, one for my family room, one for the living room and dinning area. One of the units was faulty, fan did not work. Amazon was great with returning it and sending a new unit out the next day with no additonal charges. Unit is very quiet on low and medium speed, high is a little noisy but very effective. Air in house is much cleaner and it does eliminate odors since we have smokers in the house which was one of the reasons the units were purchased. Unit is a little larger than I expected but rooms they are in are large and can be placed in space out of the way. Really noticed a difference in the air quality. Must say I am very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honeywell Air Purifier","review":"I found it very easy to use and operate! We bought it because of my wife's allergies which were worse this year due to more than average rain fall.

We sleep with on every night and my wife's congestion went away after about four days and hasn't come back since we've had this purifier. Is it a coincidence?

There is no barrier between the part of the machine which pulls in air and the part which pushes it out again. I believe it picks up dust, and then just blows it out again without ever going through the filter. If you put a ribbon above it there is no air movement at all. So I don't believe that it is changing the air in the room. Also, it blew carbon, from the filter into the air, which got in my eye. I do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I purchased this item for my 82-year-old mother who is bothered by neighbors' cigarette smoke in her apartment building.

After checking on the 5 year limited warranty, I discovered it was pretty worthless, and I'd just have to buy a new one. The only bad thing I have to say about it is that I don't think it should require replacement within two years. From what I'm reading in other reviews, that is a very typical lifespan for this product. When I spend $150, I think an air purifier should work for a minimum of four or five years. I'm not a fan of planned obsolescence or of worthless \\"warranties\\".

We have it sitting very close to our TV but it runs very quietly - even on high - and doesn't interfere with the volume on the TV.The only reason I did not give it five stars is because it has a pre-filter I was unaware of which has to be replaced several times a year. At $15 each that could add up quickly.

It has been a life saver. Running 24/7 with the air conditioner in the house has kept the living room area free of all smoke smell. Even my 84 year old mother did not have to leave.

Honeywell 1, us 0."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesnt get rid of smoke well","review":"The primary reason I purchased this model was to handle smoke. I have a small office room in my house where I spend a lot of time. For the winter, I wanted something that would remove most of the smoke. Which I previously had a honeywell, smaller model, which worked great, for about 3 months, I figured I would get a bigger and better model... This thing doesn't remove smoke half as well as the small one I had. I will say it may remove smoke over a long period of time, but I smoke about once an hour.I have a feeling the reason may be the airflow design, it takes in air from the bottom vents and pushes it out through the top. It would seem to me this thing is constantly cleaning the same air. My smaller model would pull in air from the front and force the air upward, out the back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not deliver","review":"After much research, I puchased this filter for my bedroom to help control dust allergens. After several months of running the unit nearly non-stop, there has been absolutely no reduction in dust.

Have been using it for two weeks, and it seems to kind of work. I'll give it a few more weeks to make a final decision. Might have been prudent to not get one at all or try for a better (more expensive) one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud on High","review":"It seems to work well, but is too loud when set on high.

With this, now even my roommate thinks the air smells cleaner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great & quiet HEPA Air Purifier","review":"I love this air purifier. It's fairly quiet (I don't have to turn the TV up to drown out its noise). I bought it because I live in an old apt. and neighbors smoked right outside my window. Of course the day after I ordered this product, the neighbors moved. But I am still finding benefit from it as I have severe allergies to dust and mold. I can tell the air is cleaner but how I'm breathing better (I also have asthma). I think this a great value for its price and would highly recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works!","review":"This is a great air purifier, it works great, it is quiet and it doesn't emit a cool breeze like it says. It really helps me a lot and I am a long time sinus and allergy sufferer. you can really feel the difference in the air when you go outside or to another location. I don't think it is large and bulky it's made to work in up to 225 square feet! I use it in a tiny studio apartment and I still have space.

However, the individual CD pockets have a plastic flap above them that's supposed to flip over and cover the CD which aren't quite sized right -- it is very hard to flip the flap over, and the plastic rumples.Also, the internal structure is poorly designed and the pins that hold it all together are made of plastic, not metal. The first night I got this I began, gently, putting in CDs, and when I had about 80 CDs in the binder, one of the plastic pegs holding the binder pages together cracked. I don't think it could reliably hold 128 CDs, and would not recommend this product to anyone.

I had high hopes for this book but I was gravely dissappointed. I find the Author's interpretation and presentation of scripture to be judgemental. I am sorry to say that I came away carrying more emotional baggage after reading this book than I had before I read it.She basically says that it is the victim's fault if he or she doesn't have a good relationship with God. She also offers advice in a quick fix manner.The book is summed up with nine reminders of faith that are presented throughout the book.In one of the nine the author actually suggests that you re-read the book if you do not feel healed after reading it the first time. I find this extremely arrogant on her part. In this conclusion the author places blame on the survivor if he or she neglects to be healed by her book.I would caution all survivors seeking guidance and support to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCITING STORY, FREE WILLY WITH A DOLPHIN","review":"The author, former trainer for dolphins starring on the much beloved Flipper tv series, details his struggle with big industry while he tries to return dolphins to the wild. There is a big trial in which the author loses a sizable civil fine for his liberation activities. He still has a let's get on with life joie de vivre about him. O'Barry's life is the stuff of drama and he's a modern day David in the eternal struggle with Goliath, in this case the captivity industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book about the tension between the captive dolphin industry and releasing dolphins to the wild","review":"This book provides a first-person perspective on what started as a noble attempt to obtain captive dolphins and rehabilitate them for release into the wild. Ric O'Barry has developed a credible methodology for teaching dolphins to be dolphins again. He participated in the Sugarloaf Dolphin Sanctuary, and the book gives some idea of how at least some humans kind of lost sight of the main purpose of SDS, leading to something of a disaster. Those who enjoy this book will likely also enjoy a fictional book about dolphins, Ocean Echoes: A Dolphin Tale, by Shaney Frey (Seastory Press, ISBN-13: 978-0982115114). Shaney Frey is mentioned briefly in O'Barry's book (in fact, she was the only witness for O'Barry's defense in a trial described in the book), and O'Barry wrote the forward for Shaney Frey's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I was capitivated by the contents.

I thought it was unbelievable what Yun went through, and it was an interesting book. I learned much about the history of Christianity, which I new nothing about before. However, I felt the book was very repetitive, as I cannot count how many times Yun went to prison, was electrocuted with a baton, beaten senselessly, etc. I definitely believe in miracles, but everytime I turned the page there was another one.......so many that it almost seemed unbelievable and I wondered if this story was actually true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"I was happy to see a believer's testimony in print so I read the book as soon as it hit the shelves.I was disturb as I read \\"brother Yun's\\" account of how he commanded a man to become a Christian. It reminded me of the account of the conquistadors and the Aztecs. That account alone made me reconsider the testimony of Yun. At best Yun's testimony feels ego driven. It does not have the same language or feel as accounts from Corrie ten Boom, nor those in the Fox book of Martyrs, voice of the martyrs nor any or other believer's account of faith amidst persecution or difficult circumstances.Sharing the gospel is telling the good news of Christ not demanding or commanding anyone to believe or else. What was Yun's implied threat to the man? Perfect love cast out fear for fear has to do with punishment. Since when do we have the authority or right to command anyone to repent of their sins and become a Christian ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"gobsmackingly bad bad bad","review":"the rough outline of a story without character development based on the biblical book of acts--fail"},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy cow...","review":"If the account in this book is true, then there can be little doubt that Christianity is also true.I'm an agnostic who's wrestled with the question of Christianity for at least 10 years, and this book has perhaps finally given me the best evidence I've ever seen that Christianity is true. All other arguments and testimonies I've considered have been unpersuasive because they all seemed amenable to naturalistic explanations. Most accounts in this book do not. This book gives me hope that perhaps my search for truth has finally concluded."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE HEAVENLY MAN","review":"An excellent book that once you start reading will be hard to set down! Some may find the testimonies of brother Yun unbelievable, yet Jesus stated that if we had faith in Him and love and obey Him, that we would do \\"greater things then himself\\". Brother Yun's humility is evident throughout the book. I particularly enjoyed one of the last chapters on BACK TO JERUSALEM with his observations of the Church in Western culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!!","review":"This book is truly a witness of how limitless God's power is and how mightily He moves in the face of our own human weakness. Brother Yun's story is so vivid that you feel as though he is relating to you personally the trials that he and his fellow Chinese Brothers endured and are enduring in a persecuted country. Yet in spite of their persecution, the message is not to feel sorry for them, but to examine our own life and the walk and service we are offering up to God. Their whole lives are given 1000% to the service of the Gospel. Reading this book was like reading from the Book of Acts and seeing that God's power has not changed nor his desire to save souls. Overall this book with it's miracles, wonders, trials, and conversions points to the continuing work of the Holy Spirit that began approximately 2000 years ago in Jerusalem and will hopefully culminate there as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Painful, Wonderful, Life-Changing","review":"This book was the most painful birthday gift I've ever received! But I couldn't put it down. Every chapter kept me asking God, \\"Why? Why would you allow these things happen to such a gentle soul who only wants to share how much he love you, with everyone he meets?\\" But by the end of the book, I understood more about the remarkable Brother Yun and about myself, then I ever expected to. I think every American Christian should read this book - no, make that every American - period. We have no idea how blessed we are, how easy we have it. I can only hope to be as brave, in the face of adversity, as this Heavenly Man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable Listening","review":"This was definitely not an easy listen and at times extremely unpleasant. I actually read this book when it first came out in print years ago and I really enjoyed it and found Brother Yun's accounts very exciting and inspiring.Listening to this many years later I've not enjoyed it half as much. I think what I find really hard about it is the great suffering the author has experienced as a result of preaching the Gospel in China. At times he made it sound like God was torturing him to improve his character.The quality of this audio is excellent and the narrators come across very well. I enjoyed Jeany Park's narration of Yun's wife far more than Christoper Jean as the voice of Yun. Her voice was more natural and soft against what I found to be an arrogant edge to the voice of Christopher Jean. Though this is perhaps more to do with the way it is written, rather the narrator's voice.Thanks to christianaudio.com Reviewer's Program for the free copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"get the print, not the audio","review":"This book contains excellent tales. It revolves around the life of Brother Yun, from childhood to adulthood, and his missionary efforts in his homeland of China. The tales that readers find in the book are simply unbelievable. Unbelievable, that is, if you don't have an open mind to the power of G-d and His active involvement in our lives today. If you don't, you won't enjoy the book, nor this audio narration of it, so feel free to move on. But if you do, then I solidly recommend the print edition over the audio edition.Read more, and disclosures too, at scriptedgenius(dot)com."},{"rating":"2","title":"anonymous","review":"This book is amazing! I honestly can't speak highly enough about it. I heard Brother Yun preach last night, and he is completely authentic, real and in love with Jesus. Mostly what strikes me is that hearing the life story of this man makes me realize that God is all-powerful and trustworthy, and a victorious Christian life is possible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Humbled, humbled, humbled!","review":"Brother Yun lives a life devoid of sham, pretense, and hypocrisy. He lives as all Christians should, depending completely upon God. We all desire to know God as intimately as he does, but not many of us are willing to endure the inconvenience of waiting upon God, much less the suffering, even unto death. I marvel at the supernatural guidance he receives from God. His criticism of the Western churches is right on target. My church is guilty, and I am guilty of substituting ease and materialism for God's will.This is a great book because one cannot read it without feeling challenged to live a simpler, more righteous life. We read of his complete dependence upon God, and we realize how little we trust God. We read of his utter disregard for men's opinions, and we realize how much we crave men's applause."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!","review":"This is my second favorite book in the entire world (1st is the Bible). But it speaks to anyone on a spiritual level. I enjoyed it, as have the 7 other people who are reading the books (I ordered 8) because of the intensity and passion of the writer, yet in simplicity.A powerful life story of Brother Yun, and how he suffers for what he believes, and the beautiful and intense testimony his life gives. There are many miracles and also a lot of talk about China (setting). He's a part of the Underground Church, and it talks of his struggles against the authorities and the political Church.It's one of those books that will change any, and everyone's lives....and once you pick it up, you'll never put it down!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly Inspiring","review":"This book is an amazing read for anyone, Christian or non.

While I am from a background of Christianity in the west and have never experienced much of what occurs in this book, I have no doubt in my mind the truth of it.

Suggested responses are military defense and diplomatic negotiation. Brother Yun and Paul Hattaway offer a third alternative.

You have to keep in mind that the members of Nickel Creek were just children themselves when they released this CD.

If I am just burning Audio CD copies or Data CD copies I normally use RecordNow becuase it's what I started using first and the wizard for copies is just plain simple. The Nero software has what seems to be more options but also seems a little more difficult to wade through. I can't understand why anybody would buy this software for the retail price though as it comes bundled with many of the current CD-RW drives offered for less than the cost of the software. I purchased a HI-Val 48x16x48 Internal CD-RW drive for less than the cost of the software and it was bundled free inside the box. The software is good but use your money for the latest and greatest CD-RW drive instead and get the software for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Will Corrupt a Windows ME System.","review":"Most products that support Windows 95 & 98 also work on Windows ME.

Some common negative remarks against Nero were:1. Can't burn .mp3'sA: Not true. It's called you burn an audio CD, not a data CD. Then your stupid freebie music will work in your CD players. And if you thought it would make mp3's from audio cd's... its a burning product...2. Confusing interfaceA: If all you like is big pretty buttons, then yes, buy Roxio's product. This by far has more features and options, and the interface is simple once you TAKE the time to learn it.3. Can't burn VCD'sA: Again, not true. Create a video cd and make sure the video files you are burning are mpeg layer 1's. If not, there are thousands of free programs that convert to that format.4. Doesn't workA: You didn't set it up correctlyOverall this is a great product. Don't like people who don't take the time or patience with it sway you. It's the best burning product out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product when it works","review":"I have been using versions of Nero since 1999 and generally it does a *very* good job - much better IMHO than EZCD, it has many useful options and provides good feedback.I have just however installed it on a Notebook with a combined DVD/CD-RW running XP and while it burns fine it now does not \\"simulate\\" at all.Nero's support are not the speediest to respond to new problems and looking at their site there are many ways to foul it up, I briefly had a TDK 32X drive that really did not get on with it at all well, yet my Wife's TDK 16X on an identical system with the same OS worked - go figure.In summary it is great if it works but it does not always work - I suggest you *try their Demo version first* before parting with any cash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"I haven't tried all the functions of this program, but it has worked very well where others have failed.

Basically, all the songs are not purely of Dominican nature, they are mixture of rythms, all influenced entirely by cuban music. To better understand Dominican music, I would advise you to listen to the following artists:**Juan Luis Guerra(merengue & Bachata)*Sergio Vargas(merengue)Jossie Esteban(merengue);(the older the CD, the better he is)*Los hermanos Rosario(merengue)*Johnny Ventura(merengue)*Luis Vargas(Bachata)*Luis Segura(Bachata)Anthony Santos(Bachata)These are just a few artist that you will fall in love with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate and misleading title","review":"I think the music in this CD is very good, but it's NOT authentic Domincan music.

When filled to capacity the interior is rather cramped, and it is difficult to flip through your collection.

Other than that, I am most satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad picture quality","review":"This DVD Player has bad picture quality. Initially i did not want to spend a lot as i fly only 3-4 times an year. The look and feel of this product is better than lot of others available in the market. 10\\" players are slightly pricey so i thought i will settle with this one. When i checked it in CircuitCity using a sample DVD they had, the picture looked ok, but after it arrived home i watched a movie that i watch in my TV and was dis-appointed to see how bad the picture resolution was. I immediately decided to return this one and look for better products. Philips PET 1002(10\\") was best rated in the market. So I went ahead and bought it from Amazon and returned the Toshiba. I recommend buying 10\\", anything less than that is too small and for a price difference of $55 between this one and Philips, I am happy that I got a better product and bigger size."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll Never Buy Another Toshiba","review":"When I first bought this DVD player, it worked beautifully. The drive stopped spinning after watching fewer than a dozen DVD's. Oddly enough, the drive stopped operating shortly after the warranty expired. I also have the misfortune to own the Toshiba Satellite L305D-S5895 Laptop, and the internal DVD drive in it lasted no longer than 20 hours or so before it, too, stopped working.

It worked very good at first... even at a distance of about 30 feet, in a bedroom, without a clear line of sight.Mine lasted no more than 2 months:- it started randomly ringing, as if a ghost is at your door (get out of bed for nothing)- new batteries made no difference (expensive little things)- testing at short distance: still no goodSummary: It doesn't work at all now, a useless product on it's way to the landfill. I do NOT like throwing away money (chime & new batteries) So, here I go once again in search of a decent doorbell.Be well, Jeff"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something else","review":"Within one month it started ringing by itself, and sometimes wouldn't ring at all. In less than six months stopped working all together. Replaced the battery, still didn't work. This is junk, buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable puts it mildly","review":"It seemed fine at first, right up until the return time elapsed. Sneaky thing. Well, almost fine. The battery sits a bit loose in the pushbutton unit, so when attaching it, the battery slid a bit and I needed to remove, adjust, and reattach. It worked. As I said, worked fine for a little over a month. Then it started working about half the time. Then it rained heavily and it started working all the time... as in ringing without being actually touched. Maybe something in the unit swelled? I had to unplug the receiver until things dried out.I've just changed out the battery in hopes of it working. I went through the \\"adjust battery, snap in place, remove to adjust shift caused by snapping in place\\" dance again, but then it worked. But after a few pushes over a few days, the battery has apparently slid out of place again. Off to buy one with a better rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get something else","review":"This is inexpensive and had the chime sound my wife and I wanted. I'll leave it to other reviews to discuss long-term problems, I just now installed mine and it has worked three times out of three.The install process is from the \\"we don't care\\" school. There are indentations where the screws go, but you have to push the screws through the plastic - there's no hole or poke-away tab.If you want to change the tone - I didn't, but I read the manual - you open the doorbell unit and change jumpers! This is fine if you have spent time setting up hard drives, but strikes me as an odd process for a doorbell with a total of three (3) sounds to choose from. Similar doorbells use a button on the underside of the ringer to change tones from one sound to the next.The doorbell functions so far, the bell is fifteen feet from the ringer, but the workmanship is consistent with the bad reviews and does not fill me with confidence.I recommend that you buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"This doorbell does not work, do not buy it.","review":"I bought this doorbell, followed all of the instructions, even replaced the battery, and I can't get a sound out of it.

I thought I had found another great book series and then came book number 2. The book was worthless and it took the entire book to deveop characters that are secondary. The story comes to a standstill. The book could have been written in 2-4 chapters and left more time to the good stuff. You need to go to the library and get this so you don't miss some little facts you might want, but don't buy it. I am half way through book three and it seems like the excitement from book one is back, and I want to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The Crown of Silence was a real disappointment after reading Sea Dragon Heir. Although there are a few fine moments, in general the plot and character development seem haphazard and uneven. The plot mostly seemed to consist of characters wandering around the forest or lakes looking for some ill-defined inner awakening and spewing half-baked philosophy. The compelling characters and eerie atmosphere from the first book are gone. I slogged through this one to get the third book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choppy waters with petulant characters","review":"I really wanted to like this book more. There were some good ideas but whenever it started to get interesting it would digress into petulant sulky inner dialogs or catty exchanges between the characters. It has a strong self-discovery theme but sadly that seems wasted as the characters never really seem to evolve, only switch who is their new best-friend.Constantine's writing flows beautifully and there are some wonderful images but any connection I felt to the characters was tenuous at best. By the end of the book the only character I cared to know more about was the indirect antagonist, Valraven Palindrake, and even he comes off as the bad boy in the clique that everyone either secretly loves or openly loves to hate.If you are into soap operas then you may find some enjoyment in the characters and story but for my taste everyone was just a bit of a drama queen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing piece of Fantasy Literature...","review":"This is a great sequel to the first of this Trilogy.

Excellent book go out and buy all three, its worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding writer!","review":"Outstanding! I am new to Ms Constantine's work. I first read her in collaboration with Moorcock, Silverheart, which I bought as an import. That was a real treat and different enough from regular Moorcock to show a writer who was his equal. If she's good enough to collaborate with Moorcock, I thought, she's good enough for me! I would still recommend Silverheart, but I have become enchanted by Ms Constantine's strange, weird sensibility and while this isn't her best novel, it is still pure Constantine, which is good enough for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ther eis one word for it - \\"BAD\\"","review":"This book was simply bad. It is disappointing after the first book. Crown of Silence is laborious , tiresome and drags on for ever. I don't think the author had any clarity about the story at this point.

These three actors are terrific, but unfortunately they cannot save this sorry excuse for a movie. This only showcases how important it is to have solid writing. Rather than letting the audience figure out some things by themselves, the status quo of every character is spelled out in marquee-sized letters, sometimes in trite dialog, more likely to be found in an afternoon soap. Don't bother with this film.

Lone Star Beer has never been done, in my opinion, as good as Red does it, and the cowboy songs are a perfect compliment to the whole collection. I have so many memories of all night drives to get from one rodeo to the next, with Red blaring on the stereo to try to stay awake, then Red blaring after the rodeo when it was time to have a cold one with friends.

Third, there are some incorrect facts. Fourth, I have no idea why we were subjected to footage of Desert Storm. And finally, I think by now, that any of us who have an interest in England, have seen at least a hundred times the changing of the guard at Buckingham Palace. It is not necessary to belabor that point twice in the video.

I'm sure I'll get all the technical names wrong, but here goes - the part that holds up the dryer head is just a simple thumb screw. With time, it is ceasing to hold up the dryer head, making the dryer essentially useless. The head will drop down during a drying session often now - and trying to retighten the screw that holds it up while hanging onto a wet, angry cat isn't easy! Without the screw working, the dryer will blow air straight down - which I can't find a use for.

About 2/3rds of the way through this book, he kills off many of the major characters, while completely breaking with the fairly close historical parallels he has used until now. This carnage is only very loosely motivated, and the authorial hand is far too evident.The characterization (never Weber's strong point) is flatter than ever, and the writing rather more wooden than before.I didn't buy this after I borrowed it, and while I may buy future books in this series (if any) I will probably not pay h/c prices."},{"rating":"1","title":"All talk, no action","review":"I stopped reading this book when, about a third of the way through, I realized that NOTHING HAD HAPPENED. All the characters seem to spend their time doing one of two things:1. If they're good guys, they tease each other playfully and twinkle their eyes.2. If they're bad guys, they sit around thinking about past, present, and future plots and conspiracies, all their co-conspirators and their respective motives, and the history of the universe.This was my first introduction to this series, and I would guess that the previous books were better, or there never would have been a series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh-Ugh!!!! Big War Chief!","review":"I sympathize fully with the \\"Ugh!!!!\\" review. Over eighty percent of the book was wasted on incidental, humbuggery political machinations, and dripping with preadolescent kitty-'cat nonsense (I suppose to attract the preadolescent female readership here). The only good political machination that I enjoyed was at the end, when the enemy declared a truce to delay their buildup of a final offensive. But the swift ending felt cramped and I felt completely cheated. That ending could have happened within the first half of the book. Then it could have gone on to a mature conclusion worthy of the title and cover art enclosing this novel. But for now the book cover yields to an empty sense of puffery, a smidgen of self-importance, one that is not backed up in the skill of the writing of an interesting tale; in essence, it is an annoying little example of the publication house's latest feat of ledgerdemain -- one rife with tedious adolescent jiggery-pokery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honorless Victory","review":"As a long-time appreciator of Weber's \\"Honor Harrington\\" series, I feel \\"Ashes of Victory\\" is an apt title for this book; it certainly left me with a desire to incinerate it. Weber deftly advanced many of the minor plot threads developing throughout the series and then must have become bored. Previous books in the series gradually fleshed out important plot threads involving the characters and government of the \\"People's Republic of Haven\\" (the enemy) which added faces and interest for the reader. Weber hints of important events unfolding and exciting action to follow - then skips it entirely in favor of a pitifully inadequate, miniscule, one-chapter summary of what could have been an climactic turning point for the series. The book fails to regain energy after that, ending with a whimper (both figurative and by this reader!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but where to go from there...","review":"I liked Ashes of Victory. But from what I see from looking at all of theses other reviews, it is either they loved it, or hated it. Now I didn't read all 77 other reviews, nor will I ever, but from the ones I did read about how they hated it they only said that it was because Honor wasn't in it every much, or that there wasn't much action, or too much of one thing. Well people, you can hate it, but understand that this is more of a transition (memo, I am not a good speller) book. I see it as a major changing, which I am sure others do. It is never easy to change how a seris goes, so it will be different. I however take it as it is, and I hope that... no, I know David will do great in the next one. As one person put, they can't wait to see who the next emeny is, as do I."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now things are really starting to get interesting...","review":"As I eagerly awaited the latest Honor, I re-read the previous 10 books. I wish I had taken notes to keep everyone straight! Weber has no \\"meaningless\\" characters, it seems. For devotees of Honor, the book will be a little short of progress on her plot line, but far from a disappointment.Other characters come into their own. Weber spends lots of time fleshing out what were brief sketches in previous novels. I especially enjoyed the development of the the royals and Thomas Theisman.While this book is a fun ride, it is more, as other reviewers have written, a set up for the future. But isn't that what all life is?

I thought the previous books in the series were great, and luckily, the remaining books in the series are also good. But this one was a real stinker. The entire first 250 pages of the book is about lavishing Honor with praise and rewards. Each time, she is \\"so surprised\\", finds it embarassing, and claims she doesn't deserve it. This goes on for chapter after chapter - first on Grayson then on Manitcore. There is also chapter after chapter of \\"witty banter\\" between characters that is anything but witty. It is just silly and ponderous. If you are reading the entire series, there are enough important events in this book that you'll need to read it, but be prepared to either be bored to tears throught much of the book or be ready to skim through large sections of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate","review":"This book is not as action packed as the previous books in theseries. There is a lot of wrapping up of the war and foreshadowing of the inevitable sequel.If you are into the series, you should probably read this book to see how things are wrapping up.

Other than moving from one society to another there is very little space involved and I find the dialogue repeatative and unoriginal. The characters are two-dimensional and I don't like any of them very much. I just don't see the attraction of this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"AOV, worst military SF novel I have ever read.","review":"This book was horrible. I would never have believed that Weber wrote it if his name wasn't on the book. In the space of one book the war has gone from a NATO/Warsaw Pact technological balance to a British/Zulu one. And unlike the Zulus in Zulu Dawn the villians of this peace the PRH don't have the numbers to make it into range and do some damage. A very large part of military science fiction is a belief that the villians actually have a chance to win. That doesn't exist here. All that Weber did in the previous couple of books to build up and make his adversaries credible he destroys here. He can do so much better than this! I have never before been so disappointed by a book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not His Best","review":"David Weber is my favorite Sci-Fi writer. I am willing to give him a lot of leway. This book was a bummer from the begining. Honor is featured in the book, along with all the other people you love and hate. The ones you want to get what they deserve do and new bad guys come in for Honor to thwart. Mr. Weber has several directions that he can go in from here. If he continues the series for several books, don't be suprised to see Honor doing most of her battling in the political areana rather than in space with the RMN or GSN. I look foward to the next book to see if this series and Mr. Weber continue to warent my respect. Like I said, ever the optimist...."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as Leo Frankowski's Conrad Stargard series, but...","review":"I have to say that one of my most favorite things about this book was also what made it most incomprehensible--the way Mr. Weber keeps shifting from a fog of political intrigue so thick I could have choked on its atmosphere, to often-humorous, lighthearted scenes of Honor Harrington's family life which reminded me strongly of some of the more genuinely humorous moments in Leo Frankowski's The Cross-Time Engineer. After reading this novel, I agree with the first reviewer, who recommended that people new to the series should read On Basilisk Station first--if for no other reason than to give readers like myself who jump straight into the \\"Honorverse\\" with the latest novel a chance to get used to Mr. Weber's writing style first. Otherwise--great book, especially because of the humor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely Qualifies as \\"Military Science Fiction\\"","review":"The biggest problem with Ashes of Victory is that regardless of what the intention of the author was, the book is not worthy of the series which it's in. Had this been an independent book, it would have been a complete flop.The entire book has the beginning of several major plots but no plot of its own. Furthermore, there is a enormous disparity between the amount of filler and text on the actual storyline.As an example, consider how we are given an endless amount of detail on tree cats' anatomy, surgical procedurals, political trivia, yet a major occurance such as the change of an entire faction's government has very little coverage.It is probably the worst book in the Honor series that I've read so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are reasons prolific writers NEED editors.","review":"Picture yourself stealing hours of short supplied time torevisit what once was an extremely enjoyable universe only to discoverthat it no longer exists. Nothing is left but 558 pages of unending words. Repeat to yourself that if you stay with it just one more chapter, you will find the story. Imagine repeating that until you are within 30 pages of the end of the book and can't believe anymore. Finally, despite your best effort, you break into document skim mode just to end the torture. This might be 20 pages for a good appendix. It is not a novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The continuing saga of Honor Harrington","review":"The first 11 chapters of this book are available for free online at BAEN.COM and wow - does it look good. Honor continues to mature in professional expertise and the book provides suprising insight into what makes a good 'Flag' officer. I own over 1000 science fiction books and this episode of this series joins one of a very few I will purchase (and keep!) in hardcover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Less action great story development","review":"A little different in tone than other Honor Harrington books; there is much more telling of what's going on than showing. It's not as exciting as some of the others, especially Honor of the Queen, and spends a great deal of time on technical details and politics. On the other hand technical details are one of the main things that set HH books apart from the mass of \\"space opera\\" on the shelves and this book does an incredible job of advancing the story line, tying up loose ends, and fleshing out previously minor charactors. Not the first book to read for newcomers to the series, but an outstanding book for those of us who love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"And now a word from our sponsor...","review":"As an Honor Harrington addict, I enjoyed the support characters' development and the, as always, fantastic writing style of David Weber. It takes a genius to keep all these balls in the air. Manticore, Yeltsin, New Paris... each is developed. Unfortunately, Honor takes a backseat to all the other development. Her one \\"hot seat\\" moment is brief and does not develop her as a \\"commander\\". I miss the thrill of her commanding in battle. And her interaction with her \\"core military cohorts\\". I look forward to the next book which will move into the future for the Peeps, Manticore, and Grayson. I appreciate this book for what it is-- essential to the series, not a stand alone novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Likeable but too fragmented","review":"After having read all the previous books in the Honor Harrington series I was looking forward to this new book. I liked the parts about Honor and the way Nimitz and the other treecats are evolving into \\"persons\\" to people other than their bond mates. What I did not care for at all were the large parts of the book that had nothing to do with Honor. I would rather have read more about Honor's family and friends. I was also wondering if the recuperation period might not have been a good idea for Honor to mother a child of her own... After all that would avoid the dilemma the Graysons had faced on her death at the time of her real death."},{"rating":"1","title":"300 Pages Too Long","review":"Mr Weber must have been paid by the word for this novel. It could have been a great read except for all of the padding. I guess Mr Weber's editor was on vacation."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of the lot....by a great deal","review":"What an INCREDIBLE disappointment. Doesn't Weber have an editor? Or does Baen just publish whatever he shoves under the door? This is a work with almost no action, ENDLESS exposition and backfill, no well drawn characters, cliche after cliche, and a universe filled with either awful people or military heroes. Surely somewhere in Manticore there's someone in the Opposition who isn't self-interested, brain-dead scum. But that is beyond Weber. This book is so flat, so dismal, so self-inflated that there's no time to generate any interesting characters (although there are many places where we'd like to meet someone new and exciting).My recommendation: don't bother. Weber is tired, his universe is tired, and Honor is behind a desk.

I have enjoyed all of the HH series and was not disappointed in this one a bit and I, for one, am glad to see Honor getting out of the line of fire a bit more than in the past. Despite Admiral Harrington not being directly involved, (at least to the degree she has been in the past), some of her old comrades are, and not all of them make it to the end of the book. The \\"treecats\\" figure even more heavily than they have in the past...I wonder who the first treecat to become an officer in Manticorian Space Navy will be? If you enjoy science fiction or, for that matter, military fiction, and are not reading the Honor Harrington series, you are missing a big bet.

Judging by the voting on the reviews ('did you find this review helpful') people who disliked the book are in the minority, yet the criticisms voiced are, I think, valid. Major events are thrown away, with only passing references. Frankly boring plotlines are given page after page of numbing detail and I felt that this book desperately needed a firm editorial hand. It was too long, certainly, and with judicious cutting the pacing problems inherent to the book could have been dealt with - to a degree. I have enjoyed the series up to this point, and it is this enjoyment that will keep me reading. Let's hope that the next instalment is a great deal better than this lacklustre effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ashes of Victory","review":"The latest book by David Weber is an outstanding continuation to a series that equils Star Wars in its excitement and surpasses it in its depth. Honor Harrington has died, gone to Hell, and has returned setting free close to half a million prisoners from the Peoples Republic of Havens prison planet known to it's inhabitants as Hell. With the openning passages of the book it brings forth, the rising from the ashes a true hero, who was feared lost forever. With that, the beginning of the end for a great evil presence that castes it's spell of destruction on both the Star Kingdom of Manticore and the Empire of the Peoples Republic of Haven.

When the bottle ran out, I decided to try Rive Gauche next. I cannot tell you how dissapointed I was.

In the end I actually had to use scissors and cut the stitch to get it on the steering wheel which, in turn, caused the material to tear. It's on the steering wheel very snuggly now though; I don't think it'll ever come off. You can just barely adjust it on the wheel. I'm keeping this cover for now, but if I had to do it all over again I'd definitely buy a different product."},{"rating":"1","title":"some how dirty","review":"Disapointed... dirty.

Like other people mentioned, parts of the white on the rubber were discolored to yellow. I also gave this as a gift and felt terrible when my girlfriend opened it. The rubber is REALLY hard. I don't believe it \\"fits most standard steering wheels\\" as the description claims. My girlfriend drives a mitsubishi galant and even when we put the cover in the dryer for 20 min or so to warm the rubber, it was impossible to stretch. We actually ripped the rubber in half (if that doesn't tell you something about the terrible quality!) trying to put it on.Furthermore, the rubber is incredibly stinky. You can smell it when you are driving and it makes your hands reek. It actually gave my girlfriend a headache. Seriously.I would pay 10 bucks to have the memory of this purchase wiped from my mind!

I had previously owned the Uni 4.x (bought when Cybermedia still owned and supported it). The Uni 6.5 contains functions/programs that other programs (OS's, word processors, and even freeware) now perform. What I want the Uninstaller for is to move programs while maintaining their association with their other files, and to be able to see what other files use or are used by a certain file. Both of these features were present on the 4.x series. The latter feature is not present on the updated v6.5. Despite what the manual on the 6.5 CD states, and despite what the hardcopy manual states, the file association feature is not present on Uninstaller 6.5. The file association feature is now available on another NAI product; one that needs to be purchased in addition to Uni 6.5.

This was the most disappointing. It is fairly short, but considering the low price, that should be expected and if you read the description, it tells you how long it is. So that was not an issue for me. The problem was that Sponge Bob and his friends just don't work well as claymation characters. My kids just couldn't get into it.

Now my 3 year old is going to think it's ok to call people jerks because spongebob does it. Not cool!

I try not to use words like that in my house and there goes SpongeBob teaching them. Every time I encounter something like that in a cartoon I explain to my children why we shouldn't use words like that and that it's just a fake cartoon and not real life. I know SpongBob is for 7+ but they really don't need to say some of the stuff they do. I don't like my 7 year old using words like jerk or tubby, both which have been featured on SpongeBob cartoons.Either way with some parental guidance it's a very entertaining little mini movie about SpongBob's Christmas!Thank you for reading my review, I hope you found it helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"not funny","review":"The claymation was a cute idea, but most of the writing was uninspired and not very funny.

Whether you're into Blues greats of the 50's and 60's, or just into good photography, this is worthwhile. Some of the greatest black and white photographs I have seen. Puts your right in the smokey clubs of South Chicago, and in the artists' face. Sensitively accomplished and carefully assembled after 40 years. Photographer Raeburn Flerlage had a remarkable feel for the soul of the music, and a love of these peformers, and was granted unusual access to their lives. It shows in the photos, both candid and peformance, if there is a difference here. A lovingly crafted collection, and a time capsule of a age fled, a city now changed, that gave us an American art form. Done by a photographer with the soul of a poet. Excellent notes by Flerlage, now in his eighties. For music lovers, a must have. Ditto fans of Chicago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chicago blues.. photographs of raeburn fleriage","review":"Well it's been 5 week's still no book .

I suspect any of this units would start to get rusty if left out in any type of weather.One other word of caution: I don't think this would work very well with kids' bikes. There's nothing that would keep small wheels in the slots.Gave it two (instead of one) stars since it is heavy duty, holds full size bikes securely, and folds up as advertised (although it was very stiff due to rust)."},{"rating":"1","title":"bike rack","review":"I wouldn't buy this again.

The author is really an outsider to the conflict, he makes his own hypothesis from afar away. The analysis is too descriptive, and very repetitive. The author seeks to show that he is the 'the Western leading expert' making the analysis with no policy implications. You may read the book as it has some historical background, but for a successful analysis of Algeria you'd need to look elsewhere. The book really doesnt do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality starter","review":"I've been using this starter for more than an year now and it has never failed.

I use Salton YM9 1-Quart Yogurt Maker x 4 with 1 gallon of Organic 1% or 2% milk, 1 cup of dry non-fat milk and 2 packets of this yogurt starter. After 6-7 hours - the perfect yogurt. Just make sure everything that the milk touches is clean, otherwise you will have to wait longer for the yogurt to set and it will have a stronger flavor.Highly recommended.2011 UPDATE:Just wanted to say that I'm still using this starter to make the best yogurt possible.

The only thing worth looking at is the leading lady, and even that gets boring. If you were to be totally stoned or drunk, it might to amusing to create your own laugh track.I'm a big fan of Euro-horror (Argento, Fulci, etc.) and I know Franco isn't trying to do the same thing, but this is one of the absolutly worst films I have ever seen--bar none, and I've seen thousands."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Franco movie.","review":"This film is a sister-piece of the better known \\"Vampyros Lesbos\\".

This movie is from 1970, which I like, but is very slow paced by todays standards. There is some female nudity, but no male nudity that I recall. The sex scenes are very mild, I wouldn't even give them a \\"soft porn rating\\", but I'm sure, back in the day, it was quite risque'. Most of the violence or killings is mild , or the act is done off screen so you don't see it being done. They wouldn't even show her husband slitting his own wrists. Soledad Miranda does have a wonderfull body, and you do get to see it from time to time [ just not enough ]. So, for historic value it is just fine. For erotic value, not much. For blood or gore value, very little. Runs 74 minutes. The transfer to dvd was pretty good, no scratchy or worn out spots.

Be very alert for errors, which are numerous, particularly in the answer key. These could have been avoided by a careful proofreading, and I hope they will be corrected if there is a new edition.If you are teaching, please work through the workbook yourself so that you can tell if an answer is correct.

We are able to complete an entire week's worth of homework and the lesson in Monday's class, and there's really nothing to do the rest of the week! Additionally, during the first year, the students only learn the present active indicative tense for verbs and only 2 noun cases (nominative and genitive). There is no actual textbook for the students, so the teacher has to make handouts each week for vocabulary and translations. The only resource for the student is the workbook, which is mostly copying and repetitive work. Repetition is good, but this is a bit much. If you're doing a self-study, it's probably good, and you'll go through the book much faster than 1 lesson per week.

The actual chiming parts are two strips of steel behind that wood cover. The support for those strips is poorly thought-out, resulting in a too-quiet, very dull sound. Furthermore, the wood \\"box\\" is held on at the top by a very small molded plastic nipple. Count on it breaking off the first or second time you take the wood part off.

It is great to thumb through and see how things were done at that time. This was originally aimed at young boys from 11 years old and up.

A particular lowlight is the comically bad rendition of Bob Dylan's \\"A Hard Rain's a Gonna Fall\\", which is painfully stretched out to over nine minutes. The liner notes, which elevate 1960s folk singers to the status of gods, add to the leaden effect of this CD.

A good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought they'd be smaller","review":"I thought these scoops would be much smaller than they actually were. Not sure what prompted me to think that way. Either way, despite the fact that they were too big for what I needed, they are a great product. The grip is nice, the matieral seems hard to break or crack and I would definitely use them if I had an ice bucket in the freezer. I ended up trading them in at bed bath for a set of three aluminum scoops in smaller sizes for the price of one of these. Will definitely buy in the future though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect For The Ice Bin","review":"I use this in the bin of the ice cube maker.

It is full of much action and warfare, which takes place in the last months of the killing in 1953. What is depressing is that after all these soldiers have been through, they make it to the end of the violence and begin to celebrate the idea of going home again. Then they are told by the idiots in High Command that the armistice won't take place for another 12 hours, so they have to go and risk their lives shooting at more North Korean troops until then. I can't imagine the thoughts that ran through their minds!!!What happened after that and before? Watch the movie! South Korea makes a good war movie about the Korean War. Now if only the USA moviemakers would get off their butts and try to make one too---the only flick we have related to the Korean War is the TV show MASH for crying out loud!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING AND EPIC!!!!","review":"At first i was skeptic because most korean action and war movies arent very goos at all and cheesy but this film was extremely moving and showed great detail and emotion in the story.

I just didn't feel moved by this movie in the scenes that were obviously contrived to do so. The acting, script and direction just flopped. Yes there are scenes with arms coming off and blood spurting, but that's not what makes a god war movie; that only adds a sense of realism for all you armchair soldiers who have never felt the pain of combat (and that includes me).Sorry, I just don't agree with all the hype this movie gets, it really isn't worth 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"KIMSHEE!!!","review":"DONT BUY THIS UNLESS YOU SPEAK FLUENT KOREAN!!THE AD SAYS 'DUBBED IN ENGLISH' BUT IT IS ONLY SUBTITLED!!!IF YOU ARE READING THE SUBTITLES YOU MISS THE FILM :(("},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for this one to come out on TV....Not very good.!!!","review":"This movie sucks, that's my opinion & I have seen lots of Movie's ..

I've read each book and loved every one. But now I am turned off SVH:SY. I found by reading just that one book, SVH has changed way too much. You now have Jessica Wakefield unpopular- with all her best friends against her. To many new characters that are ruling out old, loved ones- like Todd, Winston, Enid and Maria (They weren't Even in the book at all) And to much changes- Like Elizabeth's new look at life, wanting to dress more sexy and re-think her decision about sex. I'd understand if they slowly made changes, but by making all the changes all at once it's too much. Why would they change such a great series like SVH, into this stupid series like SVH:SY??"},{"rating":"1","title":"I rushed to buy it--but it was DEPRESSING!","review":"WHY DOES FRANCINE PASCAL THINK EVERYTHING HAS TO BE EXTREME! In the OLD series, everything was peachy keen. Now, in the NEW series, every single person's life is wrecked and they are all completely different. The book was interesting but NOT WORTH READING because it was so depressing.

Have you noticed the cover? It looks like some kinda fake stupid teenage romance series!

I don't just have a complaint about \\"Can't Stay Away\\", I have a complaint about lots of the recent Sweet Valley High books. There is way too much drama! I know that all the drama makes the books more exciting but come on how can someone lose two or three boyfriends in such a short amount of time. No one's life is like that and after awhile reading the same kind of plots gets a little bit boring and annoying. With the recent Sweet Valley Senior Year books, I am really annoyed that lots of the old characters that made the old books so good are gone and that Elizabeth seems to be changing her ways. I have a lot of critiscm for the recent books and I can't list it all here but I was very dissapointed with these recent Senior Year books and don't recommend that you read them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much drama!!!!","review":"I have been a reader of SVH and the other series for 7 years now and I have never disliked a book as much as I have with this one or the earthquake ones. I mean it is nice that the twins perfect worlds are changed but this is a bit too much. There has always been too much drama with Sweet Valley. Jessica is only 16 in these series and already she has lost 2 or 3 boyfriends and the twins have gotten in soo much danger so many times. But back on to the senior year book~Where are Enid, Todd, and the rest of them? I know some of them went to college but this is too much of a change. I have a lot more critism but there's not enough room but I am very dissapointed in the latest of the sweet valley books."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"I've been reading Sweet Valley High books for years. I liked Can't Stay Away very much. It seems more realitic then before. But there are some disiapointing things~ first off whats with the new covers? They look really boring and I liked the other \\"Jessica\\" and \\"Elisabeth\\" better. Also why wasn't Lila, Ken, Todd, Enid or Marie hardly every mentioned?? While it may be a good thing that the twins don't have a perfect life anymore, I miss all the magic of before! Remeber those great books when Liz and Jess were working as au paris in France?? I wish they would bring that back up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Start To A Great Series!","review":"In \\"Can't Stay Away\\", the first in a series about the twins being seniors, Jessica's sure she's going to have an awesome year when she meets Will, a hot guy she likes. After they make out and go on a date or two, Jessica finds out that Will has another girlfriend, Melissa. Melissa gets [mad]at Jessica and Will feels bad but does nothing to help Jess.Elizabeth, on the other hand, has some boy problems of her own. She's in love with a guy named Conner, but he apparently hates her. After she leaves Lila's house to move in with her friend Megan, Liz realizes that Conner is Megan's step-brother. She's living in the same house with the guy she likes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good set up","review":"Although I do agree with that it is a very good book, its a set up. This book could definitly not survive on its own. It does not have enough plot. But it does have a relly good build up sequence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!","review":"I loved this book! I am probably the worlds biggest sweet valley fan and this was one of the best books ever. The only problem was there was no mention of a few of the loved characters like Winston, Devon and Maria Santelli. But, there was mention of a lot of the characters that had bit parts in the other stories. And yes finally after a few summers, a couple of Christmases and dances every week the twins have reached there senior year and it is better than ever. I would never change the old SVH but the new Svh is even better. The best part of these new books is the characters writings. Those are so cute. And I think that the earthquake has changed the twins for better. Jessica is more realistic and not as schemeing and Liz is not as uptight but still caring and compassionate and still remembering Olivia. Ken to is still remembering Olivia to and doing drastic things!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm glad it was only a dollar","review":"Well, Jessy and Lizzie are growing up. I think it's ridiculous how Jess fell like a rock for Will so very quickly without realizing he was hooked up. And Melissa, she's awesome if a bit neurotic. I love how the social \\"food chain\\" is changing, with Jess no longer on top. The femme fatale man-eater cheerleader thing is finally over. The characters weren't as well developed in this book as they are in the later SVH Seniors, but I suppose this is the getting to know eveyone period. Liz is so dumb for liking Connor and I think that if you are reading Seniors and SVU at the same time, Liz's obsession with sarcastic jerks is getting really old. Overall, a decent book, but the later books in this series get better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"I waited a long time for Sweet Valley High: Senior Year to come out and when it did, I bought it immediately. But I was really disappointed with it. Elizabeth has changed so much - she seems like a different character, and it doesn't seem right making Jessica unpopular. There are so many new characters, and they rarely ever mention Winston, Todd, or Enid. I liked Sweet Valley how it was before the earthquake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good!","review":"I had never really read any of the other Sweet Valley High books,because they seemed really,I don't know-Girly. This book was NOT what I had expected. I enjoyed this book alot because it was different.

Will is a sleaze for starting those rumours about Jessica, just so he can hang onto the witch Melissa. Elizabeth won't be much of a goody-goddy anymore-she's fallen for Conner! All in all, it looks like an interesting series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a change!","review":"I don't understand this series at all! What is up with all the new characters? I hate it when the author suddenly changes everything without even remembering the past. Where is Lila, Winston, Todd, Enid......? It's like they disappeared! Those characters made Jessica and Elizabeth Wakefield who they are. The changes in the other series weren't so drastic (i.e.- Sweet Valley High to Sweet Valley Twins) as they showed the twins when they were younger. The main supporting characters such as Lila and Todd were there but now it's like they don't even exist in this \\"Senior High\\" series. The covers don't look all that great either. I know Cynthia and Britney are moving on and can't pose for those SVH covers forever, but at least the faces of Jessica and Elizabeth don't have to change! There are way too many changes and I think that this series doesn't even try to keep the warmth and familiarity of the series that existed before."},{"rating":"2","title":"A big improvement!","review":"I definately prefer SVHSY to the old SVH books. To tell the truth, they were just way too unbelievable. SVHSY is a much better series because the characters are ones which you can identify with, and they actually have [reasonably] normal problems. It was rather sickening to see them breeze through life in the old series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting things happening at SVH","review":"This book is exciting, as it brings into some new characters, but I'm a little disappointed as it leaves some unresolved issues from Earthquake and Aftershock. It turns out that El Carro high school has been damaged, so half the students are at Sweet Valley High, and the other half at Big Mesa. This introduces a lot of new characters, and this could create some conflicts, like in sports. It was an interesting book, and I look foward to seeing what else will happen now that Jessica and Elizabeth are seniors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dislike","review":"I love SVH and SVU books and have been reading them forever but now.... well I am sticking with only SVU. After only one book I have been turned away from SVH:Senior Year series. The characters Winston, Patty, Devon and Bruce where not mentioned once and enid and todd where in it a very small amount.Then you have all thses new people that have taken over SV by being more popular and disliking Jessica and Elizabeth now wants to be different. She wants No straight A's and wants to dress sexy.This is NOT the sweet valley I have come to love"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Stay Away","review":"My favorite book is Can't Stay Away by Francine Pascals. First of all, I like it because of the problems this teenage girl is going through. I like them because every kid can relate to them.Choosing friends can be tough! Another reason I like the book is how the author puts crazy details in it. For example, My friend Jessica seems to have put her brain on ice. Now so far I don't know about you, but this book is groovy. Finally I like it because of the style of the book.Kids sometimes read books and think this is boring and ancient, but these books relate to kidsBoth physically and emotionally.

I've done this with the brushes and the sponge. My mother who is left handed, doesnt have the same problem. My first one lasted for more than a year, so I'm thinking they reduced the quality or \\"improved\\" the design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still going strong","review":"After 6 months, we are still on the first sponge head.

The soap does not dispense properly. Despite the printed claim \\"No-leak, no-mess soap dispensing,\\" the handle leaks non-stop so one cannot leave soap in it. I won't return it this time, but won't repurchase either. It does have a nice solid grip which I really like, but deserves the low rating because it is advertised as a soap dispenser. That is what I needed when I bought it, and that is what I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"First OXO Failure","review":"Love their products but this simply doesn't work. The sponge fails off with the slightest bit of pressure. Did I get a lemon or what?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try, but...","review":"On first blush, the OXO dish scrub looked to be much higher quality than other similar products I've used, so I bought one. Initially I was very happy with it. However, over 2-3 months of use the black rubber plug used to seal the detergent inside the handle shrank (!), resulting in non-stop detergent leakage.If you're looking for a detergent dispensing scrub, try another OXO product: theOXO Good Grips 1063901 Soap Squirting Palm Scrub. I've had it for 4 months now and it's working wonderfully."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAKY UNIT","review":"UNIT LEAKS DISH SOAP. NOT HAPPY.

However, the second was just as bad. If the wand is left standing or laying sponge-down, soap leaks out of the dispensing hole. If it's left with the sponge facing up or standing on its handle end, soap leaks from around the fill-hole seal. When washing a glass, the tab on the fill-hole seal can catch on the rim, flip open, and spill detergent. Irritatingly, when in use, soap DOESN'T come out of the dispensing hole unless the handle is at least half full and you hold it at jjjuuusssttt the right angle. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"leaked badly","review":"My mom used to have a generic brand of this type of scrubber that worked fine. So when I bought the OXO, I felt like I would get a good product since I like the OXO brand. But the scrubber leakes horribly and I didn't keep my receipt from Bed, Bath and Beyond to return it. So, I think I'll try the little palm scrubbing brush from OXO. If it leaks, I'll send it back. Don't know if I just got a bad one or what, but usually I can trust OXO brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell apart","review":"The scrubbing part started falling apart the first time I used this.

I needed a good brush for cleaning the fry pan and a few other shallow dishes, this works perfectly. Quick, easy, well built, no mess. I also use it (improperly) for cleaning out my magic bullet after milkshakes. I really should get an appropriate jar cleaning brush for that but hey, it works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS SUCKS.","review":"I'm so over Oxo right now. Their stuff is just so overpriced and of such poor quality! I bought an Oxo pizza cutter in 1993, and that thing is STILL cutting our pizzas and quesadillas, and it looks brand new. What happened, Oxo? You guys got big and started churning out total crap? Boooo!This scrubby brush is just ridiculous. First of all, the sponge falls off. And second, the \\"no-leak\\" thing is false. It leaks like crazy. Every day, I have dishsoap caked all over the handles of BOTH my scrubby things - one has a sponge and the other has a brush - and that tells me right there that it's just a duddy design. I purchased them separately, and they're totally different products, but with the same soap button design. THEY LEAK! They will leak soap all over your counter and sink.

I have a lot of your products, but this might be the last one I buy. This thing is terrible. If you plan to have it longer than a week or two, then I would pass on this. Seriously, even if you get a good price you will pay more in the long run. OXO should have pulled these from shelves. Shame on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for some things, but big and bulky.","review":"I like this better than the little round brush that has the soap dispenser in it because this is a sponge-scrubber. If someone would create a little round sponge with soap in it, it would be perfect for me. The angle on this is not perfect for most items and it's bulkiness is an inconvenience in an already inconvenient chore. I bought a pretty deep bowl to rest it in, but it takes up a lot of counter space and I found that after it stayed in there a while, I would choose the sponge over this product, especially when washing up a single item."},{"rating":"2","title":"has worked for me for almost 3 years","review":"i've had this for almost 3 years and it does well. the sponges on these (like all sponges) start to stink eventually so i switched to the brush pad. the brush pads are wonderful and never ever start stinking. i have at least 6 other cleaning brushes and sponges under the sink but i use this one for 99% of the cleaning. great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"Everything on this is well built, except the sponge.

The jury is still out..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good product previously, but new version is flawed","review":"We've had several versions of the Oxo Good Grips scrubber. The latest one, however, is a real lemon. After a few uses, the rubber \\"button\\" you depress to dispense soap into the sponge stops working. You press and press and press and can see the little plunger thingy moving inside, but no soap comes out. Basically useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick cleaning without the dry hands.","review":"I already had the brush version and decided to buy this with the soft sponge refill. Now I have two and they both fit great with the matching Oxo double sponge organizer with a place for the Oxo wide pump soap dispenser and regular sponge. All make for an organized and clean sink."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leakage at rubber button after a few months","review":"Yes, it's true, this will leak after a few months usage because there is no rubber seal on the handle. Rubber on plastic will eventually give way to a liquid leaking out. Oxo finally solved this issue by developing a handle that completely seals the rubber button but you refill the soap by turning the handle in a screw type fashion. The catch is that you have to buy it with a stand, which costs about $3 more. Oxo probably realized this while testing the base out with their older model dispensers that were leaking soap out at a much faster rate since the handle is laid upright and not lying flat. See my review on the Oxo soap dispenser with a base."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripoff!","review":"I ordered this sponge as a replacement for an older model. I should have listened to the other reviewers. I've already gone through three replacement sponges in one month, they all keep popping off the wand.

It is heartening to see that beloved Kali has begun to gain more Western devotees - Elizabeth Harding has done a truly magnificent job in writing and researching this book. She has made much of the hidden beauty and splendour of the Bhavatarini more accessible to the uninitiated with this book. As a practising Kali-worshipper and theosophist, I have found this book to be a great source of pleasure and knowledge. A few more colour pictures would have been nice, but the black & white illustrations are sufficient, and the elegantly written text more than makes up for the lack of colour plates. Jai Ma!"},{"rating":"1","title":"caveat emptor","review":"While this book clearly shows that Ms. Harding has much love for Ma, it also clearly shows that Ms. Harding still has a long way to go in her studies. This book is a rambling cacaphony of the author's personal experiences, intermingled with lots of quotes from other books. Indeed, it is a good thing Ms. Harding included the quotes from other books, as her personal commentary is quite deluded and in some cases, downright racist towards Vedic people. If you are interested in knowing more of Ma, you would do better to purchase books by Sri Ramakrishna or Dr. Robert Svoboda. Except for the quotes included herein from other books, I found this book for the most part useless. However, it does show, if nothing else, that Ms. Harding has a great deal of love for Ma - definitely though more study is in order for Ms. Harding.

I have used a nailer only a few times in the past. I must say that I am VERY happy with this product. It's very light and very easy to use. It seems to have plenty of power for standard wood and pressure treated. It kicks back very little and is pretty quiet. It seems pretty well made (although Made in Taiwan, not USA like most Milwaukee) but I'm not sure how well it would hold up for a production framing crew.

I was surprised by how much of it was plastic, but put it to work. For the most part it worked fine. This weekan employee was using it and somehow a driven nail ended up twisting around and catching under the driving pin. With other nailers, I had been able to drive the pin back to free the nail. I was not able to remove this nail, even after disasembling the nailer. All I can do is invest in a new nailer and it won't be a Milwaukee.

Their blend of jigs, reels, ballads, and love ballads works perfectly, and makes this group of 7 young musicians well deserving of the \\"Best Overall Traditional Irish Band\\" award that they received at the 1999 Irish Music Awards. An added bonus is the history lesson learned while reading the descriptions of the songs.

However, if you have no knowledge of the OT, this book will certainly illuminate the intricacies of the Hebrew Bible.

A loving homage and send-up of those rapid-fire, witty, dialogue-driven comedies of the times, \\"Man of the Century\\" places the stereotypical hero of such films in modern day settings for comic effect. From his modern girlfriend who mistakes Johnny's chivalry for disinterest, to a moody, 'artistic' photographer/partner, the anachronism is played for laughs, effectively. Short, sweet and featuring an uproarious appearance from Frank Gorshin (The Riddler on the old 'Batman' series), \\"Man of the Century\\" is definitely the bee's knees.

Their writing inspired a number of films (\\"Guys and Dolls,\\" for instance).If these names don't ring a bell, reading online articles on these two writers would be a good place to start, and inexpensive used copies of their short stories are available from internet booksellers.-30-"},{"rating":"1","title":"A sick joke..","review":"This film has disappointment written all over it. Despite the pretentious beginning, the well-meaning film becomes pointlessly obscure (like the dialogue) and the plot is non-existant. The mood is captured early on, but the outcome is as bare as a one-legged dancer. With good reason in deed, the film carries an R rating because of constant profanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Premise, Very Disappointing","review":"I was very excited about the premise of this movie. But within 20 minutes I was totally disgusted. The idea of a 20's man living in modern day New York could have made a great movie in the right hands. Obviously it was not. Sex, homosexual and otherwise, and profanity were the central themes. I'm sorry to say I purchased this DVD, If anyone wants it, I'll sell it real cheap. But you would still be ripped off. I would challenge a quality writer and film maker to take this idea and do something worthwhile with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I could talk like that!","review":"I loved this movie! The snappy patter and Bobby Short's musicdid it for me. I've never particularly been a fan of this or that era but this movie may well make you want to go back to the twenties. I loved that song Nagasaki enough that I ordered a Bobby Short cd. From the other reviews it seems you love or hate this movie. I think it's good enough to watch over and over!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for fans of the Jazz Age","review":"If you enjoy history of the cinema or the Jazz Age, you will enjoy this movie tremendously. It's a lot of fun, and in contrast to formula movies where someone stuck in the past can't make it in the present, he does just fine in our age, thank you, thanks in part to the real world picking up some of the fantasy from the early cinema. The acting, and action, is hilarious. Much that's in here has been done before, in the original, but it all comes together here in a very unique way. The only flaw I found is that although the language and situation \\"formulae\\" are from 1928-32, the dress is closer to 1926-27. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moose in their most beautiful form!","review":"This book on Moose shows the most beautiful photographyof Moose I have ever seen.

It was no open road."},{"rating":"2","title":"gary's power continues.....","review":"while still enjoying listening to his first album, he released his scond album, after twelve months and eleven days!!!compared to his debut album, this has less powerful materials to present them to te world, well, at least \\"for all that u want and \\"stronger\\" has continue his journey, after \\"love wont' wait\\", i bet u'll like this 2 numbers.his second album hasn't help him much to climb higher in the entertainment industry, unlike his first album, with variety of rhythm and choices, this album did not show what direction is he going to achieve in him future albums, but this is worth a listen, if u'r gary's fans and just misses his voice so much, then, get this, u won't be dissapointed by enjoying his vocal performance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fence.

The issues he raises goes to the heart of what differentiates the ideologies of the three main branches of Judaism. And his interpretation of Maimonides' views of rabbinic science and how to approach possible conflicts between the Torah and science is right on the mark and was applied by myself in my TORAH AND SCIENCE (KTAV, 1990) and IN THE BEGINNING OF (JAY-EL, 2005). I highly recommend this work for any serious student of Judaism."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are the good old days","review":"If you are tired of the over-use of the concept \\"yeridat hadorot\\" (decline of the generations) in contemporary Orthodox Jewish thought, this book will arm you for a counter-attack!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Particularly Helpful","review":"Kellner has his typical axe to grind once again. However, in this case he is in good company. Unfortunately, he does not really indicate that his entire thesis is not particularly original and can be found throughout traditional literature, particularly in the writings of the far-right R' Elhanan Wasserman and R' Abraham Isaiah Karelitz (Hazon Ish). I was particularly disappointed not to see any citations from R' Zvi Hirsch Chajes.He also does not point out that Maimonides' thesis on this topic is implicitly against the famous Epsitle of Rav Sherira Gaon as well as R' Yehuda HaLevy's Kuzari. See Isadore Twersky's Introduction to the Code of Maimonides p. 62 ff.Rather, Kellner prefers to score political points against the ultra-Orthodox by pretending that they are not aware of this concept."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Scottish CD","review":"A new/old lineup for the Whistlebinkies. The change is in their harp/singer. I must admit I prefered their previous singer-but this CD has only one song. If you are looking for a great Scottish recording played with traditional Scottish instumentation, put this on your short list. There are some non-Scottish influences,but not to distraction. It also features a tune by the late Tony Cuffe. Tony's contribution to the tradition will be heard in sessions for many generations. The Whistlebinkies play with a great mastery of their instruments, and are a pure pleasure to listen to over and over. I have lots of other CDs from other groups, but my Whistlebinkies never grow old."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good job","review":"As one who has long reveled in papal history (I have read all 40 volumes of Ludwig von Pastor's magnificent and magisterial History of the Popes and all 19 volumes of Horace K. Mann's very readable and informative work on the medieval popes)I found that this book, despite its provocative title, does a good job telling the history of the Popes in 317 pages. When I first saw the book I expected to merely browse thru it but it caught me up and I read it all. I am giving it five stars not because I agree with all the author's judgments but because it is so well-written that there is not a dull page in the book. He tilts some to the \\"liberal\\" side, but that is to be expected, and I liked the fact, e.g., that he spent more time on Nicholas V than on Alexander VI. Incidentally, I did not have any trouble knowing which Leo or Gregory was being discussed, since they are all pretty individual persons one is not likely to confuse. An attention-holding and eminently readable work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"An excellent overview of the Popes and their times, with heavy concentration on the politics of the times both inside and outside the Church realm.

The phone rings and then there's a sudden jump to Italy near the end of the movie, just before a car chase. Renders the copy of the movie worthless.

The DVD is incomplete, it jumps from one frame to a frame 30 minutes later in middle of a car chase. I use a video editor to verify this, this is not a jump to later point in the movie, the 30 minutes is NOT on the disk.

When film makers try to reproduce those times now, all they get is a fake surface, as in the 2003 movie, \\"Down with Love\\". I'm not saying that \\"The Nude Set\\" is a great movie, it's not, but it represents the SPIRIT of those times perfectly, and that's why I've watched it several times -- it takes me out of the Baby Bush Repressed Universe."},{"rating":"1","title":"your grandma in pasties","review":"total waste of time. the \\"star\\" never appears nude, but has various sistah relations with women who do. star also has a somewhat skanky boyfriend, with hipstah cool daddy-o relations with women who do. the women who do, do it sleepwalking, with tired music and tired costumes, hurrying through the sets not because they are nude but because they are embarrassed to be in this movie. bought it thinking, \\"oh, hey, shots of paris in the '50's,\\" but it's almost all stage sets and cheaply done."},{"rating":"1","title":"fustrating, can't save your labor.","review":"some projects will not open because of software files that can't be found...your stuck..Buying the full version of CodeWarrior($399) does'nt help..this is too old a ver. to convert.

I guess the book contents are a secret? Why is there only one review, and after being published for over a year and a half? Not a very promising showing for a book with a one reader - five star rating. Based on lack of information and lack of reader interest I give the book one star. I have decided to go with the Sedona Method. Sorry Patty, better luck next time. Why not buy ratings like some of the best selling authors? Just offer lots of free stuff if people buy your book and give you a good rating. Lots' of folks do it. Do a search on wealth and prosperity and there isn't a single book that did gets it's ratings the good old fashion way, they bought them! Ask Joe Vitale.

Written and directed by Ingmar Bergman. Three Swedish Academy awards (Best Film, Best Director and Best Actress). Two sisters argue in an hotel room while Johan, a 10 years old kid, is discovering the corridors and the strange guests of the hotel. The train compartment, the hotel room and the town, three claustrophobic places that Ester and Anna can't leave while Johan seems to be the only one able to open doors and communicate. THE SILENCE is a huge film which, like some books, can be enjoyed again and again. In my opinion, one of the most beautiful films ever made and one of my most intense experiences in a theatre, ever. Masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psychopathic for Life","review":"That's right. The Harvest is here and it's a great time to be alive.

Then it's really hard to get the lid off. So I have to get a knife to open it and clean the lid often.

The phrase \\"Kosovo is holy land\\" etc is being repeated again and again. And it may be so to serbs nowadays, but it was never to the medieval serbs. The national myths about a crushing defeat in the battle 1389 have no basis in the known sources. Nevertheless, the myths are being repeated over and over to maintain the idea of the national martyrdom. This myth is essential: If the medieval serbs did not sacrifice themselves for christianity and their nation, this martyrdom would not exist. The souces to medieval history tells a different story than that of the myth, but the myth still prevails in \\"Kosovo\\". Thus the history of the serb state in the middle ages is being used for strictly present purposes, which, in this particular case, is misuse of historical facts.The one star I chose to rate the book with was chosen because of the persuasiveness of the book.

The index, I am sure contains at least 15,000 entries, each pointing to one of 79 pattern verbs, which are the heart of the book. The pattern verb pages are in a completely standardized format, with the irregular letters clearly indicated in red, for all appropriate tenses, persons and number.

Quite a bit of information is erronous or outdated (e.g. restaurants/hotels do not exist or are priced over double of what stated, museums have been closed or moved), which especially in Moscow and Yekaterinenburg led to cross-city walks and travels at the end of which we found nothing. This is especially for what concerns the Moscow to Yekaterinenburg part; pages on St. Petersburg, China, Mongolia and the Irkutsk area were much more useful.Train and bus info: there is quite a lot of information if you are heading in the St. Petersburg to Beijing direction, but no special indications for if you are taking the opposite direction.Last point: guide suggestions are generally targeted to a welthier-than-backpacker budget (though Galina in Moscow was great!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"very useful guide","review":"As the title says, I found the book a very useful guide.

No buttons functioned, it would not turn off, the CD door would not open (with three of my CDs loaded inside), and there was that telltale pungent odor of burning electronics. All this occurred after the unit had been OFF for several days. Having read another review dealing with Emerson's reliability issues, I decided to return the unit and upgrade to a Panasonic 5-disc system. The speakers were better and Panasonic does not have the overall reliability problems Emerson seems to have. But, with the Panasonic, I lost that subwoofer out that I liked so much in the Emerson. Bottom line, check out the Emerson. It has a lot of nifty features for the price. If you can take a chance on the reliability issues, you'll have a fine-sounding micro system at a mini price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regrets","review":"I purchased this item to replace my outdated system.

The camera angle changes every 3 seconds and many times you can't even focus on that 3 seconds of video because the cameras are constantly panning, rotating or zooming. Also, it's nice to see audience shots every now and then, but on this DVD I think you see the audience at least 25% of the time if not more...so much in fact that there are a few audience members who should probably get royalty checks from sales of this DVD.

The music absolutely buries Alives 1-3, Unplugged, and Animalize Live Uncensored. The band is in absolute best form.Unfortunately, the video looks as though it was edited by George Lucas on PCP. The camera angles change so frequently that your eyes rarely get to focus on the screen, and there are these computerized zooms across the audience that drive me up a wall. Also, the Gene Simmons bass solo is ruined by some over-gaining effect on the camera that buries the guy in some overbright greenish glow.Overall, the best live release by Kiss ever, just don't expect much visual enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close caption or subtitles??","review":"Wonder, does this DVD have the closed caption or subtitles (in English, of course)???I know some of you don't care but I DO!!!!!!!

One of the funniest chapters addresses the complications of adjusting to bifocals. As a former wearer of bifocals, I had a great appreciation of Cosby's view. As somebody that has dietary issues, I also had a great appreciation of his perspective of dieting. Other sections deal with changes in your body and clothes.

He takes the reader down the road that he was going through back in the late 80's. He was struggling with getting old, and as his body started to age with him. He shows how he can no longer run in high-school track, and how his hair was starting to grey. His humorus look at getting old isgood for anyone to read. Now, I am in my 20's, so some of his jokes flew over my head, but I'm sure that is 20 years I will understand all to well what he was going through.

In fact, it won't even install until it has helped walk you through a complete un-install of Norton, utility by utility. In my opinion this makes the incompatibility intentional.In a lengthy support call to McAfee they finally admitted that \\"there is a known conflict...\\" between McAfee and Norton. Their reasoning is that since ANY Norton installation \\"might\\" contain virus scan software it therefore cannot be allowed to coexist on the same machine.McAfee VirusScan ver 5.1, however, is quite happy to share duties with Norton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loyal customer lost","review":"I have been a loyal customer of McAfee for several years.

And then my computer crashed (which is a week old and working perfectly)! And then after rebooting, it froze! It kept re-freezing each time I rebooted my computer.

Got them with the metal pins that will scratch and gouge the finish of your stem or wherever it contacts the bike. I ended up putting foam insulation for pipes (from home depot) cut to fit between the pins and the bike and this remedied the scratching and gouging issues it is not practical though as I have to have some foam at hand always as they will eventually wear out the foam. I later bought a Saris bar and it is way better and is better designed and has not scratched or gouged any of my bikes.I have driven well over 5000 miles on BMX and Mountain Bikes with these and have never had a pin come undone or bend, but the scratching and gouging issue is the deal breaker here, I would not recommend at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazon picture not accurate","review":"The picture on Amazon is not accurate for what I received.

It works great to mount my mountain bikes to the rack on the back of my car. The top tubes on my bikes are too short for them to fit on the rack properly without this bar.

I just wish Allen would have rubber dipped it like they did the seat post side. Other than that, it's great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda a pain to use","review":"The concept is a great idea but unfortunately it doesn't quite work the way it's supposed to on any of our bikes. There's one bike it will actually fit on and that one doesn't really need it because it mounts on the rack just fine. This will work on one other bike of ours but you have to get creative on how to put it on. The main thing I don't like about this adapter bar is that it snaps back if you aren't paying attention and pinches the heck out of your hand!!! I had a purple welt for days!! It definitely is easier to put on if you have two people. I decided it was too much hassle to mess with though so I don't even use it anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk.

I had an Allen bike rack that worked fine for my old bike but when I bough my new bike (ladies style) it did not go on the bike rack. I thought I was going to have to fork out another $60-100 dollars to get a rack for my new bike. The incredible R2 (lady at my local bike shop) turned me onto tension rods.

Good price and quality construction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably great for a woman's bike but not a kids..","review":"The reason I gave this 4 stars is that I was hoping it would make it possible to fit my son's bike onto our car bike rack but it is not made to ft childrens' bikes (or at least the ones I have!).

Discovery of Edwina's secrets and how she collected the secrets of the town adds interest to many of the characters. The characters were well written and drew me in emotionally...I actually grieved over one of their deaths! The true killer never even entered my mind as a possibility until almost the end. Tight and quick action in this story, though I was disappointed that Edwina's house and history weren't more explored. In particular, her old and crumbing mansion and her own past, which is always looming over the story, but never really seen.

Elric is an anti-hero, and the whole culture surrounding him has demented traditions for cornerstones.Moorcock points Shakespeare as one of his influences: he certainly got the royal intrigue mood from the Bard (great dialogue, too!); the chapter openings he borrowed from Brecht (another confessed influence), which help adding a mythical atmosphere to the whole tale. An atmosphere that's enhanced by the exagerations of time (an empire that lasts thousands of years) and places (towers made of gemstones, the sea labyrinth, etc...). And, of course, sorcery."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the best books ever written.","review":"I have enjoyed the Elric Saga more than any other series of books I have ever read.

Another reviewer mentioned that he got the impression that these stories were made up as the author went along.

Cacciato, the protagonist of the novel becomes the driving force of a quixotic attempt to rescue him desertion. In the loyalty of the platoon, the care of one in the relationship to all, mark this novel.At once surreal, graphic and hyper realistic, Going After Cacciato is a book that marked Tim O'Brien as a major American writer. His depictions of the carpet bombed former jungles, the mindless, twisted jungles, and the trek of the platoon as it chases Cacciato across two continents will rewards its reader.I cannot recommend this book highly enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just didn't get it...","review":"I had never read anything by Tim O'Brien before \\"Going After Cacciato\\", and I had high hopes for this novel ... Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. I don't know, maybe I just didn't get it. Yes, there were some moving scenes and some well-written passages, but in my opinion they were few and far between. Yes, the plot was surreal, but it was also flat. I would give this book 2.5 stars if that were an option because I think Tim O'Brien does have some talent.

My final opinion was \\"who cares\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad written novel","review":"I thought that this book was poorly written. However, his insight leads to an intense examination of the life and mindset of a soldier. The soldiers in the story talk like soldiers, but they just seem like real people with a horrible burden thrust upon their shoulders. Also, O'Brien's writing is delightful. Speaking from a purely syntactical standpoint, the way he crafts his sentences is a pleasure to read, even if it describes something horrible in Paul's life. Over all, I did not like this book at all and NOT recommend it to ANYONE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, but ponderous","review":"I read this book immediately after having read O'Brien's later Vietnam novel The Things They Carried, which I also highly recommend.The story is gripping, the characters well-drawn, and the descriptions of jungle warfare, the endless drudgery and fearful monotony of the soldier's day-to-day lives, and the adventures they endure make for powerful and unputdownable reading; however I was left wondering what was real and what was only imagined.Highly recommended, yet not for those who like their plots neatly tied together."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very varied masterpiece","review":"One of the most marvelous Vietnam-novels.

To maintain sanity, one soldier (Berlin) muses over their pursuit of a deserter (Cacciato) to Paris.You realize that it's more or less Berlin's imagination speaking when they fall into a hole somewhere in Laos and make their way underground to a manhole cover in Mandalay. Up to that point, they may actually be going after Cacciato. The story is complex -- emotions of a young man, a stranger in a strange land.Four stars for solid writing and plot building."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dude, I just didn't get it","review":"I thought \\"In the Lake of the Woods\\" and \\"The Things They carried\\" were amazingly powerful works. But everyone said \\"Wait until you read Cacciato!\\" Well, I read it. What the hell? Parts are really good: the troop in Iran, the subplot involving the troop's dead lieutenant, the gradual evolving of Cacciato's character. As a whole, however, there was no coherence or cohesiveness and just a little too much mysticism. Characters using fantasy to overcome grim reality seem to be an important part of O'Brien's work but he pulls out all the stops here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Equal to His Other Books","review":"Expecting the best of O'Brien after reading his other novels, I was sorely dissapointed. Something which I cannot put my finger on and that was so successful and in both of the aforementioned books seemed to be lacking in this novel. Perhaps this novel contained, at times, too much narrative. O'Brien's powerful themes were wasted in this book, rather IN THE LAKE OF THE WOODS was a better and more artistic display of responsiblity, perception, and misperception as themes, while THE THINGS THEY CARRIED was more shocking and raw in terms of the Vietnam foot soldier's life and mentality. Though worth the investment of time, a better experience could be extracted from one of O'Brien's other novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ukraine (Country Guide)","review":"This travel guide arrived too late to be of any value.Took over two weeks to Ship in the same County LA.We had already left for the Ukraine, and purchase another guide.

The woman who wrote it obviously hated the experience of being there; from the poor infrastructure to the people.

It has worked out very well, for some reason everytime you wind it up it comes out so you can connect the ends together which is nice because then it does not drip water when you store it. The hose to faucet end has one of those nice thumb things that make it easy to tighten so it does not leak at the faucet. It has never kinked on me and I don't understand why, as all hoses seem to, but this one has not done it yet. About the only negative thing about it is that that the outside is not smooth so it is a little harder to clean off before storage. All it all if you have tried other hoses, I cannot imagine you being disapointed in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pin holes for me, too","review":"We purchased two hoses last summer because of our limited storage space, and they worked fine. When we set up the hoses last week (they were stored in a heated garage all winter) they both developed multiple pin holes almost simultaneously. These leaks are extensive enough to seriously affect the water pressure delivered to the nozzle. The hoses are useless.We do not want to buy new hoses every year, so I have switched to another manufacturer's product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact and adequate flow","review":"I've only used this item once to wash my car and it worked fine. The flow is decent, nozzles fit fine, material seems tough enough to handle being rubbed against concrete. I like that it stores flat so I don't need a big reel for it.

Probably","review":"Wayman's translation is a noble effort, and has probably been of some use to academics and fearless students of the Lam rim tradition.However, his approach to the translation of a part of the Lam-rim chen-mo (quite possibly the most important text on spiritual paths ever written) is questionable in approach and methodology; often Wayman uses inappropriate occidental paradigms, and also misses idiomatic phrases, which would have been clarified if he had relied more upon the active interpretations availiable in the Tibetan academic community. Secondly, the grammar and sentential structure of his English text is not particularly clear, and although considerably better than his translations of the concentration and wisdom chapters (ASIN-0231044046), the text remains pretty obfuscatory.As a rule, I would heartily recommend the new translation as an alternative- ASIN-1559391669.Or even better, to learn Tibetan and read it in the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"A detailed look at a Chinese village in Shantung provience.","review":"This is a most interesting and insightful look at all aspects of a chinese village of the 1940's. It's very comprehensive and includes everything from daily life to the social structure of the village and beyond. Meeting the people of the village is especially interesting. The only real drawbacks are: 1-It was written in 1945 and so it would be nice to see a more modern study, considering the many changes in China. 2-It's getting hard to find. 3-Being a socialogical study, it can get rather wordy at times, and thus lacks the flowing narrative of, say, Jonathan Spence's works. Still, a thoroughly fascinating peek at a thoroughly fascinating culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too convoluted","review":"What I found difficult about this book is the flow.

The result is a loss of integrity due to these diversions in the text which, at least on my part, leads to confusion.Too many tangents! There is just so much in this book, so many interesting ideas and conceptions and a wealth of history that despite the difficulty I am pursuing it with vigor and writing my own chapter summaries and marginal notes.

The closest it gets to a contemporary punk song is \\"London Lady\\", but if any true punk listens to \\"Ugly\\", \\"Hanging Around\\", or \\"Peaches\\" they should understand what they were getting at. More of a Frank Zappa if he was English and had deep rooted punk influence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful holiday scent","review":"We have purchased several of these in the past year and love the convenience and price of home delivery,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Catchy title incoherent content","review":"I picked up this book as title looked very interesting. I read a good part of the book in travel. The book does a fairly in-depth objective analysis of a few specific case studies (eg Rushdie affair in UK, Hijab issue in France and Nation of Islam/Louis Frakhan coverage). However, these are but random samplings of events which got a lot of media coverage but do a poor job of reflecting the overall Muslim presence in the West.

For ... you really can't go wrong, it does DTS as well as dolby digital and despite the speakers only being small they'll go pretty damn loud with very little distortion. It has plenty of connections for hooking up your TV/VCR/Cable and CD player etc and it also comes supplied with the phono cables to do it. As for the subwoofer not working, i thought i'd got a faulty unit but the subwoofer has it's own volume control on the back and you have to turn it on on the amplifier itself, the subwoofer is turned off by default. My only gripe is that it doesn't come supplied with an optical cable and my dvd player doesn't have a coaxial digital output. Other than that i'd reccomend this system to anyone who wants a decent home theater for not a lot of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY SYSTEMIC DEFECT","review":"I BOUGHT AND SET THIS SYSTEM UP.

Jenkins, author of that series. However, I was pleasantly surprised, as the movie wasn't preachy or poorly done like most movies with Christians behind them. This was a very good movie, on any scale. The acting was terrific (if this were a bigger movie, Terry O'Quinn would get an award nomination), Lacey Chabert looked gorgeous (man, has she grown up!), and the music was amazing.The story wasn't flawless, but by the end, I was swept up in the emotion of this small town and their passion for their football team, and I was really moved. Do yourself a favor and see this movie, whether you like football or not.I especially recommend getting the DVD, because I saw on the \\"Legend\\" website that there's a new Jars of Clay music video that they shot on the set. Can't wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"If you are looking for a great movie, with great values, then Hometown Legend is the movie you are looking for.

Well, I'm happy I followed my instincts! What a great movie. If you love small town/football movies, you will LOVE this one. When people tell you that it was made for ONLY 2 Million dollars, don't let that keep you from this movie. The cinematography is excellent, the acting is superb and there is absolutely no OVER acting that we so commonly see. Incredible movie! I highly recommend it for the whole family!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Remember The Titans (LIGHT)!","review":"If you have seen Remember The Titans, this movie is similar, but doesn't have the same UMPHHH... The movie has some good acting, some good dialogue, and a interesting storyline, but the crowds and background scenes lack the professional Hollywood character.The best thing about this movie is that you can watch it with the WHOLE family - young, old, in between, Christian, atheist, or any sports fan can enjoy this movie while sitting together. It has a universal appeal, with only a few scenes being over-acted by the cast.All in all, pretty good film. Just not as good as Remember The Titans.www.therunninggirl.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some movies still carry a message...","review":"After being bombarded by movies with multi-million dollar budgets with absolutely no intelligible value other than pure entertainment I find it a relief that a movie made on only $2 million can be so emotionally stunning and morally pleasing.

I also recommend this to any and every University of Alabama football fan, you'll see why soon enough.

There is nothing, repeat, nothing in the way of an original plot element in this movie. Becuase it has a sort of luke-warm Christian theme, 25 Christian fundamentalists have given it enthusiastic 5-star reviews, which is absolutely typical for Christian-themed movies and inflates their average ratings in a very misleading ways. This film is mildly entertaining, but it's just not great cinema."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Father-Son Movie","review":"I originally purchased this DVD for the extra Jars of Clay material (DVD includes the video for the hit song \\"Collide\\"). The score was also written by Jars lead singer Dan Haseltine. However, after watching this film (This was the first movie of the Left Behind series I've ever seen), \\"refreshing\\" was the overall feeling. The story of the Alabama football team gives an overall inspiration similar to \\"Remember The Titans\\" and \\"The Rookie\\". After watching this, I'll have to check out the rest of the \\"Left Behind\\" series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Football Flick","review":"This is the ideal Family movie. Dads and sons will love it because it's Football! Wives will love it because it's something that can bring the whole family together.

The closest I have come was starting \\"Princess Charming\\" and then stopping it after three chapters because it did nothing to make me want to finish.I gave this novel a chance after a favorable review in the local paper. I stuck with it, hoping that it would get better. It did not. The protagonist is so annoying I found myself rooting against her at every turn, hoping she would wind up alone so she could continue to be miserable.

Mel, the main character, is a mean-spirited workaholic. Her magic change of character at the end of the book just wasn't believable. I disliked her through the book, and didn't like her better at the end. Why did Ethan like her, anyway? The only thing she seemed to have going for her was good hair and big boobs. Her personality was rotten.There was also a petty attitude regarding women paying alimony. Why shouldn't they? I was left wondering if Jane Heller got stuck with a nasty divorce settlement.I won't be rushing out to buy any new books from this author. Try the library for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breezy & fun","review":"This is my first Jane Heller novel. I enjoyed it quite a bit, so much so that I'll be looking up her other titles. The pacing was fast, but not at the expense of the dialogue which was snappy. I also enjoyed the references to Buster the pug - he was every bit a \\"main\\" character as the rest of them.

Determined to stop paying Dan alimony, she concocts with the help of her friends an improbable plan to find Dan a love interest. Dan falls in love with Leah Purcell. Melanie fails to see how much Evan, another resident in her building, is interested in her. Naturally, things turn out for the best, or do they? The ending leaves you hanging.

Don't need to reread what I ahve already read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guns of the Mountain Man","review":"Fans of the Last Mountain Man series will be very familiar with this book. It seems that a very large portion of this book has been copied from previous works. As readers have noticed in the last few volumes, Mr. Johnstone has been using the \\"cut and paste\\" appication of his word processor quite often. In this volume he raises it to an art form. The story line seems to be written only to join these exerpts togehter. One of these exerpts he even repeats. Maybe this is an indication that Mr. Johnstone is getting tired of this series. If so please just stop this series. Refuse to take more money from your publisher. Just end the series. (Or let it sit dormant for awhile.) The rating for this book should have been a quarter star but Amazon has a 1 star limit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disapointing","review":"I have read almost all the Mountain Man Series and for the most part have really enjoyed them. I guess if this book was the first one a person had read from the series it would be great. However, if it isn't you will be sorry to see so much repeated from the other books. It is obvious that Mr. Johnstone has made great use of a word processor to insert portions of other books, word for word in this book. It would be great if he would at least reword the text to make it interesting for the readers that have purchased many of the series books. It is no wonder Mr. Johnstone can publish so many books, if he uses many portions of past books to write them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poooooorrrr...","review":"Having seen 2 other movies from the Dolemite Collection and enjoyed them very much, i was really disappointed by this one. Mediocre Kung Fu, boring story and characters, and way too much screaming from the characters. Way too much screaming! Now in every Kung Fu movie there are the occasional \\"ha-ya\\" or \\"waaa\\" or any other assorment of vocals sounds, but in this movie it was as if the directors instructions were to \\"make the biggest most annoying shrilly high-pitched idiotic scream and act like total moron if possible\\" in each scene. Maybe that was just a problem with bad dubbing, but not even the best dubbing could save this shipwreck of a movie. The crazy guy was just annoying and not much of a comedic character.. and what else can i say... i got this movie [at a local store] on sale for 1 cent, and I can understand why it was on sale for so cheap...Go and get Hitman of the Buddha or Kung Fu vs. Yoga, from the same collection, but dont waste time on this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"packaging 5 stars, CD one star","review":"I love these mini LPs from Japan. I also love the Count Basie Band. But our friends from Japan messed this one up, and it is among the worst of this series. First, the original Roulette label used for the CD face is the orange and yellow edition, which is NOT the original red, yellow, blue & green bars over white label. Second, the sound is not the beautifully restored sounds you will get from the Mosiac Records box set. Instead, it is an older master which was used on the 1987-1988 Vogue releases from France. The biggest mistake is the the first two and a half beats of the song RAT RACE are MISSING! Hopefully (but I doubt it will happen) the Japanese company will re-release the ENTIRE line of Basie Roulette recordings (and Maynard too, please!) and get it right the second time around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Publish Your Poetry","review":"For those of us who write poetry we know there is not a very big market out there for poetry, and we also know the pay is not as well for poetry as it is for articles, books, and short stories. However, we still write poetry for many reasons, to write our feeling on paper, to express our thoughts and feelings, and more. And once we complete the poem, we must begin submitting to markets to publish the poem. This is where Helene Ciaravino's book (How To Publish Your Poetry) comes in handy.How To Publish Your Poetry will show you how to create an effective submission package, how to write a effective query letter and cover letter, and she will guide you step-by-step through what to do first.This book is a MUST for all poetry writers out there. If you are unsure on how to write an effective query letter for one poem, or for a book of poems, then this will show and tell you how. In addition, you will also learn a lot more to help you publish your poems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book on Watercolor Available!","review":"I consider myself an expert watercolorist, who is constantly in search of great inspiration and instruction. This book is, by far, the greatest book on watercolor technique available. The paintings are stunning and the technique is origional, simple, and effective. Several examples take you through a series of phases for acheiving a particular painting effect; while others are only accompanied by a simple explaination. This teaches the entire strategy in some instances, while leaving the reader to wonder about others.Buy this book, You will be able to refer to it for years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"No teaching involved in this book!","review":"If you want a book to learn from and instruction, don't buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teaches you nothing","review":"This book has no instruction that is usable.

It shows a BLACK guitar in the picture but what I got (when I finally got it) was the natural color guitar. Now, let's talk about what I got: I got a damaged natural color guitar. Yes, that's it. NO amp, NO gig bag, NO strap, NO tuner, NO cord, and NO picks. Yep, all I got was a damaged guitar. It DID say, on the box the guitar came in, \\"amp, gig bag, cord, strap, picks\\". I had to open it just to see the worlds smallest amp stuffed inside a guitar box, lol. After closer inspection, it was appearent that the guitar was damaged BEFORE it was boxed up. STAY AWAY for this product. Amazon really needs to rename this as JUST A GUITAR, NOTHING ELSE, and take the picture of the black guitar, amp, strap, cord, gig bag, and picks, out of the description. Amazon did give me a refund, minus $10.00 for some reason, and they did pay for return shiping. Hopefully I'll have better luck on a different product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Danger! Not a Bass Guitar","review":"If you look at the picture you'll see six tuners of an electric guitar.The body of the guitar is made of BASSwood and that is probably where they got the idea that this is a bass guitar. The neck is of a slim design and is a little too narrow for my fat fingers.The guitar is solid and sounds good, all-in-all a good set but not what is advertised!As a guitar I'd give it a 4.5, the poor rating is that it is NOT a bass guitar!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phoebe's take on one of the best stranglers albums","review":"After working in a record store for 6 years and coming from a family of musicians and music lovers alike I thought I had hearda great deal of good music,and then I discoverd this cd.Meninblack is one of the most innovative albims I have ever heard. Apparently when it was released in '81 it garnerd little fanfare and no 'hits'- not suprising, it was way ahead of it's time.Forget Tangerine Dream- this album pioneered techno while still being very much a rock album. The more I listen to it the more I love it,a must have for fans of Talking Heads,Gang of Four,Devo etc., notable tracks:'It's Like Nothing on Earth','Waiting for the Men in Black',and 'Manna Machine' which listens like a distant stare into space."},{"rating":"2","title":"favorite Stranglers record","review":"Been listening to this one for many years, never tire of it, always something new to hear. They conjure it all on this record with intensity and restraint. The songs are brilliant in a framework of their own, rather than any sort of \\"hook laden\\" pop/rock or punk style. The musicianship is masterful, almost neurotically precise drums and bass and lots of keyboard jumping around. The guitar playing is just insane, especially on tracks like \\"Nothing on Earth\\". Hugh delivers the vocals totally deadpan with at times a sort of fake east-european accent.

The prospects for a biowar started by the imperium in order to curve human populations seems to be the most startling concept that i had not realy payed much attention to before (though thought about it ouside the context of peak oil). This book has the ability to wake people up and get active in order to try and stop (or rather openly discuss a course of action in a participatory maner) the comeing abyss that our industrial society has moved ever so closs towards. I am thinking of buying extra copys to give to some friends who would be amazed at the volumes of research Mike Ruppert has put into this book, quite simply amazing!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read","review":"A must read book for those who realize the main stream media is not honest and want the truth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crossing The Rubicon","review":"For those who want a factual,well researched blow by blow of 911,this is the book for you. at over600 pages its still a page turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book !","review":"seems to have been researched very meticulosly...and presents very good arguments for most all of its suppositions"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whinning gossip distorts his teachers","review":"This is an entertaining book with a rare inside look at real Work groups, but unfortunately not the look you would want. Kherdian does the same kind of injustice to John Pentland that another reviewer reports he does to Ms. Stavely. Read the other review for his distortion of Stavely. Members who were in the same group with Kherdian under John Pentland tell a different slant to Kherdian's account. Kherdian is preserving his ego with this book and rejecting the efforts of his teachers precisely at the point where it could do him the most good. When it starts getting personal, he can't handle it. This book does an injustice to unsuspecting readers who might think this is an honest and accurate account. They may find themselves unnecessarily discouraged. There is little real school available in the world as it is without undermining what little there is. If Kherdian couldn't give a fair account, he should have kept his mouth shut."},{"rating":"1","title":"book by Gurdjieff's \\"grandson\\"","review":"The author blows his credibility right from the start by trying to call himself a grandson of Gurdjieff!The contents of the book are just not worth reading - unless you like pure fiction - or a good laugh.Why call yourself somebody's \\"grandson\\" if in fact you are not related to the person concerned?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An admirable collection","review":"This collection brings together the early years of the King on stage.

The vast numbers of each of the species featured is impressive by themselves. Of course, you get interesting info on all these species. The male elephant seals fighting for the right to a harem until they are a bloody mess while disinterested penguins look on is particularly memorable.Unfortunately, this is only 35 minutes long. As good as this documentary is, it could have been much better with additional analyses and commentary. The cost of a DVD will be too high for many to justify this short piece. However, this is a solid nature documentary and well worth watching. I certainly recommend it for libraries, etc., where frequent watching will justify the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"It really is for only 1 plate- beware!

Who would order 1 plate? A single plate has a value of less then $1. Silly me for thinking I was getting a good deal, but Amazon should be embarrassed to list this as an 80% savings over the normal $69 price.

While the song isn't bad by a longshot, it's far from the best song on her album(try 'Hot Like Fire' or 'A Little Bit), and the So-So Def Remix actually detracts from the original's appeal(it's actually laughable)--she needs to quit trying for street cred and focus on finding some good songs to distinguish her sound.

I would have liked to have read more about her relationship with her children with Paul (many mentions of Heather), but just the fact that Mr. Fields wrote how wonderful they were, polite, and not at all what you would expect from \\"rock children\\", told me a lot.

Later in the book, she has examples of people who were rejected & verbally abused by one parent or the other, and they turned out to be gay. The implication is that people become gay because of the rejection or acceptance of a parent -- a theory so ridiculously out of date and preposterous I can't believe it could be stated with a straight face.

Phoebe, the main character, was superbly written complete with flaws and she was very easy to relate to. At the beginning, I got a little tired of hearing Phoebe complain about her weight, however since most of us women are guilty of dwelling on our appearances every once in a while, Phoebe dwelling on her physical flaws was realistic. As a movie lover myself, I enjoyed all the references to movies.The thing I really enjoyed about this book was its excellent message.

It was also refreshing to see Phoebe grow through all her trials and tribulations. I raced through this book and enjoyed every word. Now I can hardly wait for Phoebe Dreaming in Technicolor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Big Disappointment from Todd","review":"Well, I like Todd Rundgren as well as the next feller, but this warmed-over leavins doesn't add much to my appreciation for Todd or the Nazz, which in it's day was a truly mind-bending band, touring all over the US of A and UK, and bringing together the stellar talents of massive chopster drummmeister Thom Mooney, who went on to play with just about everybody including John Hiatt, Roger McGuinn, and Rita Coolidge, as well as Disney dropout Carson, Plumber Stewkey...you get the idea; these guys had a great band, and the best of that is distilled into Nazz and Nazz Nazz; number three is flabby and this one is just pitiful, with distortion, weak out-takes, and songs that didn't make the cut. Do yourselves a favor and go for numbers one and two, you can't go wrong!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No David- YES to a great book","review":"No David is a great book for kids. My daughter always laughs when we read the book- and that is almost daily. I used to also read it in school and even my primary kids thought it's funny.I can highly recommend other children's books by David Shannon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute book~","review":"My 3yr old Loves this book. It is a fun book to read with wonderful illistrations. It shows children that no matter how much trouble they get into, mommy always loves them :) My son likes for me to change David's name to his name when we are reading it because my son is my lil trouble maker :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"cute","review":"Very cute little book.

A wonderful addition to any toddler's library."},{"rating":"2","title":"read over and over again","review":"This book was given as a gift from a close friend and I've read it several times to my three year old and it has become his ultimate favorite. It leaves alot to the imagination showing pictures of things David is doing wrong and I get to add my own comments. It changes every time we read it. My eighteen month old now loves it also"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have!","review":"What a delightful book! I have a three year old and a 22 month old grandson who could be poster-boys for this book!! It was the first non-dinosaur book my 3 year old would even allow me to read to him. He made me read it some 10 times to begin with. After that he was reading it himself, outloud. The 22 month old was almost as facinated....( probably because he hears the word \\"no\\" on a regular basis!). I would recommend this wonderfully illustrated book to anyone who has a 2-4 year old in their family. My daughter, my sister and I have given copies to our friends with boys in this age range."},{"rating":"2","title":"No, David!","review":"I bought this book for my three year old grandson, Kevin. Now, when we say ,\\"No, Kevin!\\", he says ,\\"No, David!\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginning readers!","review":"I was amused by this book, and its companion, David Goes To School, when I saw them in the bookstore. I didn't realize just what a smart purchase they would turn out to be. These books have caught the interest of even the most reluctant readers in my first grade class. They have memorized the text and all want to read it to the \\"little kids.\\" It has them working on all the skills they need to transfer to other texts--pointing to each word as they say it, using beginning sounds, etc. The words are ones that they have experienced personally, and the pictures are just gross enough to appeal to any not-so-happy-to-be-in-school first grade boy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a positive influence","review":"I have a child developmental disagreement with this story. I feel that it is very negative with all the \\"bad\\" things children do. Even if his mom still loves him in the end. A whole book about saying \\"No\\", which does not help children feel positive and learn the best way to act in life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really didn't like it","review":"My 3 year old son, David, received this book for Christmas last year, and was not only scared by the horrific pictures, but cried because he thought we were talking about him when we read it. The entire book is only about a bad little kid named David who is drawn with scary sharp teeth and a very big mouth. The last page of the book, showing that the mother still loves David after he's been bad, doesn't even start to make up for the rest of the book. I don't recommend this book for small children, as there is nothing funny about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trouble has a new name.","review":"David Shannon, No, David! (Blue Sky Press, 1998)The David books are something special indeed, and for the life of me I can't figure out why. I mean, come on, those illustraions are downright terrifying! But my son loves them (it could of course be because his name is David), and so do I. They're funny as anything, and Shannon's text is both simple enough to be easily understood by the pre-lit set and is integrated strongly with the illustrations--there's enough for a basic description, but in order to fully get it, the child has to grasp (or the parent has to explain, which I think would defeat the purpose) the cause-and-effect relationship between the text and the picture. The series is, and will remain, a mainstay at our house. ***"},{"rating":"2","title":"No David","review":"Very happy with this product. Great pictures. Bought it to show my son,David, who is deployed in Afghanistan, and to let him know we are thinking of him. LOL"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing enjoyable in this story!","review":"Just another in a long line of books that purport to be \\"modern\\" when, in fact, what they are is offensive. Any real child who behaved as David does would be spending a lot of time in his room! For an even more miserable read, try \\"David Goes to School,\\" the perfect illustration of every teacher's worst nightmare. You won't find these books on the shelf in MY classroom..."},{"rating":"1","title":"uh oh, No Lahli","review":"I am not sure which book of this series was read in my 3 year old's preschool class, but after reading these books we had to take a trip to the ER. I did not know my daughter was reading these books in school and she said she stuck something up her nose like David... well, after sitting and waiting at the ER for 2 hours we found out that she had stuck a screw up her noise. Teachers, please make sure your students know that these are things you really should not do. Otherwise you may have a very worried parent in the Emergency Room who is not accepting of the book choices you are making... make sure it is age appropriate, please."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves to read this book to me","review":"This is a book of a few words that kids understand immediately. I spend so much time saying \\"No\\" to my son, it's nice to have him say \\"No\\" back to me and he's reading a book. He enjoyes the most the picture of David running naked!!! It's a book that he can read to me and he's almost 2!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great book for preschoolers.","review":"Once my daughter (and I) got past the horribly demonic pictures in this book, we both came to love it. It is all about David and his mom - locked in the eternal struggle between a parent and a preschooler. It is truly a battle of wills and David Shannon has shed a very funny (and relatable) light on that battle.I only gave it 4 stars because I truly hate the pictures in this book. They are actually pretty disturbing to young kids and to anyone who finds sharp vampire teeth a turnoff in a kids' book character. I know they are a Shannon trademark, but I would definitely prefer a more normal looking kid.Overall a fabulous book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book for teaching \\"bad\\" behavior!","review":"We bought this book just after my son's third birthday. The book quickly made it into the \\"top ten\\" for bedtime reading. However, he also quickly started copying most of the \\"David\\" behaviors in the book. Long after the book was \\"lost\\", he would still scream \\"I want to run down the street naked!\\", and to this day (over a year later), he still jams his finger up his nose to the second joint. Hey, I've got an idea -- how about a humorous book about all the things you can do with matches, or maybe knives?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No! NO! NO!","review":"Too negative and I still don't like it!!This book is overly simple and dreadful. If you feel like you haven't said \\"no\\" enough times in a day then this book is for you. Uninspiring. Save your money I'll tell you how the no book ends, \\"I still love you.\\" Scary pictures and pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"How incredibly disturbing","review":"I'm really not sure what bothers me more, this book with absolutely nothing redeemable in it, or all the rave reviews from parents saying that their child hears \\"NO!\\" as much as this poor child in the book. I read each page, waiting for something to explain the award, but got through the end of the book dumbfounded. As far as I can tell this book is a story about a child with bad behavior which is reinforced by parents with bad parenting techniques. And \\"David Gets in Trouble\\" appears to be about a boy who eventually becomes racked with guilt after being allowed by his parents to avoid taking responsibility for his mistakes. I honestly do not see any message in these books that I would like for my child to learn.I will admit that my 2 year old loved the book, but he also might enjoy eating cake three meals a day... doesn't mean I am going to let him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, \\"No David!\\"","review":"I am ordering this book to show staff and adult students, at my pre-schools, an inappropriate book for toddlers and pre-schoolers. If a child did not exhibit these behaviors before, they got plenty of good ideas! The title, content and back cover is negative reinforcement. The mother seems powerless and the child, terrified to be out of control. No effort, other than sleep, was made to illustrate remediation. The image of a child running naked down a road is particularly worrisome. This book was brought to my attention by a family whose child continues to exhibit all of David's behaviors."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Different Opinion","review":"I was disappointed by this book. I found the drawings unappealing, which left very little to like since the story is so text poor. The depicted situations are more disturbing than amusing, and the ending, apparently meant to be reassuring, struck me as perfunctory and insincere. Anyone who heard a lot of \\"NO\\" while growing up and wants to provide his or her child with a better experience should think twice about buying this book. Why it won the Caldecott is a mystery to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely WRONG for children","review":"This book is simply WRONG to read to a child. There is zero positive reinforcement. Page after page of David acting like a nightmare and at the end of the book all she says is I love you. Disturbing this book has won an award."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible message","review":"this book is awful. it shows a message of how evil a little boy is with sharp teeth and mad eyes and that little boys who do these things are bad. this is not a healthy way to view the raising of a child and i feel it gives children the message that they are bad. i tossed it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapprove book","review":"This book is pretty negative. It shows a small child constantly failing. At the very end, he does one thing correct and is praised that one time. Also, David is illustrated a little evil looking. Children should not be portrayed as evil. In a world where children are expected to act as adults, this book shows little give for making mistakes and being accepted for them. More positive situations should have been added."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTHING BUT A BARE BOTTOM","review":"I have read this book aloud several times to kids at home and at school and find that the only thing of real interest there to the kids to whom I have read it is a bare-bottomed David running down the street.Time to return to more classic children literature like Blueberries for Sal, The Biggest Bear or Where the Wild Things Are. Better stories, illustrations and staying power."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"My boyfriends daughter loved this book the first time I read it to her. She is 6 years old and after I read it to her she then read it back to me and reads it almost every night, if not once a week. She also brought it to school and read it to her first grade class. I would definetly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Children book","review":"Product was just as what seller say, however it took a long time to arrive..

THEY JUST KEEP SAYING DAVID BE QUIET! NO DAVID! IS SOOO CUTE, THIS BOOK IS WORTH YOUR TIME AND MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this win an award?","review":"I got this book for my 3 year old because they read it at preschool. I'll sometimes pick up books that they've read at preschool so that we can also read them at home. It's obviously just my very minority opinion, but this book is terrible. The pictures are quite harsh, and it's just page after page of poor David doing things and getting yelled at. My son was actually somewhat worried about the fish on the cover. 'Mommy, those fish look really worried... will they be okay?' Sorry, but there are way too many excellent children's books out there to add this to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"In The Minority","review":"I realized before I purchased this book it was for an older age group. My son is 2 1/2. However, after reading the reviews from others who have 2 year olds and raved about the book, I felt comfortable in ordering it. I, like all parents of toddlers, understand the trouble they get into and thought this book would be fun. When I first looked at it, I was a taken back by the pictures and thought David looked, quite frankly, demonic. I showed my son with a smile on my face and enthusiasm, but, he too also just stared at the pages with a blank stare not sure how to react. At the end of the book he told me \\"scary\\" and to put it away. That's exactly what I've done and will find an older child who will enjoy this book. As for our family, No David, gets a big thumbs down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and with a good message!","review":"My son has had this book as his favorite for more than half of his life. He's two now. He already has some 50 books, and this is his favorite, and mine too! While reading this book to him, he laughs and repeats \\"No, David\\" when David does things he's not supposed to. Afterwards, I only need to remind him of what is No, David and he understands. Interestingly, it seems as if some other (adult?) reviewers here understand the message less than he does. Regardless, it is one of the best books we own and I would recommend it to any intelligent child and parent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I saw this book at the library (before buying it). There are very little words on the pages. The pictures are cute, but I don't think it's worth buying the book. I read it to my 2 1/2 year old daughter and she didn't really care about it; it did not keep her attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend for sensitive younger children","review":"Just say NO! to buying this book as a gift! We just received this book as a birthday present. My son who is almost 4 was totally upset from it. It is a horrible choice for young children who are sensitive. There are much more positive creative books to purchase such as those by Oliver Jeffers. I would not recommend it as a gift choice and would screen as an option for young children, as parents and child alike do not expect some of the negative illustrations. We were disappointed by all the hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"No, David","review":"My 4 yr old grandaughter loves this book and it's fun to read as well. Recommend it to anyone who has an active 4 yr old or older."},{"rating":"2","title":"We all love No, David!","review":"I absolutely LOVE No, David! The story is very simple but it is exciting to read and the illustrations are hillarious! David is a little boy who seems to always be getting in trouble. From getting into the cookie jar, to overflowing the bathtub, and finally playing baseball in the house, David is full of mischief. But he is also full of love, and so is his mom when she is able to finally catch him in a quiet moment. My favorite part is when David dresses up as a super hero- he reminds me of my crazy brother. You should DEFINATELY read this book, I love it and so do my 2nd graders!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Toddler fight over this book!","review":"I recently had to take this book away from my son (almost 2) and a 3 year old boy who I was watching. They both share well, generally, but this book was just too coveted by each them. They both wanted to have it! I had to take it away so they wouldn't rip it.This book is frequently requested to be read. And re-read. I get tired of it but these little kids LOVE it. The three year old pre-reads it to himself, too. I almost thought he could read until the 5th page in when I verified that he couldn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"We have all his books now","review":"My daughter (20mos.) started out with this book, and had to take it with her EVERYWHERE. We soon graduated to the rest of Shannon's books in the No David series, ( including Alice the Fairy), and she absolutely loves all of them. They are hilarious and the pics are great for small children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative and scary pictures for little kids - not for preschool and under","review":"I dislike this book; it is negative and I think the pictures are a bit scary for little kids (David has sharp pointy teeth). The book shows David doing naughty things (things my preschooler wouldn't even think of doing until this book put ideas in her head), then the adult goes to the child and yells \\"NO DAVID!!\\" Which to me is sending the wrong message; THEN when David gets put into the corner he is crying and upset there isn't anything for resolution of the emotional and behavior issue. There isn't enough information for a child to understand anything other than \\"NO DAVID!!!\\" and that the child does naughty things. I don't believe in throwing books away, but this one was almost hard just to give away. There is no lesson of love, mistakes made and forgiveness - just yelling at your kid and them either acting out more or crying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite book in our elementary class","review":"No, David is the favorite book in our 1st and 2nd grade class because it is so funny. The children laugh out loud at the pictures. Plus, it is a great beginning reader! The children liked it so much that I bought it for my six year old granddaughter, and as she read it she laughed out loud too, and was completely delighted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"Yes, there are (many) times to tell your child \\"no!\\" but you also need to explain WHY you are saying it. This book just shows David being a kid, doing things he obviously finds fun, but being told \\"no\\".....then having a time-out and then being told he's loved. Weird book....."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is great for adults too!!!","review":"I'm a 25yr old man with no kids, and I just happened to pick up this book in the bookstore because I loved the colors on the cover.

I highly recommend this book to those with an individual in their life child or an adult who doesn't understand the meaning of \\"NO!\\" The artwork is delightful and captivating and is the type of book that will be well treasured on the shelf to be read again and again.

But at only ..., more than half the price of the Onkyo, this Aiwa was a far better value. The sound is very good, especially when listening to Dolby Digital and DTS encoded DVDs. Pro Logic is great, as well, but 2-channel sound is lacking. One of the best features here is the Super T-Bass system, which dramtically improves the bass if you're not using a powered sub.

All it talks about how this part Chincoteague part Thoroughbred becomes a superstar like all of the horse books that are written now. It is like no duh the horse is going to win because the horse is the main character of the book! And, what kind of nickname is \\"Twi\\"? It's downright stupid. I just hated this book and I can not believe that some many people actually like this book. I think that the best illustration was when the ugly rat had her ribs sticking out. The worst was when she was doing all of the dressage moves. I mean, they only teach those moves at the Spanish Riding School, so Rat should not know them, especially a near perfect capriole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incomplete Story","review":"I had never known that Misty's Twilight had originally been a cutting horse with a rodeo bronc attitude problem.

I had to wait 58 minutes for the first Lesbian encounter. Not like I expected a porno flick...but please....arouse me! The film has a good twist if you're willing to wait for the end of the movie. Not a great movie if you're looking for a lot of Lesbian bedroom scenes. This one isn't it.

The maps aren't much help--they have little detail, so correspond only very broadly with the mileage logs.

One good thing about the book are hill profiles which are hard to find on the internet. The hill profiles don't exactly match the map routes, but it gives you more of a general idea of the day's ride.I would recommend this book as a supplement to help you plan your tour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nioxin Shampoo","review":"Nioxin System 3 for fine hair is an excellent shampoo for fine hair particularly in summer when humidity is a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Really Works!","review":"I've been using the product for several months now.

It exudes a sense of great balance and at the same time of depth that is unique. And I believe Garrick Ohlsson is attuned to these qualities in Chopin's Preludes and Nocturnes. The piano's timber is excellent and the general audio quality, warm and just ritht.

Yes, the on-off button was on (the mouse lit up as advertised, and worked for a few minutes, and that was it.

Turn it off, turn it on, no effect. Bang it a bit, sometimes it works, most of the time it doesn't. I don't know if this is an inherent defect or a problem with this particular mouse. But it's not worth returning it, so it's in the trash can now.2) Why is this called a \\"notebook\\" mouse. It's nearly as large as a regular mouse. Yes, the dimensions are listed, so fine. But it's too pudgy to use in the small space you usually buy a \\"notebook\\" mouse for.3) The Marketplace vendor seems to have had this package sitting in a warehouse gathering dust or getting knocked around, because it certainly doesn't look new despite being advertised as new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome mouse!","review":"I purchased this mouse for my MacBook I recently bought and I couldn't be more happier with it. It's very comfortable and responsive. I just took it out the package, inserted the included batteries, plugged in the USB receiver, and was using it in seconds! I also like the feature of sliding the USB receiver onto the base of the mouse when I'm not using it since it activates a switch that turns the mouse off to preserve battery life. This also makes it very efficient for traveling since I don't have to hunt for the mouse and the USB receiver separately - they're hooked together. Very nice! Also, when I remove the USB receiver...the mouse automatically comes on & is ready for use.So, I highly recommend this peripheral if you're looking for a portable mouse for your notebook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good mouse, good price","review":"This mouse works just fine on both my Dell PC at work, and my Mac laptop at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for Mac, Crashed my PC","review":"Works perfect with my macbook, so I bought another one for my other laptop, an HP entertainment PC.

I would gladly buy a copy of the first edition if available.The first edition is an invaluable tool for orchid growers interested in the cultural requirements and ecology of these beautiful plants. The second edition is even better. I rate the second edition over the books of Lance Birk, Catherine Cash and Guido Braem for both the casual pap grower as well as expert growers.The diatribe by the anonymous 'Reader from New York' is totally unwarranted (sounds as thought it was written by a minion of Guido Braem, whose disagreements with Crib are well known in orchid curcles)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good reference guide for the beginner","review":"The illustrations are wonderful and suitable for framing in my opinion.

An amateurish writing. Cribb, whose initial PhD thesis is in the cultivated potatos of South America, has made every effort to make this writing credible. His lack of first hand experience in this field comes very clearly through in this book. His ideads are often out-dated, and he is totally out of touch with today's realities. He is often totally dependent on information given to him by others, without proper examination of harberium material in details. His conservation ideas are in extreme, unreal, and often tunnel-visioned singlarly.Contrary to his social status, Cribb needs many years of experience before being able to warite ably on such a specialized topic.A good try for an eager novice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Music and Medicine... what a way to heal!!!","review":"I heard some of the cuts on this CD over a year ago in the home of a friend..I had no idea it was my host singing and performing.

It was written in the 1950's, published by Ace and reads like a modest first draft in need of revisions.The author constructs a detailed framework to hang an uninteresting tale of inter-planet stratagems. What really exasperating are the possibilities inherent in the plot that are not developed.The saga is pure space opera; two planets vie to control a third to increase wealth and power. One of the planets is dominated in it's physical and religious aspect by an enormous tree; an idea ripe with possibilities that is discarded after a few tantalizing paragraphs. Fortunately for the reader Vance's extraordinary imagination shines through in spots preventing this book from being a total loss.Fans of Vance should read these early novels to appreciate the maturity in later books.

I purchased the mower in spring 2004 and have had ZERO problems, ZERO maintenance and ZERO hassles for the last 5 (yes, five!) mowing seasons. The original blade is dull and needs to be sharpened, so I've decided to purchase a replacement and have two blades on hand. I'm glad I chose the corded version of the mower. The rechargeable battery model would likely need a replacement battery by now too. I highly recommend this mower for small yards with minimal obstacles.Pros: Lightweight, easy for a woman to maneuver, easy to clean with a broom, easy to raise and lower mowing deck. The handle switch works flawlessly, every time. One hour of mowing every week doesn't even make a blip on my electric bill.Cons: After 2 years of weekly mowing, the paint on the handle was worn off completely.

Ran beautifully, easy to maneuver, cord a minor nuisance I could easily live with. Second time out, still loved it. Third time, the love started to diminish, as the slightest bump would jostle it enough to drop it to the lowest cutting level, effectively scalping the lawn. Fourth time out, it died 1/3 of the way through the job. I thought maybe it was jammed, cleared out some clippings, but no luck restarting. I'll try it again, see if it can be repaired, but if this one requires replacement I would not choose this mower again. Next time I'll choose either a cordless or gas model...the cord isn't so bad during the mowing process, but it's surprisingly heavy to lug around."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's hot s...","review":"I've been a huge fan of Sean's music since 1996 back in the caribbean.I just knew that it was only a matter of time until he gained some recognition in the U.S.Way to go Sean.Shev."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Track of 2002","review":"Sean Paul has never been a good rapper.

Another reason why this album is better than Straight Outta Compton is the production.

The story is suspenseful, fastpaced, and reminds me of a mix between Alistair MacLean and John le Carre set in an SF universe. Haldemans descriptions of violence are, perhaps because of his history in the military, very lifelike, and succeeds in making you feel the shock and surprise that only reallife violence can {check out the boatscene with the exploding head}. I can only say READ IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sci Fi Classic","review":"Buying time is another strong classic sf novel by Haldeman. A lot of the technology seems dated now, looking back, but a lot of it still exceeds what we have today, which is amazing. His ability to put together plausible futures is close to unparalleled. Like a lot of Heinlein novels, Haldeman's early books more than hold up today if you can imagne them as \\"future history\\" that never actually happened. He's short on character but long on ideas and action. There is also always great scenery. Following the heroes through their adventures are always a lot of fun as they bounce from one strange city to another, not always on Earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Dracula\\" Sequel Lacks Bite","review":"Plagued by production delays, endless rewrites and Hays Office censorship, \\"Dracula's Daughter\\" (1936) remains among the lesser Universal chillers. Even worse, it's a \\"Dracula\\" sequel without Bela Lugosi - who was paid $4,000 for NOT appearing in this belated follow-up to the 1931 classic. Lambert Hillyer's atmospheric direction cannot mask a bloodless film that emphasizes comedy over terror. Worth seeing once for Gloria Holden's performance in the title role and Edward Van Sloan's welcome return as Van Helsing. A disappointing end to Universal's first horror cycle."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"You know, this is the first woman's flat I've been in that didn't have at least 20 mirrors in it...\\"","review":"Picking up the story literally moments after the events of the first \\"Dracula\\" starring Bela Lugosi, DRACULA'S DAUGHTER (1936) has always held a fascination, largely thanks to Gloria Holden's nuanced performance in the title role.Countess Marya Zaleska (Holden) is a beautiful member of the aristocracy with a dangerous secret; fits of uncontrollable bloodlust and the need to stalk and kill pretty young girls...not to mention a biological link to the old Count you-know-who. The sexual ambiguity of the Countess adds lots of dark layers in this moodily-lit horror favourite. The performances are very strong, particularly Otto Kruger, Marguerite Churchill and Irving Pichel as the Countess' menacing servant. Gloria Holden's subtle performance in the title role is a marvel to witness.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Down South Hustlers","review":"This is the best Rap album of all time!

She must have been really desperate for rent money to agree to do that on film. I will admit that there are a few funny scenes,but not enough to be worth buying the movie. It's filled with bad mobster dialogue and a plot that goes nowhere. Any Anthony Michael Hall fans that want to see this movie because he's listed as being in it, don't bother. You'll see his name in the credits and the top of his head for one split second (if you don't blink during that scene), that's it.

It also explores other animals and what life without pigmentation, camouflage, etc. is like for them.Its African narrator adds a fresh dimension to the film by blending the science with local lore.

Sadly, the reception still wasnt any better than my Samsung. So, I called a friend to test the phone out, albeit good clear reception, but a horrible feedback from the speaker phone.

Some six months after purchase the #2 doesn't work, it has always lost signal in places where other people have signal and the button to change the ringer volume or to set it to vibrate gets caught on things or comes under my fingers when talking causing it to change at inopportune times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality phone","review":"I would not reccomend anyone buy this phone. The receive signal strength is very low compared to other Sprint phnoes I have used. It tends to drop calls and allow calls to roll directly to voice mail. The battery life is not nearly what is advertised. This phone sucks down all of the battery with only a few phone calls. It will not last me a full business days worth of calls. I estimate the actual talk time is about 1-1/2 hours without using Ready Link or the net. Ready Link kills the battery very quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"not happy at all","review":"Maybe I just had bad luck with this phone but I would not buy it again. I think it has some sort of a switch problem, After 5 months the outside screen just stopped working. And then because the switch wasn't working, when I closed the phone, the inside screen would stay on all the time and drain my battery. Sprint replaced it with another RL-7300, and after 2 months the second phone stopped working in the exact same way. Sprint advertises this phone as being \\"rugged\\" and I feel it's not. I take care of my phone so I don't believe these phones stopped working through any fault of mine. My old Samsung lasted 2 1/2 years. I'm considering buying a Samsung again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great phone, but sorry speaker phone...","review":"Great phone, but has its defects. I mainly purchased this phone because it's a flip phone with a speaker phone (I get tired holding the phone up to my ear, and I hate ear pieces). By my experience and of two other owners of the same phone, the speaker phone works poorly. You can hear the caller talking nice and loud but they cannot hear you. Most of the time I had to turn off the speaker phone and just use it normally. I took my phone phone back in exchange for the Sanyo 4500 hoping it doesn't have the same problem. If you plan to buy this phone for the speaker as I did, save your time and money and look for another phone.

When my old electric mower died after 20 years, I ordered this one. In the MM275's first use, my right palm was pinched at least 4 or 5 times by the dead-man's switch lever (and I was never pinched by my old one). The lever is just too small and cheap, but is the perfect size to provide pretty healthy pinches. The handle doesn't fold, so moving it in and out of the basement is cumbersome. And, the front edge of the mower is at least 6 inches away from the blade, making it impossible to cut close to anything in front of the mower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodbye gas mower.....forever :-)","review":"I had this mower out of the box and cutting my grass in 15 minutes flat. I thought the cord would be a nuisance but it's not because I don't have a lot of grass to cut. This mower is light enough for me to maneuver with one arm. The mulching feature works great and the mower cuts the grass evenly and neatly. It is very quiet too which is really a big plus. Unless I had a lot of grass to cut I would probably never buy a gas mower again. I'm glad my wife talked me into trying this mower. My old gas mower was starting to act up and starting it was becoming a nuisance. No more fiddling with the carburetor and getting gas all over my hands.

It is quiet; the undercarriage stays clean, it cuts grass uniformly, and it is light and easy to move.Its only slight flaw is that it bogs down a bit in taller grass. It's not bad enough to affect how the mower cuts, but it does seem to labor when the grass is just a little higher than a week's worth of growth is on it. However, it seems to chew up sticks it encounters rather well, and it mulches perfectly, so perhaps this is just a mild flaw.I think, given it to do over again, I would have gotten the 12 amp version of this one instead. Otherwise, it is a great little mower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"We bought this mower about two years ago. I was cutting our grass this evening when suddenly the mower quit.

Granted the quality of this product is in fact quite good so I won't give it a one star review, but the concept is totally brain damaged. Whoever thought that tethering a lawnmower to a wall outlet was a good idea obviously hasn't thought it through very much- imagine going over your entire yard with a vacuum cleaner- yeah, it's that bad. The cord will invariably get caught on something and constantly gets in the way of the user requiring them to cast it away every 8 or so feet, and of course the possibility of getting electrocuted for running the damn thing over just makes it even worse. This product is really only suitable for very small yards with very few or no obstacles, though if you have a yard like that then you're better off buying a high quality manual lawn mower - there's so much less to go wrong and it'll last longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Go","review":"We enjoy several Black and Decker yard tools.

So just sit right back and saver the visual poetry and the technique that went into it all. The real Star is Robinson, forget about Harold Young. He was just some untalented hack director who got the job becasue Universal couldn't afford to hire any of the big-guns...u know like James Whale, Edgar G. Ulmer, Robert Siodmak..ect ect. Altold, on a pictorial stand-point, The Mummy's Tomb ranks as one on Universal's best looking chillers of the 1940's.

The other thing about this movie is the fact that it is a review of what has happened in all this past time.And as the killings slowly come to an end, the priest commanding Kharis is simply murdered by a gunshot, not because he betrays Kharis. I don't know why it is so, but it always seems better when the priests are killed by betraying Kharis.

The first year the switch broke. By the second year, the brushes were worn out and needed to be replaced. Each time the wait for parts took 3-4 weeks and I had to borrow a mower repeatedly from a friend while I waited. Luckily I live in a big city and there were actually authorized repair shops only about 20 minutes away. If you don't, you my be in for an unpleasant surprise when you need service. I have spoken to customer service at Black and Decker several times and received conflicting information about the warranty and whether such fast wear on the brushes is normal. The warranty is up in a few weeks and then I will have to pay for the next fix myself. I don't know if I will pay to repair it or pitch it out. I thought these electric's would be less trouble than gasoline engines, but I was very wrong about this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap in both price and quality","review":"What I like about this mower: It's lightweight and quiet compared to gas mowers. It's very easy to assemble, so you can get to mowing within minutes. Unfortunately, the cons outweigh the pros. The area where the electrical cord attaches to the mower is loose and in an area prone to pulling during regular mowing. This means that the cord is constantly coming loose, cutting off power to the mower. Also, the motor seems very weak. The grass in my small yard was about 3 to 4 inches long when I used this mower. It often folded down blades of grass rather than cutting them, resulting in the need to mow over the same areas multiple times. Whenever the grass seemed even slightly denser, the motor seemed to struggle, making a lower sound and leaving more blades uncut. Although my yard is only about 20 feet by 10 feet, I was very frustrated by the time I got finished. In short, this felt more like a toy mower than the real thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice mower, height adjustment lever didn't hold.","review":"My unit keeps dropping to the lowest height.

I agree that the cord becomes something to manage and probably adds about 10 minutes to mowing my lawn, but this is the first mower I've ever bought. From seeing my neighbors deal with their gas mowers, my little electric one is a great conversation starter. It is powerful enough to mow my lowcountry 0.6 acre lawn, including some lagoon frontage.

One good tip is, make sure u start cutting grass from closer to outlet and work ur way out that way u wont tangle with cord.this is a good little toy for ur home and cheaper than gas mower and BETTER TOO! it so light, its like using a vacuum on ur grass.

Best of all, I can start it every single time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent little, but powerful, mower","review":"I bought this mower six months ago and it is exactly what I needed. For a small, California lawn, it is ideal. My neighbors stand and watch as I use it -- perhaps they've never before seen a woman of mature age whisking around on her lawn, pushing mower with one hand, holding cord with other? All with only a lovely purring sound from the little dream machine, rather than the roar of gas-powered mowers in our all-too-adjacent California yards. The convenience factor is fabulous -- just squeeze the handle and you're underway. To create my own \\"mulching\\" effect, I followed the suggestion of a previous reviewer (thank you, kind soul) and simply make a few rounds in the opposite direction from the mowing direction, after I finish, thereby cutting through any residual clipping residue. My lawn benefits from the mulch and I don't have to bother with raking or bag emptying. To sum it up: this mower is a little champ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"My husband was reluctant to buy this mower but I talked him into it ordering it from Amazon because of the affordable price and free shipping. It was delivered to our doorstep 2 days later. It is so much easier to use than our old gas-powered mower--it is lightweight, starts with the flip of the switch on the handle and adjusting the mower height is a breeze, even allowing us to mow our small hillside of euonamous ground cover. I have learned that I can manage the extension cord by mowing on the diagonal-- the cord stays to either the right or left with no crossing over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just dandy!","review":"This electric mower is just the thing I needed for mowing close to the foundation of my house, around shrubbery and curb-side mowing. I plan my cutting route so that the cord is usually behind me and it works out fine for me. No need to use the weed-eater in most instances after I've used my electric mower, which is a plus. Just hop on the lawn tractor and away I go!! And I love products by Black and Decker. Made in the USA and great prices. Have had the mower for 3+ years now, and no problems with it at all.

Nice and light, easy to turn, can be guided with one hand. Really love the way it starts and stops. It's the best ever! Lawn cutting is average. It leaves some blades standing (4-5 per row), and because it's so light, it's hard to make straight lines. Messing with the cord is kind of a pain, but I expected that, and you should, too. It's pretty much what I expected from an electric mower, and it is a LOT quieter than my rickety old gas mower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"I like this lawn mower.

This model has an adjustment for height of mowing. As always, the plug-in for the electric cord is solid (especially when compared to some I saw at a big box store).I do most of the mowing (female, over 60) and find the machine light enough to be manageable, but sturdy enough to be dependable.With free shipping from Amazon, it's a much better product for the money than what could be purchased locally."},{"rating":"1","title":"its too bulky","review":"I had this mower for a long time.

Now granted, with electric you give up brute power, as compared to gas, but you can work around that by adjusting the height up for tall grass, then cutting twice. Also, these do work best without a catcher mounted on the side. Looks nice, light weight, smooth running.

When it arrived today, the exterior of the box was in rough shape, which of course could have been due to shipping. But when I opened the box it appeared to have been shipped (and rejected) before. The mower had obviously been removed and haphazardly thrown back into the box. The handle and other parts had scratches, and the manual was actually folded and placed in a crevice next to one of the wheels, with no plastic cover. In fact, there was no sign of any of the usual excessive packaging (plastic bags, crumpled paper) at all, another sure sign it had been opened before.While I don't mind ordering an open box on occasion, as I have with Amazon, I do expect the fact to be disclosed and to receive the discount.

Black and Decker would not honor their 2 year warranty. It would have cost me more than the original cost of the lawnmower to repair it.So I gave Black and Decker a second chance. I purchased a LM175 lawnmower to replace the one that they would not grant a warranty settlement to. Incredibly the first time I mowed the lawn it began to smoke. Smoke poured out of the mower and nearly caught the grass on fire.Since Black and Decker has been making their lawnmowers in Mexico, the quality has really deteriorated.

Now, the biggest test was what my power pumped skeptical husband was going to think. Well he gave it two big thumbs up! Easy start up and easy to push (very light). We have a very hilly yard and my husband was using one hand the whole time (which is good because the only drawback to electric is the cord). We got a 100ft extension cord, which was fine for our medium yard. not sure I'd want to drag around a cord on a big yard, but we really haven't found it a problem.

I have called Black and Decker and they instructed to to a repair shop which is an hour from my house. I called them and they gave me a hard time because I bought this item through Amazon and I decided I did not want to deal with a company and drive an hour each way that was giving me a hard time on the phone.I contacted Black and Decker again and requested a new lawnmower. I told them I was afraid that this was a lemon and I did not want to deal with the repair shop because of their attitude. I thought the product should have preformed better. My problem has been escalated and I was supposed to receive a call back from managment yesterday and I am still waiting for that call.

Height settings for cutting the lawn are a plus."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite piece of yardwork equipment","review":"Prior to purchasing the B&D; LM175 mower, I had a gas-powered B&D; (for 3 and a half years). I've had issues with excessive smoke fuming, failure to start, and oil leakage when using the gas-powered mower. If I were adept at lawnmower mechanics, I might have been able to fix those problems, but I'm not. The electric mower seems so much easier to use from the get-go:- Just plug in and pull in the handle and you're mowing.- Like the other reviews mention, the mower is so quiet when running, that you could mow the lawn in the evening time without causing any disturbances.- You could actually steer the mower with one hand and maneuver the power cord with the other hand without difficulty.- The blade height adjusts much more easily and succinctly than the gas-powered mower (one lever controls height in relation to both wheels).- The mower is light-weight and stores away easily.Would highly recommend this product. Can't imagine using anything else to mow my lawn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Mower!","review":"I absolutely love this mower. It works perfectly and no gas, take that oil companies. When I have to mow the other yard with a gas mower, I really see just how much polution you have to breath to run one. Now I get light headed when I mow the other yard with the gas mower there. I may get an electric for it, but heck, this one is so light I could lift it into my trunk and take it. It comes with a mulching type blade but the discharge shoot sticks out too much for my small yard and all its little nooks and crannies just like my old gas one did, so I fashioned a sheet metal cover and screwed it on, instant dedicated mulcher and can get into the tightest of spots. You should buy this mower!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Black and Decker great machine","review":"I purchased a Black and Decker LM 175 18 inch electric mower in 2005 and it has worked great until today 5-4-11.Can't say enough about it, I did not take very good care of it and it was used on really high grass for years, wet too and it worked wonderful. Plus it was left outside one winter and it had no problem cutting the grass the next 4 years. Buying one again, going to cross my fingers and hope I don't have any problems as some have mentioned.Will be more careful with this one, it will have a nice place to sit in the garage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for our lawn","review":"This mower is perfect for our small lawn.

It's well worth the price to pay for this boxset. 'Forever Darling' is the only movie which is in widescreen format the other 2 are in the original theatrical format of fullscreen. I do not like Fullscreen as I despise it but when I found out that the other 2 films were made in that resolution I didn't mind at all.

We didn't have cable and on Saturday after the cartoons and especially on Sunday afternoons we would lie on the bed and I would tell them stories. The first tv that I saw was when I was 11 years old and Lucy was the first one and then Topper and Perry Como. I couldn't wait until Thursdays when we could go across the street and watch these shows.So they had always loved Lucy. I found the set on your site and gave 2 of my children which is 45 and 41 these for Christmas. When they opened them they were very pleased and have mention them to me several times.So I would recommend these sets very highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun set of classics","review":"this was fun.

I am a 2Pac fan, and 2Pac is definitely the best rapper of all time, contrary to what they declare at the end of new Biggie videos. I hate Bad Boy, and Puffy belongs in hell. Biggie was the only Bad Boy artist who ever had any speck of talent. Juicy is one of the best songs ever, just because of the beat, and that is the only reason why I like this album. It is too bad that Puffy has to speak gibberish over the entire song. Puffy is simply the worst entertainer of all time, and it's too bad that Biggie was associated him, as all Puffy did was exploit him and capitalize on his death for his own personal gain."},{"rating":"1","title":"P.I.G.'s albums: 'Ready to Eat' and Life After Supper'","review":"This album is horrible, full of all of Puff Daddy's blatant rip offs and 'samples' and Biggie's twisted and unfunny attempts at humor.

I really enjoyed this man's music and I couldn't wait to listen to the album over again, i just can't beleive that a man this great died so young and he had so much to offer the world. I love this album and I recommend it if you love hardcore rap as well as storytelling cause there's lot's of it in this album. I loved his album before this one too and i really can't tell which one I like but I know that this his will live on cause he was loved by many and I can now understand why so many people like this mans music cause it was real and it was hardcore which is now accepted by millions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic, just Classic!","review":"this is a great classic debut album from the Illest rapper in his lifetime and ours.

Go find the original version at a used CD store.[Edit: Amazon removed my links to examples, but you can find the original and remastered versions of those tracks on YouTube and compare.]It's really too bad that whoever owns these tracks won't do the right thing!

Less commercial than Life After Death, and containing no filler whatsoever in my opinion, this album is above and beyond what many rappers today can even dream of doing. (Not to knock any modern rappers, but I'm not into a few of the current artists who seem to be selling so well).My favorite songs off this album have to be Gimme that Loot, Big Poppa, and of course, Juicy, one of the most well known rap songs ever, even sampled as half of the first song on Jay-Z's Blueprint 2. Even if you aren't a rap/hip-hop fan and have no idea about ANYTHING regarding rap, chances are you've heard at least one of these songs without even realizing it.This album is just classic. Biggie Smalls is the Billy Joel of rap.

It was hugely influential to boot. Biggie's raps feature great storylines backed up by great beats. The raps are lengthier, they're quite involved and the listener has to actually listen to the lyrics, not just passively hear fluff. Biggie's delivery and flow are excellent too; there's just something about his voice and cadence that works with this material. The raps look into the struggles and dangers faced by people on the street and also by Biggie himself. Violence and the threat of violence are everywhere, tho not glamorized, and characters in the raps meet bad ends. The title, Ready to Die, takes on a grim character in light of Biggie's early death by gunfire. The absolutely best raps of all the good ones on here are:Things Done ChangedGimme The LootJuicy - great flow to itSuicidal Thoughts - chilling recording of a call placed by Biggie to friend (Puff Daddy) about contemplating suicide.Suicidal"},{"rating":"2","title":"Biggie's pinnacle","review":"Point blank, one of the best albums ever in all aspects and if it didn't get 5 mics Benzino was mad he can't make a better album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Influential Hip-Hop CD EVER","review":"Funny how most of the \\"This album sucks\\"/\\"Biggie sucks, 2pac is way better\\" are from Kids Reviews.

I stopped listening to them for almost a year, listened to all the current (c)rap that is out now and then listened to these and other classic hip hop albums straight through again and again.

If you, like me, need to concentrate more on putting interesting patterns of value in your paintings, YOU NEED THIS BOOK.Love the work displayed -- it's quite inspiring. (I'd buy it!)

His colours are bright, bright, bright and this suits me just fine. Have been using his paintings as start-off points and then veering off into my own interpretation of them. Mike Svob tells it like it is. There is no pussyfooting around here. I love his straitforward way of thinking and the fact that he does not pull his punches.

They leave pieces of roof hanging low from the roof while they are pulling it out. So when the piggies walked around the enclosure these spikes were sticking out at eye level. I read where a piggie died from an eye infection after getting poked so at first I kept pulling out the pieces that were hanging and they ate it off the floor but after a day or two I decided it wasn't worth the trouble and got a plastic igloo.

I used the MM875 in October 2008 to mulch leaves-fair, not great at that-then it belched gray smoke this June 2009. I HATE the height adjustment lever on this one-it is very hard to see-and strongly recommend if you do Black and Decker you find a model with a simple lever you can see to adjust height settings. The other problem was the design of the mulching bag. I got several deep cuts on my arm until I figured out how to work around its poor design.

Of course, you have to manipulate the cord to keep it out of your way but it hasn't been a big problem. The great thing is that I plug it in and it STARTS every time. I had so many problems starting my gas-powered mowers (too much gas primer or not enough???) and pulling on that cord was difficult for me.One of the handle grips started to split after the first mowing but I called Black & Decker and they sent me a new set.

I liked the wheel adjustment.Now the not so good:The deck or blade housing is designed primarily to provide cooling for the motor. There's a small fan on the bottom of the shaft that helps with the airflow but it detracts from the efficiency of grass collecting.As a result, grass collection suffers.The deck design is close to the ground in front and it pushes the grass down; the result being an uneven cutting.The mesh in the collection bag is course enough to let small clippings and dust flow through. If you wait until the grass is dry enough to cut, you will usually get a lot of dust. If you try to cut grass while it's still damp, the mower doesn't have quite enough power.The current draw on the motor, 12 amps, requires a large wire size extension cord, preferably a minimum of 14 gauge but the method of securing the cord to the mower requires a small cord.More poor engineering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black & Decker Lawn Hog 12 Amp 19-Inch Electric Mulching Mower with Rear Bag #MM875","review":"Black & Decker Lawn Hog 12 Amp 19-Inch Electric Mulching Mower with Rear Bag #MM875Excellent mulching mower.

Now they're wider which allows fewer passes and more lightweight so it's a breeze to operate.

Compared to the gas mower you are used to it is1. Quieter. You can talk to a person standing next to you with the mower running.2. Lighter. I can easily pick it up.3. Cheaper. Both to buy and to run.4. Simpler. Plug it in and it goes.on the down side it is5. a little less powerful.6. a lot less convenient. Dealing with the cord takes some strategy and focus. If you zone out while mowing it might not be for you.7. problematic in damp conditions. Plug it into a GFCI outlet and don't use damaged cords and you will be OK. And if you just try to bull your way through heavy wet grass you can smoke the thing. It will fry itself if you are dumb about stalling it.So maybe not for everyone, but it is for someone.

I have some physical limitations but even my wife found it \\"work.\\" I think that if the Lawn Hog had \\"high-boy\\" back wheels, it might make it easier to push. Black and Decker's one touch height adjustment is super, it makes changing the height a dream. If you're looking to get away from a fossil fuel burning mower, the Lawn Hog deserves serious consideration."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this mower","review":"Black & Decker Lawn Hog 12 Amp 19-Inch Electric Mulching Mower with Rear Bag #MM875i am a 71 year old senior we love this mower!my family mows for me and they all thank me for buying this.it is so easy to use and maneuver.very glad i ordered it.just remember the cord to run it is not included .hea71ler"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for small yards","review":"Love this mower.

But I was disappointed on first use. 30 seconds into using it, the motor started smelling like it was burning. I returned it the second day thinking the first one was a lemon. I tested a second one in the store, which also made the same smell. It amases me that this is not coming out in these reviewes. I wonder where at Black and Deckers these reviews are written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"I wouldn't recommend this mower unless you are midget. There is no way to substantially adjust the height of the handle bar. If you are short, it will probably be fine, but otherwise, be prepared for a sore back.

I don't know how this thing runs, I am sending it back without even firing it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know why","review":"Frankly, I don't know why so many people like this mower and give it such high ratings. I bought it largely based on the rave reviews, and regret it for the last two years, not to mention the claims made by my wife that this is the worst research i did on buying a product - having a cord attached to a mower is simply a bad bad idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Product","review":"I bought the Craftsman alternative to this but it is essentially the same mower. I bought it to have something lightweight I could carry up and down the stairs from the basement because I lack an outside enclosure. It works wonderfully for my small 1/4 acre yard and managing the cord is not very hard except for some annoying obstacles (old tree trunks, etc). My only complaint so far would be the bag. The angle it comes in at just seems to make you empty it long before its filled."},{"rating":"2","title":"still going strong after 2 years","review":"I got this mower 2 years ago. Assembly required - cut the box open & straighten the handle, then plug it in & mow. Love it for all the leaves in fall when using the bag. I get tons of shredded leaf mulch for my flower beds. For summer and spring, I leave the bag off and the clippings are so finely mulched, they disappear into the lawn. I have a large back yard - 120 X 40 with many shrubs. I have no problem with the cord. It is no different than using a corded vacuum cleaner while maneuvering around furniture. The height adjustment and bag removal are a snap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handle breaks","review":"I will make this short. The mower itself does a fine job for my small yard. I have purchased two of these over the past 4 years. In both instances the handle (that part that you pull to engage the motor) broke after two years (just when the warranty went out). The first time I just disposed of the mower (not knowing where/how to repair). This month (August) the same thing happened to my current model (the warranty expired this past May). I did find an authorized dealer to repair it. It has been with them for 3 weeks (had to order the part). Their receipt stated that the repair would not exceed $89.00. Not sure what the actuall amount will end up being. It just seems strange that the same thing happend to both mowers. The quality of the handle apparatus needs to be addressed. I do like the idea of eletric. If I could find another manufacturer that offered one I would be more inclined to try another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommend","review":"Easy to open the box and get started in 5 minutes. Remember these electric mowers are NOT self-propelled, I am glad I purchased the corded model as it weighs considerably less than the battery cordless model, I do not think I could have mowed my lawn with a mower much heavier (my yard is not level). It is great to have a mower that you just turn on and do not have to pull your guts out to start, also no hauling gasoline from the station and I especially like the decreased noise level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent Mower For Light Duty","review":"I bought this mower for use on what I would consider as the \\"largest yard you would want to tackle with an electric mower\\" my lot is (140 ft x 100 ft).The Good- Virtually maintenance free (aside from keeping the deck clean)- Quiet- Does a good job if you are tackling a light mowing choreThe Bad- Broke after 1 year of use (luckily still under warranty now I'm going back to a gas mower)- Not as powerful as I'd hoped (I knew it wouldn't be as strong as a gas machine but it still seemed weak)- Blade dulls abnormally fastOther than the blade and durability issue I liked the mower. I suppose if you have a small lot and can use a short thick cord, and don't intend to use it for medium-heavy mowing jobs, this mower may work for you. Otherwise buy a stronger gas powered mower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad electric mower","review":"Few issues. Mower was missing blades of grass from first use and on. Suction power...sucks. Does not pick of many leaves and small twigs within grass. Blade is contoured so it can be difficult to sharpen. Wheel adjustment is nice to have a one touch for all wheels, but is horrible for when mowing around lawn edges (sidewalks and flower beds). Its nice to set one side slightly higher or lower to run mover off edge of lawn but still keep a level cut. Not possible with this mower. Just means more manual trimming. Mower is fairly quiet. Construction is decent, no overly loose or cheap feeling parts (yet). Mulching and bagging works just fine. If you need a larger mower or one with more power, you don't want an electric mower to begin with."},{"rating":"2","title":"B&D Lawn Hog delivers","review":"Great for small lots. powerful, maint. free, and super simple adjustments.

Not only is very light and easily maneuverable, it cuts the grass into a fine mulch hardly noticed unless you let the grass grow high.In fact, I let my grass grow for three weeks, and it handled the thicker growth with no problems as I used the bag to catch the grass.Definitely recommend it to anyone.

The handle folds fairly readily for storage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy with my first electric mower","review":"I read review after review on cordless lawn mowers. However, I realized that with the size of my lawn I could save money by going with a corded model.For those who worry about mowing with a cord, it is very much like sanding floors, or using a vacuum cleaner. It takes a couple of times to figure out a pattern but afterwards it is easy enough.My wife loves the easy start and I love how quiet the mower is. It cuts through the toughest patches of our grass and it is light weight.Overall, I am extremely happy with my purchase. I will take care of this product and I hope to use it until I can upgrade to a solar powered mower."},{"rating":"2","title":"B&D MM875","review":"This was a replacement for a similar lawn mower purchased several years ago.

Which in my opinion is not very good considering that the size of my yard is minuscule.After that it took a few months to find a place to send it to, since it was still under warranty, the closest place to drive was Canada. Black and Decker was kind enough to send a box to mail it in, it came with directions! Shortly thereafter we are called to be informed that the motor has burned out and this is not covered under the warranty. It is true that we are not greatest with lawn care and that yes we wait, perhaps a week longer than we should, to mow the grass. And because of this it can be pretty thick. But we adjust the mower and make more than one pass. Why should this cause the motor to burn out?? I know it it electric, but really.... It makes me want to go back to the noisy, gas guzzler, which we ended up having to borrow from the in laws to mow the grass the rest of the summer. Hooray! So much for saving the environment!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of @#$%*!","review":"We bought this mower 3 years ago. After the 1st season of use it needed major repairs, thankfully covered by warranty. It made it through a 2nd season, but conked out at the beginning of this summer. Left with little desire to fix a crappy piece of machinery, we instead bought a 19\\" YardMachines electric mower. The YardMachines mower is a WAY BETTER PRODUCT. The body is metal, the wheels are big which makes mowing easier, it has a clever cord keeper, and we are very happy with our new purchase. Don't even consider the B&D - Check out YardMachines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great electric mower","review":"This is a great mower! Lots of people have already reviewed the positives, so let me focus on something I didn't see in the reviews.This mower needs 12 or 14 gauge extension cords. The limit, according to the owner's manual, is 75 feet. This means you are limited to mowing relatively small lawns. Or you can ignore the \\"advice\\", use 16 gauge wiring (this is usually the 100ft cords you can buy everywhere) and take your chances on shortening the life of the mower. Or you can connect whatever length of 12 or 14 gauge and press on.My suggestion is to figure out the furthest distance you need to mow from a power outlet and make sure you can reach. Or buy the cordless mower"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not satisfied with this mower","review":"This mower would not pick up all of the clippings. It would leave a trail on either side so I had to go over the grass twice (in the opposite direction). I also have to empty the bag when it is 1/3 full otherwise more clippings spill out. The cutting swath is narrow so you're already pushing the mower more than a 21\\" gas mower. Add the cord management and using this mower took me about 3-4 times longer to mow than with a gas mower.It also cannot handle a damp or even slightly damp lawn. The discharge chute easily clogs.I got sick of taking 3-4 hours to mow my lawn and emptying the bag every time it got 1/3 full, so I got my money back and bought a gas mower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything I expected","review":"I was so excited when I found my new electric mower on my doorstep when I got home. I was waiting for it to arrive before mowing my yard, which was getting a bit long. It came practically assembled and I was out in my yard mowing within minutes. Dealing with the cord is an issue, but not much of one. Using a back and forth pattern that moves away from the outlet does the trick. It is light and very easy to start, stop and start again.The only down side, which has been mentioned by many other reviewers, was that the opening into the bag can get clogged. When I unclogged it a couple of times (which is not that big a deal), I noticed that the grass was a little moist. I'm sure that had something to do with the problem. Dry grass probably moves into the bag a little more easily.This mower is brilliant! Well, so far anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful With This Mower","review":"Pros: Easy to use, light, no gas, no maintenance.Cons: Flimsy. Even though the motor shaft on this mower is metal, the deck is made of plastic. I was mowing around a tree and the blade hit a small root that was sticking up out of the ground about 1 inch. This was enough force/bend the whole blade and shaft which sent the blade careening up into the mower deck. I thought the mower was going to be damaged beyond repair as the incident caused the shaft to be out of alignment. But the whole thing is so flimsy, I was able to manipulate it back into place. Plus I had to replace the part which is called the \\"fan.\\" This part goes between the deck and the blade and got busted up when the blade hit the root.Needless to say the mower is still working. But I regret purchasing it. If you are used to a mower with a metal deck, you need to be really careful that you don't hit anything with the blade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lawn hog","review":"My family loves this lawn mower.

Every since then I have been a big fan of electric lawnmowers. Once you get past manuvering the extension cord you will find this lawnmower easy to use. The best part is that once the lawnmowing season is over you can just put it away without any sort of oil changing or servicing. Come spring time, you just pull it out again and start it up. I have used this particular model 3 times, and can say it does a great job on my lawn (a total of about 1/4 acre). The height setting is easy to use, and the bag is easy to get on and off. Other reviewers have mentioned it, so you just need to be a little careful around rocks since the bottom is made of plastic. That is the only slight drawback I see to this fine lawnmower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lawn Hog Mulching Mower","review":"Pretty good power but doesn't seem to cut as well on the first pass as my previous gasoline powered mower.

Although it has a 2-year warranty and will probably be fixed, the multi-weeks hassle of going through their return process and waiting to get the mower back is intolerable.

I had used a Black and Decker electric mower for the last three years and had had no problem with it until the plastic guard on the side broke. This new mower is heavy and cumbersome. The big advantage to me of having an electric mower is its light weight makes maneuvering it a breeze; this mower negated that asset.

I tried a new extension cord (thicker gauge), and tried moving the blade by hand in case it got bound up somehow.Unfortunately, the unit is dead...However, I am sure this was just a fluke because these products have gotten such great reviews otherwise. So i'm going to try out another one and see if I have better luck at it.The main reason for the high review is because this unit is environmentally friendly. Yes it uses power generated by, more than likely, a coal burning power plant...

My yard is about 1/4 acre, I bought a 100' cord and am able to reach my whole yard. I don't find the cord that much of a problem. Starting is a joy, just pull up on the handle.

A couple of weeks ago a flame came out of the control switch unit while I was mowing, and Black and Decker gave me UPS shipping authorization to send it back for warranty repair (they have a two-year warranty). The call agent didn't seem at all surprised about the fire. And this morning I got a call from a guy at the service center who tells me that the repair is NOT covered under warranty because the blade has been nicked. Apparently this mower is pretty fragile. I have a couple of areas to cut that are rough, and I have whacked a rock or two. With electric mowers (or maybe just electric mowers of this quality?), that can destroy the motor. Funny they didn't mention that when I bought it. I can't recommend this mower. Even if your yard is perfectly smooth, you're going to hit something some day, and then your mower will be scrap."},{"rating":"1","title":"No enough power and its heavy","review":"I have just moved to the US from Europe and I really wanted an electric over a gas mower. Nearly all of the mowers back in Europe are electric and are hover mowers. These are light, since they have to hover (no wheels) and have the power to cut.This mower is heavy and gets bogged down very quickly. The blade kept stopping. I only mowed maybe 30ft and thought; forget this. After a lot of research this was apparently the best. I tried upping the cut height but even then I thought this will take forever. I love gardening and I was scaping the turf. So I'm not sure.I eventually brought a gas mower hoping things will catch up in a few years and I can go back to an electric mower.I should add the grass was not long but fairly dense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use, good bargain","review":"Consumers Reports rated this the #1 corded electric mower. It is light, and easy to handle. The height is easily adjustable, and has 8 levels. It's not a bad mulcher, but the bag is easy to handle when the grass is long and I don't want to mulch. I've cut long grass (after I was away) and it handled it very nicely, so it has plenty of power. It's also priced right, relative to the market.Downsides are: It doesn't cut grass that close to objects like foundation walls, so I have a fair amount of trimming. I've only used it a few times, but I wonder if the handle you have to use to turn it on will break one day--it feels a little light, not that sturdy.If you want a corded electric (perfect for my area), I recommend it. I would buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy so far","review":"The cord is a hassle, but definitely manageable. You just have to think ahead when you start mowing and work in a pattern that keeps the cord from getting in your mowing path. The mower is pretty easy to push (not as easy as the self-propelled mowers obviously). It's much quieter than gas-powered mowers, and I don't have to worry about running out of gas.The mower gets cranky when you don't mow often enough (it struggles a bit with really long grass), but it has been up to the challenge so far. It's basically been exactly what I expected so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I thought","review":"I purchased a new mower last year...this year it wouldn't start.

I used the mower 4 times with some considerable difficulty mowing without bogging down, even with the deck set very high. On the fifth use, the motor seized altogether. Service required a half hour drive and the repair cost almost as much as the mower. I would not recommend this mower. I found it to be unreliable and the warranty repair experience disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"The switch failed after three years and the motor after four. It never cut uniformly even with the bag. The grip broke apart as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good electric Mower","review":"This was the best rated electric mower according to consumer reports. It works well and is easy to adjust. I found the the shroud on the backside would flatten the grass and hamper cutting if I were to try and pull the mower backwards. I cut about half the shroud (its made of stiff rubber) with some heavy duty scissors and now I can pull it backwards when the situation calls for it. It is easy to adjust. I found that the bag on the back worked well but wasn't really necessary. The mower shreds/mulches pretty well and its easier to move without the bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Requires two passes to cut properly","review":"This is my second electric mower. I have two pros: the cutting height adjusts quickly and easily and the blade stops immediately when the handle is released. My previous electric mower (Taskforce) would slowly wind-down when the handle was released. I have one significant con: this mower doesn't cut worth a damn. I have never removed the blade and I use my Dremel to keep the blade sharp. The height is set at the mid-poiint of the adjustment range. However, it leaves about half of the Kentucky Bluegrass uncut, i.e., bent over, during forward motion even at a slow pace. I have to pull the mower back over the same strip to cut the remaining grass. Actually, I think it cuts better in reverse motion. I cannot recommend this mower. I wish I got the same mover those folks who gave this a 5 star rating got."},{"rating":"2","title":"Woman's Lawnmower","review":"I just purchased the item listed above it is wonderful.

My hope was for a relatively maintenance free mower. With no gas and oil to provide, what could go wrong? Well after less than 3 years of use, the electric motor failed and needs replacement.Cord management was a hassle and slowed down the mowing process. This mower never did give a nice even cut and almost always required going over the lawn twice.

Both mulcher and collector bag seem to work well, though mower is not quite as powerful in picking up leaves, etc., as with gas mowers I've owned.

However, when I recently tried to remove the blade, the washers broke away from the blade and spun around so the nut could not be loosened. I tried everything I could think of without success. Finally I called Black and Decker and was transferred to their local repair center. The person I talked to there said to bring it to a car garage and have them take the nut off with their air impact wrench. I took his advice and sure enough, the nut popped right off. Upon removing the blade I discovered the culprit was the plastic blade insulating washer. As it wears out it allows the blade to slip when you try to remove the nut that holds it in place. Horrible design by B&D. The best thing to do is order a replacement insulating washer-the part number is 241381-01. Overall nice mower, but poor blade fastener design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black and Decker MM875 lawn mower","review":"This lawn mower lacks the power to cut through bermuda grass in the summertime.

The one lever wheel adjustment couldn't be easier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, lightweight, environmentally friendly mower","review":"Have used this for two summers - it's light and easy to use. Cord management is what it is - I'm an old electric mower man, so for me it's fine, and a lot less trouble than screwing around with a gas mower - the maintenance, the starting hassles, and producing more pollution than a fleet of SUVs. This is the best electric we've had, it eats up tall grass without slowing down and does a decent job of mulching. Easy to clean, blade easy to remove for sharpening. All in all a great mower if you have a relatively unobstructed yard to keep down cord hassles. Durable construction, relatively inexpensive. I'd recommend it if you're in the market for an electric."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor Fan and Bottom Deck Broke within 2 Months","review":"I purchased this mower less than 2 months ago and everything was working perfectly. Then I ran over a small root. Any normal mower would just sputter a little, at worse stall out. But this mower's deck is made of plastic so when the blade hit the root the blade took a big chunk out of the deck. The plastic motor fan broke too since the metal blade is mounted to it.I wish I bought the generic Lowes electric mower. That mower has a metal deck which would withstand normal mowing conditions.Sincerely disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the older folks","review":"My husband and I are retired and find the machine easy for us to use.

I have been very impressed using this on my 1750sqft lawn. The 19-inch blade is larger than many other electrics. The cord takes a little getting used to, but it is not a big deal. The power is excellent for long grass and mulches well, but there is a bag included. The height adjustment is a great feature which allows the deck to move with one easy click. This mower is perfect for lawns without too many obstacles, even much bigger than mine.

I didn't know there was an unrated version when I bought it and that is something I can't stand is unrated films. There is a site where you can check the difference between films but this one didn't have this movie up yet. I don't know how gory it could have been. So yea, it's a basic pg-13 horror film with a good cast but very little blood and no gore. The film doesn't really make sense in some scenes but I guess i'll have to wait for the website to get ahold of the copy to see if I missed anything.

You'll be riveted to the screen with this one, but you must pay close attention: the beauty and marvel of \\"Secret Defense\\" reside in the many important details Rivette chooses to include in it. Powerful ending, too. Finally, Sylvie must be one of the most accurate representations of a real lab researcher on the non-documentary screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secret Defense","review":"New Wave pioneer Rivette injects a heady bit of existential head-scratching into this beautifully acted, cathartic whodunit.

It's done in a \\"semi-documentary\\" style, with periodic \\"voiceovers\\" explaining to the viewer how the Treasury Department does its job---the film does for the Treasury Department what, THE STREET WITH NO NAME, did for the FBI. Dennis O'Keefe plays a \\"T-Man\\" who goes undercover with a partner in order to break up a counterfeiting ring. Although the \\"voiceovers\\" become a little tiresome, the movie is well-paced and the plot is engrossing. Wallace Ford is good as a sleazy little guy known as, \\"The Schemer\\", who overestimates his ability to \\"scheme\\" his way out of things. Charles McGraw is excellent as a vicious hood---but then, that's his forte, isn't it! Naturally, after a few close calls, O'Keefe succeeds in bringing down the counterfeiters. This is a good film and I highly recommend it to fans of noir."},{"rating":"2","title":"An overlooked B-movie crime thriller","review":"If and when you see this film, ignore the tiresome, moronic narration at the beginning and end that was obviously tacked on by the studio, and enjoy the middle 96% of this tough, well-made, B-movie classic. Before he found fame as a director of westerns, Anthony Mann directed shoestring-budget B-crime thrillers, of which T-Men is the best (better than Raw Deal, much better than Railroaded.) The pseudo-documentary approach combines with John Alton's brilliant underlit noirish cinematography to create a potent brew; engaging, almost mesmerizing. You hate to see the story come to an end. A B-movie masterpiece, one of the great ones of the forties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of rocks with this mower!","review":"Just started cutting my lawn for the 5th time with this mower and managed to kill it tonight. All it took was hitting one rock hidden in the grass for a sec, and -boom- it's dead. Just smoke coming out of the motor. I can't recall ever killing a gas mower this way in my 30 years of cutting grass and I know I hit a few similar or bigger rocks in the past. I'm now really torn about fixing it versus going back to gas.It's too bad 'cause up til now it was easy to use (my 10 year was cutting the grass with it [under my supervision]) and did a decent job of mulching except with heavier or wet grass.Haven't found out what the cost to repair it might be but I suspect it will run close to 50% or more of the $189 cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lawn Mower","review":"This mower was assembled incorrectly.

I found an electric lawnmower to be a novel idea, but working with a power cord has proven to be clumsy and restricting. In less than a month, the hooks/pins attaching the handle to the base broke, making the lawnmower inoperable. I was not overly rough with the mower. Customer service suggested I take it to my \\"local\\" service center, which is over an hour away, and only open 7 - 5 weekdays. Not wanting to make 2 trips (200+ miles of driving and 2 half-days off work), I called first, and they didn't have the parts in stock anyway. The replacement parts are being shipped to me, and I'll get to fix it myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"electric mowers RULE for small lawns!","review":"Hey running this mower takes me back to my teenage years when I used to cut my grandmother's lawn with her electric mower. I always thought running her mower was darned easy and I think running this CU recommended B&D mower is darned easy too. And it is quiet! I spent more than 10 years before my divorce running a rider lawnmower on nearly an acre of lawn with earplugs firmly inserted. No need for earplugs with this little jewel. It might be a tad underpowered in comparison to gas types. But all you have to do is raise the deck until the poor thing isn't struggling anymore, and that is really your feedback about how deeply to cut! And it sure beats the Sears gas mower I found in my rental house that spit gasoline out the muffler on the first trial pull. I have never seen a small engine do *that* and I have messed with quite a few during my half-century :-)Bottom line: no muss, no fuss. Beat that with *any* gas mower."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"So much better than I expected! I have to admit, I was a little skeptical about the \\"cord thing\\" but it is SO MUCH EASIER to use than any gas powered machine I have used - EVER! It pushes more easily than the self-prepelled and not having to spend the first 20 minutes of the day trying to start the thing, it just makes mowing go so fast!Not to mention, no gas or oil when you tilt it. And it stops immediately when you let go of the handle and starts right back up when you grab it again! FAB-U-LOUS!LOVE IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Black & Decker Lawn Hog with flip handle MM675","review":"We purchased this lawn mower because I wanted a higher amp mower. I did not think I would use the \\"flip handle\\". My old mower had cut one strip and died so we ordered this one. The grass (weeds) was already high when we purchased the mower because we had had rain (we live in dry West Texas). The purchase arrived very quickly, the mower works beautifully (weeds were very high), but the best part was the \\"flip handle\\" that I did not think I would use. I really like that function of the mower. Saves me time and the cord does not get in the way of mowing. This mower is great - would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely powerful enough. Not perfect","review":"I love this thing. That's why I gave it 5 stars. 4 stars on amazon usually means a product is mediocre, not \\"good\\", so I'm going by that metric. Anyway - it's not perfect. It's like an A-. The bolts to hold the handle together were machined poorly so I had to find a bolt in my garage to put it together. No big deal. The bagger attachment doesn't hold enough but it's the only one they make. Other than that, it starts, stops, doesn't require gas, doesn't make a lot of noise, and works just fine. No maintenance is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"breaks down again!","review":"I have the previous version, the MM600, it is four years old and broke for the second time today. My lot is 130'x50' on which sits the house, a driveway, a large deck, a shed, and a vegetable garden, the rest is grass for the MM600 to mow. The first time it broke I had only used it 4 times. Warrantee covered the problem (which was never really explained) but the mower was gone for over six weeks. The mower ran fine through last year's drought, our mowing season runs May to October. In its forth mowing of its forth season it quit as I was rounding into the back yard and blew the circuit breaker in the house. I hope many improvements have been made to the MM675 since the MM600. I wouldn't buy it. Last time I took it to service there were 3 other identical mowers in the small shop. Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"Somehow it stopped working and we cannot find repairing services. We used it for less than two summers and our yard is small. Good idea, poor quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoy It Before It Falls Apart","review":"This MM 675 is a great mower when it is in one piece. You need to watch as you mow for parts falling off (screws, etc) or one day the whole under carriage will fall off. For me it lasted one season, which I consider expensive for a $200-250 electric mower. The first one I got (new) had a broken handle, and I had to get another before I received credit on this one as my grass was growing quickly !! The flip handle works nicely until it begins to slip. Finally this week the engine began to smoke and stopped dead as I was mowing slowly on a medium high lawn, so they can not accuse me of stalling the mower on thick high grass. I hope I get so sort of refund or replacement, but looking at other reviews I am hesitant, and am looking for a different brand, but which one ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"B/D MM675 Electric Lawn Mower","review":"I've only used one other electric lawn mower and that was a B/D twin blade from the 70's. This model mower is fairly nice, but is heavier than the older model. The flip handle is a worthwhile feature and the foam handle grip, while comfortable, was easily ripped on bush limbs. As mentioned in earlier reviews, the grass discharge chute falls off too easily when bumped into. The on/off/safety lever design is inconvenient. There should be a separate on/off button w/ a safely bar across the entire handle like other mowers. Also, the opening where the electrical cord is looped through is too small for a 12g cord.Bottom line: After making mowers at least since the early 70's, the design should be near perfect and it isn't. However, there aren't many choices, so this may be the best to be had. The only other choice was the Yardman and it didn't have the flip handle feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will flip over this handle!","review":"We bought this mower to cut down on yard expense, with the electric we do not have to buy gasoline and at $2.90 a gallon even mowing your yard can cost a bundle, no oil to buy either. The electric mower is quieter and cleaner. Jeff loves to be able to listen to the ipod while mowing, with the gas mowers the noise was too loud to really hear your music.Jeff likes that it does not clog out when the grass is a little on the high side. The handle flips so that there is no need to turn the mower, Jeff really loved this feature. Jeff gave it 4 stars as there is the cord to contend with, however the mower is light enough to manuever the cord."},{"rating":"2","title":"More power","review":"This is our second B&D electric lawn mower. The last one we got about 10 years ago and even thou it still works we wanted one that had a more powerful motor, This mower has the power and works great, the flip handle really makes mowering easy as far as keeping the cord out of the way. We highly recommend electric over gas, its cleaner and no maintenance had not had to service our last mower in 10 years, No oil changes, just plug and mow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good Lawn Mower","review":"I have had this mower for about a month. So far, I am very pleased. With the flip handle, the long power cord is much less of a problem than it would be otherwise. The instructions help you work out a pattern of mowing so that the cord does not get in your way. It mulches very well with grass. For the light leaves that I have had so far, it mulches about 1/2 of them in one pass. I am waiting to see how it does with thicker leaves but expect to have to rake. The heighth adjustment is very easy. It does bog down a little in very thick, high grass but not much more than a gas powered mower."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Winner","review":"This is my first electric mower and it is a winner. I love to hear it start by just sqeezing the handle. No more pulling endlessly on a cord to start and no more gas. By the time the mower got shipped to me, my grass was twice as high as normal. No reason to worry. The mower cut through the high grass with no problem and it mulched perfectly. Yes, the cord is a pain at times, but the flip handled works great and the mower is so light it can be pushed easily with one hand. I would not hesitate to buy this mower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black & Decker Electric Lawn Mower Great for City Lawns","review":"I was tired for yearly maintenance on my gas mowers...the noise, the tune-ups, emptying the gas for winter, and the pollution. This electric mower is great for my smaller city lawn. It does bog down a little in very heavy thick grassy areas however, so did the gas mower a bit. But it has not stalled out if I go a little slower in those areas. It is quiet, easy, low maintenance, and I can count on it to start immediately each and every time. No more straining to start. And no carbon emissions. So far I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine mower","review":"This mower is well thought out.

Mine only lasted for 3 years before the motor went up in smoke. In that same time I had to replace the base plates that attach the handle to the mower deck (they broke under the \\"stress\\" of being pushed I guess), as well as the lower part of the handle which cost me about $40 in the end. After 3 years the motor started sparking and became unusable. I replaced the brush heads, but it is the magnetic ring that is the problem. It will cost $70 to purchase that part...not interested. I caved and bought a regular gas mower instead and have never been happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth it","review":"the flip handle is great and the mower runs like a champ. i was only interested in electric because of the price of gas...not the environment aspect because i dont really care about that. i was surprised that its got just as much power as a gas mower and is much lighter. buy this mower, you wont regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"B&D Flip-Handle Lawn hog is great","review":"In my life I've used every kind of mower there is. It all depends on the size of the lawn. Currently I have just 1800 sq ft with only one tree in it, so I was considering either a push reel mower or an electric. I wanted to go green but I was wary of effort using a push reel mower. I borrowed one and boy did I find out. They don't get the edges of your lawn because the wheels are in the way and it requires a lot of physical effort. I planned how I would mow the law with an electric and bought the B&D lawn hog FOR the flip handle. I love it. I have to mow often (every week) because it doesn't do well on long grass, but othewrwise it works great.

There are some spectacular views of Yosemite as the very long trailer is pulled up a hillside road that begins with a sign warning them not to attempt this route. Of course, Lucy and Desi encounter and live through many of the potential disasters associated with trailer living and that makes it really funny.

It's a delightful movie and one never tires of seeing it over and over again. Look for one particular blooper; there's a scene where Taci (Lucy) is sleeping in the living room and gets scared, running through the trailer. Instead of screaming Nicky's (Desi's) name, she accidentally calls out for \\"Ricky\\", her TV husband's name. This chronicles the tale of a couple who purchase a trailer at a time when they cost more than stick-built homes and were \\"the\\" preferred mode of travel for those who could afford it!If you're looking for a movie you can watch with your children, this is it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Loving Lucy and Desi","review":"I can still remember watching the original \\"I Love Lucy\\" as a young girl when all of a sudden a commercial came on for \\"The Long Long Trailer.\\" Our family was so excited....and it was in color!

Beautiful color, made or released in 1954. I love the blooper showed many times in this film - as Desi & Lucy pull away - their car is complete - flashing back to them the dashboard, windshield and cowl of their convertible are missing. There are cameos by the actors who played Floyd 'the barber' (Andy Griffith) and aunt whatshername on the Batman TV show (actress Madge Blake). I love the nostalgia of that era, but the tension I felt of the challenges were not fun for me. I could feel the tension of them bringing that crazy thing up a winding mountain. The ending is a bit over simplistic of life. Still - there is just no replacing this comedy duo.

Watching Nicky trying to learn how to drive with this big trailer behind him, trying to back it up in a relatives' driveway with literally a dozen people giving him directions and of course the one and only Lucy collecting a rock wherever they stop which only serves to add weight to the trailer and then having to hide them from Nicky because she cannot bare to part with them, and trying to cook dinner in the moving trailer which leaves both her and the trailer in shambles all make for some of the funniest moments with Lucy and Desi I have ever seen.

And they learn the correct way of traveling with a trailer. Also meeting wonderful friendly people along the way.This movie is rarely shown on TV and I had to have it for my collection. Good price and good quality entertainment and yes, Lucy can really sing, she has a very pretty voice which she demonstrates while riding in the car.Another Lucy movie that I have and I am so glad I bought it is \\"Fancy Pants\\" in it she stars with Bob Hope.

I received it as a gift and just sat there reading it for 2 hours. I love the essays and anecdotes and the cartoons, of course. Then I started making the recipes and the ones I've tried are great. They're easy enough that my kids can help, which makes them more likely to try them, and they taste good. Plus her attitude really helps me relax about the whole business.

Things such as packaged biscuits, ketchup, lots of soy, soy sauce. This is not all recipes and some that do call for these types of things still gave me great ideas. For example I can do that same idea with homemade biscuit dough or bread dough that she does with packaged biscuits.

While NWA's profane, sexist and violent lyrics are mostly used for shock value, the group sometimes succeeds in providing a harsh social commentary (most notably in F*** The Police) with a real purpose. Producers Dr. Dre and Yella lace the album with a wide variety of beats that remain funky and hardcore at the same time while rappers MC Ren, Eazy-E and Ice Cube maintain the street gangster image without sounding forced.

The \\"reflector\\" stripes are just brightly colored strips of polyester and have no reflective capability (as the Aeromax does). The embroidered patch was not sewn on but glued. My son managed to pull it off in about 30 minutes. And the helmet is not adjustable (as the web page states) but is a one-size-fits-all.Obviously, I was very, very disappointed in this purchase.

The 'costumes' look like they were created by a group of kindergartners who had raided their mothers' closets and found old fur coats and other such treasures. The writing was even worse, and the acting - and I use that word very loosely - made the writing look good.

In what was to be the last of the Frankenstein/Dracula/Wolfman series, the Universal monsters converge on a clinic seeking a cure. Dracula shows up, followed by the Wolfman, who, while stumbling through a cave with the latest mad scientist, conveniently happens upon the Frankenstein monster. It seems that old Frank was fortunate enough to wash ashore under the good doctor's castle. That's when the fun really begins. This is about as contrived as it gets, but it's entertaining at times. John Carradine reprises his role as Dracula; he's no Bela Lugosi, but is far better in the role than Chaney was. So, enjoy it for what it is. It's not great, but not bad either."},{"rating":"2","title":"House of Dracula","review":"This film is a great film for Dracula fans! John Carradine played a great Count Dracula even though he is not seen as often as the other characters.I am not sure why the The Wolfman was put in the film? The Frankenstein monster should have had a longer role because he was only shown for about 3 minutes. Overall this is very good film."},{"rating":"1","title":"House of Disapointments","review":"Dracula, the Wolfman, and the Frankenstein creature are at it again in this second movie that they team-up, find a scientist who wants to cure them all.

Dracula and the wolf man appear in Dr.Edelman's lab to find a cure for their deadly instincts. After wolfman is getting cured (finally), Edelman is poisoned by Dracula, who dies from sun exposure by the doctor,and turns ino a Jekyll Hyde monster. Dr.Edelman finds the body of the Frankenstein monster and brings it back to life. At the unforgettable conclusion, we get a murder and close view actions of the still living and powerful Frankenstein monster, who appears in the sequel again in Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein.

Count Dracula (John Carradine) is seeking a cure for vamprism by a sympethetic doctor (Onslow Stevens). Blood transfusions begin between the two. The doctor then gets Larry Talbot (Once again played greatly by Lon Chaney, Jr.) who seeks a cure (not death) from his affliction. Dracula attempts to sink his teeth into the doctor's nurse, but is killed by the doctor. Dracula's blood contaminates him, and he becomes a Jekyll/Hyde doctor.

The only reason I don't give this one 5 stars is because Karloff and Leo J. Carroll are not in this one(you have got to understand I am a big fan of Karloff!), and I loved Dracula's demise in House of Frankenstein!

You have the norm - a continually tormented Larry Talbot, who does get cured of his transformations by having his skull enlarged, the Frankenstein monster is found in a cave w/ the skeletal remains of Dr. Neimann (see House of Frankenstein), and an unconvincing stupid performance by John Carridine as Dracula. Oh yes, he comes seeking an end for his life (dahhhh, just stand in the sun!). Oh yes, that's how he gets it in the end. What's left to do?

You'd be hard-pressed to find two albums that are more similar. E-Sic and Big Vic are nearly identical rappers to their buddies Dig and Quint, and the album succeeds and suffers in the same areas. Production is decent overall, operating at a mid-tempo West Coast funk with solid instrumentals. The record tends to be plagued by a formulaic approach, generic lyrics, and uninspired hooks. It's not a very memorable effort. Bay Area fans may find this of nostalgic value, and it appears to have accumulated some value among collectors, but I would not recommend that other listeners pay out-of-print prices for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh","review":"its a movie that i wasnt excepting when i rented it. it had a slow plot to the movie. i didnt like it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Cenci","review":"This is not a bad movie, yet is a quite dull movie.

The movie some scenes of torture that are well achieved as you might have expected for a Lucio Fulci, very little nudity, not a good pace of action, and a dull story. So, I honestly cannot recommend much here, except may be for those who seek to watch a no terror and not very gory Lucio Fulci film.Technically, a good, region free, DVD widescreen image transfer by Sinister Cinema.

The descriptions are vivid and lovely, yet there are undercurrents of tension, treachery, and danger involved. Although tragedy, death, and hopeless love are tightly woven into the plot, Haveli is not entirely a book about sadness, for Staples' tenacious Shabanu refuses to let go of life despite its trials. The open ending is enigmatic enough to be maddening, but the entire experience of the rest of the novel far outweighs it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a story!!!","review":"S.F.

People who are uneducated and change the face of Islam make up the rules in these provinces. I wish that the author could have acknowledged the fact that a strewed picture of Islam was shown because of the way it was misused. Women aren't treated like meat in Islam, and not all of Pakistan has such old-style rules. It is only the rural areas as I mentioned; the areas where the majority of people are illiterate. As a female of Pakistani descent, it bothered me to read a review saying that 'the real islam' was shown. I hope this reaches the author and shows her how disturbing it is to all Pakistani Muslims when characters who don't know the real beliefs and teachings of Islam are called 'religious.'

The prose is lyrical, the topic is timely, the humor is abundant, and the plot is riveting. Macon Detornay is a young white man with a love of hip-hop, and something a lot stronger than sympathy for the black cause. He quickly goes from robbing smug and bigoted white men to becoming a media superstar who calls upon whites to begin righting wrongs during a National Day of Apology. What happens on that day? Probably not what you're expecting ... not entirely anyway. This is a highly cinematic story -- I can see a movie in its future -- that thankfully lacks preachiness or one-sidedness: Mansbach is an equal-opportunity mocker. You may not like everything this book has to say, but you won't regret reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Start, Disappointment Overall","review":"What a disappointment. I truly enjoyed the first two thirds of this book, but the story dropped off so steeply at the end, that the whole book was spoiled in retrospect.It was a great concept, and Mansbach deserves praise for creating believable and three-dimensional characters. But as soon as the story moves beyond New York City, grotesque stereotypes emerge.Macon Detourney was a great character. His imagination is wild, and he tends to interpret the goings-on around him through the lens of TV and popular culture. Unfortunately, the same can be said of Mansbach's relationship to the America outside of New York City. He has seen imagery on TV, but doesn't have the same sense for real and imaginary.The hip hop writing is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very provocative and funny book.","review":"Reading \\"Angry Black White Boy\\" really gave me hope that people in our society may be able to start, on a broader level, an ongoing dialog about what \\"whiteness\\" is and how the issues surrounding whiteness make them feel.Even though the novel is flawed(I felt the ending was rushed...or was it just the flurry of my own mixed feelings about what happens?), I thought most of the characters were either dead-on portrayals that I recognized bits and pieces of from people I have known, or the ridiculous charicatures the auther obviously intended them to be.Just for having the balls to write this book, I give Mansbach a five star review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Book","review":"Run, don't walk---to get this outstanding book. I've read it, and even attended the classes taught on healing at Wright's church. This is information that the whole church ought to have, but does not yet have. His teaching will radically change your christian walk for the better. The christian church does not talk enough about or do enough about healing---and healing was part of Jesus' ministry! Yet, we do not see enough healing in the church. This book explains why. It is not true that healing passed away 2,000 years ago. God is still healing and delivering today.

I've now been free from allergies for 4 months! My husband who has been crippled with rheumatoid arthritis since he was 19 has also found freedom from pain!A note to Christians who are put off by the \\"healers\\" you see on TV: I never believed any of that was real. This book is real. The healing you'll find is real. And not a bit of it is Hollywood.

If your not willing to change destructive thinking patterns or learn to replace fear with hope this book is not for you. This book helped me to address a number of things in my life and helped me to become happy even when I am sad. It is worth every penny and I have given numerous copies away.

The people who think they've healed by his methods either weren't truly sick in the first place (read: psychosomatic), or other things they did along with his so-called healing methods worked for them.

From our past experience, we believe the truths included in this book confirm what we already believe and have witnessed.

It sounded a little wacky to hear that the sin in our lives can make us sick. By the end of the book, I was a believer! He demonstrates how the Bible clearly shows that God cannot tolerate unconfessed sin and that there are consequences for our sin, even after we trust Jesus as our Lord and Savior. Sanctification is the goal of Pr. Wright's ministry and it is now my personal goal as well. My husband and I have both been healed through applying the principles of this book to our lives.

I agree that the publisher should try to obtain those (as it is a publisher's responsibility), but I purchased this book under an endorsement of a respected guest speaker at my church. I go to see movies based on reviews by people I know personally - not critics that are recognized names. You have to start somewhere.We are a culture of pill-poppers.

The first we received had a warped floorboard which would not sit correctly, making it impossible to assemble the house. The replacement we received had a floorboard that was only slightly less warped, so we could assemble the house, but it was just warped enough that the sliding partitions won't stay in the tracks. The glue holding the walls and stairs together is weak, and both walls and the stairs have fallen apart. One of the plexiglass skylights has cracked. My sons rarely, if ever play with the dollhouse and it is still falling apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"A modern lovers dream","review":"After reading the above review, I anxiously awaited the dollhouse with the anticipation it would arrive damaged and need to be returned.

It never seems to receive the hype of other series but that is probably a good thing. Sometimes when a good series gets the recognition it deserves, it starts to change, and I wouldn't want this one to. The cast is perfect and the writing is fearless. They will take on any challenge in this politically correct world. This is one of the few laugh out loud series on television anymore, and I think Dennis Leary is a genius, who hopefully will keep on giving us more. Network television wonders why it's losing viewers. If they made something like this to watch instead of all that reality junk we are subjected to, they would change that.

The third season is still great viewing but without as many of the intense dramatic moments that occurred in both the first two seasons that still have the effects in the third.The show wonderfully eschews political correctness, and really engages the viewer with believable characters and dramatic conflict.This show has some of the best quality guest artists on TV with Tatum O'Neill, Marisa Tomei and Susan Sarandon as well as many memorable lesser known characters in minor supporting roles.

Star Jon Hall is pretty to look at, and he might even be a good thespian, though the script (and Ford Bebbe's clumsy direction) certainly don't give him any chance to prove it. The plot is as vapid as it is improbable (and confusing): A man named Robert Griffin stows away on a ship, returning to England to get the money owed to him by his \\"business partners,\\" who happened to be Mr. and Mrs. We end up with bad guy versus badder guy and gal ... with lots of plot manipulations and oversized hypodermic needles thrown in.

The cut is so amateurish that you'll notice it even if you've never heard the Hymn of the Nations. I wanted this recording for its historical interest and its artistic quality (granting that the Hymn is a potboiler and the recording quality is archaic). Since the cut ruins the film in both respects, I can't recommend this DVD. Whoever censored the film would make a good functionary in one of the countries where the Internationale found favor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well balanced adventure","review":"This first part of the trilogy has a good balance of story, characters and cameos.

Since the zipper's on the end, you can't like clothespin the thing shut.The hanging assembly with rod also reams out the plastic keyed hole on mower deck so the bag starts dragging halfway full.Not the best design, and China (?) we suppose, broke down on life-cycle quality assurance. The zipper has to go more than 50 to 100 times or what's this world coming to? The B & D website wants to sell the bag for $74!I'm careful with the equipment, but it's let me down.

The thing is poorly designed and catches on everything while you mow because it sticks out too far on one side.

My yard is small enough that I only have to empty bag 1 time. It works as intended and I haven't had any problems with it so far. If you find yourself emptying too many times, then a small bag and electric mower may not be what you need for your yard. So far, quality of workmanship is fine. I'll report back if issues come up. The only issue i've had is that you can't get close to a wall or obstruction on right side of mower because bag is hanging there, instead of a mower bag that hangs behind mower like most gasoline lawn mowers do."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't complain","review":"The bag is easy to attach, remove and empty - that's what probably matters the most I guess. On the downside the bag is a bit small (my lawn is not big, but still I need to empty it once in between. I cut the grass every 7-10 days). The side bag attaches to a separate arm on my B&D mower. Not only that it looks awkward and ugly when attached, but it also gets in way of almost anything. I have learned to live with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"This side bag style grass catcher just flat out doesnt work. In the first place, its slightly awkward to use with the mower. Second, it clogs very easily. I tried this bag on two different occasions. First, at the beginning of summer when the grass was a little longer. It clogged on first few strips of grass I mowed. I emptied the bag and made several other attempts to use it. Every time, the small opening clogged. I tried again when the grass was shorter and completely dry with the same results. Don't buy it! Save your money, and just rake your lawn. In the long run you will do a alittle more work, but with a lot less fruastration than trying to get this to work"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoever designed this should be fired!","review":"There's a reason you don't see a picture of the bagger and the mower together...if you did you wouldn't buy the bag! The bag is so small and hangs off the right side of the mower, rather than behind. I have to empty 5-7 times during the course of mowing my small lawn (less than 1000 sqft). Not only is it small but when it starts getting full it pulls the mower off balance, making it hard to turn as well as reducing the power of the mower's blades by getting clogged with grass. What's worse is that it hangs off the right side suspended with a pole like a canvas windsock. It hangs out so far that the mower doesn't fit through doors or gates. Also the bag gets in the way anytime you're trying to mow and have to maneuver around objects on your right like plants or trees.If I had known how small this bagger was and how ofter I'd be emptying its contents, I would have never bought it. I only wish B&D; made a rear bagger for the mower (which I like)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy customer","review":"The grass catcher arrived earlier than projected, was easy to install, and works as well as I expected.

Read lots of problems about them and I had one too the first month or so. The other worked but now I have problems with that one as well. I cannot zipper it all the way or the one functioning zipper comes off so I have to keep it open slightly and get pelted with cut grass till the whole plugs up.The other problem is that it does not hook on so well so if you lightly bump into something the bag falls off...not major but a pain in the neck."},{"rating":"1","title":"zipper failure","review":"Con:I purchased this bag, along with a lawn mower, two seasons ago. The inboard zipper pulled past its \\"limit point\\", and would not re-link, after only one season. This third season looks to be the last legs for the other zipper, as I have been careful to the point of nuisance, in trying to prevent the seconds' failure.The spreader/support bar, inside the bag, is also beginning to show through.The stand-off bar post will strip its plastic hold with a small amount of pressure, so mowing close to any object on your right will require pulling the mower backwards from the left.Pro:It is very easy to get on and off, and only emptying twice on a 5000+ sq. ft. yard in a Cleveburg, OH suburb."},{"rating":"1","title":"SIZE MATTERS","review":"It's true that it fits the mower, however, it fills up in 2 min. so.. it's useless.Sorry, don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black and Decker is TopNotch","review":"I really had my doubts about a side bag on an ELECTRIC mower??

The biggest problem is with the metal rod that the bag hangs on. The rod fits into a hole in the mower body, and the assembly depends on a small tab at the end of the rod fitting into a slot in the hole to keep it from flopping around. Because the mower body is plastic and the metal tab is very small, the weight of the grass caused the metal tab to wear the plastic slot after just one use, resulting in the bag flopping around and sometimes falling off."},{"rating":"2","title":"cleaner easier grass cutting","review":"when we bought the mower there was no bag included (we bought the mower at a yard sale) but we figured that there was no real need. After a couple months of mowing and hassling with the cuttings being raked by hand the wife and I decided it was time to find and price the \\"optional\\" bag. We found it and and were satisfied with the price and shipping so we bought it. It arrived and we have been very happy with the addition of the bag and the ease of using it. We live in AZ and so we have small areas of grass and for us this works fine but if you have large areas to mow you might have to empty the bag a couple times but should still be a help overall versus raking. We only gave it a 4 star since it is a little small but to be honest I don't know that the bag could have been made any larger but we are happy with it overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job but kinda small","review":"The subject pretty much says it all. The bag fits well and catches the grass just like it's supposed to. Emptying is relatively easy as the entire back end can unzip. However, the bag was a little small for my tastes.

The bag is easy to put on and take off the mower, and does a good job catching grass, though it could be a little bit larger. However, the zippers on this bag are pretty worthless. After 4 uses, one of the two zippers is already broken. Having read other reviews citing problems with the zippers, I was pretty careful with them, but to no avail. Now this month-old product has one working zipper. It would be nice if Black and Decker would put heavy duty zippers on this product!

I have a great deal of experience with children and families affected by autism. I am sure some of the character's emotions are realistic, but the ending was unrealistic, and an easy wrap-up for the author. I found it offensive and hurtful.

Unfortunately, there's very little that's visually stimulating about this video. It also isn't subtitled, characteristically of Opera D'Oro. The singers only seem to do any acting in between singing, and not during the singing -- it's like they're almost frozen while singing and then they come to life as soon as they're finished.

The short stories illustrate different aspects of life in Siberia and how little hope there was that anyone would survive in that place for 8 - 10 years. Amazingly, there is some humor. The human spirit can never be completely quenched. The author has a good writing style and conveys the horros of Kolyma."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truth about Communism that must be told","review":"Kolyma Tales is a brilliant author's way of telling the world what actually happened to him and his fellow slave laborers in the Gulag during Stalin's reign in the Soviet Union. It is a testimony to the total failure of Communism and the evils of a totaliltarianism bent on finding enemies among its own people. The stories tell of the misfortune and injustice Shalamov and countless other innocent people endured in the labor camps of arctic Siberia. He uses his 17 years there to give us heartwrenching insight into a part of history unknown to most of us. Solshenitsyn might be more famous in the West, but Shalamov's literary talent is in my opinion equally good. The fact that each story is independent from the rest makes for an easy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very cheap, poor quality case","review":"This is quite possibly the poorest quality toolset I have ever seen. I can't even see how it's worth more than $20 let alone $59.99. The case is very cheap and looks like it will fall apart, and there are not even close to 235 tools. I suppose they count each wire terminal as a tool?"},{"rating":"1","title":"You get less than what you pay for","review":"For the price you expect a fairly decent kit of tool in a decent portable case to use in your vehicle in case of emergency. The thing that struck me was the horrible quality of the case. The top latches pop off in your hands, and don't go back on easily, when you try. The tools are held in by plastic retaining clips that were broken or mis-formed. All the tools were everywhere, and 8 or 10 would not go back in their retainers. This makes for a nice rattle sound as you are driving... good fun. Most of the parts are small, clips, retainers, screw tips.... etc. You would be be better off getting a few decent tools from Home Depot or Craftsman and a small tool box. My biggest concern with the set is that it's for emergency.. and in an emergency, I would hate to rely on this quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Tools, Poor Organization.","review":"these are great tools but when you open and close the set, it causes the tools to fall out and get lost and mixed up. so if you buy this, you might want to buy a separate slide out tool chest. but i definitely recommended this"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality tools","review":"I bought this tool set hoping for a medium quality tool set for a great price, and it came in way below my expectations. First of all it's not actually a 235 piece set unless you count all the screws and connectors that were so graciously included. The needle-nose pliers were bent in the set I received, and overall the tool set is constructed poorly. The case makes the tools hard to get in and out of their positions, and some of the tools fall out when you carry the case gently. I would look elsewhere for a tool kit, because this one isn't worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tools bad","review":"There tools brake and cause injury. This leaves lots of liability, sure if it's for home use you hurt yourself and you obviously don't care about yourself anyway, because you bought allied junk, but think about those others who use them, you don't want to kill your loved ones because you saved a nickel on hand tools."},{"rating":"2","title":"Introducing Kharis!","review":"When Universal dusted off the concept of their mummy, they changed the story quite a bit from the original movie with Boris Karloff. Somehow the reincarnated creature was not quite as menacing as Boris was, but these movies are still a great deal of fun to watch.With egyptian priests, tanna leaves (which by the way, always looked like an ingredient I use when I make soup...bay leaves!) and a moldy ol' mummy, what else could an old monster movie fan want?By the way, the longer the mummy series went, the more it became apparent to me that the only way Kharis could get you was if he got the drop on you from behind or snuck up on you. With all those bandages and 3,000 year old joints, he hardly moved faster than a snail's pace. I'm not much of a runner, but I know I could out-run him! But that misses the whole point. Anyone faced with a creature such as Kharis would no doubt be petrified with fright and couldn't move!Recommended, along with the rest of the movies in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Books makes you re-think math and shows how to get math problems right -- always!","review":"We had heard about this book from our cousins and were eager to purchase it. This book shows easy ways to always get the right answers for any addition, subtraction, multiplication or division problem. This problem solving technique is especially valuable to know when you're working with large numbers. The books is entertaining with illustrations by the author. Each section has a parent section and a children's section. You will definitely want to get your scratch paper out and go through the problems. The book includes lots of workbook pages to get accustomed to the technique. I wish math teachers would read this book. But since they probably won't teach this, parents and kids should read it and get a great insight into math. The Check Digit technique is easy to do -- it involves basic addition and in some cases simple multiplication."},{"rating":"2","title":"love helmut lotti","review":"viaamse nachten cd was exactely what i expected being mostley pop songs sung by helmut lotti clear velvet voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"crap phone","review":"im getting a way better phone the sanyo 7400 thats a realy goodphone ive had no problems with the phone you can watch cartoons news weather and heaps of other stuff download heaps of thingsyou should so get this phone its so great ijf i were you i would get it its worth $600 dollars if your not allowed to get it it means your poor so get it deffinetly its the best phone well not the best phone but a really great great awesome phone so get it as soon as you can"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It","review":"I went from a very cheap, do nothing phone to this one.

Yes it is a very cute phone, yes it tiny. The pictures and video are alot of fun but if you are buying a phone to actually talk to someone, stay away from this one. The sound quality was horrible, even worse if calling other sprint cell phones. The best way to describe it, is it sounds like you are in a tunnel. The phone was exchanged for the Sanyo 8200 and what a world of difference in sound quality.

I love Samsung phones but this phone is is awful. Softare keeps crashing and screen gets fuzzy/overlaps. I took this phone back to Sprint and the new phone is acting the same way.

I wasted 250 dollars on this piece of crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for in the shower!","review":"This is a good razor for in shower. I don't get cuts, and I take a lot less time shaving with this. My only complaint is the soap/moisturizer bar around the blade wears out at the bottom and leaves a lot on top you really can't use. It is also a little expensive, but really helps me speed up my shower routine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great in the shower for those short on time!!!!","review":"I am a mother of three and I LOVE this razor. I have used it for over 5 years (before I had kids actually) and I find its a great time saver and a very effective razor. I love that I don't need to lather up with soap or shaving cream and that the handle is large and rubber so it doesn't get slippery. It is true that it doesn't last as long as other razors because the soap/shaving lotion strip wears out before the razor, but that is the only downside and lets be honest I don't get to shave that often anyway so they last a while for me. The other nice thing about this particular product is the \\"sensitive skin, fragrance free\\" aspect. I tend to have a reaction to most fragrances and every soap dries out my skin, but that has not been the case with this product. I tried the Cucumber Melon and although I liked the fragrance my skin felt like it was burning after I used it. I would say give this a try, I am certainly glad that I did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glides easily, but doesn't cut well.","review":"Positives: Smells good and has a feminine rounded handle. When I used it I was surprised how easily it slide across my skin. Negative: However, when I checked the quality of the several passes by running my hand across the \\"grain\\" I was shocked how much stubble was left. Not at all pleased considering all those blades. Personally I have had better leg shaves with cheap disposable single blades. What a let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intuition shaver","review":"Bought this as a replacement for an older one.

It added immensely to the remainder of the west bound drive and I used it to locate a couple of missed sites on the way back. US 80 doesn't have the current popularity of Route 66 or the Lincoln Highway but, as the \\"All-Year Southern Route\\" for \\"Coast-to-Coast\\" travel in the early days of the automobile, it was once one of the more important roadways in America. This is a great \\"roadie\\" book with plenty of history, sightseeing tips, and those details that help you put together your own two-lane experience. It is well written and illustrated and would probably make good reading for the arm chair traveler but it's real place is in the glove compartment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crock Cooking base","review":"This is a great product, especially for cheap pieces of meat. I start it the night before on low and when I get home from work the next day, it is awesome. You can add the vegetables you like and the taste is great. It has a little salty taste, but not too much (especially if you add quartered potatoes. I had a packet from a sale in my cupboard. It was a few years old and made stuff really salty, but the fresher packets that I ordered were much better. No need to chop up the meat if you buy a big cheap chunk. It will fall apart when you finish cooking it. My husband and son love it and they are very picky eaters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it just me or does everyone just love salt?","review":"So I read all these great reviews, and went out and bought this seasoning. Threw it in the crock at 8:00 AM, went to fix dinner at 5:00 PM. My daughter kept saying it didn't smell very good. The beef was fresh, and Angus beef at that. I have to admit the beef stew didn't smell very good either.OMG, it was so amazingly salty. I couldn't believe it. I can deal with salty, but this was inedible. I ended up throwing out the gravy and potatoes, saving the meat figuring I could rinse the gravy off and \\"re-do\\" it my way another time. It was the seasoning, didn't smell good and sooooo salty.So disapointing, I figured with 14 five star reviews I couldn't go wrong with this, but it did go wrong, horribly.Never again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome resource for Arts & Crafts","review":"This book is a fantastic, genuinely period (1920) sourcebook for Arts and Crafts, Art Nouveau/Jugendtil/Secessionist, early Art Deco, Mission/Bungalow and related styles of handicrafts and arts.

It covers the complete history as well as today's Diablo. For those interested in the history of Lamborghini, the author has included several pieces of information that would otherwise be unknown and several pictures that have never been publicly published outside of this book of prototype cars and concept cars.Keep in mind that the book is not intended as a complete history or in depth detail on each car, but simply a reference guide to the many models that Lamborghini has made through the years.I actually have 3 copies, each one as they come out to include updates.

Just like Power Rangers, \\"Mystic Knights of Tir Na Nog\\" features plenty of problems coupled with witless plots and senseless acting. The realism is nearly non-existent - the dragons look like they were taken from a low-grade science fiction featurette ( they don't breath gouts of flame - they shoot projectiles! ), the weaponry, armor, and barding is completely loose and looks like it's ready to fall off (especially the helm on the Knightess of Air, which is several sizes too large), and the characters are simply laughable ( one of the Knights is black. I see the point of preventing all racism, but, come on! , these are supposed to be Celts! ). The acting is simply idiotic, the scripts have gaping holes and uniteresting lines, and, best of all, only half of the characters can speak with a half-way proper Irish accent.I beg of you, please DO NOT buy this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie rocks! Yeah!","review":"I love this movie, and the television show. The Mystic Knights are sooooo cool. I used to watch it every day after school, until they sadly, *sniff*, took it off the air. My friends and I used to have Mystic Knights parties and dress up as the characters. We then acted out the episode. Our favorite Mystic Knight is Angus. . .and Rohan, and Garrett( even though he isn't in the movie), and Deirdre. We are annoyed with Ivar because he always wears the same outfit, which is always the same color. It would be sooooo cool to have the entire series available for purchase. It should be on DVD. Yeah.

I've played guitar for the last 16 years and NEVER before have I been slapped in the face with such melodic licks, riffs and leads. This album is tremendous. I haven't heard music this emotional since I purchased Yngwie Malmsteen's \\"Marching Out\\" album in the mid-80s. I can honestly say, Arch Enemy has nowhere to go but up. I wish them all the luck in the world ... not that they need it, of course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome slice of melodeath","review":"No offense to Angela Gossow, but it was a mistake to replace original vocalist Johan Liiva. Arch Enemy truly rocked with this lineup - it just works. The level of melodic intensity is incredible. And those guitar solos, wow. The Ammott brothers know how to construct a solo made of pure awesome. Just check out \\"Silverwing\\", that is the among the greatest solos ever recorded..Only four stars because even though the songwriting is really good, its not as remarkable as the Ammott brother's playing.

The next time I tried to use it, however, I saw the same problem noted in other reviews for this product. Namely, my computer no longer saw the drive. What was happening, at least in my case, is that the power connector to the drive itself was not snug and the drive ended up losing power. If I fiddled with the connector long enough power would be restored, and my computer would recognize it again. Unfortunately, I had to keep my finger on the connector to maintain power to the drive, so using it to actually create DVDs was pointless. I do not believe the connector was damaged since I only had the product in my possession for four days, and was very careful with it during that time.

This book was apparently rushed to market, as it has no central concept, a few typos, and the book actually ends in the middle of a sentence. Most of the \\"unseen\\" photos are boring, blurry shots from 1960s television that we could have done without.

Larry David's departure didn't impact the show adversely and the ensemble cast, one of the finest in television history, continue to work seamlessly together to deliver scene upon scene of laughter. Through the nearly 10 years that Seinfeld has been off the air, I continue to hear every day references in conversation to his classic lines, i.e., Not That There's Anything Wrong With That, Yada Yada, I'm a Day Person..... and the list goes on and on.

The fact that it is still in print says a lot about it. It must be a well-regarded standard text. The preface says that the book evolved from notes for a two-term course presented by the authors to grad students at the MIT Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics.The book contains chapters on Review of Fluid Mechanics, Constant Density Inviscid Flow, Singular Pertubation Problems, Effects of Viscosity, Thin Wing Theory, Slender Body Theory, 3D Wings in Steady Subsonic Flow, 3D Thin Wings in Steady Supersonic Flow, Supersonic Drag, Use of Flow Reversal Theorems, Interference and Nonplanar Lifting Surface Theories, Transonic Small Disturbance Flow, and Unsteady Flow.The book looks to be a very complete and very mathematical treatment of subsonic and supersonic aerodynamics. Unfortunately, the math was well beyond what I remember from my long-ago calculus classes. It is probably a 4 to 5 star book for its target audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for the Mathematical Minded","review":"This is a great book that should benefit readers with a strong mathematical background at senior graduate or postgraduate level in aerospace engineering studies. Those outside this bracket may find the book a challenge to understand and follow as they can very easily be overwhelmed by the mathematics.

Basic derivations for airfoils and wings given in other texts such as Anderson are rapidly skipped over.

As a graduate student myself, I would be extremely afraid of taking the class this book arose from. Expect a pounding headache after reading this text."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mistake","review":"This book is deceptively titled. It gives no inklng of the density of the math involved. It should properly be titled \\"A rigorous mathematical treatment of the Aerodynamics ...\\" I doubt I could have followed this back when I was immersed in physics and engineering courses in college.

So, not a single question? Instead the filmmaker minced around like a junior high school nerd on the \\"question\\" of the designer's sexual orientation? Terribly boring and tedious.

Sometimes I prefer the Herreweghe - Amazon-search B000005Z2W - for its clear counterpoint and sober beauty, but I think Jochum's pacing & phrasing is the most dignified. What a wand that man used on his Bach! What a pity that his complete Christmas Oratorio is out of print!P.S. August 2006: Yes, I did need both Jochum and Herreweghe, because I had not found Rilling's b-minor mass yet.

Or perhaps it is a mystical appreciation of the One as the Cloud of Unknowing.Trust me on this: when the infamous Karajan alternative from 1974 - the Festival of Soup (Bach: Mass in B minor) - is streets ahead in terms of clarity, presence, diction and the separation of powers, it is time to complain.It is impossible to comment on the mettle of the soloists in this EMI performance. They look B-grade on paper (in a non-perfunctory sense) but perhaps on the day they surpassed themselves or fell to the rung below.

It is an internal PCI card that must be installed inside your computer case, (sorry laptop users) but the capture quality is very good.

Charles Miller (Modern Technology in Bible Prophecy) has pulled together the books of the bible that are prophecy and clearly related them to each other and to modern times. This interpretation is so new and so clear that he surely must have been inspired by the Spirit of God to understand these prophetic messages. Montague has made some good analogies, but could make many more. Since the early 80's many of the prophecies dealing with modern technology have come to pass, but we were unable to understand them prior to the invention of the technolgy. Montague has not addressed these messages in his book, but perhaps he will as he seems to be searching just like the rest of us, and with his background, sooner or later will come to a full understanding which he can then share with us."},{"rating":"2","title":"has three of NWA's best songs","review":"although this album may not have much else, it does have three of NWA's best songs, Real niggaz, appetite for destruction, and niggaz 4 life"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definition of a hip hop classic","review":"This CD is better than Straight Outta Compton.

But most of it is sexist humor about accusing woman of being gold-diggers and giving directions of killing them.If you are a fan of NWA, Dre,Cube, Eazy, or Ren.

And the Nazi's like N.W.A. were hailed as articulate and socially conscious spokespeople for a generation.

It's a really good CD, but has a lot of skits in it. Ice Cube did take from the group's impact when he left, but not as much as people make it out to be. He did put in his contribution to the group, though. A good CD nonetheless. The Dayz of Wayback is a really good song, more of a reminiscing song to sit back and chill out to. My personal favorite off of the CD. Get yourself some money together and go out and get this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Title Fits Them Perfectly!","review":"Ice Cube went solo & had a successful career. Even though some of his songs were pretty harsh language wise, Cube always told a story, painted a picture of a young misinformed Blackman from the ghetto. Cube gave you the negative but balanced it with the positive. Cube's counterparts NWA completely fell into the bottomless pit of ignorance & couldn't recover. NWA's so called \\"street knowledge\\" in reality was \\"street nonsense.\\" Without Cube writing the lyrics, NWA relies on ignorant word play & the most worst display of misogyny I have ever heard.

Saying That, Erick's beats are slightly different from Strickly Business' James Brown and Roger samples. Unfinished is more 1989 than SB. Parrish Smith once again is the secret weapon and knockout punch with his wordplay, following in the footsteps of \\"DMC\\". My absolute favorite track on here is \\"Fame\\". My favorite line on Fame is:\\" My father always told me to wise up son, because if you hang out with 9 broke friends you're bound to be the tenth one. So I cut friends off and P went for self, me & Erick Sermon and no one else. Strictly writing def lyrics to my best ability with the crazy imagination as my only utility.

He asserts to write about sexual renunciation in early Christianity. Instead he basicly writes about sexual renunciation in among the Gnostics. There is a good reason why devoted Christians of all denominations view Gnosticism as a heresy. Gnosticism is very much rooted in pagan, i.e. Indian and Persian religious esoteric beliefs. As scholars like A. Vööbus (\\"History of Asceticism in the Syrian Orient\\") have shown, sexual asceticism is not anything originally Jewish or Christian, but has been taken over by certain groups of Christians from Eastern religions. Of course, these groups have heavily influenced church Christianity and made Christians and non-Christians alike believe that celibacy is a truly christian virtue. However, church christianity has never been exactly the same kind of Christianity as the one depicted in the New Testament."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Iron Man","review":"I wish more Marvel fans demanded the old classics like this one.

The video features two episodes of the original cartoon series and has a (hilarious in it's own right) short intoduction by Stan Lee. This series, launched by Marvel Comics in 1966, used the original Jack Kirby panels from the comics and set them in motion. All of the attention is applied to detailed still cells, such as that given to the Crimson Dynamo (in the episode of the same name), that often have some post kirby work (such as eye and lip movement) added to create movement. This may sound like a boring animation technique, but when the original art Jack Kirby, the result is incredible. It has a real vintage feel, like a weighty old tube radio.

Very young children (especially those interested in dinosaurs) will understand little of the story, but will appreciate the multitude of dinosaur pictures.

You will be replacing batteries very often with this mouse.I have already switched one out for a wired basic MS optical mouse.

This is a known issue according to Microsoft, and they claim they are working on it. The problem is that other services running, including PCMService which is a critical part of Dell Media Experience, conflict with MS's Intellipoint software. If you disable this (or a host of other possible culprits) using MSCONFIG, the problem will go away. Unfortunately, disabling one service to make another work is not a reasonable option for most users. This is just another problem that MS admits but is unwilling to come up with a solution.

I play a lot of games on my PC, so mouse precision is vital for success.Pros: Great \\"feel\\" - fits my hand perfectly. Side buttons are well placed. Slides pretty smoothly. I even like its look.Cons: It's a wireless mouse, so it needs batteries. This particular wireless mouse goes through batteries quite quickly. This mouse has horrible accuracy. It basically requires a good mouse pad, and even then I can see my cursor jump and stop when I move my mouse in a single direction, even right now. This not only makes it hard to game, but it makes it hard to, say, edit a certain letter in a Word document.If you want a mouse to browse facebook, watch netflix and watch youtube, sure, buy this.

I had the same problem with a Microsoft Wireless Intellimouse Explorer.

The magnifying feature didn't work and the motion wasn't nearly as smooth as my Windows experience. The performance was so poor that I returned it within a couple of days.A further note on my work mouse. Oddly enough, after several weeks of use, it reversed itself. When I push the mouse up, the curser goes down. And when I pull the mouse towards me, the curser goes up on the screen.

So it depends on your needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor manufacturing","review":"My first mouse of this type was DOA and never worked. I returned it. The second one worked right out of the box. While playing around with it, I activated the magnifier. Neat idea I thought, until I could not turn it off.

I think I turned off the warnings, so now it doesn't annoy me all the time, but if it stops responding you'll need to make sure the receiver is close enough and change the batteries if that doesn't work.Amazon won't let me change the star rating to 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"can no longer use after 2 months -- bad scroll wheel","review":"I am a web media professional, so I admit that I am an excessive scroll wheel user, but a mouse should be able to take any non-abusive input that is given to it for at least a year.

I only gave this set 4 stars because the other videos are not that good. They do not grasp her attention at all and she does not learn anything from them. The letter factory is the only one worth while. If I could do it all over again, I would not buy the entire set. I would only buy the Letter Factory video by itself. We have had it for 2 weeks and she is already spelling out words because she knows each letters sound. Amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good stuff!","review":"We haven't viewed all of the DVD's yet...just Letter Factory & Talking Words Factory. My 2 yr old loves the Letter Factory. He walks around imitating the letter sounds. After a couple viewings, he began using the magnetic letters on Grandma's refrigerator; saying the letter, making the sound, and saying the word for the letter. While my son was playing with his plastic farm animals, I observed him panting like the \\"H\\" (for hot) and saying, \\"Horse is hot and tired. He needs a drink,\\" then gave the horse some water. He progressed thru each animal using the appropriate animal name and declaring each one hot and tired, giving them water. He's learning and absorbing a lot of great information and is enjoying himself while doing it! We watched the Talking Words Factory, but my son is still a bit young for those lessons, so we'll save it until he's ready...but it appears to be pretty good also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leapfrop Learning DVDs 5-pack","review":"My son loves these videos and they have increased his reading skills tremendously in the few weeks we have had them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great learning Tool","review":"My 4-year-old loves watching The Letter Factory series.

When I found out there was a 5-pack available I purchased them all, and was not disappointed. When the DVDs arrived, my kids wanted to watch them right away. They are short 30min videos, that hold my kids' attention, and had them singing and learning their letters and numbers in no time."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!!!","review":"These are probably one of the best set of children's DVD's that I have ever bought!

They are funny and full of action and music. My almost four year old son and six year old nephew love them. They watch these DVDs repeatedly.

You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"learning tool","review":"Since watching these movies my 4 1/2 yrd old can recognize letters and is excited about making words.

I highly recommend this set to everyone! Even my two year old, who is a late talker, says the alphabet and sounds. This is a great tool and well worth the investment! Great for the car... instead of movies! Your kids will love learning because these DVD's make learning fun!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I gave the pack to my friend for her baby boy of 3 1/2 years old as a present. English is not our first language here in South Africa. She phoned me the other day to relate her experiences.

But these are not.Be warned that this set does not contain the original episodes as aired in the UK. These are the BBC America versions of the episodes. This means they are cut down to 42 minutes (about 10 minutes removed from each episode!) and some content has been censored for language and nudity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hex is Amazing","review":"Hex is an amazing, though underrated, show that wasn't a chance to flourish. Fortunately for us, it is out on DVD and is well worth the purchase. Billed as the UK's answer to Charmed and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, it is so much more than that. It has a mythology and premise all its own, which separate it from its American counterparts. At its core, it is the story of fallen angels who plot to take over the world, but it is also a story about love - between a man (or is that angel) and a woman, and a man and his child. There are many interesting twists and turns, special effects, and a great cast led by the incredible Michael Fassbender. Definitely worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Better than Buffy","review":"Excellent supernatural drama. Focuses on the whole good vs. evil battle while also weaving in problems that anyone might be able to relate to. Very enjoyable. Unlike Buffy the main characters actually having acting talent. A show that portrays sexuality in a more real way than most US shows. Has a little something for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heck(x)","review":"After seeing the first two DVDs for Hex, I was disappointed. There is minimal story/plot line, the characters are lame, the special effects are strictly amateur. There are too many un-explained things going on that are obviously meant to keep us hooked, but not developed quickly enough to maintain our interest.The main villain has little personality. The main heroine is clueless too far into the series. She really needed to develop a brain that could keep up with the events - example, Veronica Mars, first two seasons. The main character was hard to visualize becoming a force to be reckoned with, but since she left after the first season (6 episodes), that becomes a moot point.I didn't bother with the third DVD. Although the reviews posted on Amazon were mostly positive, I have to agree with the few negative reports."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great British Drama","review":"The British really know how to create a fantasy/scfi drama series.

I watched it on BBC America and it was good but the DVD was way better. There is more to the shows than you saw on television. The only down fall is why did it take so long and why was it cancelled after only two seasons? Apparently there was to be a third season but it was scraped so there is only two. As for the length this was a show in Britian a couple of years ago. Overall this is a good show and I can not wait for the next season to come out"},{"rating":"1","title":"Muy Lenta...","review":"Demasiado lenta y aburrida, ademas en la segunda temporada al personaje de Cassie le dan cuello, demostrando lo malo que es el guion y tratando de darle empuje a la historia otorgando el protagonico a otra persona, aun asi resulta una mala serie, mejor compren Buffy o Charmed!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Series","review":"I wanted to say I enjoyed this series, it started a bit slow but pick up quickly.

He hasn't worn them yet outside, in the freezing cold. However, he was very happy with them. I will say the size does run a bit big (even if you have layers on underneath) and they run a bit long. He's 5'10 and the XL is a bit long on him. Nothing some cuffing or hemming can't fix.

So, popping it into the DVD player, I was excited. I write this as I watch the film in digust.The reviews I have read were misleading, for this movie was not an instant classic, but one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is entirely in black and white (which annoys me), the acting doesn't do it for me, and it's not as scary as I said it was.The idea for the plot is very stupid. Two guys just appear in his house, and he doesn't do anything for about a half hour?

Somehow, I made it through a third of this simplistic drivel before finally giving up in disgust. No realistic plot, high school-level writing capability, and not a single character to give a damn about. I'm absolutely astonished that ANYONE with half a brain would give this adolescent garbage 3 stars, much less 5! Dialogue was completely stilted and never came close to believeable; sex scenes - and I enjoy them as much as the next person - I could've penned in high school. Who's writing all these glowing reviews? 15-yr-olds? Perhaps Mr. Massey himself? Utterly stupid and not worth the time OR money. Take a good nap instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a poorly written comic book","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read.

Yep, it costed him a lot when he stepped out of his normal habit and didn't FOLLOW his CONSCIENCE!!!! True enough some good came out of it. BUT a whole lot of bad and ugly came out of it ti!

In contrast with, say, NWA and Eazy-E's output of the same era, you get the eerie feeling that Ice Cube has a pretty limp grasp on the distinction between fact and fiction; to him it's not about kicking a crass, politically incorrect, but ultimately amusing rhyme, but he seems to be incessantly trying to compensate his feelings of aggression and of inferiority. He reminds me of this one kid, back in the day, who didn't just get a kick out of watching a horror movie but seemed to build his entire philosophy on it.

In 1959, the good Dr. warned against Blacks \\"stooping to the low and primitive methods and rhetoric of our enemies\\" and this is it! However, while Cube was supposedly all 'fight the power\\" and militant, he was also a spokesman for St. Ides Malt Liquor and songs like \\"Nappy Dugout\\" did nothing to uplift Black people. The fact is, this kind of garbage sold well among confused and misguided Black people (and some equally maladjusted Whites) with no direrction in the early 90s and when the market for such junk (mercifully) died out, Cube went back to gangster rapping.

My thoughts?The first 4 tunes are great feeling somewhat like a cross between the gloomy but experimental atmosphere of Merciless while containing some of the accessible qualities of Selfless on the title track \\"Messiah\\". The vocals are more in the \\"sung\\" vien than in the gutteral yells Justin's vocals at this point were more known for- he does finally go for the throat towards the end of \\"Scape Goat\\". The rest of this EP are basically 4 re-envisioned Dub versions of the first 4 tracks.

It was originally recorded between Selfless and Songs of Love and Hate and as a transition album it's pretty fascinating. The four original tracks layed down here are some of Godflesh's most downtrodden and gloomy to date. Messiah is decidedly forlorn, like wind whistling through desolate trees, and everything has a alien, marooned quality. Overall I'd say Messiah patterns itself more after Selfess then Songs of Love and Hate, though you can definately feel them trying to break out of the cold, clinical cycle they were trapped in and inject some swing into their music. Messiah is kind of like a long-buried archeological find; it gives us context and provides the right perspective. Stay away from four remixes, though, which are extremely pointless and should have never made the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as the first one...","review":"I love the idea of these books and have chosen many books to read by reading the very cool summaries in this one.

Gilbert De'Ath's encounters with the modern world in the form of multiplex cinemas, teenage fanzines, video recorders, pulp cinema and Pakistani newsagents is both hilarious and touching. A vast improvement on the somewhat lacklustre screen treatment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why not read the original instead?","review":"Mr. Adair may be a competent writer, but a reading of _Death in Venice_, by Thomas Mann, will reveal that he owes a great deal to Herr Mann.

At first, I was going to just write it off as being another \\"world fusion\\" attempt, however, I decided to give it a try... WOW, to my surprise, it was absolutely beautiful!The shamisen is such an emotion evoking instrument as it is, and paired with electronic beats and world music influences... well, a completely new sound is created... and it is SO refreshing... and beautiful! I love how the traditional sounds of the shamisen meld with the modern components of the music... the rhythms are great, too.Most importantly, I can listen to this album and not get bored. The music takes you on a journey, without staying in one place too long. Oh, and the kodo drums are amazing!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can fit more than 2 kids on this!","review":"I love this stroller - only thing is you can't really steer with one hand but that's probably to be expected with a double stroller.

Bizarre in some ways but rarely risque, crude or embarrassing. A little off the mainstream of humour but it still has strong narratives (although some are quite improbable) - suspend your sense of disbelief and enjoy the 'straight' (and gorgeous) nurse/wife and Ardel Hanlon's plight of trying to satisfy two unsatiable demands on his talents and time. Has some marvellous cameo roles in, Mrs Craven; the nurse/wife's parents; and neighbour Tyler (the reformed jukie who travels, in his mind mostly, through the universe!)

I thought that after the Lewinsky scandal blew up nothing could upset me about this administration, I was wrong! President Clinton has clearly betrayed our nation and thanks to Bill Gertz and his book Betrayl, America will see what happens when we let politicians tell us that \\"character doesn't matter\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just two questions","review":"After reading this book, the only two relevant questions remaining for the Clintons and their minders should be:Cigarrette?Blindfold?Those who voted, cheered, and applauded this pack of traitors into office share a portion of the complicity for the betrayal of our nation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gertz's Grim Fairy Tale","review":"Bill Gertz weaves a tall tale for Clinton-haters, trotting out the old favorites: evil Ruskies, evil Chinese, etc., and he gives these people what they want: a calculatedly deceptive and improbable yarn. The only proven chicanery here is that Bill Gertz is going to get some money for this right-wing fairy tale. But that's not the point here, is it? Highly recommended as bedtime reading for right-wing zealots--191 pages of sour grapes (remember to put the light out, bonzo)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply political rubbish","review":"From a European point of view, the American foreign politics under William Jefferson Cliton was among the best since a long time...He contributed to more stability in the Middle East and to the peace in Northern Ireland.Think about the NATO extension to Hungary, Poland and Czech Republic or the NATO intervention in Kosovo saving the lives of thousands of people and guarateeing them a right to stay in their homeland.Saying that Clinton's foreign policy has weakened the USA is simply wrong. Everyone in the world is aware that for the moment, the USA are the only superpower and play an important and respectable role in international politics (except some minor flaws like the erronous politics towards Irak and Cuba and it's poor financial support of the United Nations for which of course the Republicans are more responsible than Clinton)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clinton's lack of morality has extended to the world level.","review":"Bill Clinton and his administration have been exposed in this carefully researched and documented book as a disaster for not only the U.S. but for the rest of the world as well. Because of Clinton's vacillating, irresponsible foreign policy over the past six years, nuclear weapons abound in multiple forms. Suitcase-size nukes, for heaven's sake, may have been sold on the Russian black market to the highest bidders. Bill Gertz has documented outright lies to Congress by Madeline Albright about North Korea's nuclear buildup; he exposes the continuing give-away of millions of dollars to Russia; and he explains how Clinton actually helped China develop nuclear weapons which are now capable of wiping out much of this country.We are all much less secure than we were in 1992 because of Clinton and the Democrats' willingness to \\"fudge\\" on what is right in favor of preserving their power and getting more funds for their party. It's very unsettling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well written. Facts supported quite nicely.","review":"The author discusses very serious issues that have been covered up by this President and the main stream media for years. Finally, the truth about this administration is being reported. It is extremely difficult to believe that someone like the current occupant on Pennsyvania Avenue would ever occupy the White House. I hope and pray that this travesty never ever occurs again. Wake up America!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the editor?","review":"Bill Gertz book has a lot of very damning evidence that the Clinton administration has severely reduced U.S. security in a variety of areas. However the material is very badly organized.This volume deserves some severe editing. It appears to be a compilation of newspaper articles thrown together in a mishmosh of facts.Good information, but a pretty bad read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too damn important a book not to buy!!!","review":"Gertz has bravely taken classified information (that was provided to him by even braver government officials) and has written a cautionary book on the foibles of Clintonian foreign policy. In each episode we see how Clinton is selling out our national security and US supremacy in foreign affairs, so skillfully crafted by the likes of Jefferson and Kissinger, for the sake of momentary political gain.In this book we do learn ahead of time the true nature of Clinton's legacy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Writing, Editing and Fact Checking. Almost Fiction!","review":"This book will appeal to the low brow conspirisy theory crowd who listen to the likes of Limbaugh or Alex Jones. Unfounded claims of security breaches and secrets sold will appease many of the right wing extremists who are a minority to the thinking majority. POORLY WRITTEN AND EDITED! If you want Conspiracy Fiction read Brad Steiger's 'Alien Rapture' which by the way, has more truth in it that this wasted paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I was lured into starting this book when, scanning rapidly, I mistook the author as a writer for the Washington Post rather than the Washington Times. That impression was quickly erased when I saw a dedication to the Rev. Sun Myung Moon and his wife on the acknowledgements page. The rest was all too predictable. I finished it out of morbid curiosity.Don't waste your time. Any truthful content that this book might contain is hopelessly obscured by the strident tone, reckless accusations, and obvious bias."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure...!","review":"If you *still* can't let go of your hatred for Bill Clinton and you're still upset that the Kenneth Starr Witch Hunt didn't turn up enough to remove him from office or land him in prison, then go ahead and buy this book.

The author's allegations, half-truths and inuendo are largely unsupported and not credible. Has the author (or anybody else) asked himself, \\"what does Clinton have to gain by committing treasonous acts like those described\\" and why would the cabinet, including a Republican Def Secy, and the Joint Chiefs not stand up to such acts?The only thing more disturbing than reading the book was reading the reviews of the other right wing nuts."},{"rating":"2","title":"TREASON: Clinton, his Administration and any US Company","review":"An excellent read, and shocking blow. I'm totally aghast of what this Administration has done for the love of money and power. Did the end justify the means? For all those Americans who voted for this pathetic excuse of a citizen, many thanks from the children of this great nation. What's left of the department of Justice should go after all of these bastards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well researched, so the critics attack the readers","review":"This was a well researched book by someone who followed the administration's dealings and had access to resources and people that few other in the media could or would tap.

This book is just more of the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phony \\"journalism\\" from a biased source","review":"I bought this book because I have serious reservations and questions about the foreign policy and military practices of the Clinton administration. I hoped for a critical appraisal that would shed some light on those policies and practices and where and how we've gone wrong. What this turns out to be, however, is a lot of heat with precious little light. It's nothing more than a polemic by a paid mouthpiece of the rabid right. There may be some truth in here, but it's impossible to discern, mixed in as it is with one probably imaginary \\"anonymous source\\" after another.If you sop up the Limbaugh / McCord / Buchanan line, you'll love this. If you want a balanced assessment of the policies of the last six years, this ain't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written For Dollars. .

Crawford played Chief Dan Matthews, a no non-sense Police Chief who always got the bad guy. The show was filmed on location throughout sections of southern California and dealt with a different crime story each week. In my opinion, this is by far the best Police Show of all time because it deals with everyday crimes. There was even one episode that dealt with bad driving and traffic tickets, something that most individuals had to deal with. If Highway Patrol does become available again, Buy it! If you have never seen a Police Show from the 1950's, this one will open your eyes to just how good television use to be. 2150.............out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show","review":"My husband and I like this show a lot.

I suggest you check out George Anderson's book SAP Best Practices in Implementation too, as it is a bit more up to date technology-wise and covers staffing quite well, in a similarly realistic manner. Some of the older SAP implementation books aren't too bad either, though the slant is usually exclusively consultant-focused rather than presenting both sides.

It definately taught me a thing or two about the market that I didn't know about.

This is definitely one of the best live albums I have EVER heard. Better than some Metallica material, and they put out some GREAT live stuff. This is worth every penny. Sepultura (not Max and band) are a true asset to metal. Don't say anything about being metal or liking metal without owning this. With tracks like \\"Troops Of Doom\\" and \\"Arise,\\" I mean come on, how can anyone who wants blazing thrash NOT buy this?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid guide.. lots of content","review":"This guide is packed with some pretty good strategies for all three sides in Battle for Dune.

Dr. Fuquay was my advisor and professor. He is a very knowledgeable man. Dr. Fuquay has a knack for teaching. This book is one of the best books I've read on reproduction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rushed to print?","review":"I have used several Kaplan books to help prepare students for the SAT and AP exams. Most Kaplan books are contain good examples and excellent test taking advice.This book, however, seems to have been rushed to print. In the math sections alone, I found 21 typos / errors. These are not simple mistakes; these typos / errors affect the student's understanding of the problems and concepts.Perhaps the verbal and writing sections have fewer mistakes. I haven't checked those yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"MANY errors! I would NOT recommend it...","review":"I would not recommend this book. I was tutoring someone today in mathematics and so far I've found many math problems that have typos. This book was NOT carefully edited. These are not mere typos either. Either the problem will be incomplete, the answer will not be in the options, or the explanation/solutions will solve a different problem than asked. I am shocked that such a reputable company let this book get by with all of these errors. Avoid spending your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not edited","review":"It seems as though Kaplan decided to skip the editing for Math. I have found almost one mistake in every two pages.Even in English, they are trying to teach you but are making grammatical errors themselves. Definitely not recommended. I've always relied on Kaplan, but this edition is ridiculous; waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Horrible","review":"I have never seen so many vital mistakes in a book which is so important. For starters, there are mistakes in the decimal placements in the math answers, constant contradictions in the reading sections, and horrible essay examples- with more typos than I can count, even in the \\"Perfect 6\\" essays- in the essay portions. And that doesnt even begin to explain how poorly organized this book is. The topics are so jumbled around that it's impossible to get a good review on topics that you actually want to study.In short, DO NOT BUY. Get CollegeBoard's SAT study book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"krappy kaplan","review":"this book is filled with the same editing errors found in previous kaplan products. i read ben's review and in my opinion he never needed the book, perhaps he could edit a future addition (just kidding-edition)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some errors found.

This book will give you reason to pause and think about the possiblity of adding an older child to your family. Cindy tells the truth about the pluses and minuses of this kind of family-building. She shares a special loving insight into the mind of a post-institutionalized child who has the heart to worry about the fate of \\"her baby\\" in China.

I've recommended it to several, including one friend in the process of adopting from China and another open to the possibility of an international adoption. I'm an adoptive mom and even though the conditions of our adoptions are different, I could tell how sincere and real this book was and appreciated Champnella's honesty. The book brought tears to my eyes several times - it was definitely touching. Jaclyn and Lee's stories were told in a simple way and the stories are just so fascinating that I quickly read my way through the book. It was a wonderful journey.

So far, after 2 months, I have not had any complaints about the reliability of the connection. The setup was seemless. The only problem, which really isnt one, is that I neglected to delete the software for the old adapter and ran into some errors. Once I Uninstalled that software all worked perfectly. I think it was worth the extra cost for the extra strength signal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Norwegian: Pimsleur Language Program","review":"This program is the only place to start if you want to learn Norwegian. It provides you with the basics needed to speak a foreign language. The speakers are easy to understand and speak slow enough that you can hear each word. You will quickly progress through each unit. The program does not allow you to forget previous lessons, so you actually retain what you learned.I have purchased several other programs over the years, and was not able to learn from them. I wish Pimsleur was available back then. Invest your money wisely, start with the Pimsleur programs. They are expensive, but they work. The proof: the Norwegians actually understood me when I spoke.The main drawback with this product is that there is not a lot of information in the program. It will not provide you with enough phrases to get by as a tourist, so you will need additional material.Now if Pimsleur would only produce a more comprehensive version. I am impatiently waiting."},{"rating":"1","title":"ikke bra","review":"I didn't get much out of it. I could do all of the lessons fairly easily, but I thought that the man and the woman sounded quite different in their pronunciations, so I struggled with what the actual words were.

I'm taking lessons from a teacher now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Norwegian CDs","review":"Why is the very first thing they teach you is \\"I speak Norwegian\\". After learning that, you can't speak another word. Should start with \\"where is the bathroom\\" or something useful. I would prefer a text to go with it to help with the pronunciation. It is difficult to fine tune the exact sound.

Author Koch has captured it \\"like it was.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor-not worth your time","review":"I took this book out from my local library two days ago. I gave up in frustration half-way through. Intelligent debate this is not. The editors do a poor job of selecting well-reasoned essays and articles, and instead go for pieces that are often nonsensical and illogical. Generalizing from watching your own child's behavior?

Even the 3 year old brother and some of us 'older' folks got involved playing with it. We liked that it was for both indoor and outdoor use and that it had a baseball theme since his grandson is definitely into baseball. This made it more fun for him to hit the ball through the legs of the different baseball figures instead of just the normal hoops that we all remember growing up with."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read......","review":"Well let me start by saying, it's not Candy.

Hynes who was a Marine Aviator in the Pacific. Both gentlemen wrote their memoirs decades after the war,and even though both admitted that some memories were foggy ,they tell it the way they remembered it,warts and all.These books show if nothing else, the trauma of war is with its survivors for their entire lives.
