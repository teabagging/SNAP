It fully humanizes him, while bringing forth the reality of of his divinity, and the struggles it caused him. I liked this film so much I bought copies for my church, friends and family.The movie isn't trying to be a complete theology, but to represent an essence, to give substance to the man-god reality of Jesus, and present the most important of his teachings. As such, it's theologically sound enough for me.In fact, it's theologically sound enough for the Pope. :)I also like the version with Robert Powell, but Jeremy Sisto is a much more approachable Jesus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"This is an insult to my intelligence!

It was very educational. And, contrary to one of the reviews I read - it \\"is\\" historically very correct. Everything Jesus says just about is in the Bible. My brother has never seen the movie and we discussed it over the phone. He knows the Bible well. I would describe a scene from the movie and he told me word for word - straight from Scripture - exactly what Jesus said in the movie. I was amazed at how accurate the movie was. I don't think the movie was portraying Jesus as being attracted to Mary at all. I think it was only showing that he \\"knew\\" she was attracted to him and that he maybe wasn't sure how to tell her who he was. I was very moved by the crucifixion scene - bawled my eyes out. The whole movie gave me a new appreciation for Sisto too. He was also in Grand Canyon - the teenage son. I think he is a wonderful actor and portrayed not a \\"lazy\\" Jesus - but a Jesus who was coming into his own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesus DVD A Must For Every Christian","review":"I love this movie every time I watch it.Is it line-by-line true of the Gospels? No.Can you nit pick it apart? Yes.But, what it does do is give the viewer an impression of the kind of person Jesus was and the world he lived in. You leave this movie wanting to read more. Wanting to read the Gospels. I know I did. I've found that movies that repeat the Gospels word by word don't necessarily make me want to read them more.The movie takes some liberties on some things the Bible doesn't mention, like Jesus' life as a child and Joseph's death, they could have happened that way.The important thing is that you walk away from this movie with His message: Love the Lord God, love others, forgive others if you want God to forgive you, Jesus died so our sins could be forgiven and rose from the dead, proclaim to the world His good news.Amen. Amen. Amen. Watch this movie. You won't regret it. Then, read the Gospels from Matthew to John. Awesome!God bless,Brian"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"When the previews began airing on TV, I thought this would be an excellent new Jesus film to add to my collection. However as I began to watch the film, it became apparent This was not a movie I desired to own. Jesus' uncertainty as of his mission, his mother practically goading him into doing it. John's question to Jesus about did he repent of his sins, was just too much. The many \\"liberties\\" that were taken of the scriptures. Actually untruths would be better. However it was not all bad though. Jesus' temptation in the wilderness and his prayer in the garden were extremely good, but not good enough to justify the rest of the movie though. Two words \\"Extremely Disappointed\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame before God!","review":"This \\"movie\\"...key word movie was horrible. The closest biblical accuracy was it's title Jesus' name. Trying to portray Jesus as weak and indecisive is shameful. Also the movie indicates Mary and Jesus were in love. None of this is biblical. After the first 15 minutes 13 minutes too long I turned to something else. I hope that NO ONE will wacth this and thinks that this is an accurate portrayal of our Lord and Savior \\"JESUS\\" Christ!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blasphemy! Mockery!!","review":"This is blasphemous. I didn't finish watching it and I am throwing it away. What part I saw was Jesus being portrayed as a sinner, yelling at Heavenly Father to do it now (raise Joseph from dead), confused as to who he is and more stupidity. It is a mockery of the Lord of Lords and King of Kings."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Jesus you'd want for your friend","review":"This was a Jesus that could actually be your friend and someone you would not be afraid to talk to or follow. Too many times in previous adaptions, Jesus seems cold, distant and speaking Gospel verse verbatim and I would find it hard to connect with Him on a personal level and wondered how the Apostles felt. But I was able to feel Jesus' frustration and sadness when he was pleading with God to raise Joseph because I too have lost my father, and I could empathize with his feelings. Wonderfully acted, I felt that some of the \\"personal\\" touch was lost in the second 2 hours and I wished that it was longer so we could see some more \\"in-between\\" moments. It inspired me to read the Bible in a whole new light. It had it's bizarre moments, such as the Temptation in the Desert, but overall a very enjoyable story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesus loves you!!!","review":"I believe that any movie that emphasizes the love of Jesus Christ and follows the Holy Bible deserves 5 stars. This movie was moving. One of the reviewers said Jesus \\"fell in love\\" in the beginning of the movie -- not true! I highly recommend this movie for a new Christian or someone wanting to get an intimate look into His life and what He did for all of mankind. This movie will bring tears to your eyes as you realize His unconditional love."},{"rating":"2","title":"What influenced me more than anything","review":"For years I had questioned how much it meant for Jesus to die if he knew that he would be resurrected in three days; I questioned how much of a sacrifice it really was. I always figured, \\"Heck-I would be willing to die for three days in order to save humanity from it's sins\\". Let me tell you-after I saw the brutal and horrible pain and suffering that Jesus went through, I no longer question that it was indeed the supreme sacrifice!I'm not to worried about some as I see hair-splitting errors. I gloss over them as long as they're not some utter blasphemy or something, and I don't feel like there were any of those.David"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not from the gospel","review":"There were just too many deviations from the bible. I had to stop the film and throw it in the trash after 20 minutes. Firstly, there was no mention of Jesus being a 30 year old man living with his parents, not knowing the purpose of his life. Secondly, when the scene where he and John met is just complete fiction. Also, Jesus came out of the water. He was fully immersed when he was baptised. Here its shows them getting sprinkled on their face. I don't know why it is hard to find an accurate film? Anyway, if you are looking for accuracy, do not bother with this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely the worst depiction of Jesus I have ever seen","review":"I can barely find the words. This film is AWFUL!! Scripturally it is woefully unsound. They have taken the concept of \\"artistic license\\" to levels that are frightening. I could not watch more than a few minutes of it before I felt compelled to eject the disc. The way Martha, Mary, and Lazarus were portrayed was absolute fantasy and is so far from scriptural accuracy it was sickening to watch - Mary was shown to be romantically in love with Jesus, and Lazarus rebukes Jesus and insists that he tell Mary his true feelings for her. I continued to watch in disbelief but could stand no more when they showed Jesus \\"praying\\" in the tomb of his deceased father Joseph, begging God to raise Joseph up because he just couldn't go on without him. It was pitiful. I believe this film borders on blasphemy.... and that might be an understatement. Repugnant - I would have given it zero stars, but that option was not available."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite movie!","review":"I absolutely love this movie! Its a great way to see the life of Jesus. Its bright and lively and easy to follow as where other biblical movies I find to be dark. I recommend this to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good movie","review":"This movie was okay, but not as good as I expected. I like the words that were easy to understand-no thees or thous-just plain language, but it had a lot to be desired as it was missing any real interest, kind of boring to me. It definately was missing the real story of Jesus, like the king of kings, this movie showed lack of the purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Jesus movie I've ever seen!","review":"Shame on the makers of this film. I agree, this movie is an abomination! In this version, John the Baptist tells Jesus to repent of his sins. Jesus had NO sins! That's why He was able to redeem us of our sins when He was crucified. Mother Mary has to prompt Jesus to go out into the world to find His way??! WRONG! Jesus needed NO prompting to do God's will and accomplish His mission. Jesus knew exactly who he was from the time he was a small child, which is why he stayed in His Father's Temple at 12 years old. Nothing in this film is scripturally accurate! It's disgusting and pathetic. Watch \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\" starring Robert Powell, which is the closest-to-the-truth film version that you will find about our Lord Jesus Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for teaching the life of Jesus","review":"I showed this movie to my 7th and 8th grade CCD class. It kept their attention and taught them the basics fo their faith in a visual way. It is not all the direct words of the bible, but it teaches the basics. Jesus was portrayed as a person with human feelings and doubts, which I feel helps the viewer identify with Jesus. He was human after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jesus Didn't Know Who He Was In This Movie","review":"This a very inacurate version of Jesus life on earth. In the movie Jesus doesn't know why he came to earth in the first place. He didn't know he was God's son. And it was Mary who had to tell Jesus what to do.And what is this about John asking Jesus to confess his \\"SINS\\" and Jesus says \\"OKAY.\\" Jesus didn't have any sins. He was PERFECT.And in the movie John didn't know Jesus was the Messiah.In the Bible John knew Jesus was the Messiah right when he laid eyes on him and said \\"I am the one needing to be baptised by you.\\" (Mat 3:14)Where did you get the information for this Movie? Use The Bible Next Time.I DON'T RECCOMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANYONE.It's all Fake on who Jesus really was as a person."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brilliant Piece of Work","review":"Okay, as a non spiritual person, rather i am just a total movie nut, i must say that this film was beautifully done. Regardless of your faith, or how you choose to express it, the movie blends impressive scenery with heart-wrenchingly superb acting. Jeremy Sisto as Jesus after his his former roles, was quite a thrill to experience. I found myself watching him throughout the movie and saying to myself \\"that would be the face of Jesus.\\" The simple kindness and joy in his expressions, the truth so eloquently expressed. The additional cast leading a truly enjoyable landscape upon which this film was carried, left me wanting so much more, i ran out and bought the remaining bible movies made by TriMark. So, whether you are a religous person looking for a new face to add to your ideas of the bible, or just a movie-holic like myself, i truly believe this movie is worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTALLY RIDICULOUS, ABSURD. AN INSULT TO THE BIBLE AND THE \\"REAL\\" SAVIOR!","review":"I'm not going to waste much time here. Leave it to say, this film is a complete lie/ mockery of scripture. Anyonewho is associated with this abomination of a production should be ashamed of themselves. If someone had offered me 100 million dollars to be part of this discusting tripe, I would turn them down flat! I never made it through a full viewing. Here's one of the reasons...Jesus is taken out of the town by his mother, Mary. Once alone, Mary tells her grown son who he really is. In response to this revelation, her son screams out in despair, \\"WHY ME? WHY ME!!???\\"In scripture it's clear that Christ Jesus knew of this when he was 12 years old. He wasn't given this information by Mary, and as God incarnate, he knew who he was. Anyone wanting to see a more acurate film of The Lord, then watch a film entitled, \\"The Jesus Project\\", or \\"The Jesus Film\\". God Bless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fit to be rated as one of the worst Jesus movies ever","review":"This movie is created by and for those people who do not give an inch of importance to the Word of God and to Holiness. Please do not waste money on buying this rubbish. If you want a good Jesus movie I recommend \\"Gospel of John\\", Visual Bible- Mathew, Jesus of Nazareth. God bless you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Based On the Bible At All","review":"If you want a movie that shows the human side of Christ while remaining faithful to the actual Scriptures (word-for-word) I would suggest the Visual Bible - Matthew.This made-for-TV miniseries starring Jeremy Sisto is dangerously unbiblical and, what's worse, much of the man-made inventions aren't benign at all, but contain seeds of falsehood that undermine or downright deny the divinity of Christ.Jesus was indeed fully man, but make no mistake...He was also fully God."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather watch 6 hours of Jesus of Nazareth","review":"This movie is an abomination to the story of Jesus. First of all, the actor who plays Jesus has a permananent flirtatious lusty expression on his face. The story is not all true to the bible. It was so horrid that my friend and I who decided together to rent it, had to shut it off halfway through. If you truly want a movie that pays homage to Jesus's life, watch Jesus of Nazareth instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worldly","review":"The Gospels are always a challenge to adapt to screen, but this time they didn't even try. The beginning was pretty typical: Lots of flash and color with Roman soldiers, Priests and Scribes, and, of course, Herod with Herodias and the inevitable Solome (odd that she's often given a central role, since she isn't even named in Scripture, and only mentioned once). So for about ten minutes I sat tight, waiting for the good stuff, like Jesus' baptism, the calling of The Twelve, and the Sermon on the Mount, but the when Jesus finally shows up, he's in Bethany making sheep-eyes at Mary. Blasphemy! The Bibical Jesus would never for a moment have contemplated a different path than the one He knew His Father wanted for Him, even when He was as young as twelve years. We turned it off right away, knowing the rest couldn't be much better. Don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Film to Ever be Made","review":"The reason that I think that this movie is the worst is because it more fiction than it does non fiction. Like there is talk of the marrige of mary, the sister of lazarus and jesus. There is another scene with john the baptist:Jesus: John, will you baptize me?John: Only if you confess your sins.I would not reccomend this film to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is okay - Matthew, the visual Bible is much more accurate","review":"although i have nothing against ANY movie that shares the gospel, which is the most important thing a person can possibly understand and accept, this video has a slight angle to it that got a little too affectionate between Jesus and some woman who knew him before he was baptised in the Holy Spirit. like maybe he had a girlfriend but then the time of his mission was upon him so he had to go a different direction. lol! so, if you're looking for a good Gary Oldman movie get Sid and Nancy (then burn it) but if you're looking for an accurate and entertaining AND well-made dvd with Jesus in it, get the Visual Bible Gospel of Matthew Starring Richard Kiley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great version!","review":"This is my favorite \\"Jesus\\" movie. The acting is great, the scenery is stunning and the story is entertaining (unlike some other similar movies that seem to drag on).I first saw this version on TV when I was in Australia. They had an alternate ending that I thought was much better than the ending in this version. That was my only disappointment.This version also has an interesting take on Satan. This helps link the film to modern times, even though it's dealing with events that are over 2000 years old.Overall, I highly recommend this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"They sent me a Church tape","review":"NOT the Jeremy Sisto, Gary Oldman film.Yes the dvd is named \\"Jesus\\" but it says on the package \\"This DVD was mailed to homes in your area as a gift from a partnership of local Chrisian churches. No solicitation for funds will be made.\\"Uhh, this ain't no Hollywood flick. They sold me a freebie, and claimed it was the movie I ordered."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is a mockery!","review":"This movie is probably one of television's biggest mistake! I watched this movie in disgust as Jesus was portrayed as an ungodly, normal human being. There were times in this movie where I felt that the disciples around Jesus were more sensible than he was, which was definately not the case. I thought the idea of the producers of this movie going to and adhering to all religious beliefs about Jesus Christ and implementing those ideas in this movie, was absurd. They simply needed to go to the Bible to catch the truth but since this typical Hollywood version played to the crowds of religious differences, they have missed the mark! There is another movie under the same exact name which was made in 1979 and follows the book of Luke exactly. Go to your nearest Bible Book Store and buy THAT one and skip the Hollywood mythological drull on this particular 2000 Jesus movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good try!!","review":"This is one of those movies trying to blame it on Pilate. That's so anti-biblical!! Everybody knows, no offense, that Jewish Sanhedrin wanted Jesus dead. And that's not \\"antisemitism\\". It's just the truth. But Jewish moguls (media owners) are trying to change that saying that Jews only were puppets and Pilate wanted Jesus to die. That's a big lie. If you read the Bible you're going to find something different. And this too worldly Jesus is unacceptable ! Don't buy this garbage"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"I rented this DVD via Netflix. I would not buy it and while watching it I quit half way though. The script is so modern it's funny. I burst out laughing in several places. Mel Gibson's movie is now the yardstick. This movie is at the bottom of all the ones I have seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most innacurate depiction of Jesus...","review":"Biblically innaccurate...They made it seem as though Jesus was unsure of his purpose which is clearly not what the scriptures say..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"REAL\\" Jesus","review":"Finally, a movie that protrays Jesus as a real person that laughs, cries and even has fun. There is no mechanical Jesus here. The best movie on Jesus ever!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasy Jesus","review":"If you don't care about the truth and just want a movie to entertain yourself, then you may like it. Personally, I still wouldn't like it. The main \\"character\\" was a wimp. I don't know why they even said this movie is about Jesus. This main character doesn't even closely portray the real Jesus. Jesus knows exactly why He came to the earth. He came to die for our sins. It does not say in the bible that Jesus was undecisive, insecure and falling head over heals over a chick. There is so much more I do not like about this joke of a movie, but the negative reviews express my feeling as well. If you really want to know the truth, read the holy bible. If you prefer dvd movies about Jesus, to start with... THE GOSPEL OF JOHN and JESUS OF NAZARETH are so much more accurate. Both dvd's practically read from the bible. And Jesus is not a wimp. Do you know any one who hasn't sinned and then died for you so you can live?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Absolute Worst!","review":"This movie is the most disappointing adaptation of the story of Jesus Christ I have ever witnessed. Something about Jesus talking in a 21st century, flippant American dialect is disturbing. It had no authentic feel. We could handle the older classics getting away with removing Jesus and the characters in the story from their Jewishness and their native culture, but this one failed miserably. You would fare better with Jesus of Nazareth, King of Kings or The Greatest Story Ever Told. At least the actors, although many guilty of the same lack of cultural authenticity, delivered with passion and reverence...."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Absolutely Appalling Rendition of the Son of God","review":"This movie was absolutely abominable. I watched about the first five minutes of it. Basically, it starts out with two of the disciples grumbling and telling each other to shut up. Then Jesus comes out from praying and they all hush. He walks down the hill a little ways to where the crowds are waiting and asks them \\"What is it that would make you happy in life?\\" and someone says \\"a big house!\\" with a greedy look on his face and then Jesus LAUGHS. He laughs! Yeah right! Considering the fact that Jesus completely condemned the love of money, I CANNOT see Him doing something like this.Apparently, the writers of this movie didn't bother to stop and consult the Bible before they wrote the script.

I highly discourage anybody from watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD - BAD - BAD","review":"This is the type of movie that actually \\"grieves the Holy Spirit\\". Here - Jesus has a hard time understanding that He is the actual Son of God, and never fully understands that He is God himself. How can a director make such a movie that deviates so much from the Living Bible?? Don't waste your money or time on this one. Instead - get the movie \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\" for an outstanding presentation of the time and life of Jesus and be forever changed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bible-based, inaccurate, fabricated facts.","review":"Though the film is well produced and directed, there were horrific inaccuracies, all within the first 20 minutes. The time and place of Joseph's death are NOT known. NOWHERE in the Bible do you find this. It is NOT written in the Bible that Joseph advised Jesus on when to do the things he did. It is NOT in the Bible that Jesus ever said he, \\"loved,\\" Mary (Mary and Martha, not his mother). It is NOT in the Bible that Jesus demanded of God that Joseph be brought back to life. It is NOT in the Bible that Jesus said, \\"I cannot do this alone!\\" This video is as big an inaccurate and fabricated mess as \\"Noah.\\" Any Christian, or anyone with any knowledge at all of the Bible, would not watch this video or recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Representation of Jesus","review":"I am almost certain that Hollywood wanted to please each religion with the baptismal scenes. Most religions differ on how to baptist but as a cousin and friend of John the Baptist Jesus would of submerged people when he was baptising them not sprinkle them with water. This was a very watered down secular version of the story of the Jesus. This is not the true character of Jesus he was not a weakminded,easily tempted man that hollywood and nonchristians would like to believe. I understand that there hope was to entertain and englighten people on Jesus but inaccurately portraying Jesus as as a flawed man does not help the cause.

In this film Jesus is attracted to women, flirts with Mary, engages in a splash fight with his apostles, questions the wisdom of his heavenly father, and sees visions of Nazis and World War II (I am serious). I'm no expert in the Bible, but I know that none of these things happened in the four Gospels.

Jesus confessing his \\"sins\\" before John the Baptist is just the tip of the iceberg. This horrifying travesty is so riddled with inaccuracies and distortions of the Scriptures that in its own perverse way it is a monumental achievement.Please, please, please I beg you gentle reader, buy Franco Zefferelli's \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\" instead.

Some of the ideas include attaching bunches of flowers to chair backs for the reception, or putting a flower in each guests napkin.

I got this bike for my 7 year old for Christmas. I put it together in about 30 minutes, but the bike wasn't shifting very well. I am a bike enthusiast and work on my and my wife's road bikes, so I know a bit about adjusting shifting. I put the bike on a stand and got to work. I worked for 2 hours but was never able to get it to shift properly. It was also VERY hard to turn the shifter. After about an hour, the cable would just kink up in the handlebar. I took the bike to my local shop and they could not get it to work much better than I. Rather than deal with returning the bike, I had the shop change the deraileur and handlebar shifter to a SRAM unit. Total cost for this with labor was $[...]. Now it shifts great. If you're looking for an out-of-the-box bike, this ain't it.

The focus of Dante's Cove is the occult and includes gay and lesbian characters. The Lair is almost all about gay guys. Season three of the Lair is the best yet. It's all about gay vampires and other supernature things. It has good looking guys, full nudity and gay sex. The addition of Steven Hirschis is a welcome addition. He is soooo hot and his character is very interesting and different. Also he and Frankie Valenti make a cute couple. This is a two dvd set and has 13 episodes. I could have done without the female vampire character, but was nice seeing Sybil Danning still acting. And just like Dante's Cove and the night time soaps the season finale always leaves you hanging with multiple story lines left in the air.

Krakauer has made himself a hero and everyone else a buffoon, including the Sherpas! What nonsense! It appears that the altitude has inflicted memory damage and self worship deeply into Krakauer's brain. Both Rob Hall and Scott Fischer were highly experienced guides that regarded the safety of their client's much more important than a summit.

There are many other books and movies that give accurate accounts, please try them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"For those that have read the book or know about the events, this is an over dramatized account.

The obituary should be written and posted wherever this attempt at filmmaking is sold.

It makes Krakauer seem like a hero when he was just an observer. Read the book it was compelling and very hard to put down, though you know what was going to happen. The characters in the book seemed more alive and 3 dimensional than the actors did in the movie. During the movie I kept looking at the time waiting for it to be over. Also, it was obviously made for TV as you can easily see where the commercial breaks were.They killed a great moving and \\"nail biting\\" true story and book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT BOOK---POOR MOVIE","review":"Don't waste your time with this Hollywood movie if you read the book (which is one of the most thrilling books ever)--but maybe see one of the true documentaries on EVEREST to see what the experience really looks like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time on this","review":"To date I have read 3 different books regarding the 1996 Everest climbs, including Krakauer's book. The book is definitely a must read, but the movie is awful. It alters the personalities & inserts things to make it a 'movie'. The perception it will leave you with is not accurate, aside from that, as a movie it isn't good either. Don't waste your time on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor attempt at documenting an Everest endeavor.","review":"This movie did NOT capture the story told in Krakauer's book or Boukriev's account of the events. Since it didn't follow either of these author's accounts as described in their books, or the IMAX movie version for that matter, we could only hope that it would accurately depict what an endeavor like an Everest summit assault was like. Nope! It failed to address or adequately portray the material issues one encounters when considering an Everest summit assault. Ok, maybe the portrail of the participants would be entertaining. Nope! The development of the characters in the film was very shallow. In summary, the film had very little to offer. A waste of time. Read Krakauer's \\"Into Thin Air\\", AND Boukreev's \\"The Climb\\", both describe the events of May 10, 1996 on Mt. Everest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does the book no justice","review":"Loved the book but the movie was so cheesy. The main actor who played Jon Krakauer was completely unbelievable and it made it seem like Jon was a bigger hero than he was.

Really hated it after reading the book in a day or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor account of fateful Everest climb","review":"Too much Hollywood show biz . . . not enough Everest.

Krakauer was one of the lucky ones, he made it back alive- 12 people didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everest Enthusiasts - Beware","review":"What a huge disappointment.

Using Krakauer's account (Into Thin Air) would be a good starting point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than the Book","review":"During the first five minutes of this book it is painfully obvious that it is a very low budget film. They couldn't even get the landmarks right on the Everest map. Clothing and gear is wrong. Sequence of events and factual reconstruction isn't even close. At one point they have Krakuer striking out in a blizzard on the South Col to rescue stranded climbers, only to have a sherpa beg him to abandon his efforts. The facts show and even by Krakuers own admission he was sleeping in his tent and refused any participation in rescue efforts. This film will make you ill if you have a grasp of the facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, a little nasty, and that's a shame.","review":"Based on the infamous events of the 1996 season, this made for tv show isn't compelling. Mostly that's because it's cheap and it shouldn't have been. The story is interesting, but the main problem is that it just doesn't ever feel like they're actually climbing a mountain. It's like the screenwriters tried to write a movie about climbing Everest without bothering to research what climbing Everest is actually like. Even I could have done a better job.2 out of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very weak","review":"Not what I expected.The characterizations of all the members were weak.

Read the book, forget this video"},{"rating":"2","title":"High Value Metaphor","review":"Rather than for its entertainment value, \\"Into Thin Air\\" has its highest value as a docudrama and metaphor for crucial aspects of phenomenal successes and spectacular failures we witness and may experience in varying aspects of our lives. The film takes a full-frontal no-nonsense approach to the expedition, while the book bears a similarly terse attack on both the blatant and subtle errors in judgement and performance that would lead to death on everest. Both the book and movie are permanent members of my leadership library, and a frequent recommendation for my executive leadership, strategic planning and team building clients.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"This DVD is good as a coaster for your drink and not much else.

No one needs an indtroduction to Drive South the signature song of this CD but greater wonders await. Eat at Joe's is a dark, moody, evocative blues number worthy of any singer. The sad reality of the lines, \\"I could be your domestic goddess for an hour or so...\\", make this both a wonderful tune and a chilling portraite of life out of the fast lane. But if mood and sobriety aren't your cuppa then there are the delightfully playful Other Side of The Hill and Lovin' A hurricane. Good mix, good score and Suzy doin' it right. This is a CD that goes far beyond country, if you love music then it should be at part of your collection. How 'bout you run out and buy your copy and we'll meet at Joe's?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Honky Tonk doesn't get any better than this!","review":"This CD is absolutely essential for any Honky Tonk fan! There are many top notch Honky Tonk songs reissued here which have been undeservedly obscure up until now. These songs have a swingy hard-driving honky tonk sound that is truly addictive, and a weird edge that only Johnny can deliver. Johnny's performance is brilliant and the instrumentals are perfect, it is hard to believe many of them were done in one take! There is some excellent songwriting here by Johnny, Joe Poovey and others, where else can you find lyrics like \\"bring another drink bartender, troubles boy I got 'em and if I'm gonna sink, I might as well go to the bottom\\"?The liner notes are very well done with lots of cool pictures, insights into Johnny's life at the time and background for some of the songs. I can only hope that The Country Music Foundation will release more of these '60s tracks on the Hilltop and Little Darlin' labels. This fabulous Honky Tonk deserves to be better known."},{"rating":"2","title":"Country","review":"I ordered this cd to get the song \\"The Cave\\" which I heard several years ago.

Supporting actors Anthony Quinn, Paul Fix, and James Gleason have better moments than co-stars Larraine Day, Cedric Hardwicke and Judith Anderson. This one is set in South America, where Wayne is in charge of building a railroad for tycoon Hardwicke, but when the Duke romances the daughter, hostilities between Cedric and John become not just project-threatening, but life-threatening as well. There is a nice sequence of a locomotive on a bridge in a huge storm, but overall, it seems to be flat and not well-written or directed. Most of the South American backdrop looks fake. Unless you are a John Wayne fanatic, this is one you can miss without regret."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Color But Dull John Wayne Flick!","review":"I'm a big John Wayne fan, have more DVDs with him in them than those with any other actor. This one put me to sleep though! Very nice Technicolor, lovely on location South American scenery, competent performances from the Duke and a good supporting cast but it just drags, especially in the first half of the film. Even if you're a major Wayne fan as I am and want to see everything he made I'd save my money and wait until this one plays again on Turner Classic Movies. Big disappointment in my humble opinion!

Well, unless one wants to break it, this cheap lock refuses to comply.On top of that, the lock is flimsy to the extreme (a ball-point pen could pop it open) and the locking pin made out of (thin!) plastic.

The guy singing sounds like a drunk frat boy doing karaoke. I regret buying this and can not recommend it unless you are just a completely loyal fanatic of this band. I guess I should have waited for a \\"greates hits\\" from these guys with the studio versions because the live versions stink. Well, I'm off to a local cd store that takes used cds to trade this one in!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"I was lucky enough to hear this album played on the radio the other day...I thought it was a deffinate must-buy thingee.

This was a very exciting, enjoyable book to read. Combine 3 beautiful women, 3 handsome men, a white wolfhound, and an ancient curse and watch the fun unfold. Poor Ursula is meant to marry Theo, but she fell in love with Conan instead. Poor Theo is in love with Eleanor, who he has only seen in his dreams. Of course, Conan loves Eleanor, but Theo's inheritance rests on his marrying Ursula. Since Conan is a good friend to Theo, he cannot risk his friend's inheritance. Add to that the search for a an Roman villa by Ursula's father, and you have the ingredients for a delightful read.

Great album!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who the heck are the SCW?????","review":"Newcomers listen up! These guys are great. If you do not own any of SCW cd's..start with this one and work your way back. If you have been directed to this site due to recommended listening lists or whatever, roll your dice and gamble on this last CD. I did and went back and bought all the others.SCW remind me a bit of Black Crowes, but more influenced by R&B; than the straight forward rock of the BC. SCW tend to break into jams throughout thier songs, hence the not-so-friendly radio format, and lack of airplay. But that is the listening publics loss....at least you can make up your own mind on CD purchases. These guys are great. If anyone out there gets this cd, and listens to \\"grace\\", and does not agree that this one song alone is worth the purchase price...email me. And there is so much more here, great rockin tunes and jams. Do you here the Van Morrison references??? Get it and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Entertainment !","review":"These guys never cease to amaze me. All three of thier albums are full of heart and talent.They give a whole spectrum of rockin' blues to listeners on this album.

These guys are the epitome of live entertainment.They put thier heart and souls into thier music, and it shows on this and the other two albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Sugar-Coating","review":"This is an excellent Bible particulary for folks of the Reformed/Presbyterian Tradition. The stories are told using real images and language -- it's not sugar-coated nor is the theology compromised by using a slightly elementary vocabulary. The illustrations are vivid and hold attention -- all in all, it's an excellent family Bible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good family reading","review":"This is a charming version of the Bible for the family to read together--adults reading to kiddies too young to be able to read, for instance. It is the best version that I've seen for small children who have to be read to, and has good illustrations. Our 14 months old will sit down and \\"read\\" it aloud, looking over the pictures, for her own benefit. She favors the scenes with animals. I liked it because it tries to cover Old and New Testaments both and seems to touch on all the books of the Bible in a simplified way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great illustrations, but terrible interpretation","review":"I originally bought this Bible beacuse the reviews said it had wonderful pictures and included stories that other bibles left out (such as women in the old testament.) I thought the pictures were really wonderful, but was very disappointed with most of the interpretation of the stories. There is much liberty taken with the stories and I find it to be more creative writing than accurate re-telling of the bible stories. For example, why is it important to include in the story of Jesus' birth \\"It hurt when the baby came out of Mary, and she cried. Joseph cried, too.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"My 5 year old loves it","review":"This book came recommended by my sister, who is a Presbyterian minister. I was looking for a way to include scripture in our daily lives but felt that the traditional devotional books were too structured for DD yet. I have found that reading these stories brings the Bible to life for her and I'm learning a great deal too. I would recommend this for any families and even those without children for learning the scripture and Bible stories in a way that make them interesting and memorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a \\"family\\" Bible","review":"While this Bible story book retells many common and uncommon Bible storeis, there are three major drawbacks. First, the author takes liberty to add to and enhance many of the stories (while he admits to this on the appropriate pages, it is hard for children to understand the difference of story and truth). Additionally, the author mentions the word \\"sex\\" twice - once in the story of Hagar and once in the story of David & Bathsheba. Further, the author summarizes the book of Song of Songs, which while it is biblical, is not appropriate for children. These factors make this NOT a \\"family\\" story Bible. We do not recommend this story Bible for your family."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Curious Collector's Choice","review":"I have to admit that when I saw this a while back, I snatched it up, as a devout fan of Lou Ann And Stevie both. At the the same time, I have to agree that the sound quality seems the main fault with the release. There are a couple of tracks that sound better than others (see \\"Young and Dumb\\"). Most of the tracks, however, sound like they were recorded in a small club or studio w/ substandard equipment. They tend to sound a little muffled, at times marked by static (like an old, worn-out LP). I'd have to say, it's main value is to diehard fans of either artist. The track selection, arrangements, production, and singing & playing all point to its being an authentic recording of them back in 1977(!). Again, however, the main value would likely be to collectors or diehard fans. I won't be parting with it, but I was a little disappointed upon hearing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Scent","review":"I bought this a while back, and I love the scent.

Highly recommended!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's allright, but that's about it.","review":"Dark edged euro-pop are the words that come to mind when I try to describe this album. It's not that it's bad, but it's simplistic and, for me, a dissapointment. There's some catchy tunes, but compared to earlier work it seems very tame. I think the attempt to integrate Lovefcraftian themes into this album makes it seem all the more comical. For some good electro/industrial interpretations of Lovecraft look for a compilation called The Challenge From Beyond. For good Electro/Industrial, look for VNV Nation or Velvet Acid Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very instructive","review":"Because I am Dutch reading is not as easy as a Dutch book, but so far reading and understanding is relatively easy. A lot of things explained in the book, are much more clear to me now. It is explaned in a clear way and a lot is making more sense now. Of course it's mostly about Digitrax but as I have bought Digitrax components, the book \\"speaks\\" to me. A pitty is that the book is not updated because sometimes the old product is mentioned but with the Digitrax internet site at the back it's easy to find the right component. I find it a good book for me as a beginner to enhance my basic knowledge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting started with DCC","review":"A very good book to help with demystifying what the system can do versus the variable transformer and individual switches for sections. The amount of wiring required is about a third of that needed to try to perform the same switching operations with the \\"analog\\" wiring methods. Yes, initially it is a bigger investment in the equiptment and the book gets you headed in the right direction to help plan what you will need. You will need to buy one more book for DCC projects that gets into more task specific wiring.. All in all a very good book. Glad I bought it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Faron Young compilation.","review":"Without purchasing the Faron Young boxset, this is about the best compilation of all his Capitol hits, out there. It's also becoming increasingly rare and makes a great investment to add to a CD collection.As for the other readers who wondered why Amazon entitled this \\"live\\". It's not \\"live\\", but live...... as in Live Fast, Love Hard, etc. Short I, not long. So it is referred to correctly.Great artist, great CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops ~","review":"I've heard some good Squarepusher but this certainly was not it. Not recommended.

But thats what I like about it :) Ive never heard anything like Squarepusher even in electronic music, he is a pioneer as far as I know.....correct me if Im wrong :)The music sounds like what your personal computer, refridgerator and your car would make if they formed a band.

Four or Five years ago I came upon my brothers Squarepusher CD he had left in the bathroom cd player. WOWWWW! I was ignorant of what IDM music is, and still loved it, and I have to say, that albums like this only get better and better as one becomes more aware of good electronic music. Albums contains the quinntessential \\"Tundra\\" among others. Also #1, 3, 5, 9, etc. etc. etc. See when one listens to Squarepusher, often only a few songs are atttractive, yet as the knowledge of the ablum unfolds, all Jenkinson's true beauty is exposed.

Both singers could emote. They didn't need to swallow the microphone as they do today, with their thin, breathy style of singing, depending upon technology to be heard.The story revolves around a French Duke who, during the revolution, gives up his title, frees his bonded servants, and heads for New Orleans by ship, posing as a servant(footman). On the voyage he meets Jeanette McDonald, where a love/hate relationship develops. He is sold as a slave,takes over the ship, is shipwrecked on an uncharted tropical island, and their relationship takes the inevitable course.This is a musical, and so McDonald and Eddy regale us with several songs. it is no wonder that they were such popular singers. They actually harmonized, in those days. Refreshing, indeed.Joseph (Joe) Pierreauthor of The Descendants of Thomas Pierand other books"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Trip Down Memory Lane","review":"New Moon [VHS]This film creates a delightful and nostalgic journey.

They possess creative muscle, expressive strength, bullet proof originality, mercurial energy, full rounded expansiveness and first rate technique.This album is one of these overwhelming outbursts of volcanic inspiration. Literally every piece is a masterwork by itself. Of course, Harmageddon, Nothing else matters, refuse/resist, Inquisition symphony, Fade to black stand out because of its primordial wilderness and full expressiveness, but this album is one of the most relevant of the decade."},{"rating":"1","title":"The New Classical Music? Oh Puleeease...","review":"I enjoy this album because of its uniqueness within the narrow realm of metal music to which I listen to seldomly. One does not have to go far into this work to find real potential of these players. They are competent and inovative with their instruments.I admire the enthusiasm of the all the cult followers of Apocalyptica who grace this customer review secion. However, the various assertions that this is the classic music of the future and all that is founded only in their visceral confusion about what makes good music.No way does the talent of the Apocalyptica boys match that of Rastipovitch or Yo-Yo Ma. Check out the masters' Bach variations and you will hear traditional classical that remains current, metal, enticing, suicidal... much more than you can get with Apocalyptica with actual melody, insight, timeliness and all with a single cello!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for Metallica fans!","review":"This second effort by Apocalyptica is awesome. My concern is that since they are mostly known among Metallica fans in the US, non-fans are not aware of them or are not enticed to sample the album. That is a shame. While I am a Metallica fan specifically and a Metal fan generally, I think this music has appeal for a wide range of music-lovers.The tracks are alternately moving, powerful, soulful, and occasionally transcendental. I highly recommend that everyone should at least try the album.On a side note, I find that the CD sounds much better over earphones; average quality speakers cant seem to handle the depth of many of the more layered songs. People with hi-quality speakers should be ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Being a string player myself (although I play violin rather than cello) I have much respect for these students. When listening to the songs you can rarely tell that these are in fact cellos playing the music. It ranges all from the heavy hardcore impact of Metallica, to an almost classical sort of music. If you don't like the heavy classical music, this shouldn't turn you away and would open anyone's eyes to the horizons and capabilities of stringed instruments and hopefully deter stereotypes. This is an excellent buy for anyone with a like for Metallica, orchestral music, and diverse music lovers. ~ angel@angels-heaven.com ~ ~www.angels-heaven.com~"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good music in its own right","review":"I first heard this music on Launch, and bought the album. I'm delighted with it, as the four cello re-take on Metallica is very pleasant on the ears. I enjoy listening to it very much.Only thing that slows it down, is when they try to replicate the super-fast guitar riffs on the cello, and slow it down a bit awkwardly. Other than that, fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff!","review":"This album is great, whether you love classical or metal. The only reason I gave it 4 stars, is because, once you listen to their newest album, Cult, and then listen to this, it sounds too shallow without the bass. Besides that, it is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as the first","review":"Really, the only problem that I have with this second album is that they are looser in their interpretation of the Metallica works. In the first album, it was note-by-note, but here they adapt the tunes. 'One', for instance (many's favorite Metallica tune) is only 5m30s. Otherwise, this is an utterly fantastic album, even with the changes. It is a must-buy for any speed metal fan who also has a collection of classical."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Inspiring Knitting Book Ever!","review":"I have never before bought a knitting book or magazine which \\"spoke to me\\" with just about every pattern, tip or idea. I find the patterns to be creative, versitile and up-beat. Melissa Leapman has used a wide variety to yarns, gauges, and styles which can appeal to almost anyone and has offered \\"Hot Tips\\" for all. I particularly like the way the book has been organized with the table of contents showing a photograph of each sweater along with it's location. I added in the yardage requirements also, so when I went to the yarn store it was easy to match up available yarns with the appropriate pattern. So far I have yarn for eight of the patterns and look forward to making most of the rest. I have found that the patterns I have worked are easy to follow and look great when finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I bought this for my 5-year-old niece and was very disappointed.

She held true to what she believed in and she dazzled us all- again! I've had the opportunity to see her perform songs off this album live and she performed with just as much enthusiam as on her album. This is a wonderful debut recording.

No, I don't own \\"Still I Can't Be Still\\" or \\"Here\\", because at this time they're only available through questionable resellers, who are charging an EXORBITANT amount for them!

Sams books are usually very comprehensive. Typos, examples that do not work, contradictions, and quiz answers that do not match the quiz questions. This is all before Chapter 12. Did anybody proof read this thing? Again, Very very disapointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, poorly edited","review":"This book is chalk-full of errors. And this is the second edition. Apparently little effort was made in improving the first edition. One must wonder if it was written in twenty-four hours.A book on a programming language needs credibility. Learning a foreign syntax is difficult enough as it is without behing hampered by one's learning material. By the time I got to chapter 4, all hope of credibility was lost, and this book is now going back to the bookstore."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good (2nd Edition)","review":"I have to believe that anyone who read this book and claimed that it was free of typos either doesn't know how to read or didn't learn a thing. This book is so filled with typos that I wouldn't have learned a thing if this weren't the second book that I have read on SQL and help from a friend of mine. The typos were not of the missing comma sort, they were entirely missing joins in statements that wouldn't work without them, wrong answers in the answer key, answers to questions that weren't even asked and a bucket full of missing semi-colons.This book is clearly a very beginner book it basically touches (and when I mean touches, I mean it lightly caresses) just about everything. Another thing that I couldn't understand is the way the author wouldn't tie the examples together. In one statment you create a new temp table in the next statment you are deleting a temp table but it has a different name and you never created that table to begin with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for those who know some SQL already","review":"The only reason this book doesn't get 5 stars is because of its 50,000 errors. There seems to be some sort of error on every page.

In this book there are errors in examples, in quizes, in syntax, you name it. And this is the 2nd edition too.Even more important, the examples are not good at all. I know what they are trying to say because I know some SQL but I feel bad for the beginner. The examples are not relevant to the particular components they are trying to teach half the time.I will never get one of these books again, the lack of care put into the editing alone says something about Sams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of error; not for self-study","review":"This book might be OK - in an instructor lead class; unfortunately one cannot rely on it for self-study; it is full of typos and outright errors( e.g. Hour 10 Quiz answer 2 tells you that \\"The HAVING clause can be used without a GROUP BY clause\\" !!! which is, of course, impossible...Also, the book pretends to be SQL-dialect neutral, in reality it is so ORACLE biased that some of its very basic SQL statements would not compile in Sybase or MS SQL Server...I am a DBA (MS SQL Server/Sybase/ORACLE) with 5 years of experience; I looked into the book only because a friend of mine asked me for advice after struggling with it for couple weeks.

I vagely remember it being a simple and warm comedy with a rather sobering ending. The reason it deserves a five-star grade is probably the best quote I've ever seen in any movie. There's this scene where his agent is trying to teach the main character (Winkler) some sense and he goes: Look, there are two kinds of people in this world: there are people who put the lamp- shades on lamps and the others who put the lamp-shades on their heads. You're in the second group."},{"rating":"1","title":"i really wanted to like this movie","review":"Steve Gordon wrote and directed one of my favorite films of all time in \\"Arthur\\" (1981). As his only other writing credit, I was hoping this was a hidden gem, and eagerly purchased it. Not only was Gordon behind it, but it stars Henry Winkler and was directed by Carl Reiner- and the plot would at least sound compelling! I wanted so badly to fall in love with it, but I couldn't. The protagonist will frustrate you, the humor will fall flat, and if you've seen Arthur, you'll wonder how the same mind could have dreamt this one up.That being said, go watch Arthur (the original, with Dudley Moore- not the Russell Brand remake). I've never met someone who didn't enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Advertised as \\"Family Friendly\\"","review":"This movie should not have been rated PG and if you are planning to watch this movie with teenagers, or if you are a Christian, or just have normal (old fashioned) standards about decency, I strongly suggest you do not purchase this movie.

However, after using the toy for just a few minutes, we realized that it doesn't actually roll all the way up. As you turn the reel, the line comes up about a foot, then goes back down...so you don't actually get the fish all the way up...which, I kind of thought was the point, you know?...reeling the fish in, right? Plus the magnets have to be really lined up well to connect...so I only gave them 2 stars....I think they could make some more improvements on this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't like it","review":"I gave this fishing pole to my 3 year old of Christmas and was very disappointed. The hook of the fishing pole easily broke within 1 week. The biggest problem was the reeling feature. It simply couldn't pull up one of the fish. And, the fish's magnetic portion of their mouths didn't click well with the magnetic hook. Huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't suit our needs","review":"Was looking for a durable fishing pole to use for an educational \\"action station\\" at our nature center. Purchased this due to the very positive reviews and the magnetic set-up of the lure. Figured it would be perfect to use in a small space to catch fish print-outs that had paper clips attached to their mouths. We didn't want to use a real fishing pole due to their size and the potential for the fishing line to break or get tangeled.The magnet was too weak to pick up the paperclip fish even though they were VERY light weight. Also the line barely came out. We didn't want something with a lot of line but more than 6-8 inches would have been nice.It's a cute toy and seemed durable enough but we sent it back because it wasn't going to serve our purposes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"Bought this for my 3 1/2 year old son. It doesn't reel! You can't take it apart to try to fix it because of the way the rod is attached. The magnetic fish are difficult to catch, the magnetic pull isn't strong enough. Overall a bad buy! We are sending this back and getting the learning resources fishing pretend play one. DON'T BUY!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"doesnt work","review":"object is to pick up fish with a magnetic hook would be fine if the magnets actually held the fish on the line but it does not. my 4 yr old son got frustrated with it in 2 minutes and i dont blame him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed at all.","review":"I made the mistake of not opening the package until I was putting it in my son's stocking... not much of a gift for him.

Not that it mattered for the toy, but it made me feel silly giving it to a kid and his parent who do not speak Spanish - would have liked to have known that. But that's not my gripe. The fishing pole line did not work properly. Would not cast out but once you pulled it out, it was nearly impossible to reel back in. No recommendation here."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Deere fishing pole","review":"I was so excited to give this to my son for Christmas. He is 3.5 yrs old. I thought there was something wrong as the line would only go down about 2 feet max. It didn't wind back up either very well. I took it apart to examine and realized that's as good as it gets.

Now how careful an editing job is that?BLACK HORIZON is very dull and lifeless. The fx are cheesy; the cast is about as exciting as watching a toilet flush, and Ice T continues to get roles when he wouldn't know how to act if he were coached. Michael Dudikoff, Hannes Jaenicke and Larry Poindexter aren't even watchable. The fake Russian accents are atrocious..it's just not a very good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Art of Black Horizon","review":"This was one of the worst movies I've seen. I couldn't even watch it. In the opening scene, the footage where Ice T jumps out of the black truck on to the truck with pipes is the EXACT same footage from The Art of War.

If you spent money to buy it, you got reamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"IMAGINE IF YOU WILL...","review":"IMAGINE IF YOU WILL a movie where Ice-T is NOT the worst actor. Scary huh. They attempted to combine an action and science fiction movie and did it rather poorly. There just wasn't enough suspense, terror, or conflict in a damaged space lab to carry the movie. And another thing, there is no noise in outer space. Sound requires air to make sound waves. The doors on the space station looked like they came from Star Trek. HEY! We still use old fashion metal hatches that can make a real seal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful!","review":"Low budget movie filled with stock footage, horrible acting, terrible special effects.

Begins with a drug bust then suddenly, those characters disappear and you're on a space station. Totally unrealistic. The \\"space station\\" has passageways like a Vegas casino. In one scene, a hero takes off in an F-16 and suddenly, they're flying in an F-15. It's as though no one really cared about these blunders. Asteroid impacts seem depicted by the sparks of a grinder on metal. While I couldn't watch the entire movie, I'll bet it ended in a submarine. I think I'll go watch Plan 9 from Outer Space.

It made it very difficult to punch holes without a tremendous amount of force (I got blisters on my palms from wrestling with it so much). It eventually, after only about 100 punches, snapped at the hinges below the handle.The second one I ordered had the cutting plates aligned properly, but still snapped at the hinges below the handle just as the first one had; I managed about 200 punches out of this one before it died.I'm sure they'd be perfect for small jobs, one punch here, another there, but if you plan on using it heavily, I advise you look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality !!","review":"!!

It's made by Namco and is an incredible fighting game."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Game, But There Are Betters Out There","review":"The thing I really despise most of all about this game is the fact that 'button mashing' will win you games. You hardly even have to know what you are doing to pick up the controller and start tapping everything as fast as you can. The graphics are very nice, but without decent, innovative gameplay the game really falls short. Try waiting for Soul Caliber 2 or go out and buy DOA2.

OK so if you liked the Tekken series then this is more of the same, but that's the problem. Yes it is much prettier than previous Tekkens but the gameplay is identical !What is the point buying a next gen console to play a game identical to it's Playstation counterparts, albeit with better graphics.

Unlike every other tag game, in this one the first character that dies, the WHOLE MATCH is over. Your second character doesn't jump in. It is absurd!The game is simply outdated, the motion capture looks stiff, the control system is clunky, and it brings nothing new to the genre...and to add insult to injury, Namco declined to add even half of the options they included in their Dreamcast port of Soul Calibur.Get Dead Or Alive 2: Hardcore instead, or Soul Calibur on Dreamcast"},{"rating":"2","title":"The tekken series springs back into action","review":"Tekken tag tournament is the best game i've ever played because you acn choose two people which will make it more fun.

I love this game of tag because it is a lot faster action then the ones before, and the tag option lets you use both your favorite characters and it lets the mathes be longer. Also if one of your characters is dead then you can send him or her out and let them refill a little bit. Also the tag combo's are amazing, specially if you use to characters that go together like Jin and Heihachi or Paul and Law. If you are these people they have special secret moves that they can do with each other. This is just an all around good game, and if you are a tekken fan, this is the game for you. Go buy it, its worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whats wrong with this game?!!!","review":"this is just like the other tekken games. the tag is just horrible. if u want a tag game get DOA2. that game is way better"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tag Me Out!","review":"Wheres the 3D motions?

Its awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tekken Tag is cool!","review":"This game has awesome graphics. You can get new fighters by beating the unknown fighter. The best feature of this game is when you play the tag game. This lets you and one of your friends challenge against each other or challenge the computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tekken is disappointing","review":"I was disappointed with Tekken Tag Tournament. The graphics no doubt are great, but as far as the gameplay goes, players will be disappointed. This game in no way compares to the gameplay of Soul Calibur for Sega Dreamcast. Soul Calibur dominates Tekken, mostly because of the 3-D, 360 degree movement allowed. Tekken does not use this, leaving the game too basic, and the controls frustrating. Soul Calibur's player moves are amazing and quick, but doing combos in Tekken is a bit of a task, and the movements of the characters don't move as fast as you press the buttons. This game could be a lot better, but for now, your best bet is to save your money and wait until Soul Calibur comes out for Playstation 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE !!!","review":"This game is Tekken 3 with more characters and better graphics. There are no gameplay advancements apart from that, except the bolted on 'Tag' feature. Yep no 3D movement, like Dead or Alive 2 and Soul Calibur, or any of the other innovative features of fighting games since Tekken 3 was released all those years ago. The Beat-em-up has moved on in the intervening years but this game hasn't. It's the same mock 3D game underneath the wrapping that was released five years ago for the Playstation.If you are indeed a 'serious' games player then you can spend your money on far superior games than this. Don't be fooled by the mindless adulation heaped upon this game. If Tekken is your bag baby wait for Tekken 4, It'll wipe the floor with this ancient relic (hopefully)."},{"rating":"1","title":"this game sucks","review":"WHEN I FIRST GOT THIS GAME I WAS SO HAPPY IT WAS FUN.

DONT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wait for tekken 4","review":"The game seemed to play waaaay better on the arcade. Sure the graphics are great, and the new moves are cool enough, but the speed of the game has been dropped. If you play TTT and then try out Tekken 3, you can tell that there is a significant speed decrease in TTT. Plus the ending movies are absolute [crud] and Tekken Bowling is a joke. Buy this game only if you wanna impress friends or if you actually like the slow play. My best opinion would be to wait for Tekken 4. I have Tekken 2 and Tekken 3 and I've completely beaten both of them, so I'm not bias towards the series at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of Tekken and a preview of what's to come","review":"It's not very often that a console game actually exceeds it's arcade counterpart, but that is exactly what Tekken Tag has done in every way. The movement is smoother, the combos let loose with ease and the graphics are absolutely astounding.New to the Tekken series is the Tag-team mode, in which you choose 2 players and can switch between them at any time during the match. Personally, I like it... it allows me to use varying attack styles during the game and always keep an opponent off guard; however, it also means that you must now learn a new characters fighting style and moves in order to be fully effective... an undertaking some might not be comfortable with.Undoubtably, Tekken 4 will surpass all previous titles, including Tekken Tag; but in the meantime, Tekken Tag gives us an incredibly solid, entertaining game to play and shows us just what is possible on the PS2. It's a game that absolutely no PS2 owner should be without."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fourth In A Legacy!!!","review":"Tekken Tag Tournament is a basic round-up of the story so far. It brings together all the characters from the previous three games but, it also brings us a few bonuses aswell such as it has reincarnaited 'Mokujin' as 'Tetsujin', it adds an extra character named 'Unknown', it replaces 'tekken ball mode' with 'tekken bowl mode' and it gets rid of 2 of the most irritating characters in the whole series: 'Gon' & 'Dr B'. Overall this game proves to be a healthy and acceptable addition to the Tekken Legacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best fighting game","review":"Tekken Tag tournement (created by Namco) is a great action game.The graphics are great the sound is awesome the backgrounds are very realistic and the loading time is super quick. There are tons of special moves and combos for every character, and there is a Command list whhich tells you the character's moves and shows you how to do them. I think this is a great game for any action video game fans whether they have heard of Tekken or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"never got it","review":"i never got the product i waited for it the whole time it never came to me and i want my money back for this product"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality fighting game","review":"This is a quality fighting game right here, one I'd definitely recommend to anyone. It has virtually every character from past Tekken games, and retains the awesome fighting (well, obviously). The extra bowling mode is nice if you wanna take a break from fighting. I wish they could'v had better (or more) music, though, I mean the music for everyone's ending cutscene is pretty much the same. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Games Ever Made","review":"I've played alot of games, alot. In my opinion this both the best fighting game ever made & the best game to play if you only have two people (although you can play it with up to 4). Most of the game mechanics are easy to pick up, but there is enough deep techniques to keep the game interesting for years. Essentially the game is an incredible expansion to Tekken 3.

Most of the graphics are pretty good, and it can be fun to play against others for a few rounds. However, the game really falls apart with its inconsistencies of play, and one-player gaming is an exercise in futility that no gamer should have to endure. At critical moments in the game, your controls can simply become unresponsive. Unfortunately, you never know when this bad programming symptom will strike. This game must have been rushed to market, as nobody in their right mind would release this thing as being bug-free.

But all through reading it, I got more and more depressed, and wondered why I continued to read it, since I hated almost all of the characters! I found I was in a bad mood all through this book. But I continued to read and hated to get to work in the morning (for more than just this reason!) and canceled lunch dates so I could keep reading it! Go figure! Was I reading it to see if even one of those people I hated \\"got\\" what was coming to him/her??? Was I happy with the ending??? NO! I'm just sorry none of my friends read this book so I could discuss the psychological ramifications! It's a great read, but I don't know if you'll be happy with the end result."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"I enjoyed much of the development and history of the main characters. The writing itself is above average. However, the deputy sheriff is so unbelievable that he should be satirized by comedians on Saturday Night Live, or by some anti-establishment hate newspaper. He would have been fired long before he could have brought hurt to anyone. This is a man sworn to uphold the law, yet he manages to plant evidence, be a coward, leave his wife and family for a trashy harlot, and also manages to get the harlot back with substance abuse. Thank goodness for the colonel, and his sense of values and honor, even though contrary to Western standards at times. This book took me almost two weeks to finish, but I figured that... Oprah liked it, maybe there would be a redeeming conclusion. Not so...readers save your money. Before I am called a non-realist about life, I have never come across so many losers in such a short parameter of time and space, and all over a house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This is the first time I read a book from Oprah's book club. Oprah was raving about this book during the book discussion show so much that I had to read this. I hated the two characters Kathy and Lester. I cannot believe people can make such bad choices. They both are such losers that they deserve each other. Oprah said 'you will not believe the ending'. The rest of the book is so badly written that I can believe the ending - equally bad. I am sorry I wasted my time reading this cheesy crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeply moving tragedy that reads like a suspense novel.","review":"Being the child of immigrant parents who were desperate for their \\"American dream,\\" I could sympathize with the Colonel and understand his pride (not arrogance as some reviewers have said). On the flip side of the coin, having recently lost a parent, I could also sympathize with Kathy, the Colonel's enemy, who just wants to hold on to what was passed down to her. To see their conflict unfold was like seeing my own inner conflicts come to life.Although this novel started out a little slow, it quickly engrossed me to the point where I simply could not put it down. The author really captured what was in the hearts of the Colonel and Kathy (good and bad)...and also mine. Yes, it's a depressing ending, but this book is enlightening, extremely sensitive, teaches you about true compassion and it changed my life. It's one of those unforgetable novels that I hope you're open-minded and open-hearted enought to recommend to all your friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intimate tragedy in the Greek tradition.","review":"A clerical error, a single letter, leads each character to take predictable steps, one by one, until things spiral out of control and there's no way out but further in. At the end of Part I, I felt an enormous satisfaction with the story, closed the book, and said, \\"That is enough. It can end right here.\\" But Dubus has much more, and another character, incidental in the first half, becomes embedded in the second half and leads the story to its inevitably tragic conclusion. Dubus creates exceptionally detailed characters with a blending of flaws and strengths that intermix to form very real people. I have not seen the recent film, and don't plan to, but the actors cast as Behrani (Ben Kingsley) and Kathy (Jennifer Connelly) fit very well and made the book visualization so very very simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lives that stay with you weeks after finishing the book.","review":"The characters in this book stay with you. All of them leading lives they never thought they would be leading. And then all of them crashing together. Each person imperfect and tragic. It is the rare story which causes me to cry. This story did. Not to be a cliche but it is a sadly beautiful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly remarkable book - impossible to put down!","review":"This book seizes you from the beginning, and does not let go until the dramatic (and surprising) ending. Explorations of cultures, social justice, and narrative experimentation are woven together masterfully by Dubus; the result is a work that is very difficult to abandon for bathroom breaks, dinner or sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't see the attraction....","review":"I stalled out at page 70. Dubus' characterizations are tediously long and his writing is sloppy. He's already referred to various characters' eyes \\"being moist\\" about 4 times--a small detail, but one that really annoyed me. The author has also made a few mistakes about Bay Area facts, which is distracting to anyone familiar with the community. Finally, I have tried to get interested in his characters, but I can't empathize with Kathy or Behrani. Call me a quitter, but I'm moving on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the first fifty pages and the last fifty, skip the rest","review":"I really enjoyed Colonel Behrani's voice and perspective as a character. If the entire book had been told from his point of view, I might not have skimmed through to the end. I lost interest as soon as the author took us into the voice/mind of Kathy and her relationship with Lester. I don't enjoy 'victim-fiction' which is why I haven't read many of Oprah's latest picks. Kathy seemed to fall into that stereotype and Lester's fall into her stretched my imagination too far. I hope Mr. Dubus will write another novel using the strength of the voices he captured in the Behrani family...I'd look forward to reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love, misdirected and misguided","review":"I am in agreement with the former reviewers who felt the book was very depressing. I know that Oprah (or her staff) chooses books where readers might learn something. Well, I learned something.......not to take Oprah's picks as law. There was absolutely nothing to look forward to in this book. Although, it was well written, everyone had a self-destructive life. I had particular distain for Kathy (who we were to believe was a recovering alcholic, but don't believe what you read, folks). She was just sad, plain and simple, with no redeeming qualities. I had hope for Behrani, but the love of his own country & the yearning for his former military life was an accident waiting to happen. I had great compassion for Behrani's wife & son. I had no compassion whatsoever for the policeman who played a pivotal role in the destruction of so many lives. Don't buy the book; it's a waste of money and if you're just a little depressed today, it'll send you over the edge."},{"rating":"1","title":"A short story gone bad","review":"Plodding, dull, self-absorbed, depressing, a waste of talent. These are just a few of the things I could say about this god-awful book, but why waste your time? You get the message. There is not one likeable character in the book, including Esmail. You learn to hate each character very quickly for their selfishness, their supreme vanity, and their wasted lives. In fact, you're almost glad they all end up dead at the end (even Kathy is \\"dead,\\" as she has been most of her miserable life). This sad excuse for a novel should be avoided.

He sees a very bad side of life and insists that we accept it.Yes, life under a despot, the Shah of Iran, in intolerable. The author brings this intolerability to us right in our own back yards. America is not a dictatorship, yet the author would like you to believe that anyone who lives here is unable to overcome a horrible past.Read it if you must; but be prepared to pay the consequences.

The novel is dull and pointless. It's about two ugly, nasty people and their fight over a home they both feel they own. The characters were unlikeable and not particularly interesting. The novel dragged all the way through. The only reason I kept reading is that I figured there had to be a reward at some point. I thought the author would finally live up to all the dreck written on the book's back cover.

I'm not sure that I will be able to force myself to read the last 30 pages that are remaining in the book because I am really getting tired of all the mess ups that everyone is making in the book. Kathy goes into a downward spiral that isn't totally believable. And what's up with Lester? He started out being pretty ok but has lost all reasoning to give up a family and career in a matter of days. I don't buy that.

It is definitely not worth anyone's time or money. I agree with all the reviewers who gave the book no more than one or two stars. The sex scenes are especially ridiculous!

OK, so this married cop falls in love with Kathy, the woman he escorts from her home? Just like that? Maybe I can deal with that, but then, he learns she is a recovering addict and just shoves alcohol at her constantly! And it sends her OVER THE EDGE! Who didn't see that coming?! She is an addict!!

As another reader mentioned, it started off with a very interesting plot and detailed characters but turned into a truley miserable book. It was unbelievable, depressing and pointless. I kept reading hoping it would take a turn for the better but that never happened. I was deeply disappointed when the book was done that such a good premise turned into such a dumb story! Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"when diversity hurts","review":"I read this because of the author's father, whose work I admired. While writing talent and wisdom would not seem to be inherited, this writer is frighteningly wise. In a world, where all of us live nearby, next door to, or in the same house as someone who speaks a different language, dreams a different dream, and both fears and hates the other, there is so much pain. We hurt ourselves and each other because of the differences. As the world shrinks, we have to learn to listen. I ached for these people, wanting them, screaming at them to sit down in a room together and listen to each other. To listen past the prejudices, past the stereotypes, the hate, the fear. But all we have to do is read the headlines every day to know how difficult, how impossible it is. Yet books like these can help. They make us see the deep, true connections where we meet, past the fear we let control us. Wonderful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Depressing, tragic","review":"I usually try to read the books in Oprah's bookclub, most of the time they are very good and you can relate to the characters themselves as well as the struggles they are going through. However, I found this book terribly distrubing, and disappointing. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone and I would think twice before ever picking-up another book by this author. The only reason why I finished the book is to see who ended-up with the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"House of Sand and Fog","review":"Kathy was a bore, the kind of woman I'm really tired of reading about. I would like to see this in a short story form. There was way too much driving and drinking and feeling sorry for oneself. I would add this to the very long list of bad women books. Not a page turner but a page closer."},{"rating":"2","title":"So...I would like to digress...","review":"I would first like to disagree with any naysayers about this book. It follows a wonderful line of literary convention, and carries an idea to an end. It is an almost too perfect novel. The writing of the characters makes it almost impossible to judge them. They all are caught up in their lives and their own personal dramas, and cannot see where this is upsetting the paths of the others. This book, in short, is literature of the highest order."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read about a sad tale","review":"I enjoyed this book. It seemed to me that it presented the problems that entire countries face in relating to each other in the way these two people related to their own problems. Both characters had good points and both looked at the situation very differently. It is the same with countries as the culture of one country does not unterstand the culture of the other country. I agree that the sheriff was not well drawn, but overall a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"House of Stupidity","review":"I greatly enjoyed reading the book to a point. It was fast moving and a real page-turner with interesting characters, especially Behrani. But after three quarters of the story, it began to fall apart, its seemingly intelligent characters behaving in incredibly stupid ways, especially Burdon, the responsible FTO police officer. I was looking forward to some trouble and then, perhaps, an interesting resolution, but no, the story took a nosedive with the important characters displaying extemely poor judgement, rash behavior and gross stupidity. Ultimatley the book was not believable and very disappointing. Shame on you, Oprah, for recommending it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Bad Bad","review":"This was THEE worst book ever about a bunch of selfish, unlikeable characters. I watched Oprah and went out that night and bought the book. I wish I never watched Oprah. She and the people on her show made this book out to be a great book, which it is so far from being. And as far as the last 100 or so pages supposedly being so great, well I ended up skimming them. I could have cared less to read about all this tidbit information the author was suddenly supplying. Very badly written. This author owes Oprah, otherwise no one would be reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unconscious Living","review":"This book was a great example of people living their lives backward in a state of unconsiouness. Esmail, son of the Behranis was the only innocent victim in the entire story.I guess I can only recommend this book if you want an blueprint of how not to live your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"There are many many books here at amazon.com that are worlds better than this. Since when is Oprah supposedley so deep and profound?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A completely unnecessary downward spiral","review":"This seals the deal on my opinion of Oprah books. I finished it only because I feel compelled to finish books I start. It was like one of those movies where you want to scream at the characters to stop what they're doing because it's just plain stupid. The characters kept making dumb mistakes that sent them further and further into a downward spiral...a completely unnecessary downward spiral."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Wait for it to End!","review":"This book fell completely flat with me. I'd read reviews and had received positive personal reviews and so I was really looking forward to cracking the bind!When I began reading it, I liked the mood and was drawn in. But soon found in very draining with the lack of motion in storyline and the droning on and on from the main characters. It frankly, became unbearable, and I skimmed the last 40 pages or so, and I hate to do that!On the up side, the story itself has much potential, I just felt the author spent too much on non-dialogue, ie. many, many pages were of the characters' thoughts and memories. Normally, this doesn't bother me, but in this case, it caused a chasm in the storyline that left me bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Linear, exciting towards the end, but....","review":"The book basically depicts the clash of two individuals and one family all star-crossed and fate entwined in an embroilded situation. Each page is a narrative of trains in an ultimate but predictable collision which you can speculate to have a metal twisting explosion. The story gets al little bit exciting towards the latter part, but the ending leaves a lot to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Immigrant experience is the only redeeming feature of the story","review":"The story drags. It is depressing, as others have written. Multiple layers of tragedy, but the most compelling perhaps is the tale of prejudice experienced by the family. There are better ways to spend time than reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad ending","review":"The House of Sand and Fog was another of our bookclub books. This one was true to my experience with the Oprah selections: interesting reading, but certainly not uplifting. In fact, it was full of tragic characters who spiral out of control into disaster. The story was a little by slow at parts, yet the ploy was very unique and the character development was interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst thing I've ever read","review":"I don't mean to be ugly, but this was one of the most depressing, uninspiring books I have ever read. I understand that the Oprah book club thing is about books that maybe don't have uplifting endings but the ending on this one was just overwhelming. I didn't find a redeeming value to it at all. I actually felt depressed when I was done. If there was a message (which I am sure there was and I even believe I slightly got it), it was drowned out by the futility of the entire story. Again, I don't want to be ugly but I absolutely hated this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Felt like I needed a bath after this one!","review":"This novel was chosen by my book club... Our overall review was a resounding thumbs down. It starts off promising enough with an interesting premise, and did hold my attention till about the halfway point. Then something strange begins to happen to the plot and the characters, they both deteriorate to the point of ridiculousness. I was especially amazed with the character of Lester, who although seemingly portrayed as a loving father engages in such inexplicably reckless and stupid behavior as to certainly result in his children being minus their daddy. The novel is also gratuitously interrupted with raunchy ...descriptions that sound like a junior high school boy and his friends were penning the scenes. Save yourself the aggrevation and don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO ENDING....... AGAIN!","review":"Dubus has a definite talent for spinning the English language into an almost compelling tale. The characters can draw you in, you get set up for an exciting conclusion, the crescendo builds.....then nothing. I felt like someone tore the last few pages out of the book. I'm not surprised, though. He does the same thing with every story in Dancing After Hours. Big build up, no payoff. A note to Oprah's Book Club, try a bit harder."},{"rating":"1","title":"outrageous, horrible, depressing","review":"The first third was interesting. The rest of the book was ridiculous. The author treats the 3 main characters as if they are victims of fate without any sense of understanding or intelligence. The ending was hideous. I definitely would not recommend this unrealistic, gory, and depressing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very engaging","review":"I just love a book that draws you in and makes you feel like you are part of the story. \\"House of Sand and Fog\\" feeds your senses in such a way, you feel as if the events are happening to you.I could actually feel Behrani's pride and there were times Kathy's pain was too much, forcing me to put the book down. When a writer has the power to reach out from the pages and touch you such as this, it really earns its five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this book","review":"I felt angry and depressed when I bothered finishing this book. The characters were at first compelling, but by the end despicable. The plot was very thin- not enough to justify the 300 + pages. A short story would have been sufficient to tell these sorry characters' tale of woe. The author included several vivid descriptions, as if they were added for a writing class assignment. The voices of characters whining and worrying over and over was irritating. I didn't quit reading because I hoped something would happen. The ending destroyed all faith in humanity. Don't bother reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap read","review":"First of all, the author writes from two perspectives he knows little about, a drug addict woman and and Iranian immigrant. The depiction of Iranian culture was a complete stereotype and often inaccurate. The transliteration of Farsi phrases would have been tedious for those not familiar with the language. Kathy, the female protagonist, is a cookie-cutter character from a cheap Hollywood flick and is hardly convincing. My second problem with the book is the overly-descriptive and far too frequent sex scenes. These scenes could have been done tastefully, instead, are disracting to the plot. Rather than constructing what could have been a fine peice of literature, the author has put together a cheap read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails on many levels","review":"Not to be picky, but first of all, the law is that since the county never owned the house, since they made the mistake that started this whole mess, they can't auction it, and in real life the sale would be taken back whether Behrani agreed or not. But aside from that, where the author fails badly is that he does not make Lester or Kathy synmpathetic characters that I care about. I feel nothing but contempt for them, and throughout the whole story wish they'd go away and leave the Behranis alone. And no, I'm not Iranian or even close. The story just spirals uncontrollably downhill to such an extent that it was not believable. And the end is ambiguous, maybe intentially. I have no idea what happens to Kathy at the end. But since the author has made me not like her I don't feel sorry for her at all. This could have been done much better, but it's obvious that the author is talented, and his next effort can be considerably better than this (I hope)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Is OK But Not Great","review":"The author penned a good picture of how different the \\"family\\" oriented foreign people are compared to the \\"self\\" oriented American people are. That's the only thing that kept this book interesting, other than that, I really thought this was a rather slow read. Most of Oprah's books are terrific but this one isn't that good in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"House of sand and fog","review":"Though Dubus' skill as a writer is exceptional, and the book extremely well written, I was so disturbed by the conclusion, and the fact that the character, Kathy Nicolo is portrayed as a vacuous idiot, and Lester not shinning too brightly himself, I could not possibly recommend this book. It was like taking Lithium, it brings you down and keeps you there. I have read books recommended by Oprah's book club, fool me once..."},{"rating":"2","title":"compelling read","review":"I felt that many of the customer reviews I read captured quite successfully what I wanted to say so I can only add that this is a book that totally captivated me...yet knowing that as I got deeper into it that it would result in a tragic and disturbing conclusion -- but the characters Dubus presents here --particularly the Colonel, were so \\"real\\" that I woke early this morning to finish it -- it was as if it was my duty to read it and complete it knowing that I would be saddened by its resolvment but still compelled to complete it. A most unforgettable story that will stay with me for quite awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Competing dreams lead to tragedy","review":"It starts with a bureaucratic mistake, escalates into a power struggle, and ends in tragedy. Three people want the same thing - a better life for themselves - but can't see a way to achieve it without denying the others their dreams. Actions taken as a result of impulse and poor judgment are compounded by further actions and reactions. Dubus changes perspective regularly throughout the novel, revealing each character's back story, dreams and motivations. My only complaint is with the ending ... I recognize why, at the end of the book, Dubus gave each character an opportunity to reflect on what had happened, but I still wish it had ended about 30 pages earlier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"I really enjoyed reading this novel, it was interesting and also emotional. I love when I read and I actually get emotionally involved in the story. While the story contains some parts that aren't that necessary; like the various sex scenes, I still remained interested until the end. The ending was also unlike what I expected but I was not disappointed, just left feeling like instead of inserting unnecessay parts with the story, the author could have saved that space to further develop the ending a bit more.All in all, this was my first time reading a novel from this author and I would recoomend it to others, even just to experience the emotional roller coaster that the story takes you on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the faint of heart...","review":"Truly a great read. From beginning to end, I found it difficult to stop reading. Once you begin this emotional roller coaster, you find yourself immersed in the lives of three people. The stories are beautifully told, switching from perspective to perspective, you never lose focus. The reader is completely involved and there for every step taken, every mistake made by each character. The writing style is great, and actually makes you believe that each perspective is being told from a certain person's point of view.I do feel, however, that the ending left something to be desired. Other than than, the storyline is a steady stream of events that keep you engrossed. This book is certainly not like any other Oprah book... it's actually good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tragic Must read Page turner!","review":"Please note right off; this book is not for the weak in heart. It is not a skip in the woods happy go lucky book. That being said I will say what it is-it is a triumph in writing. While the point of view shifts you will be intensely involved in what starts as a small dispute over a house, and spirals into a murderous tornado. The backround on the characters is amazing- detailed, and very believable. As I drove around town I believed I ran in to whom looked to be the characters in this book, it seemed so real. I was immeadiately sucked in and couldn't put it down. I have shared this book with many friends and family as well, and while the story is dark, we all agree, it is an incredible ride. I was shocked to find myself even shedding tears at the end---I am not even sure who I was shedding them for. After you read this book, you will know what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"House of Sand and Fog","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I felt it was shallow writing and frankly surprised it was on Oprahs list for good reading. Half way through I was bored and thumbed through the rest of the book and got the jist of the story. Reminded me of a soap opera. Swearing and sexual feelings/fantasies don't fall into my category of good reading/literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"!que horriblE!","review":"this book was poorly written, the characters were shallow stereotypes and the story was stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dysfunctional City by the Bay","review":"By sheer willpower, I managed to get through 60% of this book before heaving it into the fireplace and watching it finally bring a little heat and light into the world. I am sure that is a happier ending than the author had in mind for his work, but it was the best I could manage under the circumstances. Not a single character in this book is worth wasting your time getting to know. If they lived in my neighborhood, I would move out at night with no forwarding address !"},{"rating":"1","title":"House of Emptiness","review":"I started reading this book with high expectations. I like reading books that leave room for the imagination. Half way through, I realized that I developed no connection with the characters. I didn't care for Ms. Nicolo and her cop boy-friend and more disappointingly I didn't like or sympathize with the Iranian family although the book's whole story line suggested that I should have because these poor people are foreigners who came to U.S.A by being forced out of their own country due to the regime changes and they are home-sick and trying to make a new living in this totally strange country with its strange rules, odd lifestyle etc. etc. I felt that the book was limiting my imagination by forcing me to read it as if I were watching a very predictable movie. I guess the author had a movie script in mind and arranged the whole story with that perception. Flavorless and a very empty book."},{"rating":"1","title":"complete waste of time","review":"This book is an utter waste of reading time. Overwritten, poor character development, self indulgent, and horrible narrative. I would not recommend it at all. I'm recycling my copy rather than passing it along to someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"worse book I have read in a long time","review":"I chose this book because of the description of it as 'unbearable suspense' and thought it would be a nice summer read. Anyone reading these reviews knows the storyline: main character , Kathy Nicolo, is evicted from her home erroneously because of tax office error (a simple response to the volumes of mail she received from tax office before everything escalated would have avoided all).Don't want to give away the plot, but although the author gives realistic description of scenes and internal diaologues, I was mostly put off by the continuous self indulgent, self absorbed main characters. What kept me going through the 364 pages was the thought that there was some unforeseen twist at the end that had you re-evaluating the whole story, or raised consciousness in the characters. Instead it was an intertwined path to what could only lead to total destruction."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Collision of Two Opposing Forces","review":"Andre Dubus III has created an intense and gripping novel that is impossible to put down with the hope of never reaching the end. Daring to risk a departure from the conventional use of a single protagonist, Dubus develops two main characters who polarize our emotions and intellect. Between themselves, Massoud Behrani and Kathy Nicolo are the antagonists to each other; however, for us the reader, it becomes a vacillating experience that makes us feel for the both of them while at the same time has us pass critical judgment on their flawed natures. Hoping for some compromise to resolve the struggle to possess the treasured house, Dubus instead allows the plot to form its own direction, like a raging river overflowing its banks and forging its own course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"Great Read! Shows both sides of an unfortunate incident affecting desperate people with no way out. Not sure which character deserves the most sympathy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tale of the Struggle for the American Dream","review":"In this novel, Andre Dubus III manages to intertwine the lives of two extremely contrasting characters through his masterful command of storytelling. In the book, one character, an immigrant, struggles to achieve the American Dream while another, a recent divorcee, struggles to maintain hers. Brought together by a single house, the characters discover each other, and, more importantly, themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed characters-that's the point!","review":"Not every novel offers a spoon-fed protagonist. The reviewers giving low ratings seem to have misunderstood the cast of main characters altogether. Do you people only read books about princesses and knights in shining armor that you can \\"sympathize with\\"? Haven't you ever come into contact with that person in life that plays the perpetual victim, making mistake after mistake and never bothering to get their life in order? At the end of the novel both Kathy and Lester come to see prison as their rightful abode, while Behrani can only find solace in what he assumes will be a blissful afterlife.This isn't one of those \\"choose-your-own-adventure\\" books where you get upset when your character makes a misstep. It's a study of dysfunctional characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent writing, great story, fascinating characters","review":"Told from dual and opposing perspectives, \\"The House of Sand and Fog\\" is intelligent, suspenseful, compelling and thought provoking. Once read, it's impossible to forget these unique and realistic characters, they're like none other in literature. Even the minor ones are memorable.Both narrators are relatable, well drawn, distinctly different and each flawed in unique ways. The suspense builds when the main characters challenge each others right to \\"the house\\". Both have a legitimate claim but it's their personal investments--one reaching for a brass ring and family security, one holding on to the end of the rope-- that force them into a \\"win at any cost\\" mentality. This is a great book to discuss with friends since readers inevitably pick sides themselves. As the story develops and the tension escalates your favorite character will probably switch a few times as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of House of Sand and Fog","review":"I recently read the \\"House of Sand and Fog\\" by Andre Dubus III. The most accurate portrait of this book that I can paint is to say that it's a very descriptive novel detailing the intracacies of relationships and what results when a passionate conflict is included. I couldn't put it down while I was reading it; its moving language and meaningful suspense kept me wondering and reeling the entire time I held it in my hands.However, this mirror is double-sided. It is indeed one of the most profound and depressing books that I have ever read, but it isn't one of my favorite. I think once I'm a bit older (I'm 12 right now) it my be something that I will like better.So, I give this book 4 stars out of 5: its very well written, but it's not one I would give as a gift to anybody, so I can't give it a full 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"House of Jekyl and Hide","review":"Mark Bowes, I couldn't agree with you more! The first half reads as a fast-paced, solid story which manages to be insightful and reflective while keeping the action alive. It was very grounded, and seemed like many real-life legal and personal battle happening every day. But when the wheels come off, when the characters begin behaving in outrageous, completely unrealistic ways, the story degenerates into a lurid TV Movie of the Week.Just as this soft-spoken novel turns into melodrama, the author begins using more obvious, cliche literary devices, as well. Whenever a character does something completely unpredictable and violent, the next chapter gives us a flashback to a damaging event from that character's point of view. As if the reader will be comforted by extra exposition. Surely, there has to be a better way to invoke sympathy, keep the reader interested, and move the story along!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the ending you'd expect...","review":"This was a book I couldn't put down.

You'll love it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a relaxing read, for sure","review":"This was one of the most disturbing books I've ever read, but I can't say it was poorly written, just that I didn't enjoy it too much. I did like the way the author educated us readers to the ways of the old world while also portraying how some modern-day people live. I didn't like \\"seeing\\" an innocent family that minded their own business and took advantage of an auction, get dealt such a terrible hand. Just not my idea of a good book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough to choose who to root for","review":"I had a really hard time deciding who I was rooting for in this story, I felt so much pity for Kathy, yet I empathized with the Colonel and his reasons for wanting to hold onto his \\"cream puff deal\\" of a home in order to give his family a better life. What an amazing talent Mr. Dubus has to make me feel so strongly for both characters. The story is extremely thought provoking, human error results in tragedy and it is all too real. I felt really awful for the Colonel's wife, and thought it was interesting how I could sway between feeling sorry for Kathy and the Colonel, and then being so angry with them . . . my feelings were all over the place, which was a bit frustrating for me but to the authors credit this story aroused strong emotions."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap and manipulative","review":"The book started out quite compelling and sensitive to the difficult lives of the characters.

This one is so unbelievable it's difficult to describe. Absurd characters... ridiculous ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was also disappointed in this book and my comments are similar to the other negative ones. I did hear Oprah talk about the suspense and how it kept her on the edge of her seat. I did not feel this way at all! In fact, I bought it since I knew it would take months to get it at the library and I think I finished it because I bought it! I love to read and like nothing better than that feeling of not wanting to put a book down. This did not happen with this book. I did not like any of the characters very much and thought it was not at all suspenseful until the end. I also thought the very end was just flat and didn't leave me with any feeling of finality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"This is a tedious grade B or C book that wouldn't make it as far as a made-for-tv movie. The characters are one dimensional, the writing flat and cliche-ridden (eg He had the: (fill in one) softest, deepest, darkest, warmest brown eyes I had ever seen.)

The unacceptable behavior exhibited by Les, Kathy and the Colonel is described in such pitifully self-serving detail that one only hopes readers don't try the same games themselves in real life.The message I got was that it's okay to play the victim and seek revenge.You would think Oprah, of all people would understand the incredible power of suggestion from books, media, etc. There will always be people writing about sad, sick people and things but the last thing we need are influential voices endorsing them.Don't waste your time reading this and don't waste your money supporting the Oprah \\"fan club.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A TENSE AND HEART-PALPITATING BOOK !","review":"Andre Dubus is a very gifted writer with an extraordinary imagination. I was spellbound throughout the entire book. I did not like all the sex \\"scenes\\" between Kathy Nicolo and her co-adulterer, Les Burdon, and didn't feel they were necessary to the plot. Both of these characters were a psychological mess, and all of my sympathy went to the Behrani family. The ending was tragic for all concerned. House of Sand and Fog is one of those books that is very hard to put down once one starts reading it. A very compelling novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great page turner","review":"This is a great book. The character developement is excellent, which, to me, is the most important part of a good read. The book centers around a bitter fight for ownership of a hosue, and you find yourself feeling for each side of the arguement because Dubus does such a wonderful job of developing the characters. You can see each character's point of view, even though they are people you normally woud not identify with. Once you get to the middle of the book, it's very hard to put down. I highly recommend this for anyone who's looking for an absorbing read, you don't forget these characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reality check","review":"This book is ideal for taking on an airplane. It reads quickly, demands little attention, and concludes with very little to ponder. The first section is well written and promises some interesting insights into immigrant culture, but then the novel deteriorates into a largely unbelievable plot that is suitable for a movie of the week (which is probably why this was even written, and which explains the disturbingly pornographic sex that appears at predetermined intervals) The reality check is that I at first told a Persian American woman at work how much she might enjoy the book. By the time I finished it I prayed she would not recall the conversation. The ending so badly stereotypes people as to be embarassing. Overall, however, it will make the time on the plane pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just because Oprah likes it, doesn't mean I have to....","review":"Life in general has enough drama and conflict in it. I read to decompress and escape for a little while each day. This book was not an escape, but more of a torture. I now vow to stop reading after the first three chapters if I am this unhappy with a book again.This was a deep well of wallowing in self pity and expectation of something that never appeared.Perhaps the author needs some anti-depressants. Then again, seeing the sales numbers, perhaps not."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe this made Oprah's book list","review":"If you think that you are too happy with your life and you want waste a couple hours, then this is the book for you. I can't believe that this book was made into a movie or that Oprah put this on her book club list. It is that bad.I did find it interesting to review the cultural differences and expectations of different societies, but other than that it was extremely depressing and a total waste of time. If you want to know the ending - everyone either dies or goes to jail. What an uplifting story - not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mark Bowes's review is right on target","review":"I too wanted to throw the book away as it degenerated into unnecessary, pop-culture violence in Part Two. I should have had a tip off when the narrative voiced changed: it was almost as if Dubus had written two books and then lumped them together. Furthermore, I am not sure that the central premise of the book--ownership of the bungalow--is sustainable for 350 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've got to stop listening to Oprah","review":"I bought this book because I caught a show where Oprah claimed it was one of the most phenomenal books she had read to date. Well, I've just got to stop listening to her. I've enjoyed very few of her recommendations. The characters are depressing and the storyline is frustrating. You just don't care what happens to them, you read along in awe that none of them consider going through the proper channels to rectify their problem..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I wasn't even 1/4 of the way through the book and threw it away. Too bad. Might be a good story, however, why should the author use such foul language and who cares about the porn movie that the character watches. I tried to get past this several times, however, everytime they bring up the character, Kathy, such foul language is used.

I have enjoyed Oprah's choices in the past, but not this time. I agree with other reviews that the first part is okay, but don't even bother reading the second. All of the main character's were despicable. The plot was thin and unbelievable, and the ending was just plain horrible. I ended up just skimming the last 50 or so pages to get it over with.

I don't want to give too much away for those who haven't read it. It is still an interesting read...I would have given it a 4.5 or a 5.0 were it not for the Yellow Moon Owl inconsistency. But because of such an inexcusable flaw (which will rear its head later, starting in Chapter 9 and snowballing from there), I cannot give this book more than 2 stars. Mr. Dubus, I suggest you get either get a proofreader or concentrate more on doing your research on Yellow Moon Owls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly Depressing","review":"I have generally enjoyed the books on Oprah's list, but this one was terrible and depressing.

While the story may have had some redeeming qualities, my attention was drawn to these inaccuracies.The story is depressing and at this point, cannot bring myself to read to the end.

The ending turned me against the book totally. I was very upset by it and very mad. The writer could have done so much more with this. I will definitely never read any other books by him. On a scale of one to five, I gave it a three until the end which brought it to a one.

It is very well written, but was so slow I felt like skipping to the last 10 pages to find out what happened (I've never done that). The revealing look at mid-eastern culture was interesting - I'd say that was the best part. I got so sick of Lester Burdon and his low level girlfriend Kathy. Also, Mr. Behrani seemed too angry and pompous to care about.

This is true America, a melting pot of so many cultures, and all these people blend here in this novel.

But I absolutely hated the ending. There was really no closure and it was too damn depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting book with human characters","review":"Not one character in this story is flawless. Their flaws draw them to make some really bad choices that lead them to more bad choices. Kathy, the girl trying to hide and hope that things will will just be okay (she doesn't deal with the first notices she receives, just figures they're a mistake). The colonel just wants to be a success so he doesn't lose face with his family and peers. His family doesn't see any problems because the colonel hides the problems, and they choose to overlook any evidence. Everything builds and spirals until you just want to read and see how the author handles these issues. I found I wasn't pulling for any particular \\"hero\\", because there wasn't one.I really liked this book because I found it wasn't predictable and it showed people with different cultures and ideals trying to work through a situation in real estate (which I find confusing in the best of circumstances). I really enjoyed this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"two authors?","review":"The first two thirds of this book was evokative and persuasive, especially in creating the two sympathetic characters of the recovering addict who loses her father's home and the industrious, proud Iranian immigrant with the emotionally fragile wife who seeks a better life for his family in America. The last third of the book seemed to be written by someone other than the author who created these protagonists, someone concerned with plot and action rather than emotion; creating a morality play and perhaps with just getting the book done. I was entranced by the beginning and felt duped by the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"House of Bad Decisions and Despair","review":"If you want to read a book about people who constantly make bad decisions and others who are trying desperately to make things good but get tharted, then this is the book for you.

As a result, I try to always reserve making judgement on a book until the very last page. I have been joyously surprised on several occasions by a last minute twist an author squeezes in which transforms a seemingly endless read into an exciting adventure. I enjoyed the writers' style, and the preliminary development of the characters did draw me in past the \`point of no return' (about 10 pages). Unfortunately, after that point, there was very little else pulling me along except the desire to be done with this book. I found each characters' decent into ruin, return to addictions, moral declines, or eventual fates depressing, dull, and down-right annoying after a while. My apologies to Andre Dubus III, after all, who am I to criticize? But this book did nothing for me personally. In all fairness it should be noted, this book was recommended from a family member who DID like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"nihilistic and depressing","review":"This book was quite disappointing. The characters self-distructed without reason, and the author never made me feel sympathetic toward them. If the author's aim was to say that life is futile and meaningless, it was well made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.","review":"Being a Persian, and also having liked many of Oprah's selections, I was so excited to read this. Let me just say that this was truly one of the worst books I have read in a LONG time. None of the characters are particularly likeable or to be respected. I cannot believe that this has been recommended by Oprah, and because of this, I will not be reading any more books that she recommends. In all fairness, the first part of the book is very good, Dubus even does a fairly good job with the Persian culture. But my recommendation is to never read Part II, and to come up with your own ending. There are bad endings .... and then there are bad endings. And this was just dreadful. Really, really upsetting. And no, that should not encourage you to read it and find out how bad could it really be?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A poorly written work with unbelievable premise","review":"In the first few pages I thought I might like this Oprah recommendation. The writing seemed to be imaginative and the study of cultural differences had promise. It was a promise never fulfilled. The book soon disintegrated into redundancy, with the same descriptive phrases being repeated again and again as though the author couldn't think of any other way to describe a person or scene. The book is filled with graphic, coarsely written sexual scenes which add nothing to the story and seem to be added for purient purposes. The characters are unsympathetic and the premise for the plot is unrealistic to the extreme.What could have been an interesting study of cultures in conflict absolutely missed the target."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than plot and characters, great book experience","review":"This was a slow read for me. I think there's some internal pacing going on, where only so much darkness and be ingested at a time. Plot, characters etc are secondary to how this book can move the reader. It's an experience. To recap the book's content, for me, does not, explain the effect of the book.Dubus wrote a tragedic novel that read, for me, like a timeless story of how close to madness life can be. We may live in parallel universes where each small decision leds us to the universe of redemption or to the universe of utter madness. We skip from one to the other with each decision. Unfortunately only saints or such are able stay on the course of redemption.I do not usually stumble across a reading experience like House of Sand and Fog, especially in today's world of formula story telling, formula diagloue and formula publishing."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an amazing book!","review":"This is not the type of book I generally read so what possessed me to do so I'm not sure. . .but, this is truely a wonderful story right up to it's tragic ending. I thought it amazing how the author could write from two so totally different perspectives and give those characters meaning to me. I had a hard time putting it down, so anxious was I to find out the end of the tale. It's worth your time to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good best-selling type thriller","review":"For those who enjoy best selling novels, House of Sand and Fog is an enjoyable thriller. The drama of these two parties who fight for a house is well worked through, challenging the reader's simpathy for their causes and experiences. Even though sometimes the characters' mindset seemed rigid and their feelings a bit extreme, I didn't find their portrait to be stereotypical. I could follow their beliefs, their history, their doubts and the unique meaning the house had for each of them. I found that the sexual sub plot was heavy handed at times, skewing my attention from the main drama -- but it wasn't so bad. This story is about misunderstandings, despair and past hurtful lives that come together around a pathetic house. Even though I was eager to know who was going to get the house at the end, I felt this hollow sadness for the characters, and hoped for a good compromise at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suspense less","review":"I have read alot on my own but have enjoyed Oprah's picks. She really played up the suspense and I didn't find any."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bird Cage Liner","review":"I usually find good in all books, but I can't believe this was published. The story line is weak and is based on a bunch of sitiuation tragedies that network TV would be embarassed to protray. It is full of unnecessary sexual content that reads as if a fifteen year old boy wrote it. Grow up Andre!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about the journey","review":"I enjoyed this book on many levels. As a woman, I am delighted to finally sympathize with a male character. The story is believable, realistic, and well told. It's simplicity at its finest: Behrani wants to keep the house and restore peace to his family; and Kathy, who is wrongly evicted, struggles to get the house returned to her. In the end, the worst possible things happen and it is not a \\"Hollywood\\" ending, but if you've ever seen the real Hollywood, you know it's not all hugs and happy endings. This book is about the journey these characters travel, not their tragic ends. This book cannot be summed up by the last chapter. In many ways it's a beautiful ending, especially if you believe in the soul. What would have happened if Romeo and Juliet had just run away together, opened up a B & B, had a few ordinary children, lived to ripe old ages and then died peacefully of natural causes? YAWN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rave Reviews Unwarranted","review":"Although the swapping narrative was mildly interesting, it wasn't enough to save the story from the seriously flawed plot. Every plot twist, which eventually led to the dismal conclusion, was tortuously removed from the realm of reasonable possiblity. Although the moral of the story may have a definite base in the reality of today's society, this particular attempt to derive a realistic parable from that base was unconvincing. The characters just didn't seem vacuous enough to have done what they were forced to do.\\"Dumb, Dumber And Dumbest\\" would have been a much more appropriate title..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oprah... what were you thinking","review":"I should have read the reader's reviews before I bought this book - if I had I would have saved myself a bit of cash. Being neurotic I have to finish what I start and House of Sand and Fog or as I started affectionately calling it \\"House of Sand and S#@*\\" was a drag all the way through. I tried to convince myself that the meaning and mythic potential behind the gratuitous and ultimately boring sex as well as the poor character development was worth it but the author just didn't pull it off. One good thing - I discovered that I really do have discriminating tastes when it comes to books - Oprah has recommended some really good stuff before but this is definitely not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"a struggle to read","review":"I read this book at the urging of my fiancee, who found it delightful. I struggled to finish this story. While I could not predict the ending, I found the entire book very slow and at times confusing. I did empathize with the immigrant wife and son. the rest of the characters were very disturbing and dysfuntional people. What happened to the original homeowner was her fault and the city/states fault. No one elses. The concept of the story was good the substance and writing could have been much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such an incredible waste of time","review":"I have read all but seven of Oprah's book selections, and I have found most of them very rewarding. This one, however, is the grand exception!The story line was interesting and original, but the characters were grossly underdeveloped. By the novel's midpoint, not only did I not care what happened to them, but I simply just wanted them to go away! Dubus did not portry them in a manner that makes the reader like them or sympathize with them.Bottom line...DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY. Read Joy Fielding's \\"The First Time\\" instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"It's hard to believe that this book was nominated for a major award, and that Oprah saw fit to add it to her book collection (a dubious honor anyway). This is a terrible book, with little to recommend or redeem it. The depiction of the struggle of the immigrants' lives was mildly interesting, but the rest of the story and characters were soulless and underdeveloped and unnecessary. Only a story that MUST be told should be told, and this story is not one that needs telling. I noticed that previous reviewer called this book as good as I KNOW THIS MUCH IS TRUE. On that, I must agree."},{"rating":"1","title":"House of Sand and Fog","review":"As a resident of the book's setting, the SF Bay Area of California, I was intrigued about the book -- unfortunately, the anticipation of reading it was the best part! This has to be one of the worst books I've ever read! I don't quite understand the critical acclaim it's been getting -- I would compare this book to a trashy romance novel. This is a sorry tale about Sheriff Lester Burdon who cheats on his wife and falls in love/lust with a Kathy Niccolo who is broke, homeless and is constantly having visions of he ex-husband who dumped her. The other main character of the book, former Col. Behrani was a man completed in denial of his current lot in life which is a trash picker by day and 7 Eleven cashier by night. I found this book re-enforcing of negative ethnic stereotypes and a total waste of one's time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"Although this book is well written, I found it to be unbelievable and I didn't like ANY of the characters. I was glad to get through it so I could move on to almost anything else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and bizzare.","review":"I have read several of Oprah's recommendations and like all of the others, this is an unusually weird book. I don't think she reads anything except this type of book. I did finish the book, only because I am stubborn and refuse to give up, even though it was not an enjoyable read. I do not recommend it to anyone, unless they are into depression.I will not read another of her recommendations nor will I read anything else by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Watching a Bad Accident","review":"This book was overwhelmingly bad. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because it managed to keep me interested enough to finish the book. While reading it, I kept asking myself \\"How stupid can these people be?\\"I kept reading the book in hopes that any one of these characters would have some redeeming quality, but that never happened. They were bad characters from Page 1. Whenever I thought this book couldn't get any worse, it did.I had no sympathy for the main characters. They were pitifully self centered and constantly acted to their own demise. The character I came closest to feeling sympathy for was Behrani, but then the writer would invariably add a trait that would make me lose sympathy.Also, Dubus' style of writing in changing from first to third person was highly frustrating and unsettling. I wish he had just picked a style and stayed with it.I was very unsatisfied with this story and wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the ruts and muck of humanity","review":"A woman in the habit of carelessness loses her house via county auction and a hardworking immigrant gets a bargain. Hey, can't we work something out? Not really. While Andre Dubus III takes his readers into the minds of Massoud Behrani, Kathy Nicolo and her hopeless lover Lester Burdon, he also sticks us in a rut that's knee-deep in self-deception, selfishness, prejudice. Face your demons, people! (Umph, it doesn't even dawn on them.) If that's the point, a work well done. The story is a downward spiral filled with characters who are always asking, 'why me?' and never looking beyond the muck of sand and fog. Massoud, Kathy and Lester work up a frenzy that gives humanity a black eye. While a few peripheral characters share tiny moments of kindness, their portrayals are left in the dust. The story left me agitated . . . albeit affected by how ugly we can be. -DJO'B"},{"rating":"1","title":"One-Dimensional Characters","review":"This story is told in 3 voices. Voice 1, Colonel Behrani, is an indepth character study. He and his wife and son are colorful, 3-dimensional deep characters.As for Kathy and Lester, the other 2 voices, they were not much more more than 1 dimensional. Dubus did not develop these characters to the extent he did the Behranis.I was disappointed in the gross mispronunciation of more than one main streets in San Francisco. This meant to me that proper research was not done by the readers (both).I was also disappointed in the monotone performance of the female reader. She was probably trying to be as one dimensional as Kathy, and she was successful.The story is a good one, brought down only by the lack of character development of 2 of the 3 main characters and naive performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Facts obscured by fog","review":"If it were not for the fact that this it my book club's book this month, I would not bother finishing it. I find the author's lack of geographical knowledge about the area very disconcerting. Secondly, the characters are not at all likeable. Some reviews have suggested that the book is not for those who choose to delude themselves with uplifing stories. I don't require an uplifting story, but I prefer characters to have some redeeming value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring story line, cheesy, and unbelievable ending","review":"...The story line is boring--and I hate to use this term--cheesy.The Colonel was an interesting character--you loved him and hated him all at the same time. The author had clearly done his research. Lester and Kathy, on the otherhand, were poorly developed. The sexual references in the book are ridiculous. Like when Lester thinks of Kathy, is it necessary to give us graphic details of what he thinks about? That seemed completely irrelevant and thrown in for no reason.The ending was described as suspenseful, and that it was. I was in suspense wondering if it would really end this poorly. I just kept thinking \\"this book is so dumb.\\" ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly draining","review":"I listened to the book on tape in my car, and found myself so depressed and anxious when I left the car. Kathy Nicollo is the type of person I would consider trash, and would not keep company with if I knew her in real life. A 36-year old woman who throws out notices about overdue-taxes ? Anyone who doesn't bother to straighten things out deserves what they get. Oh, and this woman has no female friends whatsoever to turn to when her husband leaves her and she is evicted ? Come on ! I found myself screaming at the character (my tape-player) and wanted to smack her in the face. Is this really what reading a book should be like ? The only thing that kept me listening was wanting to see her \\"get it\\" in the end, and I was robbed of that! What a disappointment.If you want to read a book about two people trying to get back at each other, where you actually feel conflicted about who to root for, read \\"Kane and Abel\\" by Jeffrey Archer. Dubus's book can't hold a candle to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"well written, but worth writing?","review":"I was excited to get into this book... it seemed so promising. Clash of post-modern clutures, learning to live (or not live) with our neighbors, who are so different from us.But nearly half of it is about this one crazy man finally going over the edge. In that vein, it's nowhere near as good as 'In Cold Blood' (what is, right?).And in terms of culture clash, it's nowhere near as good as Crash (film, yea, but very thought-provoking).In retrospect, I wonder why an author from way-mostly-white New Hampshire would set his culture-clash novel in California. It could never happen here, right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"When I first started to read this book I could not put it down. The first half of the book was compeling. As the plot thickened I could not quite figure out how it could end in a sensible manner. Does Nicole get her house back? Does Colonel Behrani do the right thing or does his pride and ego interfere with his decision making and how about Lester, does he leave his wife and children? All these plots seemed intriguing and then the second half of the book is very disappointing. Its like the auther did not know how to end it so it goes crazy! Also, my lungs ached with every cigarette Nicole lite up. Was it necessary for her to do that constantly? I go the message in the beginning she was a chain smoker. Anyway, I was really disappointed in the ending. I was looking forward to a clever conclusion to a tangled mess. They either ended up dead or in jail. How convienient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corona is in SOUTHERN California....","review":"To all authors: if you're going to make up cities for your novels, please make sure that they are not already existing within the state! That was even more annoying than the references to \\"Frisco\\" and smoking in non-smoking restaurants. Makes one wonder how much of the other research is wrong.One of the bigger disappointments is the title--it leads one to think that the house is in some way special--it isn't, and why either party is fighting over it at all is puzzling at best.I read this because I thought, it HAD to be better than the movie (which, except for some of the acting, is just dreadful), it just had to be. But it wasn't.Don't waste time with either the book or the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst book ever","review":"This is the worst book I ever read. It took me almost a week to read, when a book of this size if I like it takes 2 days.

The book puts you in the middle of everybodies lives really quickly, and you get attached really quickly. I wasn't able to compare my life with them, the book is totally unrealistic. And then it totally left me feeling horrible and sad. I went to work the next day still (ticked) off. I thought after I finished reading it, I would have a good review, but alas, I don't. If you like extreme tragedies, this is a great book. However, if you like books that are real and don't leave you (ticked) off, don't read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unpleasant story","review":"I listened to the audio version of this book. I admit to preferring books with happy endings or at least those where the protagonists profit in some way. The audio version is a 14 hour tribute to stupidity and stubbornness. There is nothing to learn here except how not to react to bureaucratic error. The writing is good, but the turns in the plot do nothing to make this a worthwhile experience. Isn't it enough to have things in life with terrible results like 9/11 and the Holocaust without producing fiction that does the same? The reactions of the people to the circumstances don't even make sense. By the way, Kathy is a reformed cocaine addict, not an alcoholic like several reviews state. (this is stated very early in the book)."},{"rating":"2","title":"House of Sand and Fog","review":"As I began to read the book I felt - Here's another story of someone in deep trouble. The authors descriptions of the different events and of Kathy was exceptional. I did feel sorry for the colonel and I wanted him to have the good life he wanted for his family when he came to America. After all isn't the Usa the land of opportunity?? At times I was hoping that Kathy's husband Nick would come back in the picture to stir-up some trouble, but that did not happen. Lester did what he had to do with the situation, although I think he got what he deserved. In my opinion Kathy should have died at the end of the book however your the writer. The ending was not what I expected but then again you needed an ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time reading about these pathetic souls","review":"This book was terrible and I struggled to get through it.

But I thought Dubus had such a gift for portraying flawed personalities. For example, it was interesting to watch Kathy get bounced around by life. Dubus did a good job of showing how she constantly let herself be propelled by external forces (went with Nick to RR meetings against her will; let the county take her house; didn't ask about Lester's being married but let him start dictating her life just as Nick had; watched as Lester set their disaster in motion without protesting, etc.) When she thinks Lester is leaving her she nearly kills herself, vaguely understanding that she can survive only as a parasite. Even at the end of the book, in jail, she only starts to come back to life again as she attaches herself to the powerful Jolene. To watch such a loser in action, how she made her decisions, was fascinating, and I thought Dubus did a good job with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time!","review":"I cannot say enough bad things about this book. Why ... felt it was so wonderful is beyond me! This book is poorly written with too many unneccessary characters/details when it wasn't important, and not enough good details where it was. The plot in and of itself is a bore -- all that over a house?! Women, especially married women, do not want to read a book where a married man is so 'gentle and warm' to his immoral, trashy, alley-cat girlfriend. The sex scenes are graphic and disgusting. GROWN WOMEN HAVE BETTER THINGS TO DO WITH THEIR TIME THAN READ THIS PURE GARBAGE. There was nothing uplifting or positive about the whole book ----> I quit reading it about 1/4 way thru and thumbed through the rest, looking for one good reason to finish. Found it never picked up; just got worse. The best place for this book is not on the bookshelf; it's in the garbage with the other trash. Got my money back from the bookstore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying to be Shakespeare maybe?","review":"I liked this book for the first half or so. The characters were very intriguing and I genuinely cared how the entanglements would work out. But it gets so incredibly tragic by the end that I felt as if the author thought he was writing King Lear or Romeo and Juliet (minus the poetry). As I neared the end, I found myself needing to talk about it and related the whole plot to my husband, who sat there in disbelief at how badly things were going for everyone. I agree with the previous reviewer who said the \\"romantic\\" parts (i.e., the sex talk) was childish. The author's descriptions of how a woman thinks about sex struck me as a man writing about a woman's experience, and it just didn't ring true. In the end, I found the book to be not a gratifying read. Guess I'll stick to happy endings for now."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Book I Have Ever Read","review":"I thought this book was great. It makes you think the whole time you are reading it. Don't be surprise if you want to throw the book across the room because you get mad at a character, it just happens. If you get this book and read it, you will be happy with the results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Bottom line I thought the book was great up until things started becoming completely unrealistic. I won't get specific for those of you that want to waste your time reading the book. I'll just say that I was loving it until half way through when I didn't even want to read it anymore. What a complete disappointment! It just went off on a wild track that there was no way that would've happened in real life. It was just stupid. Don't waste your time with this one. I threw it in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"A novel which should be a short story","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. The tedious description was ad nauseum. Poor development of sand and fog symbolism. One reader called the Colonel's ownership of Kathy's house as \\"freedom from pretense\\" and that he ends as a hero. If anything, his determination to make a profit from the sale of the house and his suicide in uniform underscore pretense and superficiality. Furthermore,Lester's desecration of law and order while wearing his uniform points to a more meaningful metaphor. Additional focus on structures - Kathy living in cheap motels, her car, a shack in the woods - shows a transient nature which Colonel Behrani eschues. Enough foreshadowing makes the ending plausible:the Colonel's temper and abuse, his focus on control and Kathy's irrational behavior from page one. Lester is a poorly developed character. The novel reads like an author's first write which should have been a short story."},{"rating":"1","title":"really annoying characters","review":"Though I had a hard time putting this book down, and the plot was grasping, I was constantly annoyed by the three main characters, especially the way the author developed Kathy and Lester, and their disfunctional relationship. I felt compelled to finish the book, but was annoyed throughout most of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD MATERIAL FOR QUENTIN TARANTINO","review":"As I continued to read this book, my mind kept saying \\"Boy, this reads like a cheap novel\\". After having repeated this phrase to myself numerous times, I concluded that it is a cheap novel. For the most part, the characterizations are trite, the plot highly contrived, and the turns of events unrealistic. With the exception of some informative material on Iran, this book easily qualifies as \\"Pulp Fiction II\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the read","review":"Although this book is well written, the second half ruined what could have been a good book. When I was finished with this book I was very annoyied that I had wasted my time. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reading","review":"You will love this book! The author does an excellent job with points of view! You will find true human emotion in the characters. This is one if the best books I have read this year. Be good to yourself and enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written, but&#65533;","review":"House of Sand and Fog is the most stress inducing book I have ever read. It's the story of the battle of wills between two parties, Mr. Behrani, and Kathy Niccolo, over a little bungalow just off the shore in northern California. When a third party, Deputy Sheriff Lester Burdon, steps in to help Kathy, the battle gets intensely out of hand, and everything snowballs uncontrollably until the disastrous finale.While it was beautifully crafted, and I marvel at how Dubus was able to wring out so much depth from such a simple plot line, the tensions are piled so thickly I couldn't appreciate the story--I was too stressed out! I wouldn't recommend this novel to anyone, unless they felt they needed a little extra anxiety in their life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don' bother...","review":"Once again I feel the sting of having read a book, studying each line, reading each word...only to be disappointed. If you want to feel that you have spent several hours of your day in a wasted effort, i highly recommend you give this book a read. It leaves you unfulfilled, depressed, and somewhat confused. What starts out as strong character development and a study of a foreign culture disintegrates into sadness and misunderstanding. And i have yet to figure out the strong sexual undertones and graphic descriptions included in the book...perhaps i just don't get it. My mind is full of sand and fog...or maybe i just thought this book sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"A train wreck in slow motion does not make for good reading","review":"From early on in this book, you know that something terrible is bound to happen. But in the beginning you hold out hope that at least one of the main characters will grow on you and show some signs of being something other than a complete self-absorbed and amazingly weak fool. But no, it is not to be. By the end, you feel deep sympathy for a couple of innocent bystanders but not the two main protagonists. How this train wreck in slow motion of a book ever got nominated for a National Book Award is beyond me. If you want good tragedies, try Tolstoy. In the hands a master like that , this story could have been a winner because it does have the makings of good tragedy. However, in the hands of Dubus, it comes off as more like darkness for the sake of darkness instead of darkness for what it tells us about the souls of humankind. Okay, Dubus, you've mastered bleak...now get over it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"House of Depression","review":"Boy was this a depressing novel. I love Oprah's show, it's so uplifting, but her book list leaves room for improvement. This was a book about people in a lose, lose situation with no lesson in sight. Read this book if you suffer from being too happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"This book got such rave reviews from Oprah, I was prepared for a great book, but I was really disappointed. The characters make terrible decisions, they are not likable or sympathetic and the plot is totally predictable after the first 60 pages or so. Also, if this is set in the present time, (I didn't catch it, if it was 20 years ago or so) then I wonder if the author has BEEN to California in the last 10 years. We have had no smoking laws in restaurants for a long time, but the main character, Kathy, constantly smokes in the mall and in several restaurant settings. There isn't one character you can care about enough to hope they make it, except maybe the son. And the basic premise, that the county could mistakenly take away her house, is very doubtful. It seems a pretty thin hook to hang this whole story on."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book I have ever read","review":"What a terrible picture this book presents! She thinks bad and sad thoughts and so she gets bad & sad things in her life. so sorry that this was recommended and that I took my valuable time to read it---a big mistake!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived","review":"Nobody does much of anything that's rational in this novel. And the climax is precipitated by a series of Hardyesque \\"diaboli ex mahcina,\\" from the dep sheriff's unnacountable actions in Behrani's house, to the even more unaccountable action of Behrani's son at the crisis.Some scenes are well done, but the plot creaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"I swore I would never read again after this book","review":"This book was such a yawner that I nearly swore off reading after I finished the book. Were these people the most stupid, unrealistic characters? Every turn of the page brought on more stupid actions and there's not a positive, inspiring person in the whole story. I must be wierd because all the reviews here are heralding this book as a 'must read.' If you're a normal, down-to-earth person and intelligent human being; don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Characters, Bad Decisions","review":"The characters in this book are not strongly depicted. There is a lack of evidence to support what motivates them to make the horrendous decisions that they do. The reader doesn't develop an appreciation for any of the characters' values, which makes it hard feel anything other than disgust with respect to the decisions that they make. I have no idea why this book is so highly regarded, awarded and recommended. I found it to be a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star Too Many--Poor Literature","review":"Poor literature indeed. The author seems desperate to voice his sexual smut, just so completely unnecessary and tasteless-doesn't even pertain to the storyline. The author also drones on and on, filling up page after page, with descriptions of everything-rocks, landscapes, houses, you name it-in what feels like an attempt to get page count.The characters are not believable and they never build any moral disposition for you to even like them or care what the outcome was. I threw the book in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"* NOT For KIDS !!! *","review":"I gave this book 1 star, only because the review requires at least 1 star. This book was given to my 14 year old son to read for a High Honors required summer reading program. He read through the first 2 chapters and handed the book to me and said he wasn't going to read it. My husband and I then read the book and discovered extreme graphic sexual content, not just once, but, many, many times! The description of the sexual content is not done in a metaphorical way, it is exremeley graphic! I'm totally disgusted and appalled that not only did a teacher choose this book, but that it was approved by the Director of Curriculum! PARENTS BEWARE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time and money (just saw the movie)","review":"This was a frustrating piece of trash movie, full of sensationalism, murder and gore, for murder and gore's sake, with no redeeming qualities that any of us - the unfortunate movie goers - could deal with. The audience was mixed; couldn't decide whether to cry or laugh (some cried, and some did laugh). The consensus of opinion seemed to be, \\"This is unbelievable, and why didn't they call 911, and why didn't they give that girl a tetanus shot, and why didn't Ben Kingsley change the expression on his face?\\" I'm exhausted! Please rate this a zero, or anything lower than one. (I wouldn't be surprised if it wins the Academy Award this year!) Oy vey!"},{"rating":"1","title":"i am judging this book by its cover","review":"i have not read this book yet. but there is one interesting thing on its cover, the word \\"sand\\". it looks like average american mentality is set to mention this word when it comes to anything iranian. in other words, no matter what the scenario is, this word has to be included in there to signify it iranian. despite your brainwash, iran does not have as much desert as you have been programmed to think it does. as a matter of fact, other than sands of the persian gulf beaches and the caspian sea, there is no other place in iran that is covered by sand. another piece of information for your geography that you did not learn in the high school: all together, iran has less desert than the state of california. the world has changed; it is time to join the planet earth and learn about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent book","review":"i can see why they turned it into a movie. at first i was like this is going to be boring because the sound of the plot but it was a page turner. i loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I was extremely disapppointed in this book. The characters were uninteresting and totally unsympathetic. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed in the language used in this book (I think they should provide a ratings system like movies). And I hated the dark feeling this book left with me. It was not uplifting or enlightening. If this book is someone's reality, I certainly don't want to read about it, especially if it's not true. If this were based on a true story I would probably have a lot more compassion for these people. But the author Made These People Up! Don't waste your time reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like these people","review":"A story about unlikable people is tough going. I've read the other negative reviews and they all put it more eloquently than I can - these characters just aren't likable so who cares what happens to them?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the last Oprah recommended book I will ever read!","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read. The characters' lives are totally unbelievable. I felt sorry for their stupidity, and obviously wondered about my own in finishing the book. I felt very heavyhearted knowing that anyone could have even survived writing all of this tragedy in one novel. After reading the last page my sadness turned to anger in having wasted my time reading such a ridiculous story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Yourself - Don't do it!","review":"Don't waste your time unless you're not quite sure if you want to commit suicide or not. This book comes with the knife included.Who is Oprah to be advising people on reading material? I have found no information in any of the books she recommends, no redeming value and no research in the content. And certainly no entertainment! I want to be entertained with information that I can't put down. There are too many books, too little time. Oprah's stamp is the kiss of death as far as I'm concerned. If you want an informative novel that you can't put down read anything by Phillipa Gregory!"},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!","review":"Dubus is for the most part a great storyteller but has redefined the term \\"fiction\\" with this storyline! With the unrealistic plot of a former druggie's house being sold as a result of an error in clerical work, he forces the reader to feel nearly nothing towards his protagonist, \\"Kath\\" and the supposed antagonists, this innocent Middle Eastern family who uses the opportunity of purchasing the \\"seized\\" house to better their lives in the States. The \\"book\\" begins to run like a made for TV movie with its lame and depressing ending! New definition for UGH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"House of Weak Ending","review":"I loved the book until the last few chapters. The book ended like the author was in a hurry to close it and wrote a very weak ending. I was angry that the ending was such a let down and so stupid because the rest of the book was so enthralling. I will never trust reading anything by this author again."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Endless Jounrey","review":"I do not know if I would consider getting a book like this a present. From beginning to end you are left with a feeling of betrayl from the author. In other words, you do not care about either conflicting parties nor the trials and tribulations that flow throughout the novel. Andre Dubus III, has an aptitude for character development, almost too good. You end up knowing more about the characters that you wish to because each character would be considered a neusence in our society. One of the biggest downfalls of the book is the unnatural dialog between the characters and the less than pleasing plot. I highly recommend passing over this novel and continue searching for a real diamond in the ruff. Heath~"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Keeper","review":"This book has the distinction of being the only book I ever threw away. What a tedious journey to endure, only to come to such a ghastly, morose ending. I honestly can't recommend this book to anyone. I had to laugh when I heard it was on \\"Oprah's Book Club\\" list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Pathetic","review":"House of Sand and Fog is one book that readers should always avoid. Reading it is simply wasting of time. I started reading it to find out who exactly gets the house. But the conclusion was simply disappointing. I felt like stupid to read it till the end. The first part of the book was really interesting, but when I went to the second part, it turned out to be boring than ever. And also there was too much stretching in the conclusion. Dubus was not really coming to the point. He just left it incomplete. As far as I think, Dubus just tried to show how much he was capable of saying the story from two people's point of view. Unfortunately, it was nothing but a disaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here's a thought","review":"I thought this book was very good. I am forced to read many books for school and this has been one of my favorites. The connection in the book with mythology is very creative. Kathies fate and then her punishment reflect that of Oedipus. If you didn't like the ending read Oedipus and you might understand some more of the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressingly prosaic","review":"This author clearly has a gift for writing, but seems to have spent too much time in front of television dramas. Some very interesting, three-dimensional characters fall victim to a ridiculous plot. I will wait for your next novel, Mr. Dubus, because if you can bring yourself to collaborate with someone who has an interesting story to tell, I know that you can bring the characters to life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing in Every Aspect.","review":"From the very first paragraph, you know this book is going to be depressing. What you don't know is that it's going to be a headache to get through. Each character is shallow and has the Shakespearian-quality of making ridiculously rash decisions inevitably leading to tragic consequences. I especially found the author's attempts to mesh the Persian culture in every other sentence irritating. What bothered me the most about this novel, however, was that I felt no empathy for a single character --save for the Colonel's son--a character who was kept far in the background. The narratives were too drawn-out and ridiculously infused with self-pity. Throughout the novel, I began to despise the characters more and more, and by the action-laden end (strange because the rest of the novel took so long to pick up), I felt totally disappointed. I had expected so much more from this book because the idea was brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"On the whole, annoying and tiring","review":"I must admit that I looked forward to reading some of the early chapters of the book during my lunch hour. After the first third or so, I lost interest. Then I got irritated by the repetition and boring 'tension' that the book introduced and then beat to death. Then at about the 1/2 way point I thought I would stop reading it, but compromised and spent about 5 second on each page, just to feel that I had 'read' it.The main characters are weak, selfish, pointless. The plot is thin and not very convincing. The writing is boring, and the formula of switching the character point of view from chapter to chapter got tiring (probably because the characters are so).Sorry for this low rating. I 'm fussy about my books and life is simply too short..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oprah is on a roll!","review":"I got into this story immediately and found it hard to put down. The three main characters in the book were all identifiable. I could see how Kathy felt so helpless as her house is taken away from her through no fault of her own, but at the same time I felt like Behrani should be allowed to keep the house as it also was no fault of his that it was put up for auction. When Les came on the scene I had a feeling he wasn't going to help matters any which he sure didn't. I didn't find the ending to be a letdown as some did, it was full of twists I hadn't expected, but I was wishing for a happier ending. I will be looking for more work by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great character development, steadily eroding story...","review":"What started out as a thickly developed, interesting story, totally destructs 2/3 of the way though. The strong, well developed cultural contrast between the 2 main character groups seemed squandered the deeper into the book I got. I was surprised to find this book had received awards. It seemed that the author became bored and decided to change the ending and take the cheap, Hollywood B movie ending route....Can you say \\"movie option?\\".If they do make this into a film, hopefully the script will be changed to have a more cohesive (and hopefully more positive) ending that fits the characters' development.Worth a look only to get a perspective on a naturalized citizens' view of America and as a possible model for developing and contrasting cultures though characterization..Otherwise, skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please give me somebody to care about in this book!","review":"First, this book is constructed in a unique and interesting manner that moves the plot along quickly. If you *have* to read it, as I did for a book club, you won't have any trouble turning the pages. However, if you're looking for a redeemable character to relate to, you probably won't find it. I think Dubus meant to make the main characters more sympathetic by giving each of them a voice in the novel, but it backfires. I didn't care how the problems resolved at the end - the characters' selfishness and intolerance had just exhausted me by that point."},{"rating":"1","title":"the house of undeveloped characters","review":"to say that this book took a weird turn would definately be an understatement.I genuinley liked the characters up until about page 200,when i thought to myself,shouldn't this woman know better?It's as if Andre Dubus turned two of his main characters(Kathy and Lester)in to pshychopaths in the second half of this book,from people who were seemingly normal(at least by california standards)in the first half.Everyone likes an exciting twist in a book,an unexpected turn,but this ending was nonsense and left me very dissapointed.If anyone tells you that this book is a page turner it,s probably because they were trying to get through it faster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly Disappointing","review":"I realize that I am mortal, and therefore will never get to read every book that is of quality. That concept is one with which I can live. However, I find it atrociously irritating to have wasted what precious time I do have reading crap. House of Sand and Fog is nothing less than a shocking disappointment. So much so, that if I could rank it with 0 stars, I would. Engaged by the characters and their stories at the beginning, I found their depraved actions at the end to be so far-fetched and terribly gratuitously violent and sexual, that I felt like I was watching a cheap Hollywood film. I would find it hard to believe that anyone would buy the actions of these characters as possible. I understand that desperate people often resort to desperate actions, but Mr. Dubus sells these people out at the end. Please save your precious time and money and spend both reading something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I found this book to be extremely depressing. I only stayed with the story to see who would get the house, but only to find such a depressing end. I believe Mr. DuBois had his head in the fog too long. I'm sorry I wasted a beautiful summer day on such a gloomy book. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I stopped reading halfway through","review":"The book started off with an interesting plot, but then it deteriorated into absurdity. The characters lost all plausability. I didn't have the desire to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"Could this book have dragged on any longer? I found myself struggling to finish the book because it took so long for something to actually happen. I did want to find out what happened in the end (which was completely ridiculous), but didn't care much about the people, except the wife and son. Everyone else pretty much got what they deserved. And the end? It's like the author had to contrive something so tragic that it didn't even seem real. Also, I agree with another review - if he said the words \\"his/her eyes were moist\\" again, I thought I might throw the book across the room. I usually love Oprah's books, but this one isn't worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Although I am late in finding this author, I have already told others about him.Love the style, have ordered others by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just adding my 4 stars (lol)","review":"Tons of reviews here i see... and i'm jumping in late.I loved the book!! Funny - i liked the second half better than the first! Our differences are what makes the world go round...I thought the story was fantastic, writing was awesome, and kept me riveted to the book - i read it in 1 1/2 days - didnt want to stop!My only complaint is - i couldnt LIKE any of the characters, which gives me no one to \\"root\\" for. I supposed that's not such a bad thing, but it just felt strange to me. I did like the wife/mother, and her 'side' was the one i was on, but everyone felt so complex that they just never become people for me to like or feel like i could relate to, i guess.

Why do they all end so horribly? This was one of the most tragic books I have read. Dubus makes you care so much for the characters, and then just writes the worst possible outcomes for each of them. There is enough pain and suffering in the world today-give me something a little more upbeat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oprah was wrong","review":"There are some moments of good writing here, but they seem to belong to a short story writer who loses his grip when faced with a long form. Not one of the characters was believably motivated. That is, I could understand the importance of the house, but each separate decision or action made by Les, Kathy or Behrani seemed manipulated by Dubus purely for his own purposes. The failure of the novel to compel my suspension of disbelief was cumulative, so that by the last hundred pages I found every action or decision less and less believable; as the characters had more time to think about what they were doing each appeared increasingly less likely to act as he or she was made to do. I'm incensed that the famous Dubus name dictated a literary marketing scheme: if this book had been sold as a mass-market rather than a trade paperback I wouldn't have wasted hours on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forced myself to finish this one","review":"Most authors create at least one human character the reader will feel sympathetic towards, not Andre Dubus In \\"House of Sand and Fog\\". While the characters created were believable and the reader understood what lead to the real estate predicament, one doesn't care. The depressing resolution was almost cheering as the characters are now out of circulation. The prose is primarily well-written though the plot sags about 2/3 of the way through. Skip this one. It doesn't merit Oprah's raves. Her \\"Good Housekeeping\\" seal of approval doesn't make this a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"No suspension of disbelief possible","review":"Earth to five star people: Five stars is a rating reserved for masterpieces, which this book most assuredly is not. The characters seemed like chess pieces (or checkers, more like it) trundled around quite unsubtly in order to achieve the desired climactic result. Give this one a miss if you value your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've lost my faith in Oprah","review":"I will admit that I am an Oprah fan and have read (or tried to read) every book that she has chosen. There have been a couple that I couldn't manage to muddle through and how I got through this one is beyond me. Maybe her promise that the last part of the book would be worth it. The book starts out very good then goes downhill from there. Sure, the action picks up at the end but it is sort of unbelievable. Am I the only one that noticed the authors preoccupation with breath? C'mon - that sort of detail is o.k. but in one part of the book I think we know the status of the breath of 3 characters in 2 or 3 pages. There is tea breath, tea and sugar breath, cigarette breath, alcohol and cigarette breath, etc. Enough of the breath. If you are looking for a good book to curl up with, ignore this one. It is hard to get into to and most of the plot is unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A particular stereotype of gloomy contemporary fiction","review":"While I thought this book was well-written in some ways, I found it very predictable and not suspenseful at all. You can often see the author behind the words, thinking \\"okay, this sentence is the one that'll suggest that what this character is doing is a mistake, and things will get even worse. It seemed very contrived and obvious. The violent scenes were predictably ugly, the white-trash female character had predictable sex scenes, the right wing military man was predictably conflicted, and the cop was the usual type of \\"good boyfriend\\" character--gruff (he's a cop) but of course sensitive-that always comes up in this sort of fiction written by soulful writers. This book could have used a sense of humor about itself. It has none. Plus, I heard the author on the radio and he's some kind of reformed, ex-macho bar fighter who sounds like he's keeping himself in check from referring to himself in the third-person royal."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG disappointment","review":"I was curious enough to find out what ultimately happens with the house, that I finished the book. But I found myself despising the main characters so immensely that I hoped that neither of them got the house. The repeated descriptions of Kathy and her nicotine breath and messy hair made me nauseous and made me wonder why Les wanted her so badly. I liked the wife and son very much and found myself hoping that they would get the house to the exclusion of the colonel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I read the whole thing.","review":"Perhaps it was Oprah's promise that the last 100 pp would make it all worthwhile. Perhaps it was my reluctance and stubborn nature to say that the book just wasn't a fit for me.

I know life is not always pretty, but I wish it were and I would much rather read about resolutions that are beneficial to everyone and not as tragic as this one.This story is presented with great empathy toward the Iranian family -- their tale is masterfully presented.

Yes I was one of the lucky to get my hands on the PS2 on 10/26/2000, but Its seen more movie time then game time. Onimusha: Warlords is the only PS2 game that's held my attention for more then an hour. Warlords story is basic, a princess is kidnapped by evil guy, good guy must save the day. Unlike Resident Evil, Warlords has a few little eggs that make this far supirior. First of all in warlords you have the ability to preform some great combo's , magic attacks, and one hit kills. Also Warlords gives you what RE dosen't, the abilitty to Block. Warlords has some great eye candy, with seemless backgrounds,great looking enemys,and the magic attacks look great. Onishma: Warlords in my opinon, Is the best \\"Survival Horror\\" game to date, but warloads is also a little more fast paced then Traditional \\"Survival Horror\\".

I, myself love anything related to fuedal Japan or Demons, this happens to have both! With only a mediocre storyline (save the princess from a reincarnated Daimyo, Oda Nobunaga) and corny dialogue, it is drawn back slightly. But in terms of physical and special attacks, this is one of the most dazzling and gut-wrenching games ever made. This game may not be RPG perfection, but it's pretty damn close.

This is totally lame and makes the game practically unplayable.Did I mention no jump button?I paid $5 and would have had more fun had I kept the money and A) made a paper airplane with it or B) set it on fire and watched the delightful glow.Buy Devil May Cry 3 and have a blast.

It has the potential to be a great game in the tradition of the Zelda's of the gaming world. Unfortunately, this game has a fatal flaw-its length. Honest to God, when I finished the game I thought that I was only through the first part. I thought okay, now onto the next stage. Instead, the game informed me that the next installment was coming soon. I felt so gypped. I even played it twice thinking I may have missed something that caused me to choose the shortest version of the game-but no. Honestly, I would rent this game on a weekend with no plans. You simply cannot afford to spend good money on a game that if it lasts you a weekend, I would be shocked. Don't buy this game.

It has the Resident Evil look and touch, but is some what better. The game has a great look to it, and is challanging to an extent. Some times the game gets really confusing and you dont know if you are doing the right thing or just running around in circles. The only flaw to the game is how fast it is to beat. I did not buy this game and i dont recomend buying this game, but rent it. I played the game for five days and beat it. So go to Blockbuster and rent this game, if you cant beat it you just miss two really cool looking demonds and an awsome ending cinematic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A FUN but Short Game.","review":"This is the first game I've played from Capcom, and I have to tell you that it was an extremely enjoyable game, even though the total time it took me to finish the game was between 3-4 hours and to me that seems kind of short.

Granted that the graphics are pretty good and the gameplay is pretty fast, but there's not much to the game beyond that.Go to the next area, kill the monsters there (without the Resident Evil save-your-ammo-like-your-life-depends-on-it stratedgy which made Res Evil games so edgy), get the item, solve the obligatory puzzle, repeat. The 'horror' aspect of Resident Evil games is completely gone which makes this one a bit heavy on the cheesy and not-so-challenging side.It's also REAL short.Good graphics, not so go voice overs, not too compelling storyline (save the princess...groan!).I was disappointed, but I guess I might be in the minority."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I could give it more stars!!","review":"I just can't say enough good things about this game.

Two problems: 1-you can't skip the cinema sequences (this is a real pain when you are \\"Died\\" and have to retrace your path) and 2-I can't believe they didn't use the analog stick for primary movement control! What were the programmers thinking?! So instead of natural fluid movements around the game you get this herky, jerky walk'n into walls movement. I also found it very hard to control during battles with the tougher enemies. The last little anoyance I had was they show the main character rolling out of the way to avoid an attack during a cut sequence but when you are actually playing the game you don't get to roll. Anyhoo enough babling. The game is very fun if you like to kill, kill, kill.

This Samurai-type guy is on a quest to save a woman, which doesn't really take to long. Along the way you kill the same demons over and over, you have only one attack and one block. After you kill all the demons at one location, you're interrupted by more slow plot lines that actually take away from the rest of the game. The game is slow and transitions are sketchy, the controls leave MUCH to be desired, the plot is boring and rudely interrupts you.

Ie set the camera down and let the actor run around until he leaves the room. Then set the camera down in a new location and repeat.If you like games like Resident Evil or Fear Effect this game is for you. Also if you like solving awkward puzzles, this game is for you.

Capcom fnally under stood that the action of running, stopping and shooting sloth-like zombies was getting bland and they took the genre a step further. In Onimusha you slice and dice zombie-like swordsman, but don't be fooled, these zombies are quick with the steel. The story is generic: the princess get's kidnapped and it's your job to save her. The graphics and environment are sweet. The Medieval Japan settings look awesome with the setting sun shining on it. The whole game has an errie feel to it. Of course there is much blood shed and puzzles to solve and there is even a huge demon monster which speaks english! Overall Onimush: Warlords is a sweet PS2 game. It has the value of a Resident Evil game, but with a much faster pace. Get Onimusha, it's short and sweet and you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Onimusha","review":"Onimusha warlords is a fantastic game.

It doesn't matter one bit if this author is inventing or re-discovering using facial optical distortions in a mirror; if it works for you go for it. It is.....bizarre. Just to experiment, simply turn out your lights, light a candle to illuminate your face from below and squint into a mirror.

Some of the material that was based on fact from older manuscripts was good. Alot of the author's opinions are not in line with other teachings and I feel it can become quite confusing to those who wish to follow previously established beliefs and systems in combination with the author's beliefs. I also feel when a reader purchases a book they should be able to have all the info needed pertaining to the subject of the book. This author... omitts or vaguely describs information that can only be found in his videos and other documents, thereby forcing his readers to spend more for additional material which could have easily originally been covered in the book alone.

The Book of Solomon by Carroll Runyon is a powerful grimoire for Goetia conjurations, yet written in a warm and friendly manner. It contains much original material for Goetia conjurations, and should be in the library of the active occultist. In addition, there is also new information and material regarding the Goetia that as far as I know, is unique to this book. This also includes original Sigils that are very powerful. Included also is a remarkable conjuration tool which matches a particular Goetia being with its reflective astral being, sometimes called \\"angels\\", or better the postive and negative aspects of Magick, which is necessary for a successful Magickal Working.I wrote a review for this book several years ago, and since thenI have been using it often for studying more deeply the Goetiabeings, it works very well and has stood the test of time,at least relative to my reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST MANUAL ON GOETIC MAGICK!","review":"If you are interested in LEARNING HOW TO PERFORM goetic evocations this is the book for you.

What happened to \\"Son Of Sagittarius\\", \\"Eddie's Love\\", \\"The Thin Man\\", \\"One Tear\\" and all those other tunes that deserved to appear on a collection such as this? It's truly not fair. It's bad enough that Motown/Universal won't re-release his most popular albums. I gave it four stars because it included my favorite EJK song, \\"Girl You Need A Change of Mind\\" in its entirety and because to this day I still love the man. Motown, show Eddie's fans some respect and at least release some of his albums on CD, like PEOPLE...HOLD ON or EDDIE KENDRICKS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"did not get item very angry","review":"I ordered this cd on december 31,2002, I still did not receive itI'm very disappointed, Will some one please call me or e-mail me"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Trip Down Memory Lane","review":"I heard songs I had forgotten about, including some memorable religious ones.

I suggest espn x games snow boarding."},{"rating":"1","title":"You mean I can't put in 0 Stars","review":"Anyone thinking of buying this game, DON'T!! I can not stress that enough. everyone is telling you that this is the best game. I bet 99.99999% of these people haven't played ESPN Snowboaridng one. That one is sooooooo much better. Please I beg you don't buy this game. buy the ESPN Snowboarding one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Game","review":"I loved SSX, It is a great snowboarding game.The graphics are fast and, I find it easier to control than ESPN Winter X Games Snowboarding... However if you're looking for many different modes of play, X Games is the way to go. For the money, you should get this game..not a must have, but its fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Game Is Great!","review":"This Game is pretty good. If I could I would actually give it four and a half stars, but I can't. Anyway, this is the best snowboarding game for both psx and ps2. You are capable of doing tons of tricks from a Mute to a swith 540 iguana air backflip. There are even more combinations. To make it even more dificult you can go goofey-footed or do a late trick. Overall this is one of the best ps2 on currently on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Game Ever","review":"SSX is the best game ever. The graphics and gameplay will leave you breathless. The game is addicting. Until I bought this game, I never thought that any videogame could be this fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SSX","review":"I have owned every system and many games since Pong on Atari, yet I have never found a game as addictive as SSX. The graphics are incredible (except for a few off-course problems), the game play is incredible, the fun is non-stop. I have played with many of the characters; however, I truly found each unique and difficult to master. I am a Mac man now. The game will continue to entertain me for a long time. I have not even really played the other games I bought with the system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Game!!","review":"I am not much of a fan of snowboarding and have never played a snowboarding game in my life. Until I popped in my PS2 demo disc from Sony which had SSX on there. This game and madden 2001 is the best game on the disc and probably the best games that the PS2 has right now. Although, the demo on lets you play for 2:30 minutes, it is very fun. I replay the demo over and over again. I have not bought my copy of SSX yet, but plan to very soon thanks to the great demo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snowboarding has never been better","review":"SSX should be considered by everyone as one of the greatest achievements in video game history. It's graphics are beautiful, the control is quick and responsive, and there's tons of stuff to unlock. The two player mode is also quite good, going head to head with a friend to see who can pull off the best tricks.The only negative thing I can say about SSX is that the tracks were often poorly done. I found that Pipedream, Untracked, and Tokyo Megaplex were very weak, but overall it still doesn't hurt the game that much. Can't wait for SSX: Tricky, due out this fall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential to PS2","review":"This game is great graphically and in gameplay. The learning curve is a bit difficult, but you will be rewarded after a few training sessions. What makes this game so great is its many options which are similar to the Tony Hawke series. This is the best Snowboarding game ever! There are so many jaw-dropping tricks and camera angles that will keep you from leaving your seat. The snow is even given close attention to detail for the fact that when you carve the ice, your trail is left behind due to the movements that you make. Unlike a lot of other games out there, you will not get tired of the many choices of music the game has to offer. If you do not have this game, then you are not unlocking the greatness of the PS2."},{"rating":"2","title":"nothing compared to ssx tricky and ssx 3","review":"When I went over my friends house I played the origanal sxx and I was extremely disapointed.I own sxx tricky and sxx 3 and I expected it to be along the lines of the those games but the minute I saw the menue for where you pick your player I was really confused.Mac looks like Nate sort of Mobey didnt look anything like himself and Hiro looks like griff.When we started the races that was okay It wasnt very challenging.Plus there arnt UBER tricks. If I were you I would stick to the other games"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, must have for PS2!","review":"If you have a PS2, you must get SSX. Beautiful graphics, and smooth flowing play. Who thought snowboarding could be this cool?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Game is Awesome","review":"This game has awesome graphics, which encouraged me to purchase it. Also, Music on PS2 games is a BIGGIE, this has it, awesome sound effectes, next generation graphics and awesome tracks. (which have to be unlocked) By completing & winning in showoffs, races, and time attacks - which unlock outfits, boards, boarders, and a TON of tracksI got this game for $20 off because I collected 62 pepsi cap codes, (only 15 codes were needed for 1 coupon![1500 pts] {100 pts per cap} <- since I had 4 or 5 pts of coupons left I bought X-Squad which just came in today (Dec 27) so far, its fun, once you get past the first part... But anyway This is a Must have ps2 game! I loved it, my brother loved it, my dad loved it (who doesn't play very often, but when he does its FOREVER!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"SSX","review":"I love this game! True to life snowboard feel with great control and sound effects! Music can be annoying, but adjust the options and you can take care of that. Courses are long and graphically stunning. I only wish there were more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hours of Fun!","review":"SSX is a great game that will give you many hours of fun. The last time I owned a video game system, was the original Sega. No Nintendo nor PS1 were ever mine. I was hesitant to buy a PS2 because it honestly takes about $500 to get set up to play. Finally, I took the plunge, and SSX is the first game I have bought. It has blown me away, and I have no regrets about buying the system now. The game is immediately playable because the controls are not hyper-twitchy, you really have to make an effort to make your character wreck. Although it is easy to pick up the basic concept, there is layer upon layer available to improve your game. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best game out right now!","review":"This game is perfect in every way. The courses are huge and very pretty. You won't believe what the tracks are! They are awesome! Buy this game now, because it's gonna be hot for the Holidays!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SSX","review":"This game is the bomb! It's graphics are beautiful,the gameplay makes you want to play it for hours,the variation of characters is very cool because each of them speak an accent unique to their country,and the trick system is huge.There is also a ton of stuff to unlock.I would recommend this game to anyone who has a Playstation 2.Like I said,SSX is the bomb!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great snowboarding fun, veterans and newbies alike","review":"GRAPHICS: 9Utterly amazing courses will at some points take your breath away. Great player models too.SOUND: 10Soundtrack done by Mixmaster Mike will have you singing after you've turned the game off. Excellent board noises to back the gameplay up.GAMEPLAY: 10Anyone can pop this game in and be hooked in no time. Addictive snowboarding gameplay. Many modes and courses as well. Completing all the tricks is a game in itself.VALUE: 10With multiple characters, challenges, modes, shortcuts, you'll get about an hours worth of gameplay for every buck you spend on this gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blistered Thumbs From Playing","review":"A perfect game. The only way we could land a PS2 was to get a \\"package\\", and SSX came as part of the bundle. Now, sports games are not really our thing, and I can't imagine us going out of our way to get a snowboarding game. Holy cow would we have missed out.This game rocks right out of the chute. A lot of games take a while to get going, or it takes you a while to figure out what's going on. This one's a blast and a half when you still don't know what the heck you're doing, and it just keeps getting better and better.We haven't unlocked a quarter of the tracks and riders yet, and it's overwhelmingly huge already. You'll get jazzed when you win, jazzed when you lose, and will blister your thumbs from playing it too.It doesn't get any better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You Thank You","review":"I don't like to give things 5 stars. Why? Because it tells you I am saying something is the best and I don't like anything that uses a 5 point grading system of any kind. But this has won my respect in ways few other games have.For one, it looks great. This is one fine looking game. Although I always wonder why no one like to make large detailed crowds that cheer for you. The game is a beauty and the tracks are large and detailed.I love this game. I love it like I love my dog. Once again, you may be asking me \\"Why do you think that cough *LOSER* cough?\\". The answe is quite simple.I got my mom to play it.She took mild intrest in the game, and thanks to it's easy control scheme is now asking to play it a lot. She is becoming quite good.Now with my once \\"nerd's only\\" hobby spreading in my family like wildfire I might have a chance to get some things this holiday season.It's all because of SSXI liked the game a lot alreadyMy mom made me love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"ssx snowboard supercross!","review":"ssx,the best snowboard game around.A fantastic snowboarding game with loads of superb tricks and moves to get you loads of points.128 bit gives you a ultra fast gameplay and super cool graphics.Coming soon to Toys R us and all other stores will be an ssx 2 called ssx tricky which will be also be a great game will lota of great tracks,tricks and characters.If you have just purchased a PS2 and you are looking for great games get ssx and gran turismo 3! the game rocks and i give it 5 stars out of 5!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Game","review":"I preordered this game along with my PS2 I am not disappointed. SSX is a good game and worth buying. As previous reviews state, it is fun right out of the box and even beginers can pull off some (but far from all) of the tricks.As with most video games for PS2 the graphics are good and run smoothly and of course as with all video games for PS2 it is expensive. There are a large number of rider, board, clothing, and course selctions that will make this game playable for a long time.I rate this game a 4 and not a 5 because I think a game should only get a 5 if it is trulty awesome and a clear standout from the other games (like Gran Turismo was at it's launch).This game is not be a waste of money, do not be afraid to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"SSX... PS2 Sports game of the year","review":"There isn't much more to say that hasn't been said. This game is well worth the purchase. One of the best racing games I have ever played and I have been racing since atari/intellevision/colecovision/nintendo/sega/3DO/sony...well, you get the picture...let's just say a while. The characters are all cool with their own styles. The courses are cool with plenty of secrets and shortcuts, causing for endless replay value. Not to mention the actual replay mode. To watch the stunning graphics with the various camera angles is cool in itself and could easily consume much of your day. The graphics are some of the best I've ever witnessed. Each race is exciting till the end. Spill, pick it up and try again. Good music & sound. Fun for all that attempt it. Even my wife enjoyed it, and she hardly ever plays the games. Highly recommend this game for anyone that own the PS2!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SSX - BEST PS2 SPORTS GAME OUT THERE!","review":"This is the first game I purchased for the PS2 system and it really blew me away! Graphics are unreal with very little if any pauses. Huge tracks and many characters to choose from...even 4 or 5 hidden ones. Soo much to do in this game. You can race to earn medals or bust some moves or just freeride. I already beat the game, but I just cant seem to stop playing it over and over...it is very addicting! All in all this is the greatest game ever made for the PS2 and should be in everyones collection! I HIGHLY recommed getting it! See for yourself and I am sure you will agree with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"PS2's Killer App","review":"I love snowboarding, but there is no way I'm going to ride like a pro. I will not be able to pull off big air or insane tricks, and I'm never going to have the body of a twenty-year-old again. I can, however, play SSX til' my thumbs fall off, and I think it's as good a substitute. The controls are excellent: you'll have fun just running a course in the Freeride mode. But once you start to feel a little more daring, it's tough to beat the adrenaline rush of an actual race in SSX. The action is fast, the visuals are gorgeous, and this game is just plain fun. This is the game that will make owning a PS2 worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW says it all","review":"SSX, is awesome. The more I play it the better it is. I would recommend this as the first purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST BUY","review":"If this was the only game ever made for PS2 I would still spend the 299 for the system.

A MUST HAVE!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best Snowboard game ever","review":"Im kinda of a video game junky. My friends and I can not put down this game. It is a total blast.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I didn't play it that long and couldn't tell what the other tracks and players were like. Unluckily for me, I not one of the people that has gotten a PS2 in the MONTH thats its been out. Sony is making me very unhappy with their \\"Oh, we fell behind on the production of chips component thingymajigs\\" gag. I'm sure they are making millions of people angry and about to cry because we always just seem to miss that last PS2 at the store. At the Target store they are getting ONE per week until Christmas! But, hopefully I will be able to get one tomorrow after the Thankseating is over, and if I do I will definatly get SSX to go on the side."},{"rating":"2","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY . . .

And I haven't even gotten past the first stage yet . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most GNARLY","review":"As I said in the title of this review, this is the GNARLIEST game ever! This was the first game I got with the almighty Playstation 2. And is still my favorite. The quest for all golds never ceases to amaze. I don't even care about saving cuz going for golds every time never ceases to amaze. I would rate this higher than ZOE or anything else. The only game that may be as fun is Crazy Taxi.

They are three babes packing heat, but they have no clue how to do the job they have been assigned. Director Aaron Harvey delivers paint by numbers Tarrantino that officially clocks in at 94 minutes but seems to last twice as long. Harvey never misses an opportunity to slow the action down to a crawl and his screenplay makes no sense at all. Bruce Willis is annoyingly quirky but true awful acting honors fall to Forrest Whittaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"it was weird... i couldn't stand forest whitaker with his mexican accent, what the hell was that about ? part of the movie ? i would have been the same without his damn accent, anyway the film was wack, Bruce Willis was in it for like 20minutes only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tarantino-lite but FUN","review":"I enjoyed this Catch .44 movie but while the fun dialogue and snappy action reminded me of Tarantino a whole bunch, the great cast made me want to keep watching.Another of my favorite movies is the Big Sleep and when you come down to that story, there are holes in it you could drive a truck through, very much like this but never dull and a fun picture.The cast is great, full of several established actors and some newer ones that I expect to see more in the future.The picture looks great and has a great soundtrack,lots of old favorites. There isn't much in the way of extras on the DVD, just an audio commentary track by the Writer/Director & Editor and Spanish soundtrack.I can see myself watching this again in six months and perhaps the story will make more sense to me on the second viewing.It's worth checking out and I'm glad I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh? This was a movie?","review":"If you like blood, guts and bullets, you will like this movie.If you like acting, a plot and something that makes sense,Don't rent this movie.If you like some good music, buy the soundtrack.Does Willis get paid by the minute or the hour? He's overpaid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stuck in a Rut","review":"The overall storyline had some potential but failed due to really fragmented pieces amongst which was the scene of our three women holding up a diner which was repeated/looped so many times as the story progressed that it felt like it occupied half of the movie. The background of the girls provided almost zero insight into their characters other than they liked to argue over nothing which occupied another 25% of the movie. The final 25% was Willis, who this past decade or so is just stuck in a rut in repeating his patented, conditioned to sell but admittedly provides a great income for limited on-set time, bad-ass behavior that has gotten so old it feels like grandpa reliving his youthful fantasies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Worthless Movie","review":"How hard can it be to make a so-so movie? How hard can it be to make a really bad movie? This movie excelled at being bad. This was the absolute worst movie I have seen in quite a long time. I only watched it because it had Bruce Willis in it. Why he did he do this movie (was he blackmailed? Did he have a stroke? Did he want to do one really absolutely bad movie before he died?) I do not know. I will be cautious about any of his movies in the future. An absolute waste of viewing time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch No Country For Old Men instead","review":"For those of you that watch about any movie that comes out this movie will be just fine.If you're a little more picky about how you spend a couple hours of your night I would skip this movies. The director seems concerned with style more than substance. Either than or the director knew the cast he had to work with wasn't going to be able to deliver so he had to use other methods to keep the viewer's interest. There are multiple sections of the movie where a song is playing as you watch the character sit there or do mundane items. Probably high-art to some but it came across a way to sell the soundtrack.1 - part No Country For Old Men2 - Part Boogie Nights3 - Part Forrest Gump (the long music sections)4 - Part 70's drive in movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't spend your money on this","review":"Thank god this was one of my free netflix deliveries. I was going to rent it for 3.00 rental at the blockbuster box at the supermarket but thank god they were out so I waited for Netflix.Expect about 15 head shots of people blown away for no reason other than to shock. Who writes this stuff? Bruce Willis must be bored because the last few films he has done are a waste. He is getting at the top of my list next to Mel Gibson that I am just not going to bother any more.So if its a free rental and you got 90 minutes to WASTE go for it but don't buy this.The only good part is the range of character that Forrest W pulls through and that is the only, and I repeat only worthy part of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Implausible and overly violent; Bruce Willis looks gaunt (cancer?).

In one scene two people point their guns at each other for about one half hour as if it were a standoff. But they often look away from each other while they do it! This is unrealistic and unbelievable trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"This one is probably not worth your time. It begins with a scene of 4 girls in a country diner and escalates to a shooting scene. It's a movie that jumps around in time a bit (back and forth to a certain shoot out scene.) Everybody is a thief and a liar, trying to steal from each other and out to kill somebody. Drugs and money are also involved. Bruce Willis is some kind of crime lord and his part is really not very impressive. The only one who really does a good job in the film is Forrest Whittaker. He does an excellent job with his part in this lousy movie.There is lots of blood, murder, foul language (\\"F\\" every couple of words) and doublecross. Unless you are seriously bored,don't waste your time with this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Pulp Fiction/Death Proof wanna-be","review":"Misguided attempt to be hip is derailed by a TERRIBLE script derivative of Tarantino's Death Proof and Pulp Fiction. The theme involves a group of female assassins whose conversation is very similar to conversations in Death Proof. A better version of this theme is in the 2006 movie Smokin' Aces. Bruce Willis and Forest Whitaker are wasted talent in this small budget production. Avoid this movie; there's better out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"If you find yourself wondering why you haven't really heard of this movie before despite the rather star-studded cast, it's simply because this tedious hyper-violent, expletive-laden mess of a film that attempts to ape Tarantino yet lacks the skill, script-writing ability, or panache to pull it off, is indeed awful. I found myself not only not caring about the three heist planning girls, but actively disliking all three. Furthermore, despite being predominately placed on the cover of the DVD, Bruce Willis, indeed the sole reason I choose to watch this film in the first place, is woefully underused. Even for die hard Willis fans (pun not intended) this film is a miss"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible, dull movie","review":"This has got to be one of the worst, most stupid and dull movies I have ever seen. Three female killers are in a shoot-out in a diner. The story goes back and forth but...there is NO STORY. There is never any explanation for why they are there, how they are connected to each other, or what was supposed to happen. The appearances of Bruce Willis and Forest Whittaker are little more than cameo appearances, especially Willis. Their roles are as mysterious and meaningless as the three women's parts are. It is quite obvious both Willis and Whittaker were simply involved to pick up some easy money with no real acting involvement. Willis has done a few lousy movies like this lately, and I'm astounded he isn't worried about damaging his brand as an actor with tripe like this.Do not waste your time or money watching this film. There's a reason you never saw it advertised or shown in theaters. It is garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Movie","review":"I can't believe that Bruce Willis would play in this very bad movie and he looks like he just got out of Bed and looks drunk all the time No class at all and the story line is not their and the movie jumps around way to much and so Bruce Willis should go hide in shame to have made this awful movie But I did love the Girls the only thing good about the movie.

The art direction is outstanding, especially in the claustrophobic diner and the gas station, but also in Mel's mission-cum modern den, which perfectly reflected my confusion about this movie's attempts to straddle eras and genres. The soundtrack, which includes the Kills, the Sweet, and Johnny Preston, is just as eclectic and confused. Great music, but awkwardly cobbled together.I don't begrudge this film its influences, but, again, combining Taratino's gimmicky visuals with Kevin Smith's over-written dialogue produces an overall effect that I think might be a bit more clumsy than what was intended, and what you end up with is the cinematic equivalent of an emo-hipster whose anachronistic facial hair ruins every bit of irony he was going for with the members only jacket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creative editing, but weak plot","review":"This movie falls into the category of everything being good except the story sadly. The camerawork was great - cool angles, well framed shots, etc.; same for audio, atmospherics and even (mostly) acting. Sadly however, the story was not good at all, and borders on incoherent. As you watch this film, it feels like an exercise in who can be the most incentive member of the team, except the screenwriters, so you end up with an artificially, somewhat over the top film that lacks meaningful substance. It reminds me of Guy Ritchie - IMHO Lock Stock and Snatch are brilliant stories and very creative camerawork and editing, but his later movies had everything the same minus the stories. So it is here. Its an ok watch if you're bored, just don't expect the story to have any meaningful impact."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you can't get to sleep.......","review":"Watch this movie.

The plot made little sense until the end when it somewhat ties together. The movie may have been more flashback than anything else, making the storyline was hard to follow. The acting was okay considering the script. In my opinion, there just isn't anything good I can say about this movie. It was a weirdly composed movie of betrayal and twisted justice--lots of up close violence. I love Bruce Willis but he should have passed on this one. Amazon Vine does not allow us to pass on our Vine items for review which is actually a blessing in this case.

It's a Malin Akerman movie MARKETED as a Willis/Whitaker movie.And even that would be fine if this movie was any good. But it's not. Weak dialogue, bland characters, and a throwaway storyline that's trying to be all tough-guy/Tarantino-ish in the same way 5th-grade schoolboys try to be tough when they're bullying the 1st-graders. Bullets fly artfully, people cuss poorly, the camera slow-mos at properly \\"dramatic\\" moments.... <yawn>I've seen Akerman in a couple other movies, most notably \\"Watchman,\\" and I'm sure she was excited for the chance to take a leading role in a beat-'em-up action flick, but this thing is just a boring mess.

I must admit that I had an extremely hard time staying awake. No action movie should put you to sleep. It is so bad that you loose interest in it very fast. This movie reminds me of Pulp Fiction in a way, but it seems more like a parody. It has none of the memorable moments and good acting. I was shocked to see Bruce Willis and Forest Whitaker both bomb in the same movie. I fully expected them to take control of their characters and make it good or at least okay.

I've always found her tales nostalgic and innocent but always on the right side of sentiment-not overdone. Here the sugar turns saccharine. The Story Girl, with her improbable nickname, mouths such unlikely gems as, \\"Where are you, children?\\" when trying to find her best friends. I highly doubt evev children of the time referred to each other as \\"children.\\" Dialogue is stilted and weird.

A few months later I read The Golden Road, which for some reason is more widely available. I cried at the end of that book. Aboout a year after I first saw the book I finally bought it.

On either end of the muffler, right inside the inlets, there is a short perforated section, maybe 4\\" long or so. These sections are surrounded by fiberglass packing.Beyond this, however, in the center of the muffler, it just opens up into a very large, open chamber with nothing in it.Whether this open area is supposed to act as a resonator of some sort, I really don't know. What I do know is that this muffler does very little muffling.So, if you're looking for a loud muffler, this will do the trick.

I agree with other reviewers in that its at about 90% of what PC gaming is like. This is good enough for me. The only complaint I have about it is the cord. Its only about 10 feet long, which is okay for a bedroom gamer, but for my large living room, this severly limits where i can sit. This is minor overall, and this controller is awsome.

You've destroyed this country and now you're joining the tea party to completely demolish it. I hope reason, and sanity prevail, but I'm not really certain myself.

We are very pleased with the quality of the pictures and the ease of use of this camera. This camera is easy to load with film, has an excellent zoom, and works great even in difficult lighting. The only complaint we have is that with the 'red eye reduction' on, it slows the picture taking process as the flash fires, so you can't take quick snapshots with that feature in use. I think most cameras have this problem, so if you are taking pictures of fast little kids doing something cute, don't plan on using red eye reduction, just get yourself one of those special 'red eye' pens at the photo counter."},{"rating":"1","title":"adequate","review":"The Minolta we previously had produced better pictures without having to worry about settings.

However, after looking at the prints from several of my kids school concerts, I was very disappointed in the camera. While using 400 speed film, and a full zoom lens, the photos came out very dark. The pictures were taken in a school gym during daylight hours with plenty of light. I never had any problems like this with my old, 80mm Fuji camera.

I wanted to use these because with the carbide construction you don't need to use case lube. With all that I did have to return these. The reason is that I bought a Hornady LNL AP press, and what I didn't know is that the lee dies are a bit short to be used with this press. I have found videos that say yes they work, but I set it up and the dies were hanging on by a thread so I didn't feel comfortable sticking with them. I returned them and the return was smooth and fast as any returns I've had with Amazon. I went with the Hornady dies and of course they worked just fine. So as long as you know the lee dies work with your press I would recommend them to anyone, buy with confidence."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for any hardcore country fan","review":"This boxed set of \\"The Complete Hank Williams\\" is one of the best ever put out.

The sound quality is superior, the accomanying books are out of this world, and the music itself speaks so purely and simply for itself. Hank Williams was an enormously popular entertainer in his time. There is a veritable cornucopia of modern artists who owe, and have expressed, a huge debt to Hank's music as being resposible for their own relevence to popular music. There will never, and can never, be another Hank Williams. I suggest that one experience the real deal here."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Complete Hank Williams CD Set","review":"Great CD set including songs that previously were unpublished.

Maybe if your in a hurry and just open the book fast and shove the cd in that way, that'd ruin it. This guy wrote some of the greatest songs ever, and this collection is like a bible. As too all you anal collectors who complain about songs that arent in this collection, you have to remember the quailty of some songs have no stood the test of time, so they had to leave them out.

Sure, one is a little longer than the other, or it's oval is a little sharper, but there really isn't much of a difference.3. The graphics are horrendous; it looks like this game could work on a regular playstation.4. All the cars are the same, except for little differences in looks. There are only 3 different car types: loose (great speed, no handling), Neutral (average speed and handling), and tight (no speed and great handling). These do not change from car to car.The only good thing about the game is the drafting system: you actually use your opponents draft to gain speed and pass them.Do not buy this game. It is a complete waste of both time and money"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was EA thinking???","review":"I just bought this game. I'd seen the demo for it, and thought it would be great especially after owning SSX and Maden 2001, which was also released by EA.

The graphic are good, but that is standard with the PS2 console. So that don't count. The reduction of tracks in the 2001 version is the biggest down fall of this game. No interactive pit stops. The Nascar 2001 PS1 version is a better game than the PS2, and I play that one on the PS2."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E","review":"I would definitely recommend to anyone even THINKING about buying this game to rent it first. I am a big fan of EA sports games, but this one is particularly disappointing. The graphics are mediocre at best and the gameplay couldn't be more boring. The commentary quickly gets on your nerves, and the display gets choppy and digitized when alot of action is going on, especially when viewing the rear view mirror during a race. I think it could be a good game with some more work, so I hope EA takes this to heart for the 2002 version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same of this, less of that!","review":"I found that this is the same game as for the PS1, with a little better graphics than the first.

When I first took a practice lap around the track, it was amazing. The graphics looked great. However, once you start racing with other cars, the graphics seem to slow down, and go down in resolution.Seems like this one was rushed out. Lot's of features from previous versions are missing... ie. fine adjustment of your race car, custom instant replay with controls and camera angles, etc.A total of 12 tracks are included.

The only problem I had was with the DVD of Ladyhawk, instead of going straight to the DVD menu, it plays the movie automatically. I can't even go to the menu afterward....weird... But all other dvd's I tried work great. I also use it as a regular CD player, but I wish it had some sort of screen saver that would turn on during long plays (but since I use a lcd tv, I'm not really worried).

When I actualy read it, I was very sorry that I even wasted my time trying to track this book down. First of all, He spends too much time talking about his childhood, that simply has no meaning. It is also some confusing parts about his exit of the Black Panthers. In his comrade Elaine Brown's \\"Taste of Power\\", Brown states that Bobby Seale was kicked out of the Black Panther Party, but Bobby Seale ends the book, that he left instead of being thrown out.

This book reads well, but is not referenced in a manner that will be useful to readers who prefer documentation (and yes, there are publishers who allow it!). For the general reader, who isn't interested in such distinctions, it may be a good read, but absent any analysis of Mueller, his career, or recent findings, the book fails to hit its intended mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste your money","review":"Prior to reading this book, I had read the excellent three volume set \\"Gestapo Chief\\" by Gregory Douglas. I bought this book, hoping to get additional information on Heinrich Muller. Unfortunately, this book was apparently written to discredit Douglas' 3 books. The book's cover is even identical to Volume 1 of Gregory Douglas' books. This book is essentially a rehash of previous books on the SS and Gestapo, ... and much unsupported conjecture about the career and subsequent disappearence of Muller. ... If you want to know the truth about Heinrich Muller, read Gregory Douglas' 3 books. Together, they are the standard work on the Gestapo Chief against which all other books on the subject must be judged."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Heinrich Muller.","review":"I enjoyed two of Whiting's previous books, but this one was hard to follow. One of the previous reviewers stated this work was rambling. I have to agree. The flow in this book from chapter to chapter was terrible. The author would review one section about the Red Orchestra, then in the next chapter review some aspect of Roehm, Boring, Nebe's life. One had a hard time with what the author was trying to prove. Intermingled in this writing was slugs of information about Gestapo Muller. It almost appeared that the author had a hard time finding enough material about Muller, so anything related to him was thrown into the book.This could have been a good book if the author had focused on the subject. Rather he threw everything in, including the kitchen sink. I did learn something about Gestapo Muller, so that is why I rated this two stars.

All the \\"Road-Eyes\\" and giant representation of stage gear is rediculous, and Young actually seems really serious about all of it.So, in conclusion, this is a great collection of songs and has great performances.

The electric set becomes even more surreal as a pinhead and mad scientist in white lab coat join in with the woodstock soundtrack blaring behind them.

BIG MISTAKE! I took it home and popped it into playstation2 and hoped for a great game instead i got 5 minutes of beating the game.

The first time I put it in I beat it then tried it on the hard level and same thing again, won with out a loss...ok with another player but the computer is a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Good As It Could Be","review":"This game gives me mixed emotions. I am a huge fan of Street Fighter games, and I want to like it, but when playing it you just can't seem to connect to the 3D characters. They look cold and lifeless, like mannequins or dolls.The graphics are not very good and there is frequent slowdown. More than that, the artwork itself is not impressive. It is also very disorienting to play a fast moving fighting game in 3D, and this game in particular makes a friend of mine nauseated the camera angles are so awkward.One minor annoyance, when you beat the game you are set up into a little 'mini-game' and have to knock down as many people as you can. This can be fun but it ruined because of the horrible sound effects this game has.My final verdict is that this would be worth buying, but not at [this price]. Wait for the bargain bin, in the meantime enjoy Marvel vs Capcom 2 on Dreamcast, which is an infinitely better game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Street Fighter Done Bad","review":"Street Fighter, always one of my favorite fighting games, and one of the few 2d fighters left, and that was ok because it was Street Fighter! But for some sick reason they decided to move it from lovingly done cartoonish 2d fighters to sub-tekken 3d. Why??? If you want a 3d fighter, get Tekken Tag. If you want 2d beauty like good-old Street Fighters of the past, sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it","review":"I don't know about the rest of you but I'm just never impressed with the Street Fighter series when it becomes a 3D game. The graphics look terrible. It looks like a 3 year old drew up stick figures and smeered poo on them and said, \\"look Mommy, it's Blanca!\\"Really please, you can't tell me that you're impressed with the same predictable and boring fights with this game? Honestly, Street Fighter was a game that should have never gone 3D because it just doesn't work for the game because even so, you don't even have that because all you do is go back and forth. You can't get stuck in a corner but you also can't side step like Tekken.If PS2 really wanted to impress people, releasing Street Fighter Alpha 3 would have been the smarter move. I have to say, I'm really hoping that another one of these is not in the making."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm disgusted with Sf.blah","review":"All I can say is this game is a joke.The graphics are cheap and the gameplay is rediculous.Definately shouldn't be marketted toward serious gamers who enjoy fighting games as I do.I liked Street fighter 2 I believe on the Snes.That was pretty damn cool..This one is a pittance compared to the old version. ....Seriously,it is a horrible fighting game."},{"rating":"1","title":"This series is getting old","review":"All of the Street Fighter EX games (the ones in 3D) have been pretty bad. This one is no different. While it easily has the best graphics in the series, it should still look better for a 128-bit game. Capcom should have tweaked the controls, but it's obvious they rushed this one. Try Tekken Tag Tournament."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is only good when friends are around. PERIOD.","review":"Listen, anyone who can play Street Fighter halfway decently can finish this game in under an hour. I rented it one day and finished it in 15 minutes. Not only was it over in 15 mins, but it had the WORST ending i've EVER seen. And no, it wasn't on an easy difficulty, it was on the hardest setting! I'm not that great but this game was 0 competition.The ONLY thing GOOD about this game is fighting with a buddy. Chun Li is my favorite cause she's just psycho in here. This is the game's ONLY saving grace. If not for this it would have gotten 1 star.So if you will never have to play this alone, go ahead and get it... USED. For solo play, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh My God","review":"This game is terrible. The graphics look like a rgular playstation game.

It is absolutely imperative that this game be played with at least one pther player if you want to get past the more diffcult challenges on each level, plus it is a lot of fun to see what your character can do, or your friends' can do, after more time playing, experience, and new skills.

I own the game, I bought it because I heard good reviews about it. When I started playing it I was 'STUPIFIED'! The game has SNES graphics combined with a very thin and simply put, stupied plot. Enemys simply walk up to you and you punch them, then they die. The game is easy and predictable! Please don't buy this game like I did. I only gave it 1 star because I heard the multi-player was really fun, but I'm sure it's exacly like the single player. Don't play it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Multi player game","review":"This has to be one of the best strategy type multi player games that I have every played.

I would not recomend this game for a single player multi player is way better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be fun","review":"While at first I was very excited about the possibility of multi-player gaming, it soon became apparent that the game was not challenging at all. I am not near becoming any real good on any games, as I am completely bad at all games except Jeopardy. However, if this game turns to be way too easy even for me, then I believe it will be extremely boring for most kids. Cute game to play with your spouse, and kill time once in a while. But half way through it, it just got very boring and we stopped playing altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY BORING!!!","review":"I got this game yesterday, and it is the stupiedest game for the PS2 I've seen so far. With SNES graphics and a super thin storyline, this game presents no challenge whatsoever and the enemys you fight just run toward you until you punch them, then they die. Single game playing really sucks! I gave it 2 stars because I heard the multi-player was fun. Don't buy or rent this game! Wait for some good games to come out for the PS2, stick with regular PS games for now. I do reccommend 'Onimusha' because the only good game out so far for the PS2. Stick to my word, Gauntlet Is Boring!!! Save your money for something good, which I didn't do because I bought it. If you like multi-player games, then rent it.

My favorite character is the knight. The minotaur is the best I have used so far. He has good speed, remarkable strength, sort of good defense, but bad magic! The blue knight is my favorite knight. Ithink the green Knight is pretty cool to. The yellow knight looks like an egyptian. But the red looks kind of ugly to me, because he looks like a viking with an extra-large beard and it also looks like the beard is so thick that it could knock out Lich until he was defeated!

And since midway went bankrupt its nearly impossible that theres gonna be another gauntlet game. Out of all the ones i've played. This is the one to get! If your trying to get your hands on gauntlet legends forget that and get this. Cuz all this is.. is Gauntlet legends with 8 new characters. Dwarf, Knight, Sorceress, and Jester. Along with their upgraded classes. It also features 5 NEW WORLDS!!! Thats a big jump isnt it!? And its got Gauntlet legends primary characters as well as the upgraded classes. If you've played gauntlet legends too much but havent even played this? Get ready for the next level! And if you have a multitap and friends to play with. Then your in for some fun!!! I wouldnt consider it to be a dungeon crawler like balders gate and champions. But its got its own unique twist that other games dont have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gauntlet","review":"I very much enjoyed this game. I used to play on the GameCube but when I moved I gave the game and system to my grandchildren. So I bought the PS2 version after moving.

It isn't super difficult to beat the boss monsters so it is more enjoyable.I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Game, moves well","review":"Guantlet, Dark Legacy is colorful and character operation is easy. There is a lot of fighting in real time, with nasty monsters throughout the game. A wide variety of spells may be used by sorceress', executed with ease by assigned buttons. Slashing in the case of ... knights depending on your choice of characters. There area wide variety to choose from. I chose the yellow Sorceress. A dynamite character with tons of power and the Blue Knight the second time through (not so strong but cute)The graphics in this game were fantastic. Locations are huge and varied. The main bosses for each world are challenging but not impossible.If I were to improve this very nice game I would add some movement abilities for the characters. Maybe jumping and climbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now this is a game","review":"Gotta love remakes. Graphics are sweet, gameplay is good.

Do yourself a favor and avoid this pos."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"First of all this game has some of the worst graphics on the PS2. I often found myself shooting my own partner in multi play because all the creatures look the same. Also, the levels are best described as flat, boring, and linear, with absolutely no challenge. The player characters and enemies are all the same with about two basic attacks each(actually the special attacks are kinda cool). Oh and the characters you can unlock through completing bonus levels are basically clones of other characters with different color clothes. Another thing that really bugged me about this game were the bosses. Usually in an RPG the bosses are imaginative, unique and challenging. But in Gauntlet if you happen to find a super \\"holy\\" item you instantly kill the boss. Where's the fun in that? If you really think you'll like this game please rent it first!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy, Weak, Worthless","review":"Buyin this is out. Rent it and wish you hadn't.

His works are, as one might expect, classic Russian. However, he has penned a couple of pieces I like very much, and one of them is from his opera, \\"Prince Igor,\\" specifically the Polovtsian Dances. It is a very lyrical piece of music, and the choral work is very well done. Those who like popular music will recognize this piece as the source-work for \\"Stranger in Paradise.\\" The disk is very well done and I really should give it five stars, except that I'm not that \\"into\\" this genre of music.

The same can be said about Chris Cunningham. When two such people meet, the results are not always what you would expect, but in this case, I have to admit the results are superb. This video and it music are so beautifully weird that it is almost as if they are alien. Chris and Richard, and others like the Boards of Canada and Autechre, are finding and exploring strange and fascinating new worlds for us, which we can briefly glimpse through their art. I feel privileged to live in a time when such art is being produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh My! Tell me I haven't been slipped anything!","review":"Well, to put it bluntly, if you miss buying this, you miss out on one of the most twisted and satiracal 'music videos' of all time. No, you will never catch this video on MTV. This video, like \\"Come To Daddy\\", blends the madness/genius of Richard D James with frightening digital effects to produce a short film that made me search through my food for hallucinagens.

I also get tired of mamby pamby, touchy feely management books. Therefore, you can imagine what I thought of this book from the title.Upon reading this book, you find that it is not the fact that it is revolutionary, but that it points out the logic that was already there. It was simple to apply. We are using it where I work and the book helps in many ways. As the product quantity or type changes, all the production facilities are on wheels and we just move the work areas into different small sub-plants. There is no wasted resource and we even recovered some free space. Our parent company cannot keep up with us, as they are compartmentalized and static.

I found this book to very accurate in terms of the historical content and the intrigue that surrounded Elizabeth I. I also found it to be great read as well.I liked that the author chose to tell the story in the first person as it makes Elizabeth feel real and that her life was not a easy one, even if she was destined for the throne.

Elizabeth's big sister, Mary, is second in line for the throne, Elizabeth is third! Her brother has died of the flu and now Elizabeth is in jail waiting for her dear sister to let her out.If I could give this book a trophy, I wouldn't.

I was already very interested in the Tudor history, although I was more intested in Elizabeth and Mary. I really enjoyed finding things I knew and being able too relate them.

Soon Queen MAry comes to throne, but England didn't know what kind of person MAry was.England was now stricken with a famine and a treacherous Queen,Bloody Mary.Elizabeth was confused, first Mary was her friend, than MArywas putting her in horrible predicaments, Elizabeth didn't understand.Then oneday she... well you figure out what happens, or you could just buy this WONDERFUL book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Riveting Historical Fiction","review":"Carolyn Meyer paints a wonderful picture of what Elizabeth's teenage years must have been like. This narrative, a historical fiction, tells of Elizabeth Tudor's years after her brother Edward's death and into her elder half-sister's reign. The rebellions and suspicions cast upon Elizabeth put her life in terrible danger, sending her to the tower where her mother was executed years earlier. It's a great book, especially for those of you guys and gals that lovedElizabeth I: Red Rose of the House of Tudor, England, 1544 (The Royal Diaries), this one is more geared towards the young adult market with its language and content. However, this novel doesn't focus on Elizabeth's romantic escapades like some novels do, just her struggle to maintain her faith and her life under her sister's ever watchful gaze. It is a great book, and I highly recommend it. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it","review":"I read this book in two days - I couldn't put it down. It was entertaining from start to finish.

This book delivered."},{"rating":"1","title":"over-milking the suspense","review":"It started out good. But the ending drags exceptionally too long, and even worse, in a predictable way.At the ending, Follett milked the suspense too much that the only thing coming out was a bland liquid. I listened to the Books on tape, and had to fast forward since disk 9 (of 11). From disk 9 on, it was like riding a roller-coaster that keeps rolling around the same loop 100 times too many: the villain arose fromdeath, gun was out of ammo; no mobile phone to find, but when one was found, it had no battery ...The story pace became stalled , despite all the actions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting Reading","review":"It has been a while since I have read a book that I absolutely could not put down.

Here we have a germ-heist gone badly. The criminals are trying to steal a new strain of germs - presumably to terrorists - from one of the most secure research facilities on earth. Toni Gallo is the head of security of the instillation and also happens to be in love with her boss. So her job, her love and her life are now all in jeopardy now that the security has been breached.Follett intertwines the story in a very clever way that has all interested parties meeting up at the same estate to get shelter from the blizzard. Children, extended family, employees, in-laws, and psychopaths are all forced to spend Christmas together - with vials of a killer germ on the kitchen table... The tension grows almost as fast as the snow piling up outside, and keeps building until something snaps.This isn't Follett's best work, but is an enjoyable tale, and worth reading on a snowy weekend.Relic113"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Gets By","review":"This was an OK read, which is unfortunate for a writer such as Ken Follet whom we hold to such a high standard simply because of his evident talent which cannot be questioned. A little more heavy on the description compared to his past works which rely more on plot twists. The setting was nice, very ominous for sure, but the latter plot fell a little short of expectations created in the first half of the book. Maybe not as heart pounding as say Chetan Dave's Datoga Island or Michael Crichton's State of Fear but it's still worth reading once."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Ken Follettt?","review":"After reading this book, I may say that the author suffered from a 'whiteout' while writing it. It is quite boring: suffers from the lack of action and poor psychological portraits of the characters.

But I felt I had to warn readers about this poor excuse for a book.Mr. Follett was obviously under some kind of deadline, or short of cash, to put out this totally lame effort. I had saved it for a fun, fast read after slogging through some Henry James this summer, and was totally disappointed in both the writing and the plot.

Fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If it were anyone else, 3 stars","review":"I have to agree with most of the bad reviews for this book. It didn't have the flow one would expect from Follett, and the climax was okay, at best. If this book was from most any other author, I probably would have given it 3 stars, but after reading Jackdaws, Hornet Flight, Code to Zero, and a few others, this just didn't compare.Truth be told, it was probably a good book, just not by Ken Follett standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wrote this dreadful book?","review":"This book was written by some writing student, not possibly by Follett.

I'm not sure why such a talented writer as Follett would put out such junk food..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted pages","review":"This is my first Ken Follett novel. And my primary problem with this book is that I feel entirely to much time and pages were wasted on the \\"family\\". Halfway through the book and I'm still waiting for the crime to be committed. I have 2 more of his books that I purchased, and if they're anything like this one, I won't buy any more, even at $.01."},{"rating":"1","title":"Literature cliché after cliché","review":"I have read Follett in the past with much satisfaction, particularly \\"Pillars of the Earth\\". However, Whiteout made my jaw drop by how truly bad his writing has seemingly become. Its not that his prose is particularly bad, its just that he uses cliché after cliché to formulate Whiteout's story. Some reviewers have pointed out plot holes, but I was irked by simple things dealing with character interactions that seemed way to \\"convenient\\". I could go through the text and pull out some examples, but I have already wasted too much of my life by reading it the first time. I like Pillars enough to still potentially read more Follett in the future, but this particular book was flat out laughable.

I would expect 2-dimensional characters in a genre thriller, but Follett has managed to populate this book with 1-dimensional characters or worse. To top it off, there is no \\"thrill\\" in this thriller - most of the book is unneccesary detail and it truly never gets to the frightening prospect of bio-terrorism. This is simply a heist novel, and not a very good one at that. The plot is miniscule and he fills page upon page with boring, irrelevant description. There are no unexpected events to provide a thrill - I could have told you the ending after reading the first 20 pages. In short, as a thriller this book is a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"a major dissappointment","review":"I have read all of Follett's novels - and was ready to lose myself in his newest book; I was incredibly dissappointed in the predictable and banal plot, the \\"high school-ish\\" style of writing, the total lack of character development (although the characters were so shallow and silly that perhaps there is no need for any development), that for the first time with a Follett novel, I did not finish it. Also, could someone explain to me the necessity of the scene with the condoms at the end of the book??!!Igor Dumbadze"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid Like the Plague","review":"The first two-thirds are efficient and fast-paced. But the last 130 pages... unbelievable, and unbelievably tedious.Without compuction, four criminals steal a virus that will kill millions. They decide to do so despite a sudden increase in lab security, and despite knowing that their escape will be complicated by a blizzard. They can't bring themselves to shoot guards who learn their names, plans, and descriptions. They take a family hostage and give them more than enough information to ensure failure, capture, and conviction.Thank goodness the police are stupider than humanly possible.Follett goes to preposterous lengths to avoid shooting anybody. His villains threaten and brandish guns on every page - and then they punch and kick their victims. Over and over and over again. A hundred pages from the end, I found myself thinking, 'No criminal would ever act like that.' But they do, endlessly.By the time Whiteout is over, I regretted the complete waste of my time. Be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped","review":"A wildly positive description led me to buy this, hoping to be captivated. Two hundred pages later, it started to take off. The unique aspects of the story, the biohazard and deadly aspects of the virus, have been seen elsewhere--from THE HOT ZONE, on. The plot is clunky as the author corrals innocents and villains into a house in a blizzard. We are told that one can spy on the action in the kitchen, from above--CLUNK! We are told individually about each cell phone in the house and why the innocents can't use them--CLUNK! CLUNK! The family members have such little characterization, it's difficult to keep track of them. A description of sex play is tacked on at the end and out of place with the book's tone. The writing is quite pedestrian, as if Follett were just lending his name to the thing. I'll look for recommendations of the better Folletts--like Eye of the Needle, and Key to Rebecca."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Follett","review":"Very typical sound book from a solid author there just aren't any surprises. The book like Jackdaws and Flight of the Hornet is totally predictable but unlike those two previous books he teaches us nothing new. Hot Zone is more informative on bio-safety issues.Pillars of the Earth was his last great effort. These new books seem to have a formula spelled out early in the book, characters developed while the plot lingers, then the formula executed to a prictable end.A once great mystery writer and someone who wrote a great historical piece just mails in another tome and we buy it hoping for the old Ken"},{"rating":"2","title":"Whiteout Was A Winner .... My First Follett Book To Read","review":"WOW!If all of Mr. Follett's books are this good, I'll buy the bookstore out! A friend of mine reads his novels and I have given her several.

I finished it today and can't wait to get another book by him to read.You will enjoy this story that is fast paced and easy to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Follett's Best","review":"It's just ok. It's no \\"Key to Rebecca\\", that's for sure.The main character, Toni, came off to me as the most insecure Security Director of all time, frequently second-guessing herself and struggling with her competence and inner feelings. That came off as a bit pathetic to me. An interesting character in Daisy though.The romance aspect felt sappy and quite \\"token\\". I felt this to be completely predictable and probably unnecessary. I even found myself literally rolling my eyes at these laughable portions of the story.The tempo strikes a remarkable change about halfway through, once the heist kicks in. Page-turning, thankfully, gets much easier at that point.All in all, an average (at best) bedtime book, but I was let down, and feel that it didn't come close Follett's true potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book","review":"Most of Ken Follet's books are worth reading, and this is one of them. You might feel as bogged down in the snow as the characters are, as you trudge through who's chasing whom in the middle of a blizzard. Overall, you remain interested enough in the characters to keep going. Some surprising twists and suspense at the end make it worth it. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING--Follett's worst","review":"I have never written a review before but this novel was SO bad, it prompted me to warn others against it. I agree with the writer who questioned whether Follett had gone senile. I am questioning my own sanity for trying to finish it.I was brought up to finish what you start, especially books--so I persevere but will not admit to my 2 children who are English teachers that I'm going to finish such a gabork. Who knows, it may redeem itself in the last 100 pages--(but I doubt it).I thought Pillars of the Earth was a great book. Eye of the Needle--a remarkable thriller. I've always looked forward to his latest but this is such a waste of time, I read it to fall asleep.Grandmanan"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Follett worthwhile","review":"I must admit I do not believe there is a Follett book I have not read. This is one I would rate in the better quartile of his works as to plot and plot resolution. This is an enjoyable read and worth the investment of time and money. Follett spins a another good story here..at times you will convince yourself to just read the next chapter and soon discover that was five chapters back. This is a good book to spend some time with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the editing?","review":"I was surprised to see a novel by an experienced pro that had such terrible stretches of writing in it. Would not have finished if it hadn't been a club selection. Got better nearer the end, where the action picks up.So where was the editor? Is Follett so big that they can't tell him when something is clunky and amateurish? Awkward info dumps, cardboard characters, and too much that is thrown in to see what sticks. Way too many superfluous beatings, errors, and convenient plot devices. And in this part of Scotland, apparently most of the populace drives expensive luxury cars. Um...Yes, there are good things, but they are overshadowed by the things that aren't. If professional publishers and writers are going to put out something so much in need of editing that it says they don't care, it shows what contempt they hold readers in. \\"Aw, they'll buy it anyway, because it's a Follett!\\"News flash-- we expect better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"whiteoutblah","review":"I am a Ken Follet fan who was really disappointed by the book \\"Whiteout\\". After such works as \\"Pillars of the Earth\\", \\"World Without End\\" \\"A Gathering of Eagles\\" and many, many other books of his - this one was a crashing bore. It is almost as though Mr. Follet used a hack ghost writer and signed his name to it for money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was really disappointed by this book.It was recommended to me by a friend, and I was told that it is so gripping that once I would start reading it I would not be able to let it down. It took me almost 6 days to finish reading it, and I wanted to give up more than once. The story is very typical: A gang steals a lethal virus from a lab to sell to a terrorist group, and at the end they get caught, and the virus is never released into the air. Nothing thrilling about this plot. There are no twists or surprises. Too much time is spent describing, in my opinion, shallow characters. When action is taking place and the reader feels immersed in the novel, the author manages to interrupt the thrill by long dialogue between the characters and the description of their shallow personalities. I only kept reading because I was waiting for a twist, which never came."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fast paced story that grips you from the start","review":"Ken Follett writes a tale that includes, first love, a deadly virus, family relationships, and a complex security system, but one that seems to pull everything together seamlessly.While the story might be predictable, it is fast paced and enjoyable. The characters are well written and throughout the first 1/3 of the novel you are learning about each.As always Follett creates a wonderful environment, this time covered in snow, which adds to the story and plot.Not too technical but enough to convince you that this theft could happen if the right circumstances came together. I read this book in one day because I could not put it down.Great read and highly recommended!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"Its been said that every story has been told at least once. Ken Follett has mastered the art of telling the same story over and over again... seventeen times, in fact.In Whiteout, Follett tries to cover a little-explored genre of the adventure/ suspense novel: bioterrorism (I'm being sarcastic). Whiteout covers a period of two days- Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. The protagonists of the story are shallow, and the antagonists are badly put together and seem to have no motive for what they do- apart from the fact that they seem to like bloody, gory murder and revenge of the most jeuvenile kind.Follett reuses the same plot that other writers have in the past. There is nothing new, exciting or suspenseful in this book. In short, this is a book which should be left on the shelf. If you really insist upon reading it, check it out of the library- don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"Very boring and simple.

Just as the main character is about to ....Thanks Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Follett has Lost it","review":"Do not read any of Follett's books after Night Over Water. Third Twin was terrible and Whiteout is worse. I have been a loyal fan since Eye of Needle but I won't be reading any new Follett. Trust me. If you are going to buy this book based upon your enjoyment of Follett's previous work you will be disappointed. Unless of course you enjoyed Third Twin in which case knock yourself out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael Nails","review":"Mr. Follett has a great idea, but the reasons for the villain's actions were the weakest aspect of the story. The idea of using Biohazard material as the central theme was grabing at straws. Follett never gets into the real thiller aspect of this theme. The policeman in charge should have been sent to \\"how to\\" school, because he was the lamest cop I have ever read. A real throw back to the dark ages. The lead--protagonist--was the best part and she is a credit the book. However, there should have been more one on one with her and her future husband. All in all a fair book, but nothing the savor the night through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Improbable twists and turns","review":"I am definitely a Ken Follett fan, but this novel must have been written in haste without the usual Follett craftsmanship. The many improbable twists and turns, instead of creating a feeling of suspense, leave one feeling rather manipulated by the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whiteout","review":"Ken Follet's characters were poorly developed.

The entire premise for the theft of the Madoba-2 virus is just naive at best. Follett may have visited some bio-tech firms for his research for White Out but he sure didn't do any research on basic security. What kind of high-tech company that handles a killer virus would not change access pass codes when an employee is fired. That's just stupid. There is also a ridiculous amount of filler and fluff in this book that had little to do with the actual story. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Ken Follett we knew and liked ?","review":"This is a really disappointing work of Ken Follett. It is hard to believe that this is the same author who gave us \\"The Eye of the Needle\\" and \\"The Key to Rebecca\\".The story is mindless and although fast, it is not interesting.

I was immediately disappointed but kept reading, hoping that the book would get better.The book lacks the depth and substance of Follett's previous books. It is one step above a trashy romance novel.

However, 'Whiteout' confirmed my suspicion that once you have read one K.Follett you have read them all: too many coincidences, characters that are 'good' or 'bad' as of page one and a story where you can assume how it will end as soon as you completed the first few chapters. 'Whiteout' bears very few suprises and that I was able to predict in what situations K.Follett brings in his famous erotic twists is not really a good sign...I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst novel by Follett ever!","review":"Ken Follett is one of my all time favorite authors.

Whiteout's plot is full of holes, the dialog is amateurish, the characters are contrived. This book didn't exactly put me too sleep ~~ though the event about which the story is based took nearly 200 pages to occur. I just kept marveling at how really awful it was and wondering if it could possibly get worse. It did, at the end when a silly sex scene was tacked on ~~ almost as if, \\"Oops, I almost forgot!\\". Follett found a new niche when he wrote Pillars of the Earth. I'd love to see him use his talents to produce something of that quality and genre again. He's certainly given this one all he has to give."},{"rating":"2","title":"Follett keeps you turning the pages","review":"With White Out, Follett pulls together the ingredients for a great story. Set in the present day, Follett spins a tale focused on a multi-generational, dysfunctional family together in a remote Scottish estate for the Christmas holiday. The patriarch of the family is a brilliant scientist who created and runs a nearby medical research laboratory. As the story unfolds, the reader is introduced to a group of nefarious individuals intent on launching a biological terrorist attack in London. Character development is strong. Human frailties are exposed. A series of sub-plots run throughout, adding depth to the main storyline. Although the story starts a little bit slow, White Out becomes an impressive, fast-paced tale, full of intrigue, twists, and turns that are classic Follett. Once you start reading, it will be difficult to stop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Effort","review":"Pedestrian and uninspiring. A pot boiler that misses the mark.

First off, I'm a huge Follet fan, with Pillars of the Earth and Eye of the Needle as two of my all time favorites. Not sure what happened with this one, though. Everything seemed out of place and not well thought out, i.e. dialogue, setting, characters, etc. I never cared for the characters or what would happen to them. I should have stopped reading this one long before the end, but I stuck it out thinking it would get better (it didn't). If this is your first Follet, please don't judge him by this book.

The description in the back of the book is promising although all too common in many of the books today. A deadly virus gone amuck. Who has not written about that?

I know this game hasn't come out yet, but it HAS come out in japan(why would they have an american football game in japan? dont ask me!). I played my friend's imported version of the game and it was great! First of all, the graphics were amazing. No I'm not just talking about the cutscenes, the entire game's video quality was good. Plus the PS2 port's controls were a lot easier to use than Nintendo 64's football videogames (i.e. NFL Blitz, Madden 64). This would be a great first game for your Playstation 2 collection. Just remeber to get an extra controller."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best","review":"This is the best football game out right now. Yes even better than sega's NFL 2K1. EA sports has payed attention to every detail this time around. The graphics and controls are top notch. The players have facial expressions and grass even gets caught in thier facemasks. There are even the actuall coaches who react to the plays on the field. The instant replays are just jaw dropping. A great addition I thought was the Madden Cards which you can use to unlock some retired football greats like John Elway and Barry Sanders. My only question is how EA will top this next year?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Game Freezes when trying to play a game!!!!","review":"I purchased this game on May 15, 2001 and I could not play a game. After contacting Sony Support they said a lot of people are having this problem if they have a PS2 from the after Christmas production but a Madden 2001 from before Christmas. You can send your PS2 back to Sony for service, no idea if it is free or not. My choice is to not buy this game and wait for Madden 2002 due out in the fall. Shame on Sony and EASports for having no warning about this on either of their websites. This glitch only affects the Madden 2001 game since it was designed based on a prototype to be one of the first 5 games released. Other than that the PS2 is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Close To Perfect You Can Taste It","review":"This game has unbelievable graphics, good gameplay, and a great Franchise mode. This is without a doubt the best sports game for the Playstation 2. The only problem with this game is stopping the opposing quarterback.

This game is the Alpha and Omega of sports games and once again, EA hits a TOWERING homerun. I've played the Dreamcast version of football, and while enjoyable, it takes a backseat to the gameplay of Madden 2001. If you could only afford 1 Playstation 2 game (and if you actually have one, congratulations!) this would be the one to get! My next move is to add the multiplayer controller and enjoy the fun just that much more. When Sony and EA got together, it was a match made in video game heaven, Madden 2001 just proves that dreams DO come true!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Madden 2001 PS2 rocks!","review":"By far the best football sim ever!

In order to run this game on Windows XP Home Edition, you will need to run this in Windows Compatibility Mode (I got this to run in Windows 2000 compatibility mode). Trying to run this game Windows XP results in a \\"Lock-up\\" of the PC. The Windows 95/98 gave an enumeration error and Windows NT 4.0 wouldn't run at all.

As for Madden NFL 2001, It is a good game, I have no doubt, but it is not the best football game. NFL 2k1 for dreamcast has as good as graphics, more options and INTERNET PLAY. With Dreamcast and NFL2k1 You can play anyone anywhere with dreamcast, isn't that a feature that PS2 sure doesn't have. As for the dvd, for the price of PS2 you can buy a dvd player and dreamcast.

I'm sorry, but the players look like Blitz players, the control is off, the field looks choppy, the crowd looks like a painting and as always Madden comes up short of making a good game. NFK2K1 has more realistic movements, fields, player sizes, and just gameplay. I can pick up NFL2K1 and know exactly where the ball is going to go.

This game by no means is better than NFL2k1. The game play totally left me in a daze when playing defense. It seems that everything in this game is built around the offensive pass yet didn't take into consideration for defending the pass. I sometimes have double & triple coverage on a mediocre receiver and yet he still catches the ball. This really hurts my game because I love to play stiff hard nosed defense as NFL2K1 allows you to do. Dissapointing and wouldn't have purchased if I had know this."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's simply the best.","review":"IT is the best game i have ever played.

I highly reccomend this game. But it is starting to get old. I would wait a little bit longer if you are going to buy it cause the price is prob gonna drop."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have to agree with the majority of the reviews posted here","review":"This game is definetly everything that the posters have said it is, and more. When I play a game I look at numerous aspects to determine whether or not I like. Aspects such as graphics, sound, control, but most importantly: the fun-factor. A game can have terrific graphics and not be fun, and a game can also have rather primitive graphics and be very enjoyable. Case in point, Madden 64, the first Madden game to the N64. Rather sub-par graphics, but still perhaps the best football game ever, because of the fun-factor. Now where does Madden 2001 stack up in terms of fun-factor, you might ask. I can only say that this game is incredibly fun to play, which surprised me when I saw the graphics are as good as they are. This game is incredible. Buy it. Now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madden Scores","review":"This is the best sports game that I have played to date. The graphics are absolutely amazing. The gameplay is terrific. It is almost like you are watching a real game and controlling the players. Another thing that is really cool is the commentary. Madden and Summeral do the play by play and it is the best that I have ever heard. The comments are totally relavent to what is going on, on the field. I haven't noticed any serious repetition yet, but I have only had the game for a weekend. I think if there is one spot the game is lacking, it is in online play, but the modem peripheral for the PS2 isn't going to be out for a while, so it's kinda harsh to fault the game for that. Maybe next year."},{"rating":"2","title":"#1 football game out there","review":"I think it is the best football game, the madden cards are so much fun working for and very challenging.

The graphics are breathtaking, the best ever for a football videogame. The controls are great, however running with qb is difficult. What makes this game the best for ps2 is its replay value. The franchise mode is packed and will keep you playing for months. The madden challenges and cards are a pretty good addition to the series. You earn tokens by accomplishing in-game challenges. Then, you can buy a pack of madden cards when you have 100 tokens. A pack contains 15 cards. There are in total about 235 cards to collect. You can also risk cards when you play with a friend, adding more incentives to beating your best friend. Don't believe SSX's hype, Madden 2001 is the best game for the ps2 right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good game","review":"Exelent graphics, it's hard to compare to other systems because they don't have the quality or horsepower of the PS2, a lot of views look almost real.

I would recomend this game to everybody who love football or want to show of the PS2 to friends, i like the season play a lot, but there are more ways to play it, the franchise play is nice but i prefer the season"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nearly Flawless","review":"WOW! Truly amazing graphics. It's not just the fluid movement of the players, it's the minor details. The players adjust their pads after a hit, in a dome they all throw four shadows because of the indoor lighting, the linemen drop the first down marker and run out of the way when the play comes at them, and on and on. Not to mention the depth of play, playing a season, owning a franchise, worrying about the salary cap...it's all there! Or you can just simply play FOOTBALL! The only downside I can really point out is the announcing. It's repetitive and quickly becomes annoying. Not to mention, Lesley Visser is TERRIBLE as the sideline reporter, she sounds like the VISSERTRON 2001, her line-reading is more wooden than Pinnochio. The game however, is simply to beautiful to look at and play to allow the audio to detract from it. Buy this if you want the best football game ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like sports you'll love this!","review":"After not following American Football as i live in England, i was surprised to have found myself so engrosed in this game. After playing the game for a short while i was starting to learn all the plays and reading oppositions formations. I even found myself following the American games in reality. The graphics are close to photographic quality, and movements are mapped to almost perfection, right down to blinking and talking. This game is breath-taking, a must have for any sports lover!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO GOOD","review":"Nowhere near Madden 2001 for PSX1! Forget about \\"giving him the business\\" after the whistle because just like NFL2K1 the play is automatically stopped after the whistle. And you will know the play is stopped because the camera automatically zooms in on the player involved. After every play you will see a huge player, faces all the same, blinking until the choose play screen appears. Other disappointments include big arrow on kick offs making it simple, impossible to shed blocks and no 86 Giants-you got to be kidding! Listen--stick with the dreamcast. PSX2 launch is a joke(this is what I waited an extra year for) game developers are already anticipating the xbox and Maddens 2001 is no good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too great.","review":"Wow. I bought this game along with the Playsation 2 at launch and there is only one word to describe it: DISAPPOINTING. This game looks okay, but the play control, frankly [is bad]. Just like all the other madden games, but with little improvements in the graphics department. This game doesn't even have CURVED LINES! All the \\"curved\\" lines seem jagged do to the lack of anti-aliasing. Even though in the commercial, it looks neat, but those clips are just the instant replays. Anyway, this game has nothing over Dreamcast's NFL2k1. 2k1 is soooo much better. It does have it's weaknesses, but not as much as this game. 2k1 has online play, curved lines, and it is easy ... to pick a play. I am not a sega loyalist, so this review is NOT biased. This game seems very rushed. If EA took a lot more time, this game will be very excellent next year. IS IT JUST ME OR DOES THE PS2 SEEM LIKE A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT??!!

I was able to replace it for a while using electrical tape, but eventually I also started having trouble reeling it in, the top wouldn't stay screwed on, etc.It's a good length for my admittedly unusual use for it, but after so much trouble with the reel I replaced it with the Daiwa D-Fish Combo kit, with which I've been a lot more happy.

I don't like that the belt loops are so narrow that they will not fit on a standard buckleless underbelt (e.g. Uncle Mike's)without changing the position of the belt on your waist. One should also note that ballistic vests can impede quickly drawing or sheathing the blade because the knife is designed to fit snugly to the body at a level just over the top of the duty belt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great design","review":"Everything you expect from Ka Bar. It's a great knife that has a comfortable and practical design w/ a wonderfully sharp blade. I have had this for a yr or so now w/ occasional use and it looks and works the same as the first day I got it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended.","review":"As an ex-cop... I wish I had known about this knife back then! I never carried any knife on duty... but I would have carried this one! A few other things to consider (PLEASE LOOK AT YOUR STATE'S LAWS 1st)... The blade is less than 3\\" so it does NOT require a concealed weapons permit to carry. VERY SOLID. Comes with the Kydex holster so you don't need to upgrade it (unless you want the ankle holster). You can also exchange out the screws and change it from right to left handed. I've learned to carry it on my left side and hold it with the blade side pointing out from my pinkie finger. Wish it was made in America though (Like a TRUE Ka-Bar). I'd pay more for it if it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy Weapon to carry","review":"I bought this knife and clip on sheath to carry on my weak or left side. I carry a Glock on my right. The reason for this is if any one tries to grab your gun you can disable the person with the knife. It is very sharp and the curvature is just right for slicing."},{"rating":"2","title":"razor sharp blade!!","review":"This blade is hair popping sharp out of the box.

Good service there. I've taken three of them to an engraver and had names and ranks etched into the off-side of the blade. Laser etching makes a great looking grey script on the coated blade surface and the engraver arced the script to make it the same configuration as the blades top edge. Very crisp and clean lettering. It's great gift for those who've been, or who are again, going in harm's way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality from Ka-Bar as always","review":"I own two TDI knives and two TDI trainers, even the trainers are high quality, but for the money you really can't do much better than Ka-Bar. The ergonomic design of these knives make them very easy to use not just for tactical purposes but for utilitarian as well. I use my original TDI (small) for EDC and the larger TDI I keep at home for protection. Both knives are very well made and I know will last for a very long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Knife","review":"Well I was not sure at first if to purchase this knife or not because it didn't explain as to what it came with. The Knife comes with the stealth, belt clip, and a wrench.

I don't really care for the sheath, especially the metal belt clip. The clip is relatively thin and has sharp edges. I'm scared to sit on my leather couch or on any other delicate fabric for fear of tearing it. I'm not in law enforcement, so I imaging this wouldn't be a problem if attached to a duty belt."},{"rating":"2","title":"KA-BAR is quality","review":"Well made and feels good in the the hand. Definitely needs to be sharpened though. Blade is coated which is very nice. Fits great right behind my mag pouches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great knife, terrible sheath.","review":"I love my TDI, but had to stop wearing it because the metal clip on the sheath bent away from the kydex and eventually broke off after just two months of EDC. I'm having a new kydex sheath made so that I can carry this again soon. Plus, the metal clip had a black finish that rubbed off on all my uniforms and my hands whenever I wore it. Eventually it stopped after a few weeks of wearing it, but until I figured out where it was coming from I had no idea why my hands were always black when putting it on.As for the knife... It's fantastic. It's very easy to draw and it has a very good handle. It just seems to fit every hand I've seen hold it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome knife","review":"Great knife.

WIth all the fights and checking this game is as realistic as it can be. NHL 2001 is an awesome game. Personally i think this is the best game out there. This is a game you will love. There is no point in renting it. Just go buy it b/c you will love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS GAME SUCKS!!!!!!!!!","review":"I am the biggest fan of hockey games for playstation, and I was geeked when this came out. My friends and I cracked a few brews, and started to play. Well in 2 player mode, there is a glitch in the game. If you dish from mid ice, that is hit the puck in the air,or between the blue lines at the goalie it goes in everytime. Its so weak. You would think that the folks at EA would hirer some compent testers. Do not buy this!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT HOCKEY GAME","review":"Ok. I have played basically every single EA Sports NHLsince NHLPA 1993 and this game completes the evolution of EA's superb NHL dynasty. I mean how much more realistic can this game get (with the exception of a few flaws which i will explain later on).The Pros- the AI is superb - the controls make this game the most realistic game ever (no more cheap goals like psx and super nintendo versions of NHL) - Fantasy Draft (no other hockey games have this cool feature)The Cons- annoying commentary- Ok am I the one who is really annoyed by Jim Hughson. Bill Clement is ok on the color commentary. But what EA should do is have Bob Miller who has been calling the LA Kings games for over 25 years.- the fighting- ok this is the weakest part of the game what EA should do is really work on this and maybe have the jersey over the players head trick. this would be real nice"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I bought 989 Sports' NHL Faceoff 2001 for PS1, which is a far better game than this embarassing title from EA. The gameplay here is a total joke, nothing remotely like real hockey. It's hard to follow the play, the frame-rate slow-down is very annoying, goals go in bizarre, random ways, and the checking and positioning of the players is unrealistic. In short, a bad game, with great graphics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Game Play is Most Important","review":"I've owned every generation of hockey since Activision released 2-on-2 hockey for the Atari 2600. I believe, and all of my friends agree, that 989 NHL Faceoff by far has the best game play of any hockey game ever created. If you appreciate \\"realistic\\" game play that is. While EA is esthetically pleasing, and has a lot of neat gimmicks, the actual game play doesn't compare to 989. The checking is unrealistic and exaggerated, fighting is a joke, players do not go to the net as much, and you have to skate around the zone for half the period waiting for a play to develop, and it rarely does. I'm so disappointed with the game play that I've gone back to playing 989 hockey for the original Playstation. While I don't dispute that the graphics on this game are like nothing I've ever seen, it means nothing without the game play to back it up. The day that 989 releases Faceoff for the PS2, I'll be the first in line to trade in my EA NHL 2001."},{"rating":"1","title":"This doesnt measure up. Dont believe the Commercials...","review":"I now have a PS2 and a dreamcast. I have NHL 2k for the dreamcast and there is no comparison between it and this game...The dreamcast wins hands down. The gameplay on this is riduculous compared to the dreamcast NHL 2K. The graphics during play are also much better for the dreamcast game.Very simply the intro graphics for the this game are unbelievable. But when you actually play the game the graphics are not up to par. The game play is bad: no one timers, no shooting while skating, it has a bad feel etc. I dont know about everyone else, but I really could care less about intros...I want good graphics during game play.The same goes for Madden football. Its just not as good as NFL 2K for the dreamcast. Basically, EA sports just cant compare with Sega sports games.If you are considering buying the dreamcast vs. the PS2 for sporting games, then take my word for it you want the dreamcast!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS GAME WAS RUSHED!!!!!!!!!","review":"When the game introduction started I was thinking... ..WOW!!!!

I loved this game so much my friends and I would play for hours. It's what dropped my 3.5 to a 3.0 in college. Once I landed a PS2 my first purchase was NHL 2001. I was, and still am sick with disappointment over this game. Yes, I can see Brett Hull's nose hair, and yes, the gameplay is smooth and every international team from Austria to Zimbabwe is represented, but the little things are gone. The most irritating of these is the lack of a franchise mode. One season and then you're back to the title screen. No taking your favorite perrennial crappy team to the top with trades and front office maneuvering. This, to me, has taken the games legs right out from under it. I can play head to head, but alone it's a yawn factory.

The difficulty of the computer is extremely sensitive and can be adjusted to multiple levels.I've bought the last two versions and this version takes the next step up, as the last 2 did.

The numerous options, realistic play and camera angles are amazing. It is better than its original PS1 version because the gameplay is \\"physics-based\\" and the players do not move as fast. The game can get tiring to play continuous, unless you use the analog joystick found on the PS2 controllers. Overall, the gameplay is very well developed and the graphics are wonderful. I would still recommend this game as one of the best hockey games out there...if not the best. However, other sports games, namely FIFA and Madden 2001, are much better picks if you have no preference for either sport."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Hockey Game Available","review":"And I thought NHL 2000 on PS was great! Wow. This game is incredible, from the amazingly lifelike graphics to the insanely customizable gameplay. The front end presentation is spectacular, as we have come to expect from EA Sports. The sound is immersive and really adds to the excitement of playing. There are camera angles suited to any taste and the in-game, pseudo-tv-sports-broadcast style is plenty convincing, Some of the play-by-play is so spot-on it'll give you chills.

Everything in this game is excellent, the graphics, gameplay, AI, etc... I especially liked the new openings for every game where the players walk out on the ice. I'm not sure if Faceoff 2001 will be any good this year, then again it's hasn't been good since 98. THIS GAME SHOULD BE ON YOUR PS2 MUST BUY LIST.

This is an odd little episodic novel about a slacker type dealing with life issues. The deadpan voice may turn some readers off, but I found that the character is emotionally knotted enough that it rings true rather than contrived.

Crank it all the way up, pop open a cold one and all of sudden it's 1938 and you're in a Dallas honky tonk. By the way, the liner notes in the booklet are outstanding with dates, pixs, stories.

Taking it's cue from the movie, this book had it's named changed from THE LONG BLACK SCHOONER to THE STORY OF THE AMISTAD.The book tells the story surrounding the Amistad. However, it is told in a way that is appealing to both youth and adults. The language is simple and the story is straightforward. There is no historical gobbly-gook here.I found the book to be rather interesting, quite informative, and fairly easy to read (I read it in less than two days). It makes a great gift for any young history buff or anyone who is interesting in learning more about the Amistad but who hasn't studied much history."},{"rating":"2","title":"the coverage is helpful","review":"beware, to get the thing you really need to shake it hard and twist the top a thousand times.

I recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got comparison?","review":"Readers seem to rate a text for its mere appearance/publication or its importance within the larger framework of Buddhist texts, than for the quality of its translation. Now, how many people have actually compared the original to the translation? Few, I guess. Yet most of the readers give a high rating. I find that unplausible.Even without mastering (Classical) Chinese (from which this translation is done), someone with some experience in Buddhist rhetoric will find some things to remark:* Classical Chinese lends itself to different interpretations, leaving a certain arbitrariness in translation (in syntax).* Words like 'the Law' and 'the Laws' or 'Dharma' need contextual interpretation. I don't doubt Watson is a good translator, but I wished some notes were included where ambiguity of terms exists.* Leaving passages or whole chapters out is a pity. For a complete published edition leaves the reader to choose which chapters to skip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and Easy","review":"It was easy to order and the product arrived promptly with great service if anything were to happen in shipment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent translation","review":"Books like this always have you wondering whether the translator has really done his/her job properly, but with this one you can rest assured that he has. I have read the original Chinese version from which the translation was done and backed it up with a comparison of the Japanese (which translates from Chinese much easier than the English) for meaning and there's little I can find to criticize. The English reads well and naturally. Nearly all the unusual vocabulary is in the glossary, but the occasional word (e.g. 'vajra') is missing. The introduction provides useful background, making the whole readable as a story. By way of criticism, the translation of the names of bodhisattvas into English seems a little overdone. A table showing the names in the original Sanskrit and Chinese versions might have been a useful addition. Overall, an extremely useful book for finding out what the Lotus Sutra is all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required reading for Buddhists","review":"This book is the ultimate teaching of Shakymuni, and thus essential for anyone who claims to be Buddhist, or is exploring Buddhist Dharma.

The Lotus Sutra was conceived as a drama of colossal proportions and is considered by many scholars to be one of the earliest known literary masterpieces. Burton Watson's vivid translation provides readers with a clear understanding of this most profound work.

So I sent it out and paid another $25 to get it sharpened but the man who does my other razors for me said that after 4 hours of effort there was just no way to get a proper edge on it because the metal was too soft and the grind was uneven along the edge.

I don't care much for the robot mode, especially the head. Perhaps if it had darker colors. The transformation is a simplified version of the standard Cheetor/catbot method, and while the figure carries it off reasonably, it would be improved without the geared movement of the heads into position. The cat mode is excellent - it stands well, looks good, and the weapons add to its appearance. Its posability is hampered somewhat by the geared transformation - I frequently try to move his arm (or foreleg depending on mode) and end up having to put his head back into place. This will probably loosen up with play, though. It's a good toy for the price, and a good army builder figure.

I can guarantee my old window unit would keep this little room cool(cold). From what I have read it appears all of these portable units are way overated for their BTU's.

The ballad that should have been the best song, \\"Till Death Do Us Part\\" featuring Brownstone (the best R&B girl and guy groups on the same song) falters because while the ballad-y production works for Brownstone, it sounds too crossover for Solo.

It's all a great reminder as to what real love is and it helps keep your love in perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful way to start the day","review":"My lover and I often start our day by reading a chapter or two to each other from this gem of a book.

The sources are not all mainstream accepted texts but it seems that he groups and qualifies the sources so the reader can add his/her own 'pinch of salt' where needed. It will be an important reference for me for some time to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is an old remote which is usable with Pentax DSLR's","review":"Works with my Pentax *ist Ds.

I finished the book the same night I got it! I wanted to finish it, so I wouldn't let myself fall asleep until I did. I was tired the next morning, but I didn't care...I finished the book, and that was all I cared about. You might want to have some tissues ready if you're the sentimental type. Some major stuff happens with Patrick and Alice - stuff everyone has been through, or will go through at some time in their life. Elizabeth's secret is bad, too, but I can't say more than that, cause that will ruin the suspense! Alice manages to come through with a clear voice. The emotions she has to go through speak so clear to everyone, that you will feel like you're Alice. Your not reading about her...you'll feel that you are her. Once again, Alice comes through clearly with feelings we all understand and have, but still manages to get through a message to us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phyllis does it again!!","review":"This HAS to be my favourite Alice book yet; out of all thirteen! Alice has to endure the change of going into High School, but with with her two best friends, manages pretty well. Alice's boyfriend, Patrick broke up with her to go out with this other girl, Penny. Oh, how I despise her. Alice is really bummed. This book is funny, touching, and is laughable as well. The suicide watch thing was hilarious!!!! Once again, Phyllis nails this book. Just think, we have to wait till May 2002 to read her next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"13 is not an unlucky number!","review":"Phyllis Reynolds has now written 13 Alice books and every one is better than the last. Alice Alone was a very quick read because I enjoyed it so much. The only problem I had with this book is that Patrick didn't seem sad at all. Here Alice is, crying her heart out, having her friends start a suicide watch for pete's sake, and Patrick starts kissing Penny almost immediatly after they break up. And I really liked him. I found the whole thanksgiving/cons plot line rather boring and pointless (Alice time) and Lester was hardly even in this book. Phyllis should keep treking with these books (I'll be 27 by the time she writes the last book!) but please don't put Alice with Sam. I don't like him for some reason. Whenever I read about him, I feel kind of sick. But Alice should date other guys. Maybe someone new? Mark? Brian? Donald Sheavers? I liked Alice Alone, but I enjoyed other Alice books more, I think. Just read it and make up your own mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alice Alone","review":"Alice is finally starting highschool. She has everything a lot of girls wish for. A great boyfriend, two awesome best friends, and a cool dad. But one girl,Penny wants what Alice has. She wants Patrick to be her man. Penny's flirtatious ways eventually make someone fall for her. Alice is left devastated. And even though you know she won't be alone for eternity, you feel the anguish she does and that every girl(or guy) does when someone breaks their heart. Alice learns that even when your life seems like there is no tomorrow, there is and if you just live day by day, you will put your life back together. A funny touching story, Mrs. Naylor never lets her readers down."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALICE ROX THIS WORLD!!!!!!!!","review":"ALICE ALONE is the best book in the series! Alice is in highschool, and it's hard, but really fun. However, things start to get shaky at Alice's co-ed sleepover with a \\"fake kiss\\". Penny, the new girl, is taking Patrick's heart by storm. Is he still alice's boyfriend when he shows his feelings toward Penny? More trouble comes with Elizabeth and a very dark secret, Ms. Summers and Mr. Sorringer, Lester and Marylin, and much more. Will Alice be alone forever? With some good friends, Alice can survive. This book is very emotional: funny, sad, and full of life lessons. Once or twice it made me cry and I have laughed at least 10 times out loud. It is an essential book to read for 5-8 graders to learn what you still have to come. I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Alice book","review":"I have enjoyed every Alice book, and this new one, which I have been eagerly awaiting, is no exception. I don't want to give away too much of the plot, but Alice is growing up and things are changing. But Naylor recounts these changes with the same wit that she has shown throughout the whole story of Alice, who is one of my favorite characters. In particular, one of my favorite chapters dealt with the hilarious Thanksgiving dinner that Alice prepares. Don't miss this one! I can't wait for the next Alice book."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR YOUNG READERS!","review":"i wouldn't recommend this for any young readers. they should put a ratings on books also to tell parents what kind of stuff their kids are reading. especially books that are in the \\"kids section\\" of the library. awful and distasteful! watch out if you have a 10 or 11 year old reading this book.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adult Situations, not suitable for young readers","review":"This book advocates a 9th grade girl hosting a co-ed 'sleep-over' (chaparoned by an older brother?) and later in the book there is a very descriptive explicit portrayal of a sexual child molestation incident involving one of the key characters.This is definitely NOT for the young reader, or even the young adult reader, if it is for any reader at all.I only give it one star, because I couldn't give it zero."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alice Alone- This book is very descriptive-MKB","review":"Alice Alone is a great book. It is about a girl named Alice who is in high school. Alice has a older brother named Lester who is in his 20's and she has a dad. Alice's mom died when Alice was in kindergarten. Alice's dad is in love with Alice's middle school english teacher named Ms. Summers. Ms. Summers is in England deciding between Alice's dad and Mr. Sorringer(the assistant principal.) Alice has two best friends named Pamela and Elizabeth. Pamela is the wild one and Elizabeth is the christian one, but Elizabeth has a very big secret that she has never told anyone. And of course Alice has a boyfriend named Patrick. Alice and Patrick have been dating since middle school, but there is a new girl in town named Penny and Patrick seems to be attracted to Penny.I think girls would like this book because it has problems that girls go thruogh . I dont think boys would be interested in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A parent's review","review":"This is the third Alice book I've read, and so far, it's the one I enjoyed the most. Even though it's been a long time since I was fourteen, I really felt Alice's emotions and confusion over the problems with her boyfriend Patrick.As with the other Alice books, there is always some content that parents might want to review before they allow their child to read it. Particularly if their child is younger than 14. However, I thought that this book handled that kind of content well and gave good advice, advice that might indeed be significant to some readers.Alice is becoming more thoughtful in this book and I liked that. It's not only age-appropriate, but also thought-provoking for the readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Once again, Phyllis Reynolds Naylor has created another masterpiece. It's amazing how realistic Alice is, and this book is simply wonderful. It inspired me to read the entire series in one night, from the Agony of Alice to Alice Alone. Also, it says on the back that the last book is a look at Alice's life from 18 to 60. What do you want to bet that when she's sixty she'll look back on that letter from All but Alice? Anyway, it was a wonderful book and Alice fans will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alice Alone","review":"It's a brand new start, the nith grade.While alice learns that everything isn't so easy, she gets jellous of a new girl every boy likes, including her boyfriend Patrick.While Alice is excited to be working on the Hight School News Paper Penny gets even closer to Patrick.Pamela breaks down and shares a awful secret she has had in side of her sence she was seven.Alice struggles to keep her jealcusy of Penny at bay, while she watches her father handle some unsettling news about his recent fianc'e. Alice learns what trust is all about, and to have confidence in others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting","review":"I needed to read this book twice through to make sure I wasn't crazy. My conclusion: Save your money. The book seems sort of haphazardly designed with no stand-out meaning in the layouts. The essays although well written didn't really say anything, which really broke this book. The book also seemed pretentious to me, design included. Come down from the clouds and be a normal person, seriously. For what it's worth, the cover sure is \\"pretty\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hind sight is better","review":"Bought it, read it, wish I didn't spend it. Hoping it would have been one that would have been worthy of my typographic and design library, but it doesn't make the cut. I loaned it to few other designers as well, they reached the same conclusion. If the economy is bad don't buy it, if it's good..up to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patented DK Brown","review":"It's always a pleasure to see Brown's insider perspective on British design. In this book, he takes the opportunity to heap praise on some of his predecessors and nose about in their memoirs for hints of their thoughts on nascent designs. There is little effort here to provide a systematic survey of post-WWI designs--which I would like to have seen--but there is a sufficiency of substance and a liberal sprinkling of anecdotes. This is not a great book, but it is informative and enjoyable. My main complaint is that it tends toward the pricey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helmet and pads","review":"I was afraid the helmet would be too big but it has pads that can be inserted and removed for growth.

Also worth noting, there is no organization to the images...it's a mess.This was a complete waste money, don't make the same mistake I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad that this book is still so relevant.","review":"This is a well researched and well written book.

Perhaps some of this senseless mayhem could be stopped if Lieberman's research reached the right people."},{"rating":"1","title":"tripe","review":"Mr. Lieberman is a dangerous man. Obviously well-educated (he can write), he is clever enough to fool the reader with his ability to present personal, small-minded, poorly informed opinions as facts.As a mental health professional who works with juvenile offenders, I can firmly state that Mr.Lieberman's \\"facts\\" are wrong,wrong, wrong. But in these sorry days of poor treatment for the mentally ill, it comes as no surprise that a self-proclaimed \\"expert\\" doesn't know the difference between a bonafide mental disorder and a personal choice. True recovery for those who are caught in the tangled web of the justice system and the mental health community will be harder to realize as long as books like this are foisted on the public. I ought to know - I'm on the front line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does someone have an agenda?","review":"This book was completely a waste of the paper that it took to print it.

Not much to do with hunting.Hunt mode really sucked. You can't move more than 10 feet in any direction. You just sit there like an idiot, and use your calls. Eventually an animal will come along, and you shoot at it.No tracking, no movement allowed by the player. It's a shame. The graphics engine looks okay, and I was eager to go exploring. Instead, I was confined to a 10-foot circle of invisible walls.Grab the latest \\"Hunting Unlimited\\" instead.Edit 9-12-10: Since I wrote this review, \\"Hunting Unlimited 2011\\" has been released, and it is not good. They've switched that series to a new developer, and a completely new engine, which is terrible. So I have to amend the last sentence of my review. It should read, \\"Grab 'Hunting Unlimited 2010' instead. Not the 2011 version though\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"bought this game for my grandson but he was very disappointed...played once and never played again..graphics were not good and the game was more like a comic impression than an actual hunting game...was too difficult for a child to play with any success, in fact adults found it frustrating to try to play..very disappointed in this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"another recycled ripoff","review":"I am sick and tired of publishers cheating customers by reissuing previously published works with a different title, cover, etc. to fool the customer.

He was always rude and abrupt to her, had low opinions of her, and laughed at her to be mean, too. Yet she fell in love with him?! They never once had a meaningful conversation. He often left her alone towards the end and she sleeps with him after they start kissing and he sends her away the next day without even letting her talk to him! I quit reading from that point on. I don't like not liking the man in the story and could care less if they ended up together later or not.The author's 1st book in the series, Promise Sunrise was excellent. You don't need to read both, since each is a complete story and the female lead was only 6 years old in that one.

They both shipped from GlobalWorx Distribution Inc. in Richmond Hill, NY. I will be pursuing this further."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a woman's point of view: devastatingly unforgettable","review":"All the reviewers seem to be men, so I thought you might like a woman's perspective: My now-husband had this on the first day I met him & through our first several dates. I was completely mesmerized by this scent . . . or was it just him? I would walk by men wearing this and be overwhelmened by thoughts of him. Trust me, this scent is alluring, inviting, masculine, and extremely attractive. That's why I buy it for him all the time - I never get tired of it & I hope he wears it forever. Oh yeah, he likes it too! Definitely worth a try! As for the one negative review, it honeslty looked like the guy had a bad case of self-importance - who cares about whether the mood of the scent can be captured in one word? I say, go for it - you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake perfume was delivered","review":"I have used Acqua Di Gio before and I have always liked the perfume but this time around a Fake was delivered to me and I hate it.

I've used this brand of cologne for 4-5 years and it usually goes well with my body chemistry but now seems unfamiliar. I started doing research online and it would appear that my item shows flag signs of a counterfeit and a good one at that. Every detail from the product package design to labeling is identical to the real one except for the actual fragrance itself, the high and low notes are off and the scent only last a couple of hours. To think if I would have payed the difference to have bought it at the mall (about 15 dollars) I would have my normal satisfaction instead of disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware, there are many frauds!","review":"Many fakes of this product have gone forth. You will know if it's authentic by how it hits you. It's a very well put together, lively, citrusy smell.

This is a wonderful product, but it's unfortunate that it's reputation has been tarnished by thousands if not millions of frauds under its brand name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible seller","review":"I purchased this cologne for my husband for Christmas. It arrived ontime but the box was wet, inside the plastic wrap, and the top of the bottle is loose and the cologne does not smell anything like it is supposed to.

Don't be dooped by this seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is NOT Acqua Di Gio","review":"I know this scent like the back of my hand. Needless to say I didn't smell it when it came in because I assumed it was the real thing. After my husband opened his present and put it on xmas day, I actually asked him what he was wearing.

I will be contacting the seller as well to return this."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT THE REAL THING!!!!","review":"Very disappointed!!

Even though there were many sellers offering in Amazon, I ordered the one sold by Amazon LLC. I quickly received the package. when i opened the box, I found the wrap around the perfume box is open at the bottom. Anybody who received in this condition should immediatley return it. I still give it a chance thinking Amazon would not cheat. When I use the perfume, I have the smell only when I put it on. Then gone. I would still buy things from Amazon but would not buy perfume through internet anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this item","review":"I have been wearing Aqua Di Gio for years.

I love my Cool Water by Davidoff and that's 100 times better than this Gio and the fragrance stays almost all day! I would still buy it and wear it at home or for short visits, but not for work.

Acqua Di Gio is my favorite cologne that I no longer wear."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pun purchase","review":"A fine example of how fickle or intimate (I prefer the word intimate) scent is to each of us. This is one fragrance that I have not gotten to like. Received as a gift more than a year ago, the bottle still has three-quarters. It does have a \`rich' scent but I find it to be too confusing and indescribable a scent, not educing a one word description like \`sporty', \`sexy', \`alluring'. I don't wear it very often but I don't recall a single occasion of \`what fragrance are you wearing?' with this one. It's just not my cup of tea so definitely, if you're not familiar with this scent beforehand; do not buy before trying it out at a department store for a day. Why Buy? As a gift for the guy competing for the female that is currently in your crosshairs. As a gift for your boss - you will know he's coming from a mile away. You need a gift for a guy who couldn't pour water out of a boot even if there were instructions on the heel"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously, stay away at all costs","review":"The insane, enduring popularity of this cologne absolutely confounds me.

So I started looking at my bill and it all looks fine, everyone else I ordered from that day is sending my orders. So I go to look at the item itself, and notice the price is much higher than what I originally paid for it. So I think I have figured it out. They made a mistake and sold it to me at a price they didn't want to sell it. Now I haven't heard back from them in email, but if that was the reason.

Be careful buying fragrance online, especially popular ones. Now I think it is worth spending extra [...] bucks and buying at the local store.If you still buy it online - it's a good idea to do a blind test. Just go to a local store grab some paper strips that they use for testers, spray the tester from the store on half of them and yours on the other half (don't forget to mark which one is which). If after that you can easily tell which one is which not looking at the mark, there is a good chance that one is fake. You can also compare how long they last.

The analog sticks respond well to commands and I've been able on numerous occasions to maneuver around and perform plays that I never would have been able to in other games.The multiplayer is fantastic, and I especially like the customize team option. You can change the faces, hair, etc. of players and name them after your friends.

THis game has the best graphics by far of all of the games but this allways happens when the new game comes out. The game playing is alot more realistic. The game style is gret but i have to admit the controlling of the players could be easier. There are great new things about this game. I just cant put it down.

For example, it's far easier to score on a bicycle kick that practically any other way. On the flip side, it's virtually impossible to score in a \\"conventional\\" fashion (i.e. along the ground with your foot).* The \\"physics\\" of the gameplay somehow seem off. The ball flies a little too straight and there is a 2-D feel to the play.Overall, I'd recommend it, if only because the graphics are so amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"great game but not realistic","review":"i love this game, lots of action, and the game moves quickly. but the problem is that real soccer does not have as much scoring as is in this game. most aspects are very realistic except for the crossing pass. it is way to accurate and the bicycle or scissor kick that is easily made is a bit ridiculous. still a great game to play with friends and run smack at them though. watch out of the computer opposition when the settings are on world class and the game speed is turned up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fifa 2001 EA Sports Solid","review":"Fifa 2001 has to be one the most visually stunning games on the market today.

These were the \\"Air Defense Team\\" - a group of three miniature Transformers who, in addition to converting from aerial vehicles to robots and back, could combine to form the Star Sabre Sword. This powerful weapon played an integral part in the Transformers: Armada cartoon series. Now, with Armada's sequel Transformers: Energon comes a repainted and remolded version of the Star Sabre set. This time, the Mini-Cons combine to form the translucent yellow Energon Saber Sword, which can be used by the larger Transformers. In addition, the Mini-Cons themselves are great toys with excellent play value, converting from jet planes/space shuttles to robots and back. This fun set is a definite great value!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It falls apart easily","review":"It is still like that. It dosen't stay on forever in saber mode.

The grammar is ridiculous and I spotted more than one misspelling (waste instead of waist, plural \\"girl's\\"...come on) It is not really a story, so much as a collection of antecdotes.

Frankly, this book did just that. This dancer held herself up to be a pristine stripper with morals of gold - while her fellow dancers are portrayed to be a little more nasty and a little more seedy, and a little more willing to do anything for a dollar.The insight into what really happens when men are turned loose on the Las Vegas scene sounds pretty made up to most of us other dancers who are out there every night.

As a stripper myself, I have seen a lot of stuff inside the clubs and I was hoping to read on what this author has experienced.The author in this book barely touches the facts and real scenerios that occur in the clubs. This author seems to generalize events and not go into more depth or detail. Alot of what this author talks about is infomration that is already known to many people, even those that don't frequent strip clubs.I guess I was looking for more informational reading material. I was not impressed with this book and could not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book lacks infprmation, it's more like a funny story","review":"Most of the other reviews say this book is funny, well it is but that is it. It sounds like the author went out of her way to make the world of stripping sound funny and nothing else.She barely touches the surface. She writes aobut what the guys do and what the strippers do in those establishments, but it attempts to make light of it, or make sound like a glamorous funny thing. As a bouncer, I can tell you tha tthis book is way off.

Her Royal Panoply survey of past monarchs certainly cannot be trusted after reading this confounding and confusingly sour effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not much new here","review":"I had read that this was a different kind of biography and it proved to be. There wasn't much I hadn't read before, but I did enjoy the never-before-seen photographs.If the book is a bit dull, it is because the subject is. The Queen isn't terribly interesting or exciting.

Then the Garlic Pro would chop it down into huge chunks and more twisting supposedly will get it finer at least my old veggie chopper can easily do that if I pump it a few times more. But it's just not true with the Garlic Pro and the big chunks of garlic refuse to budge and stay that way. Then a blade came loose and I took it back to the store I bought it from. After I got my money back I checked the others on the shelf some also have fine cracks and the blades will definitely come loose it's just a matter of time.

But the military portions were far better then those in the formerly renowned \\"Deerhunter,\\" which got an unwarranted pass at the time, and the story in \\"Soldiers\\" is decidedly more powerful, and convincing - clichés and all.As Hollywood also does so well, there are a few flights of fancy here and there, but from a historical perspective the story is authentic enough - ask any attorney how many marriage laws had to be changed just because of courageous interracial couples such as those fictionalized in this flick.

Since Mr. Katz died, other editors have written newer entries, but I feel that Katz's leave his personal mark. One actually gets a feeling of film history in reading his entries.

The answers to some of the most obscure questions about moviemaking reside in this brilliant compilation of facts about films and the people who make them--everyone from the best boy to the stars. As a research resource, it's invaluable. To satisfy that nagging question about some film you saw with James Cagney, get the Film Encyclopedia.

He moves into a home in Vegas next door to teen Charlie played by Anton Yelchin. Charlie is suspicious of the guy and warns his mother played by Toni Collette to stay away from him. Toni Collette is one of the gifted actors of our time and is underused in this, but its still nice to see her doing a fun movie for a change.I saw the original which came out 26 years ago and thought it was ok. This one is better. While the original used more comedy, this one is darker, more horror and appropriate. It's well acted by the entire cast including the teens which you expect to find mediocre acting - not in this. They rise graciously to the challenge. One by one Charlie notices his classmates disappearing and it isn't long before he discovers that his neighbor is a vampire and not a nice one.

Eventually he discovers he is a vampire and his girlfriend is the next victim, so he recruits peter vincent to hunt down and kill the vampire. Had some interesting ideas, but what hurts the movie is its crude dialogue and over use of the F word and whatever else spoken obsanity thats written for a teenage audience, its unnessary. Peter Vincent isn't likeable and its disrespectful towards Roddy Mcdowalls original performance.

I was glad when Chris Sarandon made his cameo appearance because it reminded me to praise him for how much better he was was in the 80s original,half a star goes to the special effects b/c they were ok, but the writing was awful b/c they felt the need to explain everything that was obvious in the film, the cinematography was poor,there were severe developmental issues, zero suspense, and it seemed rushed, I tried to watch it as a stand alone movie and it didn't work, this movie was a travesty.

It is obvious to me, at least, that certain doctrines are assumed to be correct and therefore written into this book. Also, there are several incorrect statements that would confuse novice readers, such as, \\"Out of all his followers, Jesus chose 12 men to be his disciples (Mark 3: 13-19), giving them the title 'Apostles' (Luke 6: 13)\\" (p. 557). Anyone who can read these verses knows that Jesus chose 12 men to be Apostles out of his many disciples.

Quantum mechanics is certainly one of the most significant theory's of the 20th century and the period covered in this book is of particular interest because of the large number of new particles discovered during this time.

Now that I'm well into my adult years, I found myself wishing someone could have addressed these ideas when I was much younger.What makes this book so special is its practicality. Sean doesn't preach. He offers practical, time-tested advice and solutions for teens struggling with the decisions that are going to make or break their futures. He warns, praises, inspires, and empowers teens to make the most out of their lives by making good decision.This isn't just a self-help book. It's a book that every teen can find worth while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting","review":"As a High School Student on my way out into the real world, I would have found this as an invaluable gem when I was a younger student.

The picture is not sharp at all and the colors are a little off. I'm at a loss for words on the quality of this DVD. Very disappointed! Fright Night, which is 5 years older than Part 2 is exactly how a dvd should be, so what happened to this one? The picture quality on this DVD is worse than the VHS and Laserdisc!!! Artisan needs to be contacted to have this DVD taken off the shelves and re-released.

But this is almost a worst case scenario for DVD. Full screen, the image looks like first gen VHS at BEST. I'm not even an aplha nerd, but there's no reason for this picture quality. THEN, there's the extras. There are none. NOTHING. I'm surprised they even have a menu. Your option is start, or chapter select.I don't know what the market is for this film, but I know it's a very good film, and a decent sequel to the seminal first installment. With the first being remade, you'd think it would have been enough to spur a bit of a renewed interest in this film. Guess not. SEE the film, but I'd rent it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wide screen Fright Night 2 badly needed","review":"As a big fan of this film and after having watched the vhs edition of fright night2, I still can't help feeling undernourished when it's over. The widescreen cinematography is sooo important for this film to work. I decided to wait and see what happens once the FN remake comes out.. sadly nothing on the radar for any new editions re. FN2. I believe Columbia Pictures sold the rights of this would-be franchise to another company, so it's important to know there probably won't be any correlation between the two films when the remake streets on video. LIVE video owns this title, and sadly, this video outfit no longer exists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch out Jerry's got a sister, shes seductive, beautiful and monstrous!!","review":"Fright Night 2 is similar to Fright Night 1 in terms of is about vampires and a few scenes of a werewolf, the characters of Charlie Brewster (William Ragsdale) and Mr Vincent are back to slaughter more vampires.Regine Dandridge (played by Julie Carman) is the sister of Jerry (From Fright Night 1),seems to be a beautiful woman with a thirst of blood and a seduction to men. She later seduces Charlie and eventually manages to turn him a vampire too and has to fighte his inner montrous demons, just to kill Regine and her other monstrous friends. Charlie always seems to dream about her in which his girlfriend seems to be turned off by him.I liked this movie and I think it is just as good as the first one as there good graphic monsters and has a good plot as they prey on people and the werewolf has a good design to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please re-issue !!!!!","review":"This movie is very good as far as sequels go and this transfer to DVD is simply unacceptable! Anamorphic widescreen and remastering would improve this a hundred fold. And some nice extras would'nt hurt either.

Like in the first one, Amy had until dawn before she was fully changed, but good ole' Charlie went through it for days... And I didn't really like the werewolf-like vampire. Regine's whole little gang was pretty annoying.

I've had a vhs version since 1990, and the picture quality on my vhs tape is better than the quality of the dvd version even after watching the vhs tape countless times over the past 13 years. I don't even know why artisan went through the trouble of releasing this dvd. Hopefully they will do the right thing and remaster the film in a later reissue.I would have given this movie 5 stars, but simply put the quality of this dvd is the worst of any dvd I own so I give it 1 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not one for sequels but","review":"this is one that I actually enjoyed because it stuck to the original storyline (unlike \\"Nightmare On Elm Street 2,\\" for example) and featured two characters from the first movie (actually three but it's a different Amy this time around).Jerry Dandridge's sister is here to take revenge of Charlie and Peter Vincent for killing her 1,000 year-old brother. The way she went about it was different (for a pleasant change): She seduces Charlie and it's up to Vincent and Amy to save him.Good special effects and seductive storyline make this a pleasurable viewing experience. Also good to have for the library, too (although I like DVDs and the Special Features section of them, I prefer good ol' VHS tapes).Since Hollywood likes making sequels so much, they should take a lesson from \\"Fright Night 2.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have taken other viewers advice","review":"The quality of this dvd is very poor.

While it's good to have this on DVD (if you don't happen to have a VCR hooked up to your TV) this version of the movie is bad!!!

Now I am a gigantic fan of the first 'Fright Night', but 'Fright Night 2' I Love. Sure the first film is untouchable, but I just love this film. There's something about this film that is fantastic. The film is well cast(William Ragsdale, Roddy McDowell, Traci Lin, Julie Carmen, Jonathan Gries, Brian Thompson etc) are perfect. Well done to Director Tommy Lee Wallace-please release this on DVD, my collections not complete until I own this. The music by Brad Fiedel is superb, and at times very sexy. The settings and locations are absolutely fantastic. I love the humour in this film. It's such a fun, excellent movie.

It is up to Peter and Charley's new girlfriend, Alex to save him. It is a neck-biting horror film while it's a rip-roaring funny movie.

For me, they are the only backpacks that are the right size for both full french easels and large Versa plein air easels (as well as other necessary equipment). It's not especially sturdy or well made- but it's the size that works and if you're just carrying it relatively short distances from car into the field it works just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh PALEEEZ!","review":"This was truly a tired ghettofabulous story. I waited the entire book for the story to reach it's peak and nothing happened. While I was reading this I kept thinking what was the purpose of the book? This book can't even compare to the Coldest Winter Ever because Souljah added depth to her characters who developed as you went through each chapter. Gena, on the other hand, was the same person from beginning to end. I never did figure out if she loved the man or the money and which does she miss more. In my opinion, this book was a waste of time to write. I can hang out at the local park and hear the same story, but with a more dramatic touch, and a realistic ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lets just say it a door stop","review":"I cant even finish this book.

Quadar and Gena were the Adam and Eve of this whole Urban Street Good Girl & Bad Boy love story. I read this book many many many years ago and can still remember when I would go around saying \\"that is so blue.\\" When Q got shot I cried like he was my man and the bittersweet ending left me feeling like this is really real. This book is a classic and an inspiration to all books that came after it.She did write a part II but I hated the part two. I know you gonna get the sequel if you cop this one, I did. I wish I hadn't though cause this classic should have been left alone. Yeah I am going to get the third one, two and I hope it is better then the second one. Doubt it, but if you only get this first one to me that's all you really need. Just close the book, hold it to your heart, wipe away your tears and let out a deep sigh. And let it end for you right there."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is ON POINT !!!!","review":"After I finished reading this book all I could say was this was so ON. This was my first Teri Woods book and it was gold. Her writing style is awesome, talk about in depth characters.

Terri Woods is official! whatever she got to say im listening!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Ok book 2/1/2","review":"Based on the reviews of this book I know alot of people won't agree with me but oh well. People have been telling me for months and months to get this book. Well I finally got it and it really didn't live up to the hype. It wasn't a horrible book but it wasn't that good either. When I read this book I kept thinking this story was trying to be a subpar \\"The Coldest Winter Ever\\" but it never quite made it. Gena and Qua were ok characters but there were too many other characters in the book that made the storyline too junky. Another thing that bothered me about this book is the countless grammatical errors and misspelled words. I'm sorry people but that is not acceptable in anyone's book, self-published or not. Please read The Coldest Winter Ever to see a true example of how a story like this should be done."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU CAN'T LIE IF YOU TRUE TO YOUR GAME.","review":"This book was a very interesting and enjoyable book. I feel that this book was so good because it reminds me of the life people live in the streets of New York and Philly. To tell you the truth, I'm not really a book reader, but after I read the summary on the book True to the Game it really grabbed my attention. I asked my teacher if I could read it and it came out to be one of the best books I ever read. This book was about a guy named Quadir and a girl named Gena who met at a party and eventually got together and became something. This book True to the Game, which was mainly about the game on the streets, was one of he best books base on the streets in this time period (1988). Gena and Quadir found themselves caught up in the vicious world of drugs and money, only to find that success in this game is not easy to win. I feel that in order to live the life on the streets, you have to be from the streets or else you would be lost in the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wasn't ALLLLLL That","review":"Everyone hyped this book up to be so decent but to me it was a typical drug dealing book It was kind of confusing at parts and just dumb everything I thought would happen in the book happend its not different from any other books I want my money back All the characters seemed so fake it was just not a good book"},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a very good book","review":"This was a very good book. i really enjoyed the love story between gena and qua.

This book opened you up to how people are living their life, with the drug money, fast cars and jewelry. Every time I read another book I still think about this book. This book made you shed a tear! I had to keep reminding myself that it is only a book. Girls, even though the fast life is fun, it never last and people should look at what can and will happen when you stay in that lifestyle. Gena got to walk away with bags of money but everybody don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"To True a Story!","review":"This by far is definitely the best book I ever read. I guess because I see myself in this book, sad but true. This book had me crying and cracking up laughing, especially situations that I had gone through. From the shady girlfriends, to the club scene. She really hit all points accurately. The only thing I would like to have seen more in this book is better descriptions of the characters, so you would be able to better picture them. THank God! I don't live that life style anymore because if I did, this book would really make me think twice about my situation. Keep up the good work Teri, and I hope to see a new book out by you soon. I can't wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed this very much","review":"If you're looking for a remarkable novel, well crafted with lyrical prose and deep meaning, then do not read True to the Game. But if you're looking for a great little book about the street life, with an interesting story line and very believable characters; then by all means do read True to the Game. Practically everyone compares it to The Coldest Winter, and I found myself doing the very same thing. After I discovered that this book in fact was written way ahead of The Coldest Winter, I began to relax. If this book had been published and given wide spread publicity back in 1994 (or 93) when it was orginally written..well there would have been no comparison. We all would have considered it off the hock. I loved the characters, especially Gena and Quadir. They were so in love!

Especially after ready excellent books like Dutch and Dutch II. I think maybe because it was her first book the writing was kind of shakey. But I'm sure natives of Philly who read this book are going huh? The story of the infamous Junior Black Mafia was turned and twisted around horribly. Names of people just popped up all through out the book. You'll have to go back and read again to try to figure out who she's talking about. The way it was written is like the reader already knows who the character's are. Not! Ok so in the end Gena gets the money. But I got confused when Quadir asked her to marry him and he said her name as Janel Louis Scott. How did the name Gena come from that? Too many characters popping up out of place and uneccessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was hyped up too much.","review":"Half way through this book I wanted to quit reading it. I still haven't finished it, but so far it is really hard for me to keep reading because I still do not feel a connection with the characters and they are getting on my nerves. I was told that this book was similar to Shannon Holmes's \\"B-More Careful\\" which was OFF THE HOOK. Although the author of true to the game tried to use the dialogue of people who grew up in the drug game, she failed to get us involved in their lives from the jump. I give Teri Woods props tho and encourage her to keep writing, but other works will need improvements to maintain the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fable Huh?","review":"This was an excellent book. The book captures you from the beginning then from there you are taken into the lifes of characters. True to the Game seems like a book that was written from a first hand experience of a baller's wifey. I started this book on a Saturday and finished it on Sunday. I especially like the part where Gena beat up Cherrelle for harrashing Quadir.The end leaves you hanging because you don't know what Gena did with all of Quadir's money.

The main characters are Gena and Quadir who find themselves caught in the nasty, world of drugs and money. Quadir a millionaire drug dealer builds a huge money empire. He is also faced with the battle between him and the notorious junior mafia. Gena is faced with holding onto her man, her house, her car, and the money. True to the Game was the best book I ever read because it told the real story of what is happening in the streets. These are our lives this is what is happening around the world we live in. This book tells all the highs and lows. It tells you that if you get caught in the drug world that the all this money that you are making can cost you your life. This book seems like a book that can help change some people around.

Read it !!! 1 Love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something else","review":"I am still reading this book, but I must say something about it. The only reason I gave this book four instead of five stars is because I am not for that kind of life. You make dollars for days, but you always got to look behind your back. As for the book itself, it is captivating, riveting, and entertaining. It makes you wish you could go to the stores and buy the whole mall and then some...I am for that aspect, I also thought that there would be a lot of shoot em ups, but I was surprised that there weren't all about that. They really kept the focus on Gena and all. I was sorry about Sahirah, and it is always sad to see folks die at such a young age no matter what. But, Ms.Woods put out a good debut novel, and hope to hear more from her in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is da bomb","review":"When I read this book it was nothing but excitement after excietment. You meet new characters every where u turn. Each and every page has a great set up. Every time I had to do something I would find myself right back reading this book. You cant put it down. If your a hustler or a baller or whatever you are you should cop dis book na mean. The book is off the hinges. I already started to read it again.

This book came highly recommended to me, I will never listen to that person again. Since I was around twenty years old when the Junior Black Mafia (JBM) were running things in Philadelphia, I am aware of how a young woman can get caught up in the money and the power. But come on...Gena from the Richard Allen Projects, meets a drug dealer from Philly in New York? Come on! This book displayed the worst side of some black females. I knew several members of the JBM that are now in prision or in the grave. Gena was and continued to be driven by money. Even at the end of the book! How about doing something good for yourself, like finishing school or getting a job. This book depicted and glorified the drug lifestyle. In one part Qua was so happy that he had become a millionaire...okay...off the backs of black folks...that's something to be very proud of! This book was pure-D crap!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PARTIALLY EMBELLISHED","review":"... Magazine recently featured the author Terri Woods. Sheis towards the end of the spectrum of Gen X. Growing up during thesame period as myself, I am totally familiar with this era. Hip Hopmusic categorizes this time period significantly. We all remember thehuge rope chains and Eric B and Rakim melodies. The hot beamer coupesthat stalled along 125th street and the hot summers in North Philly,but this novel is emebellished beyond belief. Woods depiction of thedrug game in Philly is totally distorted. I didn't feel sympathy forthe main character. I don't feel that she was a heironess. She was amoney grubbin, non workin, narcissistic prostitute. This novel ispoorly written and should have stayed in the hands of streetvendors. Although, I do admire the way Woods understands heraudience. For this reason , I gave her two stars. She must give herfemale characters more substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"I have read all types of Urban Fictions..This book is boring and not well thought out.

I was scanning through my cousins book collection and once I came across it, I never put it back down until I finished it. Because of this book, I've read countless other urban novels and they keep my bookshelves overflowing! I fell in love with this book from the first page to the last and to those who haven't read this yet, I advise you to do so. You surely won't be disappointed I know I wasn't.I can truly see myself picking this book up ten years from now and still enjoying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"True To The Game","review":"The book that I have read is a very sad story. This book is about a young beautiful teenager girl who suffers a lot in life. Then she meets love of her life, unfortunately he is a hustler.She begins to have a lot of conflicts in her life with her friends and boyfriend. She was once in a abusive relationship which she couldnt handleanymore. This story starts off really good and then ends up sad. It tries to let the audience know that life isent a joke.I really enjoyed this book True To The Game. One of the reasons why I enjoyed this book so much was because it is based on what really happens in life to most people. This book can really teah you a lesson in life, and really gets to your heart.This book also makes you realize that life is too short to fool around and mess up your life. I would say that I would read this book all over agian.

This book I can't say it was bad but I can't really say it was good either. You have 17 million dollars + and you contemplating on rather or not you should get out of the game? I think not... It's called investing. You got all the money let your money make you money. But hey it was just a book so let me calm down. There were too many characters popping out of nowhere. I'm still trying to figure out who Nitah is and who Jalil is? At times the book was going in ever direction possible. Teri Woods tried that's all I can say. I don't knock anyone who is out there doing there thing but the book could of been a lot better. Gena was dumb. Quadir was unrealistic. Gah Git? what is that? I don't know. I am skeptical of purchasing her others. But remember that this is just my opinion. Everyone is entitled to their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lures You In!","review":"This book is crazy! You cant help but get sucked into the story as you read. At first I found it to be a bit much but as you read deeper into the book it kinda start to make you feel like you're being lured in the middle of all the characters and their drama! It's the next best thing to living the \\"street life\\" first hand. When I finished the book all I could say was \\"WOW!'. Fiction or not, you just cant believe how gangsta this book is. It's worth the cash if you into those living-in-the-hood-gotta-hustle-rob-cheat-kill-and-sell-drugs-to-get-paid type books. If not-keep browsing.

Besides the grammer and editing of this book I found it to be captivating. I felt like I knew each character, I laughed and cried with them.

I was very disappointed. First of all, has Ms. Woods ever heard of an editor? This book was filled with so many errors that at times it was distracting. In my opinion the plot was boring. I'm struggling to understand what all the fuss is about this book and this author. For those of you who are avid readers and truly know good authors and storytelling, save your money and if you must read it, borrow it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"True to the Game","review":"Didn't like this book. All the main characters were typcial and unbelieveable. Some of the situtations in the book would not have happened in real life.

I mean, okay, first I'll give the author props on writing a book cause we do need more black authors, but it was poorly written with alot of mistakes that a good publishing company should have corrected. Second, the author added too many characters that you really couldn't keep up with. Thirdly, she didn't even describe any of the characters really. If you are an Omar Tyree, Sistah Souljah, or Eric J. Dickey fan DO NOT PICK UP THIS BOOK!! Because that means you are used to the author describing the characters to the tee; where you can actually visualize them in your head. This author doesn't do this and you will get frustrated trying to keep up. The storyline was weak also; like she just got tired of writing. The people that hype this book up usually don't read on a regular basis anyway so of course they don't know a good book when they read one. Thats why I said a real book reader knows a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ms. Woods should take a few writing classes.","review":"I found this book to be lacking in so many areas. I think Ms. Woods should fire her editor if she has one, there are so many typos and misspellings that it is ridiculous. It reads like a children's book, it is so elementary. Her style of writing is so elementary. I am surprised that it got such a good rating, but the people rating it must not read alot. Or they do not know what a good writer is suppose to put out there, my advice to Ms. Woods is please take a writing class, and read a few books by E. Lynn Harris or Jerome Dickey or Stephen King for that matter. I know every writer has their own style but, this style or author is just not worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"true blue - a waste of money","review":"The book, read like a urban newspaper!

If you're a reader who likes to feel like you're right there in the moment then this book is definitely for you.

This book glamorizes and glorifies the life of the hustler and the hoochie. None of the characters have any depth and the book has no sense of realism. The teenage girls seem to live in a fantasy world of men and money, and the guys seem to think hustling is the only way of life to live. There is nothing real about this. It's all pretty sad.

It also could've used better editing to make the flow of the story go a little smoother. It was kind of hard to follow because new characters just popped up outta nowhere w/ a storyline that led nowhere.

Because of this, the attachments for glasses have a tendency to bend outward when heavier glasses and mugs are placed on them. The feet of the old model were made of hard rubber, and helped to keep the rack in place. The feet of the newer model are plastic, and the rack often slips towards the sink as it's loaded with dishes.It's not a terrible dish rack, and I guess the antimicrobial coating is nice, (although I never had a problem with mold on the old rack) it's just a cheaper, flimsier version of the old one.I wrote a review of theRubbermaid Antimicrobial Large Drain Board, Blackthat goes with this, it didn't fare as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as expected.","review":"Just as I expected since I was replacing my chrome model that began to rust.

This strip kept glasses above the edge of the counter. The new design is flimsier and less sanitary, with the edge of the glasses resting on the counter.

I tried calling the company - but got a foreign-speaking person and was able to figure out it was the shipping dept. I tried the customer service number and was told no one was available to take my call. I paid a total of $17.00 plus in order to get the model pictured in the amazon site, and now, if I want to return it, I have to pay the shipping PLUS a 10 - 25% restock fee!Do NOT buy from this \\"Toolboxsupply.com\\" unless you want a one way trip with your 'disposible money'.I buy an unbelievable amount of merchandise through Amazon.com and this is the first vendor I've ever been 100% dissatisified with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does the designer of this actually WASH dishes?","review":"For some reason they left a GAPING HOLE where the silverware basket hangs on the NEW dish drainer.In the photo you see they don't show the end of the basket that has a GAPING HOLE.I tried using my old corner silverware basket with this drainer, but the dishes fell out of the BIG GAPING HOLE at the other end of the basket.The new silverware basket DOESN'T hold the silverware up, and it DOESN'T keep the dishes from falling out of the GAPING HOLE in the dish drainer.WHO is designing dish drainers?

Do yourself a favor, pay the price and buy a fantastic dish rack on Amazon.com like the simplehuman KT1025 System Dish rack (pricey but worth every dollar) or OXO Good Grips stainless dish rack and sink mats.

You may make the dish drainer look better by routinely scrubbing it, but it's almost guaranteed there will still remain black stains all over it. This problem can easily be avoided by going with a plastic dish drainer instead. Please do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like the size but there are no compartments for silverware","review":"I like this but there are no compartments for silverware.

It had a lot of nooks and crannies that trapped water and got icky. It was also difficult to clean well as it required a brush to reach many of the nook and crannies. After reading all the reviews on Amazon I didn't see any rack that wasn't overpriced or had a fair number of bad reviews. So I finally decided on a cheap wire rack and The Original Dish Drying Mat underneath the rack I can't believe anyone would be foolish enough to spend $60 on a dish rack! This small dish rack fits well on the mat. It is easy to clean and doesn't have any nooks and crannies to catch water. I'm not sure the antibacterial coating is anything more than a marketing gimic for the coating. I recommend replacing the silverware holder with something that drains water out the bottom. Overall, this is a find rack and it's inexpensive. I don't mind if I have to replace it in 10 years. The rack and drying mat make a good set up."},{"rating":"2","title":"No...it's not as heavy as the old model....","review":"...but it is a well-made dish drainer with lots of space for dishes, cups, glasses, bowls, utensils, and the like.I bought the large model to replace a no longer needed dishwasher, and I am happily running my dishes through quickly and getting out of the kitchen. Both good things.I do agree with the other reviewers about the new silverware basket; it's not as convenient as the older design....my smaller pieces of silver need to be placed carefully to remain upright and dry spot free...but that's a quibble. Rubbermaid still makes the best dish drainer on the market....especially for those of us holdouts who prefer to hand wash their dishes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same quality as previous model, poor design too!!","review":"This is much lower quality than any Rubbermaid dishrack I've ever had. It's flimsier, and I only had it one day when the rubber film ripped at one end. The idea to make a big hole for the really, really hokey silverware caddy is awful. You can't use the space for anything but the stupidly designed caddy, because taking it off leaves a big gap. I'm thinking I'm going to get my old one back, scrub it up again, and use it, instead of this disappointing item. I always knew what I was getting with Rubbermaid before. No longer. I will never order their products unless I see them in person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact and useful","review":"I live in a one-bedroom apartment and I do have a dishwasher. I bought this as a supplement, because sometimes I just wash one or two things and leaving them on the counter is unwise. I bought this and the matching draining board.I would only change one thing about this drainer: have a place to fit cups, bowls, and forks. As it is, it has two main sections, but I think more sculpting for different types of dishes would help with the draining. It's a great product overall and saves on the dishwasher use. Additionally, it looks good and is not so large that it takes up too much counterspace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbermaid Antimicrobial Dish Drainer","review":"I ordered The Rubbermaid Antimicrobial Dish Drainer, like the one I have that needs replaced.

We bought two of them in the same order. When they arrived, the drainers were stacked carelessly and we had to untangle the side hooks in order to separate the drainers from each other. The bottom drainer had black marks on the bottom of the feet that we had to clean off before we used it. However, once we got past those packing/unpacking issues and set up the drainers, they work fine and we are pleased with them.I am glad I saved the corner utensil cups from our former drainers because this only comes with one that goes on the end (as shown), so we needed the old ones to get enough space to drain all of the utensils in a typical load of dishwashing.

Nice job Sheryl!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Deepest","review":"Sometimes, when covering a certain kind of song, it always needs to have a bit improvement, or the original version seems to take the cake. That does come with the case for Sheryl Crow. She hasn't provided any heavy covers among any of her albums, but there is always the chance to add on for the hitting parades. Her cover of the Cat Stevens classic, The First Cut Is The Deepest really is one of the few lackluster songs that Sheryl Crow has ever done. Although it is nice for the die hard Sheryl Crow fan, it doesn't seem to the actual chemistry that Rod Stewart had conjured when he did it back in the 70's. Unfortunately, it was done in two different versions by Sheryl, and neither of them had a certain chemistry, very rarely said for a Sheryl Crow Track. Hopefully, she can make a better cover song soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Her Best","review":"This CD was given a renaissance when Doubletree Hotels used 'Relax Max' in one of its commericals. When I heard Dinah insouciantly bend the word 'Reeelax' on TV, I knew there would be people under 60 all over the country surfing the 'net to find the source of that extraordinary voice. Dinah is cozily ensconced in Quincy Jones' cheeky arrangement and the result is the sophisticated sound the record companies stopped making decades ago.But that's not all. Dinah's saucy 'Is You Is, or Is You Ain't, My Baby?' is a must have in the Miss D. canon. Tack on the rarely sung Ellington/Tizol standards 'Perdido' and 'Caravan', and you have one of Dinah's best CDs. (Though the lyrics for these last two are fatuous, the compositions and the performances overcome those flaws.) Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great dittie","review":"Bought this for the song \\"Relax Max\\" which is well worth it as I only heard it on the TV advertisement for DoubleTree hotels.

The haunting lyrics serve as the foundation for this album, but the piano work, along with input from Johnny Mandel will stand forever as a masterpiece in my extensive CD collection.

You shouldn't expect any less--nor hope for any more. This album explores the true complexity of heartbreak. By writing about the range of emotions that accompany love and relationships, this Costello/Bacharach work puts today's one-dimensional pop music to shame. However, in order to truly appreciate this you may need to have the heart to do so. I give the album only 4 stars in a comparison to Costello's long list of accomplishments. When compared against the remainder of today's pop drivel, five stars simply aren't enough to do this new Costello/Bacharach collaboration justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"You must own this CD.","review":"Take a cynical--no, jaded--lyricist and pair him with a great, tragic melodist and you have the engine to move some of the most perfect pop tunes heard in years.

Bravo guys--I'll keep this one on for a long while."},{"rating":"2","title":"a dream come true for Bacharach and Costello fans","review":"For those of us who carried the torch unswervingly for both Burt and Elvis all these years, Painted From Memory can be nothing less than a complete dream come true. As marvelous as they both are, the sum of this album is truly more than the parts combined. Listen and hear both the pithiness of Costello and the sentiment of Bacharach combined and balanced, to exquisite effect.Though you can hear Elvis reaching sometimes to hit some of Burt's more demanding notes, it makes the reading of it even more poignant. On \\"Toledo,\\" you can almost hear Dionne singing it already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Burt's back with a great new musical partner!","review":"One of my favorite albums in college was a Bacharach-David collection.

Elvis mumbles from somewhere out back while the piano tinkles on remorselessly, and every now and then a braying reincarnation of the Ray Conniff singers bursts into, I guess, song, without any emotion whatsoever. A serious disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing performance from Costello and Bacharach","review":"I've heard of Elvis Costello since I was nine and when I heard he was working with Burt Bacharach I thought it would be weird, but it turns out it was amazing! The whole cd is a musically challenging album with piano solo's and orchestra selections that fit perfectly with Costello's unique voice. The back-up singers also add something different to the cd. Among my favorite song's on the cd are \\"Sweetest Punch\\" and \\"Toledo\\". If you go to a music store anytime soon buy this cd, it's easily a classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lush Music by Adults for Adults","review":"Not to sound like an old fogey (I'm 42), but I've recently despaired of finding a new pop album that appealed to my changing musical sensibilties (I find myself more & more inclined to buy Sinatra , Bennett, & the like.) Happily this CD has turned out to be a great find: a wonderfully romantic, though not sticky sweet, collection of tunes made by two seasoned masters of the pop form that adults can listen to again & again with real pleasure. Imagine 60 years of songwriting experience between Burt & Elvis, & they still sound fresh & good! Not much more to say 'cept I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The King of America moves from Nashville to California.","review":"This CD is somewhere between an all-grown-up Imperial Bedroom and a California-style King of America. All of Costello's great albums start with great songwriting and this one is no exception. The lyrics and music fit together seamlessly. Having said all that, this album would have earned a 5th star if Burt had loosened his stylistic stranglehold on the music just a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuch!!","review":"I love both Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach so I anxiously awaited this release. Frankly I couldn't wait to get rid of it after I hearing it. Perhaps I didn't give enough of a chance but Elvis' signing was pure torture. Apparently I'm in the minority given the overwhelming positive reviews I see here. \\"Incredibly disappointed\\" would be putting it nicely. It also appears that I have to give it one star becuase I'm not allowed to give it NONE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Elvis' ALL TIME WORST!","review":"In a career that outshines all the pretenders our prolific Elvis has had more than his share of clunkers. Before you is the bottom of the barrel. His ability to stretch and defy categories is admirable. Unfortunately too often he's way past his limits! Truly horrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Bacharach Album","review":"I love Burt Bcharach. I still listen to his vinyls. I have 25 records of his. Elvis Costello has ruined this album of beautiful music. HIs caterwauling, Tourette style, singing through his nose. (nasal register) usually used for comedic rolls, a vibrato in the nose, just unheard off. I could not understand a word that he sang. This was the worst singing I've ever heard, I just cringed, on first hearing. I tried to like this album. But the more I played it, the more I hated it. I wish this album was re-recorded, with a singer other then Elvis Costello, so we can appreciate the beautiful music of Burt Bacharach. Meanwhile back to the old vinyls."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a little late, but I have to bash this album...","review":"...because it sticks out in my memory as one of the most distinctly bad records I've ever purchased. I can only categorize my reaction to this album as \\"allergic.\\" After one listen I was ashamed of myself for buying this record and I could not get to the \\"Buy, Sell or Trade\\" shop to sell it back fast enough because it bothered me to even have it in my possession. Bad poetry over slow, boring music."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 fab tracks accompanied by 10 non-tunes","review":"The 2 fab tracks are THE SWEETEST PUNCH and TOLEDO. The rest is utter crap. And it's Bacharach's fault since he's the only one with any talent anyway. Costello continues to wring his precious song-lyric metaphors for all they're worth. Check out the ultra-emetic MY THIEF (or better yet, don't) with its precious girl-singer mewling about a \\"perfect alibi\\". It made me wanna fwow up all over Elvis's collection of cutesy-poo hats."},{"rating":"2","title":"It gets you right where you don't want to be gotten!","review":"A beautiful, thoughtful and graceful collection of heart-rending compositions. Bacharach and Costello seem an unlikely pair, but after hearing Costello's work on \\"The Juliet Letters\\", I should have expected something great. The whole album moves you to tears...I'd recommend it to anyone. Touching and refreshing in an age of mindless noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strangely uninvolving","review":"This CD can't help but be pleasant, but unfortunately, that's all it is. The songs just float out there and are completely uninvolving. What sounds like an intriguing pairing of artists turns into a huge question mark: Why didn't this turn out better? This album has been wildly overpraised; find some \\"real\\" Elvis instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on Elvis!","review":"I've been a faithful EC fan since I saw him on SNL in about 1979 or so, and went out the next day and bought the just-released \\"My Aim is True.\\" I think \\"Get Happy!\\", \\"King of America,\\" and some others are among the best rock/pop lps ever recorded. But I just can't take this Burt Bacharach business. These songs are so pitiful and insipid they make me sick. I try to give it the benefit of the doubt cause it is EC, but I just can't get with this thing. Come on Elvis, remember you're the angry boy, not some mushy trod-on wimp begging his lover to come back and whip him one more time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another 1 Hit CD","review":"I've tried to listen to this CD on a daily basis hoping it would grow on me, but nothing sprouted. I am a big fan of Burt Bacharach's music but I'm afraid his well has gone dry. The only memorable, outstanding song on this CD is the last one. God Give Me Stength is brilliant! Typical Bacharach melody with great lyrics by Costello. All the other tunes seem to fade away from my memory. Bacharach has a gift for writing catchy melodies, but there's nothing catchy about this collection. I wish I could say something more positive about it, but compared to so much of Bacharach's excellent work in the past, this CD is a big disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gift for the broken-hearted!","review":"Bacharach is back! And he's perfect for Elvis' tender voice. The songs on this album are the saddest ever written. This CD and some cocktails will have you sobbing your eyes out if you've got a broken heart. I had to hide it from myself, it's just too powerful. God give me strength. Thank you Burt and Elvis. What the world needs now is more real music like this. Timeless, tortured and beautiful. Just like Christina."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elvis and Burt at the top of their game!","review":"It's very rare that I can say that every track on an album contains an excellent song. In fact, I cannot remember enjoying a pop album more than Painted From Memory. An unlikely but wonderful duo of special musical talents...only negative is the CD doesn't come with the lyrics or tell you who wrote them. Rats!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harrowing, exquisite","review":"I accept some people simply can't stand Elvis' nasal adenoidal singing, but you're missing out.I'm listening to this for the 50th time, at ear-splitting volume with tears streaming down my face. The gorgeous sweet-as-honey easy-listening production intensifies the emotional hurt packed into many of the songs:\\"I'm so drowsy now, I'll unlock the door / What fades in time will hurt much more / So here's that happy scene / Where you come back to me / It's only found in fiction.\\"And \\"Those eyes I tried to capture / They are lost to me now forever / They smile for someone else\\" (the title track)Wonderful beyond any words I could add."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply a masterpiece!","review":"It is very rare when all of the planets align so perfectly to create pop magic. If you love pop music, this is the CD for you. You will never tire of listening to the wonderful melodies and heartfelt lyrics and haunting vocals. After hearing music so perfect, one can only hope that this is the first of many colaborations of these two musical geniuses. This beautiful CD is easily the best release of 1999."},{"rating":"2","title":"costello at his best, Burt- well he's always perfect.","review":"Two living legends unite- and the result is close to perfect. Flawless production & Costello's best vocal to date. You wont be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's been missing from popular music!","review":"There's is so much that is just plain musical on this cd.Lush ,inventive orchestrations,songs that sound composed,not like they were written in five minutes.From the first chord,it's like a pleasant reuinion.This Cd will probably get zero airplay because there really isn't anything like it being made today.I can only hope that this is the start of something great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Album of the year. No doubt.","review":"Absolutely brilliant songwriting. The arrangements are classic Bacharach and the lyrics are inspired Costello. In the future someone will probably re-record this CD and substitute Elvis' voice with a Dionne Warwick/Luther Vandross impersonator and it will be a huge hit with the public. Popular taste will usually gravitate towards a sweet, milk chocolate essence. But I will always prefer Elvis' plaintive, tortured voice. This album is pure bittersweet chocolate for my melancholy soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Star Album You Don't See Coming","review":"On first exposure the songs seem like a heavy meal with their dense orchestrations, Burt Bacharach's signature stop and go rhythms and Elvis Costello's opaque, barroom syntax. The overall effect could be extremely pretentious. Over time, however, after repeating listening, the rush of the songs' emotional climaxes have great depth and an eerie simplicity about them.Burt Bacharach appeared to be attempting something truly original and different from his smash hits of the past. I, for one, believe that he succeeded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hasn't Held My Attention","review":"THERE ARE A FEW GOOD TRACKS ON THIS, ESPECIALLY THE FIRST 2, ESPECIALLY \\"TOLEDO,\\" BUT OF ALL E.C.'S RECENT STUFF, THIS IS THE LEAST COMPELLING. WHICH SURPRISED ME -- I HAD HIGH HOPES AND AM ALMOST ALWAYS UNCRITICAL OF ANYTHING HE PUTS OUT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I was unaware of this collaboration however once I stumbed upon it I became intriqued. Burt Bacharach's formula for beautiful music makes him a timeless producer along with Mr. Costello's writing makes this CD more enjoyable with each listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Hal David when you need him?","review":"I first heard of this CD on an National Public Radio interview. It sounded like it had great potential, which unfortunately it did not live up to.While some of the music is interesting and Mr.Costello does an OK job, the lyrics are just plain awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"HILARIOUS!","review":"I\`m not usually a movie fan but this is brilliant. I think Frank Grogan (Peter Caffrey) stole the show as he played brilliantly the role of the worlds most talkative hostage! Brendan Gleeson and Peter McDonald also put up excellent displays. By far the funniest scene as pointed out below is when Bunny and Git are breaking into the house in the forest.I nearly wet myself with laughter at that scene!"},{"rating":"2","title":"offbeat dialogue","review":"I happened to see \\"I went down\\" on French cable TV and loved it. I guess you would categorize it as a comedy crime caper movie. A triumph of underplaying by Peter McDonald. The best thing is the dialogue, sharply observed, offbeat and deadpan. Paddy Breathnacht delivers the story in a series of chapters with witty titles. Seemingly pointless snippets of dialogue are unforgettable:GIRL: Do you ever talk?GIT: yer...GIRL: What sort of things do you say?GIT: I say things like, shall we go to the shops?...Or the conversation between Bunny and Git about America...wonderful!Brendon Gleeson's part is very similar to his role in \\"the General\\".Having searched unsuccessfully for DVD version, I had to order a second hand VHS from a store in the US, fortunately it works find on my (French) multistandard vhs player."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny irish low-level thugs","review":"a good straightforward, funny, low-budget, crime buddy-movie comedy. it's about a kid who comes out of prison and gets into a mess, and then another one. not for kids -- the title's intended as a double-entendre. but it's sweet and funny. brendan gleeson is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bargain","review":"We bought this online and got a better price then what we found locally. Very happty with product and was just what we wanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks great and cleans easy!","review":"This high chair is a great buy. First of all it looks nice and goes well with our other furniture. Secondly it is so EASY to clean. The seat cushion comes on and off in seconds and is mashine washable. Some other brands that my friends have you just have to wipe down (and you can never get everything out of all those crevasses) Also the tray insert is great. You just take it out and carry the mess over to the sink. It is also dishwasher safe. That is much better than others where you need to remove the whole bulky tray or like the PegPerego where you can't remove the tray at all!The only negative I have read in other reviews was that it only had 3-point straps vs five. I have not found this to be a problem at all, in fact my son hates sitting in other chairs where he can barely move.I rcommend this to anyone who wants the easiest highchair to use and clean"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible and unsafe highchair","review":"I first got this highchair because I liked the wood and I thought it was sturdy and attractive. WELL, I just had to go out and buy another one (BabyTrend Malawi which I love), because the EB one is just impossible. My one year old daughter kept climbing out of it and almost falling because it has no chest harness! And it is very high off the ground. The Babytrend one can be lowered to almost ground level and has chest straps to keep her safely in it.I suppose if you have a calm baby who doesn't move around or climb then it would be an ok choice, but I couldn't leave her in it for a second."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent choice!","review":"I originally wanted to purchase another high chair, but when I did some research I found that it was not generally favored. After some investigation I came across the Eddie Bauer chair and decided to purchase it. I could not be happier. It is sturdy, good quality and comes in some great prints. You may pay a little more but it's absolutely worth it. I definitely recommend this high chair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great High Chair","review":"I had an extremely hard time finding any information about this high chair prior to my purchase, but am very satisfied! There are 4 tray settings, a \\"cubby\\" under the seat to store bibs and washcloths, 2 parent-assist trays to keep the feeding bowl out of the child's reach and a removable top tray for easy cleaning. The chair pad comes off easily for washing as well. Although the seat does not recline, I really like that the tray (on its smallest setting) fits snugly up to my 7 month old's chest - allowing less mess in his lap. I highly recommend this high chair!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not for young babies","review":"As first time parents, we didn't really know what to look for in a high chair. This high chair is very pretty, but not very functional. It doesn't lean back. Unless your child is already sitting on his own this is not the chair for you. Also-NONE of the suction cup toys will stick to the tray. We are looking to buy a better chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Chair is the worst chair ever","review":"I was encouraged to buy this chair because my sister in law told me that I would get sick of looking at a colorful highchair and the wooden one would look great in my kitchen. She also told me that I would never need a chair that reclines. Well, my 5 month old has been eating solids for a month now and I still feed him in the bouncy chair. This chair does not recline, so he tends to slouch and and gets food every where. Since you can't just wipe the cusion down, I have to wash it. I'm selling this crappy chair and getting a funtional chair that reclines, wipes clean and has adjustable hieght."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Functional","review":"I bought this chair as a first time mom and not thinking about the time i would have to get things done. This chair once you start feeding your child solid foods is a waste of time. If your child is like any other infant the food does not stay in their mouths but goes everywhere else including the seat cover. So that means you have to either vacuum the seat, take it off and shake it out or if its really dirty you have to wash it. That means you then have to dry it. WHO HAS THE TIME!!!! not me. I can not recommend this seat to anyone. if i still had the box i would be taking it back.Also, when you first start using the chair your child is not ready to sit upright right away. this chair does not give you the ability to recline at all. we constantly had to adjust our daughter so that she would be sitting upright and not falling to either side. doesn't make for a happy and enjoyable feeding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Condition","review":"This High Chair was a gift, when they opened the box it was scratched, dented and not packed well at all. My friends had to return it to the origional store and get another one. This was VERY inconvient especially since she was 9 months pregnent. I was Not happy at all..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The chair looks great, but very hard to clean.","review":"I really like how the chair looks, that it's narrow, that the tray that can be put in the dishwasher, and the little compartment in the back that we put bibs in. But it's Horrible to clean! You can use the cover and you'll have to wash it every time it's used if you have a messy toddler like I do. Or you can take the cover off but food sticks really bad to the wood and after scrubbing the wood so much it starts to fade and look bad. I would prefer the high chair come with a plastic pad so it can be wiped down easily. If I could do it over again I would NOT buy this high chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money Highchair","review":"This highchair is absolutely horrible. I registered for it because of its looks, and Oh, boy...bad, bad, move. It doesn't recline, the space where the baby sits is too small and can't be adjusted! If your baby grows and still needs to sit in it, forget it. His knees will get stuck. It's a hassle to move it from place to place and it's got the worse buckles ever. I ended up buying The First Years Reclining 4 Stages Feeding Seat, which I highly recommend. It doesn't take up space in your kitchen because it is strapped onto a regular chair and it has the same functions as any highchair. Best invention ever. Big frustration this Eddie Bauer Monstruous Thing. Trust me, please: Don't buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased.","review":"I have a 4 month old who has been eating solids for a month due to GERD. The chair is a bit big for her (15lbs)but that just gives her room to grow into it. There aren't any bells and whistles with this chair, but it is sturdy and in my opinion safe. The buckles are a bit too large, but like I said she is small to be in a highchair anyway. Overall we are happy with the cleanup and sturdy build of this chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"hazard","review":"I love this chair for its style. However my daughter's leg was trapped between the front side slat and it became red-purple swollen. She was in extreme pain trying to free her and 10 minutes of ice and dishsoap did I manage to free her. The velcro to secure pad scraches her legs everytime and the buckle is very annoying to use. It is located on the bottom of the seat when my baby sits, annoying. This chair can be a hazard and Eddie Bauer shouldv'e made it better in many ways!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST!!!","review":"This high chair is a disaster. It is so heavy it takes two people to move it from the kitchen to the dining room table. It is impossible to clean without q-tips. My daughter is uncomfortable in it, as the back has no recline at all. I bought it because I wanted a non-plastic high chair, and this was the only option. I wish I didn't. Plus, the seat cover is machine washable, but who wants to wash it after every meal? I stopped using the safety harness because it was such a pain and bothered my daughter. Also, the plastic tray top that pops off for easy cleaning, was found out by my daughter when she was around 7 months old, and she would pick it up (with her dinner on it) so that got stored in the pantry. We lost a couple of dinners on the \\"feature\\".

First the paper it's printed on is some horrible recycled junk that is only fit for text. Second the black and white photos (all are B&W) almost all have poor lighting and contrast. They may have looked good on the computer when they were editing it but by the time they were printed cheaply on cheap paper they are completely unacceptable.

Died after 9 months.- Nokia's warranty is slow and unfriendly- Only supports Bluetooth 1.1Once you start using bluetooth, you will never want to place another handset to your ear. Unfortunately, most bluetooth headsets have problems with call quality, connection or fit. I guess its time to start looking at devices that support the new Bluetooth 2.0.

Actually, I found it to a pretty nice fit. It works fine at home and the voice command system on my phone picks up all of my commands. Once you get in the car and start driving it all goes down the toilet. I guess it picks up too much background noise or something, but it absolutely will not recognize my voice commands.

Good potential but needed refining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Another Headache","review":"I just got done playing a demo for Charlie And The Chocolate Factory. Let me tell you, this game is a headache on a disk. First, lets start off with the basics.Sound- The whole time you are playing this game, you hear these noises. Not normal noises, but weird dripping chocolate noises. The music is annoying and repeats constantly.Gameplay- This game is based around a big factory, with chocolate oozing and more. It is like one big puzzle. Unlock one part to get to the next. Not really anything mind blowing.Controls- This is why I hated the game. The controls are horrible. You are in this weird 3rd person camera and it switches and fliks every time you jump or run. Possibly the worst controls ever.Overall, this is a good game, but I wouldnt reccomend for over the age of 12.

Unfortunately this CD was issued before Billy Vera became involved with the reissue program of Specialty material. The sound is strangely 'muddy' and way too compressed, which gives the tracks a tunnel echo effect which simply isn't on the original tapes. If you want to hear Larry Williams how he should be heard in crystal clear sound, invest your cash in the UK Ace CD \\"The Bad Boy Of Rock'n'Roll\\" (CDCHD 709) or better still, chase up the 47 track 2CD set on Ace - \\"Larry Williams At His Finest\\" (CDCHD2 1021).

He has good articulation in his legs (which are his arms when he combines with Inferno), and his arms are still good but not as articulated as the legs. He has a simple transformation. His accessories are cool too, coming with a gun with a firing missile that shoots a little less than a yard and also a strange sort of cutting tool. Overall, Hot-Shot is a really great transformer, and worth the money to add to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"ENERGON HOT SHOT","review":"AS A ENERGON FAN SO FAR THIS IS ONE OF THE BETTER ONES OUT THERE.

Although it is a far cry from her sister book, The Giver, the people in Kira's world do not know what real \`love' is. There is secrecy being shielded from the watchful peoples' eyes. The book does not move too fast, nor does it move too slowly.

The title track sounds as if they simply played some musical phrases and then just put the output through a series of granular synthesizers, switching them on and off. It's a cheap trick that anybody with some knowledge of the tools involved can pull off. The main trick is to totally let go of any preconceived musical notion one might have had before. Locking yourself up for a few days in a room with the only sound being white noise might just help with that, I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"Gantz Graf is mostly a misstep for an otherwise excellent band. The first two tracks, especially the title track, are annoying drill and glitch messes, basically incoherent and pointless. Looking back, I realize that it was this release that put me off Autechre for about a decade, thinking they'd finally gone off the deep end. Luckily, I heard good things about Oversteps and am now back-filling my collection with all the intervening albums. Still, this is really bad, although the final track partially redeems the release with an amazing buildup of speed and intensity. Skip it unless you're a completist."},{"rating":"2","title":"gantz graf","review":"This is one of autechre's best if not their best ep. EP7 is full length and practically an album so I dont really include that. But fans of later autechre ought to add this essential item to their collection. The title track at first seems a bit jarring, but after listening a few times, it is actually in 4/4 and one of their more interesting tracks. Dial cant be described except as awesome and CAP IV is some serious Autechresc epic."},{"rating":"1","title":"truly awful","review":"The emperor not only doesn't have any clothes, he left town years ago.

Individually they all certainly have talent but collectively they were such a great band.

If you like this check out some of their earlier albums (CD's)."},{"rating":"2","title":"JAPAN BUT NOT JAPAN","review":"Everyone on this album who wasn't David Sylvian was apparently upset that it wasn't released under the 'Japan' trademark.

It's still an incredible album, and a crucial addition to any serious Japan/Sylvian collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love Donald!!!","review":"I am just about the biggest Donald O'Connor fan and was ecstatic to find a bio all about him.

He said it was all crap, but I'd beg to differ! I sat down and read it in one afternoon. Andrew Tomas presents so many ideas that, if you really take the time to think about it, coincide perfectly with current scientific knowledge. He makes his case, saying that we can't possibly be the first race to have lived on Earth. How else could the pyramids have been built with such perfect precision with their technology, or how could ancient philosophers have known the Earth was a sphere, or that there were planets beyond Saturn?

Bought two SongBooks for myself and one as a gift for my father-in-law. Really not happy with these radios. The sound is mediocre at best and I would say better for listening to talk radio than music. The blue SongBook (I bought red and blue ones) has the worst sticky finish on it and its impossible to clean and feels disgusting to pick up. The REAL reason I have to give it such a low rating is failure rate. One of mine died completely and had to be shipped back to Tivoli. My father-in-laws did the same thing and they blamed it on a faulty power cord but would not ship him a new one until he shipped them the radio and cord for assessment (and the courier charge was not covered).Finally, don't let these radios sit in the sun as they overheat and shut down. We use them by our pool but have to put them in the shade under a chair or else they fail in about 30 minutes.I would not buy another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would give no stars if I could","review":"Case is decomposing after a few years.

The knobs and buttons has a solid built feel and overall we're pleased with its clean aesthetics and performance. HOWEVER, like the other reviews, the rubberized finish on the case can be an issue. Within a year of owning the Songbook, dust began to stick on the case and when attempting to clean the case, it only spread the dust/grime around in a sticky mess. I would still recommend the Songbook for its great sound and clean lines but you might want to opt for the \\"glossy case\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice way to listen to ipod","review":"Great tuner.

But I needed a clock radio with an alarm, and it just so happens that sometimes I can't sleep and so in the middle of the night I turn on the radio--BBC and better news and all that. Believe it or not, that cancels the alarm. Once you set the alarm, that's it for the Songbook for the night. Then there's the problem that if you just leave the radio on all night, it's the radio frequency that takes up most of the readout. The time is teenyweeny in the corner of the display. I pretty much know what station I'm listening to without looking, but I might want to know what time it is in the middle of the night. Like I said, buy it for the radio, not the clock."},{"rating":"1","title":"the lid of the earphone's part in the ear fell off","review":"the sound is clear, but the lid of the earphone's part in the ear fell off several days ago, So it is very comfortable to use it now and I don't think the processing quality is good enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"not working with Nokia 6350","review":"the headset is not working with my nokia 6350. its waste of time and money..don't buy for similar hand set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Headset not compatible with Nokia E71x","review":"I ordered two of these headsets for two different Nokia E71x phones.

No one else had mentioned the landscape portion of the software, so I didn't really know what to expect. I'm sure this program is fine if you want to design a house, or an addition to your house, but if you desire lanscaping software, pass. The plant library is very small and does not include many common landscaping plants, and you can forget about finding something exotic or unusual.

It's hard to believe that the graduate has succeeded in attaining a degree in conducting as he asks rather dim-witted questions on the subject and often gives answers of the same quality. All this just provides a set-up for the \\"director's\\" advice. We're also given some rather unnecessary details about food, driving, etc.Nevertheless, I pushed through the annoyance of the pros because Bertalot has invaluable pratical advice for choral directors, born largely from his passion and determination with the discipline.

Gary's best assest is his biggest problem, the fact that he is a terrific researcher. Such is not the case with this latest entry.The New Age movement is a complicated mass of false religious systems dating back to the Tower of Babel. Gary takes them as a whole and shows the reader exactly where this system is headed. From the religious and social implications to the political and environmental, Gary's research shows us that we are closer to anti-Christian upheaval in the name of peace than we ever thought.What's most interesting is the Catholic tie in. Gary proves that Catholicism has, right now, the inside track to being the official religious arm of the U.N.

I used it for my first baby, and I maybe used it 5 times and the handle clicked out of place and wouldn't ever pump right after that. It also leaked really bad when the milk would go down into the tunnel to go in the bottle. It wouldn't go all the way down instead it would leak down my breast. It hurt my hand so bad to pump. I would get the amount of milk I needed but it took forever, and I would have to keep pushing the handle back in place. I am difinitley getting a new. When I look at the price of this thing it makes me sick that I spent that much on it. I wish I could give it 0 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"I actually just threw this across the room. This is my 3rd baby / third time pumping.

I hate throwing this away...such a waste but I can't take it anymore!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WOULD NOT RECOMMEND","review":"My old Avent Isis that my sister loaned to me broke, so I went out looking for a replacement. I selected this Evenflo pump, because it seemed to look the most like the Isis. Apparently, all pumps are NOT created equal. When I used to pump with the Isis, my milk came out so easily, quickly, and with no discomfort. With this one, after about 20 minutes I had only one ounce out of each, my hand was so tired, and I was sore. Didn't seem to matter which setting I had it on, or whether I had the horn insert in or not. It also recommended hand expressing to begin with, before I began pumping...but didn't really think that was practical, since most of the time I will be using this in public bathrooms, while my little one is at home with Dad. I went online and spent the extra $ to order a new Avent Isis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't even work as a temporary pump","review":"I ordered a fancy electric pump online and needed something to get me by for the 10 days it would take for the pump to arrive.

Basically, I spent $2 per use for this piece of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Pump","review":"The pump has poor suction compared to a very old Pur manual model my wife was using.

Avoid if possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality - don't waste your money","review":"If I had purchased this pump first I may have never known how bad it was. The pump I've been using for 5 months broke but it at least worked wonderfully before then. I bought the evenflo pump b/c it was the least expensive one I could find. Well, you get what you pay for. Please, please, please do not buy this pump. Even on the max suction it still has less than half the pumping power as my first one. New mommies: you do not want this pump."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pump!","review":"I actually had purchased a more expensive brand of manual pump, but after 3 days of using it at work, it broke! So I ran out and purchased this one and I love it. I actually get better suction with this one and paid less than half of what I did for the other one. I love that it comes with a little black bag to store the pump in and makes it easier to bring it to and from work everyday. The suction dial is nice so that I can start pumping on an easier setting and then increase it to help production. I got 4 oz in 10 minutes, no problem. It's also quiet and while I would never say that I could operate it one-handed, the contoured handle kept my hand from tiring out so much.Love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good pump","review":"okay, so I've never owned a pump before, but this one sucks.

I wish I could return it. It's horribly made, impossible to clean and very uncomfortable. the handle doesn't swivel so you actually have to break the seal to move it around.

Since I didn't anticipate using it much I thought it was a good idea to spend less and this one was cheaper than some of the other manual pumps. Within four uses the seal broke and it no longer had enough suction. I returned it for another and the second one lasted about twice as long before it went back to the store. I ended up with an Avent Isis and am completely loving it. Totally worth spending the extra $15 or so for. And, I actually like it better than my electric pump!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This pump sucks... Because it doesn't suck!","review":"This pump has a dial that is supposed to be able to increase or decrease the amount of suction applied but there is no difference between the lowest and highest settings. After a few uses it becomes noisy, and by that I mean it clicks and squeeks. And this sound is coming from who knows where since the handle assembly itself is not easily taken apart without breaking it. It was extremely difficult to extract much, if any milk with this flimsy pump since most of my time was spent putting the thing back together. I do not recommend the purchase or attempted use of this product. It may be priced attractively but it is not worth the frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy this hand pump","review":"I went out of town and forgot my breast pump. I bought this pump for about twenty bucks. It took 30 minutes to pump 2 oz. I hand expressed the milk instead. My breasts were FULL and it could not pump hardly anything.

I have the Medela hand pump and it is wonderful. do not buy this pump get the medela"},{"rating":"2","title":"great for the price","review":"I'm used to my electric pump, but a piece broke so I had to go out and by a manual. I found this one for super cheap. The time I used it I hated it, I thought I bought a hunk-o-junk. But I've used it a bunch of times since that first time and now I love it. It's a great little product for the price. It's cheaply made but does the trick. Yes it takes longer and is alot of work, but it got the same amount of milk out that my electric one does. So overall I like this pump and is perfect for when I'm on the go and dont want to haul my electric one. But the Evenflo pads that come with it are terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't pump, just breaks over and over and over...","review":"I bought this as a travel pump for a cruise I am going on so that I don't have to bring my huge electric double pump. Thankfully, I decided to try it out on an overnight wedding last weekend and after I put the bottle on the pump and tried to use it, the bottle would pop off every time I tried to depress the handle. Then I finally got my hand in a position to not put pressure on the bottle which is almost impossible because that is where the tork goes to offset the pump handle and the whole handle mechanism fell apart. I was so determined to make it work I fought with it for a good 30 minutes. I have no idea how this item could have actually gone into production because it doesn't work at all. This isn't even a matter of it being a bad item, it should actually be recalled because it doesn't even stay together much less work. I could use my hand and a ziplock with better results. =("},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"Product totally useless, it worked fine for about 3 weeks and then it crashed into pieces.

Quite accurate after break-in","review":"The Seiko \\"Orange Monster\\" has quite a following, and deservedly so. It is a substantial, strong, durable, and accurate dive watch that costs peanuts compared to many others. Mine was delivered promptly, and started gaining about a minute a day, but has since settled down to about +15 sec. per day which is quite acceptable. The Luminescent is amazing. By far the brightest, longest lasting I have encountered. The movement is smooth and quiet, and I particularly like the way Seiko recessed the crystal so it is protected from scratches and abrasion. The domed crystal also makes it easier to read under water. Another notable feature is the quality of the bracelet. Very sturdy with fat bars and the diver extension is a nice touch. Bracelets with push button releases are much better too. This one has it all. Just amazing how Seiko can put this all together for such a low price. Anybody who likes watches should have one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Winding Does not Last for Long","review":"This is a nice looking watch, with a real \\"man\\" feel, but unless you will be wearing it every day for the whole day (for self-winding), you will need to set the time again every time you wear it, since the \\"wind life\\" does not last long. I still like the watch, but am surprised it has such high reviews with this issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Orange Monster!!!","review":"Not much more I can say that haven't been said already, but I'll add a few of my observations anyway.-Love the drilled lugs. They make it sooooo much easier to change straps/bracelets.-Everything looks and feels like quality, especially for a $200 watch.-Love how the bezel feels. Never turned a bezel on a more expensive watch, but I don't see how it can feel much better.-Only timed it for one day and seemed to lose 1-2 seconds in just over a 24hr period.-Lume is awesome.A few gripes, not enough to take a way a star.-Not a neg, but I would rather the entire watch and bracelet be brushed.-Bezel and dial are off by a hair. You can even see it in the pic.I've been on a watch buying spree this year. Orient mako, Deep Blue AP Diver, Citizen NY2300, G-Shock (stormtooper mudman, dw5600, awg 101)and finally the Orange Monster. Other than the awg 101 which I wear at home and on weekends, this is my new favorite watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Watch for Hard Knocks - NO FEAR !!!","review":"Owned this watch since 2006.This is my Amoured TANK! I use it on road trips where there is a possibility of it being banged around a lot.I leave my $2000 TAG HEUER watch at home and I use this Seiko watch to the beach, swimming pools, SCUBA diving so far to 90 feet (along with my Dive Computer) and hiking trails and even when doing an oil changes on my car. I have banged it on to rocks on land and coral underwater with minimal to no evidence of damage!!!It may run fast but at this day and age one depends on the Dive Computer rather than the olden days using the bezel on this watch and Dive table to calculate dive time. So up-to-the-second accuracy is not paramount.This is a heavy watch so if your wrists aren't used to heavy items then do not get this watch.. .Otherwise *machomen* will not have any regrets wearing this watch... 8-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"Had heard great things about this watch.

I got it because my friend has a Black Monster and he really liked the Orange one as well as I did, so I purchased it. I work at night and the glow in the dark markings for the digits are not bright enough for me to see well. This is the only reason I am giving the 4 star rating. Other than that the watch is large, heavy duty, nice time piece. I love the stainless steel watch band. I had to have the band shortened, but was able to do so at a local Jewelry Store and only cost me $3.oo . The orange face makes the watch easy to read and is a great conversation piece. I did not purchase the watch because of its water resistance to 200 meters, although this is a great feature. I just wanted a good name brand, with time, day, and date features. I did not want all that other chrono, stop watch, alarm, etc... features on a watch.My ORANGE MONSTER ROCKS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my Orange Monster","review":"I have had my orange monster for 3 yrs now.

I do not have anything bad to say about this watch, it's not heavy underwater, it is a divers watch. I expect this watch to keep time just as well as my 1985 Seiko quartz 150 divers, which still works fine just lost glow in dial. Forget Rolex submariner, omega seamaster and all those other high dollar dive duplicates. Seiko in my mind is the best value for the money. You will not even come close to finding a watch of this caliber in this price range with other brand name time pieces. I own a Rolex Daytona but find myself wanting to wear the orange monster. Rolex is the investment, Seiko is the work horse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Orange Boogy Monster","review":"this is an excellent watch, i did my research on a nice watch that did not break the bank and for two weeks i kept coming back to this watch, the more i looked at it the more i liked it and the more i iked it the more i started to want it and start collecting the monster line. The blue one is a super nice one also but so rare you would pay top dollar for one.Anyways, in conclusion to my experience with this watch is that so far its kept time consistent, i have not noticed any seconds added or slowed so to me seems to be excellent. the weight of it feels good and the size is perfect, not to mention Orange just happens to be one of my favorite colors.Buy it before the price starts to increase and they are all gone, you will not be disapointed.About amzon shipping, i ordered it on late Wednesday night, i wanted it as fast as possible so i paid an extra 8 dollars to have it by Friday."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good","review":"I just got this watch about a week ago. I haven't worn it that much because it's a little tight on my wrist. So far, it's beautiful and I'm very happy with it. I've ordered some extra links for the band. Once I get the band adjusted I'll start wearing the watch more often and write a longer review.At this point, I like the watch and would recommend it. The most striking feature so far is the luminescent hands and markings. They glow very bright in any amount of light.The fit and finish of the watch is also top notch.

This watch does it all for sub $200, it performs as good as your Doxa, Submariner, Planet Ocean, etc... so save your hard earned $$$ and buy this watch for your water activities and outdoors. You hit it, scratch it, drop it, however, for the little price you paid you'll come to appreciate it more.Kudos for Seiko, this watch's worth every PENNY! buy one for all your activities (working around the house, Hicking, Diving, Waterskiing, whatever else you do and save your \\"Rollie\\" clean and ready for your Soiree)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Self winding design is very poor","review":"This watch is self winding and won't last between wearings.

There's even a \\"cult following\\" I heard! Yes, it is a handsome timepiece that makes me look mucho macho, but its inaccuracy is just too much (1 minute a day!) its wind-up charge is only about half a day, and its crown gets all weak and flexible after about a copule of weeks. Yeah, and true to what soem people say, it does stop totally once in a while for an hour or so even if you use it 24/7. Im not being unfair in reviewing this watch bit as objective as I can. I have two other Seiko automatic watches that are (one diver the other a 5 model) that I had for about 5 years now that keep good time plus or minus only 10 seconds a day, and can keep a charge for more than two days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seiko Monster is a bad watch for me.

Yeah maybe I am spreading the word about my faulty Seiko Monster but that's the TRUTH and I want others to know that my Seiko Monster was defective. At least Im not a dumb fanatic Seiko Monster cultist who idolizes this watch with a candle-lit shrine, chants, and ritual. For crying out loud, it's just a watch, an inanimate spiritless object, that does not have feelings or civil rights! But it did hurt that I wasted $150 for this bad watch. I dont care about giving the watch a chance, regulating, breaking it in, etc. What happened to my Seiko Monster is that it stopped, which is not good, so I returned for an exchange."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT watch!","review":"An excellent buy at a great price. Comfortable on the wrist (after a minor adjustment to the bracelet length), accurate timepiece, attractive, and easy to read under any light. (and without light, too!) As others have suggested before me, buy this watch with the bracelet. If you prefer the rubber strap, that would be easy and cheap enough to replace at a local shop, but buying a replacement bracelet will be much more expensive and difficult to accomplish. I could wear it either way, but much prefer the bracelet. Others may have complained about the watch stopping too soon after taking it off, but I wear mine 12-16 hours each day (at a desk job) and it never stops running. A rugged, yet classy-looking timepiece. You could do better, for a whole lot more $$, but this is a great watch and a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"Equal to my Swiss watches.

It does not keep accurate time, it gains minutes a day no matter what. Also I can not set the watch accurately. The last postion of the stem, the hack setting does not work. Once I have worn the watch for a few hours the second hand will not stop when I pull on the stem. I even purchased an automatice winder to see if this would help, it did not. So for accurate time keeping and setting I have to wear one of my other watches. I do not expect the accuracy of a quartz movement, but minutes a day means I have to set it each day just to have a semblane of the correct time. I love the style, the face and the bracelet, but not the time keeping which is what I buy a watch for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another ecstatic Orange Monster wearer","review":"The perfect watch? Maybe. But only if you want/need a dive watch, traditional design without bizarre gimmicks, world-class construction, stainless steel band, both day and date display, automatic winding, freedom from batteries, a bezel that rises slightly above the tough crystal to make it harder to scratch it against objects, cool sweeping second hand, incredible glow-in-the-dark readability, legendary Seiko accuracy and reliability, very affordable price, very cheerful orange color -- I could go on and on. And someday I will. When I have enough time.Actually, it's a lot easier to name the few things that could possibly be improved. If I can think of any. Yep. Yepper. Yepperino.Oh yeah: the crystal isn't sapphire. Then again, everyone says that sapphire doesn't scratch: it shatters. So let's skip that one.

I wear it pretty much every day. I wanted a rugged watch for work, and it fits the bill. The only criticism I would have is that I wish the bracelet were wider and thicker. I would like to see this watch with a 24 mm band, and thicker, like the Seiko pilot watch, SNA series, maybe 4mm. But, overall, it's a great watch, especially at this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent watch","review":"Very nice diver watch. Fast delivery from the seller.

I own quite a few automatic and manual wind watches and this is the easiest to read and set when it stops. My watch tends to run about a minute fast each week which is fine with me. I'd rather have it run a little fast than slow. This is a big, clunky watch that you will not grow tired of."},{"rating":"2","title":"great value for the money!","review":"Really, everything everybody says about this watch is true. Tremendous value for the money! feels much more expensive than it is.

Don't be scared by the \\"monster\\". This is my favorite watch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its Legen - wait for it - dary!!","review":"I have owned my OM for just over a year now and its my daily wear watch. I like the look and it has great wrist presence. From a WIS point of view, this watch has an almost legendary status. It keeps good time and has worked well for me. I am usually about 3-5sec a day slow but that's certainly acceptable to me. The fact that this is an automatic movement made completely in house makes this a steal for under $200. This watch is my first Seiko and my first automatic, but it won't be my last!If you are on the fence about this watch, BUY IT!

It is only the doors for the cabinet in the picture.

However, if you want the cabinet, the entire set is approx. $800. This isn't worth that much money. The doors that arrived are not even a realistic cherrywood color. They are very cheap looking and the glass doors are painted grey around the glass, which does not go with the fake wood color, or any wood color for that matter. Just be aware that this is not what it seems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive","review":"While this book does not contain any new information about the Nag Hammadi texts not covered in other books, it does contain the whole story of their discovery in Egypt along with some of the more important gnostic myths. If you aren't familiar with Christian gnosticism, it is a great place to start your study. If you are, having both the discovery of the texts and a brief description of the gnostic belief system in one volume can be very useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Introduction to the subject, good refresher for the more advanced reader.","review":"Dr Meyer's book is wisely titled for it not only provides an interesting and engaging narrative of the discovery and publication of the Nag Hammadi texts, it will be helpful to those seeking to discover in Gnosis a deeper and more personal spirituality. The first part of the book provides an adequate history of the origin, discovery and publication of the Nag Hammadi Gnostic writings. In the second part of the book, Meyer gives a brief analysis of the entire contents of the Nag Hammadi library, along with selected quotes from the documents themselves. This is a good, basic introduction to modern Gnostic studies. Seasoned readers on the subject will find it excellent reading as well. Thank you, Marvin Meyer, for a well written book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stories that need to be heard!!","review":"I haven't finished reading this yet, but like it so far.

This is what my wife and I did: we read \\"trucks that sweep the?\\" and then our boy will say \\"street\\"!!!

Susan Egan as Belle especially makes me wish Paige O'Hara had reprised her role. Egan is given a beautiful new song all her own (\\"Home\\"), but often tries too hard and ends up sounding artificial to me. Gaston, too, was better in the movie; although \\"Me\\" is a good enough song that it masks his shortcomings, elsewhere he sounds like he's overacting. So does Terrence Mann as Beast. Though Robbie Benson had few lines to sing in the movie, I felt he rendered them much better than Mann - more naturally. My feeling is that the entire cast sounds as if it could lighten up a bit and just be themselves a bit more, and the whole thing would sound less like an obvious stage production and more like a story flowing out naturally."},{"rating":"2","title":"not as good as the australian cast recording","review":"if u want real vocal talent check out the 1995-96 australian cast recording....the beast can actually sing! unlike terrance mann who sounds like hes having a hard time squeezing the notes out..........and the ensemble all together put chills on the back of my neck.........especially in be our guest,transformation and the finale........AMAZING..........and the lumier on this album is fantastic! also starring hugh jackman as gastonwho is also fantastic! a must have for all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Beauty and the Beast is total family entertainment.

There are nine songs here that were not in the animated Disney movie. David Ogden Stiers (Winchester from MASH, Cogsworth in the animated movie) narrates the prologue and his voice is extremely sensuous! The cast works perfectly together and the magic comes through in the music. I am a little surprised that The Transformation (Home reprise) didn't become more popular as a wedding song:\\"We are homeWe are where we shall be foreverTrust in meFor you know I wont run awayFrom todayThis is all that I needAnd all that I need to say is...Don't you know how you've changed meStrange how I fin'lly seeI found homeYou're my homeStay with me\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD.

(\\"Ladies Night\\" is NOT disco...even if it is a nice 'club' song. Neither is a REMIXED version of \\"You're the One that I want\\"..which wasn't disco to begin with regardless of vintage.)I would say this is the nadir of the \\"Pure Disco\\" series..this one's only for diehards.

Percy's song \\"Please send me someone to love\\" is revered on the same level as Johnny Ace's \\"Pledging my love\\" and Charles Browns \\" Black Night\\". Please send me someone to love is a pure classic in another sense- It was the first song to hint at us all being one race-the human race-and in a subtle way protesting racism.

Plus the rating on this item was good too. I ended up using this as not only household cleaner but garden spray also! Great bottle! Heavy duty enough for stronger chemicals that don't clog :) If you've ever tried mixing dish soap in water to get rid of garden pests, you'll know that the soap seems to always clog the spray nozzle- but not with this one! I bought the bottle set, gave some away to friends/family & will definitely reorder if I ever need more! Just wish it came in a variety of colors for different purposes but a permanent markers works too."},{"rating":"1","title":"bottles are not clear","review":"The bottles I got were larger than the image and had large tacky scissor patterns on them. I guess I wouldn't care if I were planning on using them at a salon, but that is not the case. I ended up giving them away because I needed clear ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as described","review":"The bottles work fine, but they are certainly not clear and look nothing like the product pictured. The bottles I received are more opaque, taller, have a black top/spray nozzle and have scissors printed all around the bottle. One of the main reasons I chose these spray bottles was that they were described as clear and pictured as such. Not so. Pretty disappointing. The design does not scratch off and takes more than one layer of paint to cover. As I am just using these in my home, it is not critical that the bottles are clear, but if I had purchased them for business, they would have not been usable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after a while","review":"I loved them at first. I bought them because I'm deployed and needed bottles to use for the communal showers. After about a month or so of use the spray handle depresses and you can't use it. Not sure if it's the bleach/water used or it's just a cheap product."},{"rating":"2","title":"The HAT!","review":"I really wanted to be a sexy sherlock last Halloween. So this year I finally ordered it. I thought it was pretty funny that this is a manufactured costume. Do that many people really want to dress up as a sexy female Sherlock Holmes? (more on this later)I bought a large and the fit was good. The material is polyester but it looks and feels better than you would expect. little to big on top but the cape covers that. I was disappointed in the hat. It was too big and didn't have all four flaps like the deerstalker is supposed to. The magnifying glass does not look like the one in the picture but it gets the point across. Doesn't come with a pipe, which I thought was necessary so I bought one for $3 at a costume store.People seemed to like the costume and I actually ran into two other Sherlock Holmes that night. One male and one female wearing a different sherlock outfit from mine.It's a cute costume and really not that slutty if you don't want to look like a total tramp. Neat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff","review":"I love essential oils! I bought this to add to my dr. bronner's castille soap. Just a few drops in the small container makes for a nice, cleansing soap. The smell is, of course, medicinal, but so is all other tea tree oils. I will be purchasing this again, great product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've ever read.","review":"This book was forced on me in a political science class. If you love left-wing propaganda and dogmatic party-line thinking, you'll love this book. It's filled with half-truths, opinions stated as facts, and outright lies. By the end I felt physically ill. You won't find solutions in this book for the problem of blacks committing the majority of crime in America, only pathetic excuses. The author also dismissed a priori the idea that poverty does not necessarily lead to crime, rather a third factor may lead to both regardless of race: low I.Q. (p. 134) (The Bell Curve). The author shows his elitist attitude when he characterizes the electorate as dupes (p. 179) and advocates punishing law abiding gun owners (p. 200) because of the actions of criminals.... truly frightening and an excellent example of left-wing authoritarianism"},{"rating":"2","title":"They Tell You Everything","review":"I'm amused by the reviews that compare the Evens to Fugazi or \\"A million other bands since 1995,\\" because they don't remind me of anyone else. Usually I'm impatient with low-key guitar duos - too many afternoons at the Takoma Park Folk Festival maybe - but the Evens play with a mesmerizing intensity. Their voices may be average by themselves, but together they sound heartfelt and beautiful. The instrumentation has a backbone that eludes most acoustic songcrafters and the lyrics are minimalist, pithy and powerful - based on observations that are ambiguous in the best sense of the word. Give Ian and Amy some time and your full attention, and you may be edified without feeling preached to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with Fugazi","review":"This chick's voice is really annoying. It's like what would happen if Fugazi and The Indigo Girls got together. Not a pretty thought, eh? The songs where Ian does all the singing are ok, but still not up to snuff with lesser Fugazi tracks. Pretty forgetable... and once she starts singing, forget about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A triumph of minimalism","review":"A lot of bands coming out now are big and bloated and doing the same thing.

I did the grids with my husband and he actually liked them even though he's a construction worker and totally not into the New Age.

Its way too bloody and the rabbits look like evil rats that drool. kids should not watch this they will be scared of this movie.The idea of it is good but they should of never made the movie.

I couldn't sleep for weeks after seeing this movie - it certainly made me see rabbits in a new light. Years later, I decided to watch it again, as I had matured and was apt to scare so easily. Instead, I still found it to be a sick movie that sends shivers dowm my spine."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a cartoon but it's too scary for kids.","review":"The movie has evil rabbits killing eachother that's not a good message for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"My honest opinion of this travesty","review":"This film is upsetting to adults and children alike. I can remember watching this many years ago and being quite disturbed by its violent nature and apparent assumption by the creators that watching good-natured rabbits being savaged to death by the 'general' was somehow character-building for small children. Whoever decided to create this abomination must have had very few friends at school and probably was mocked frequently by his peers as a consequence of his obvious inability to distinguish between right and wrong. In short, this film is not suitable for children of any species, let alone those fluent in the English language and able to understand the nauseating lyrics of the rhythmless soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best FILMS ever made!","review":"As good as the Oscar-nominated \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" was, this earlier film really deserved to receive a nod from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.Featuring superb voiceovers from the likes of John Hurt,Richard Briers, Michael Graham Cox, Zero Mostel, Harry Andrews, Denholm Elliot, and Sir Ralph Richardson, this is one 'toon that transcends other animated films as well as many live-action ones. The story of survival by a band of rabbits against man, predators, and others of their kind runs the gamut of human emotions.It also boasts a score that ranks up there with the best from Williams, Herrmann, Goldsmith, or Steiner.It is highly recommended for parents, teachers, and others interested in a quality, thought-provoking video selection. Films of such excellence are few and far between."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watership Down","review":"This is my four year-old daughter's favorite video.

What a dissapointment.","review":"The transfer of this movie is bad. It's very noticeable at the beginning when Bigwig has an audience with the chief. The colors flicker and fade. It happens throughout the movie.I tried the DVD on three different machines and two different TV's.If you want the movie try to get a different release off eBay.Do not purchase this DVD. Warner Brothers needs to provide a corrected version.Otherwise the movie is great. :)Just to be fair to WB I had the movie replaced. Same issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"All the World will be your enemy......\\"","review":"Once you see this movie you will be compelled to read the book which is so much more in depth. Still, this movie is a good introduction to what the book is all about, it has a bit of everything, politics, adventure, spirituality and humor so for Frith's sake see it before you stop running. You will never look at a rabbit the same way again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watership Down (Deluxe Edition)","review":"Watership Down is one of my favorite books, and the video is, for the most part, true to the book. The production information and interviews were very intersting and informative. Since the story contains several scenes of bloody battles between the rabbits, I don't think it would be suitable for very young children, but other than that, I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Animated classic","review":"A simply awesome animated film based on Richard Adams's great novel in which the lifes of rabbits are used as an allegory for Human society, Watership Down tells the tale of a group of rabbits who's home is about to be detroyed and how they must find a new place safe from their enemies. They eventually find a new place, but there are no female rabbits to start a new burrow. So, the rabbits go out in search for females and end up having to fight the dictatorial, rabbit General Woundwort (voiced by Harry Andrews). This is probably one of the best animated film ever made. Both adults and children will enjoy this. The comic relief is provided by comedian Zero Mostel (in his last role), as the voice of the looney Seagull, Kehaar. The film is full of famed British stars, doing the voices of various characters, amongst them John Hurt, Denholm Elliot and Ralph Richardson.Watership Down is a great film that should endure for a very long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"its the best movie in the whole wide world","review":"its the best i first saw it when i was 7 and got hooked great music watch it its so good"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watership Down","review":"This is one of the best movies for rabbit lovers. Keep in mind that unlike the rabbits in this film, American Cottontails do not live in warrens; the rabbits in the movie are English rabbits, like many of our domestic rabbits. Lovers of other animals, and plants, of the English countryside will also enjoy this film. There are a few scenes of blood and death, hence its PG rating, but these scenes are definitely not overdone. The plot is far more moving than many other animations, and the music, both instrumental and vocal, is superb. If you have not read the book yet, see the movie first, read the book, which the author, Richard Adams based partly on the true lives of English rabbits, and see the movie again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Any cartoonist would like it!","review":"Hi, I want to be a cartoonist and this is my childhood favorite movie, Watership Down. I seen it when I was a kid atleast when I was probably atleast ten. Now I am 16 and I still like it. I hope to get the movie for myself. The book is good but I would watch the movie before I read the book because it's kinda confusing and I can picture it in my mind better with the movie! I also found in a article that mostly people with a cartoon taste would like it. You got drama, music, sadness, friendship and care! Sure it got lots of blood but it's nature! I am a nature type person and I love cartoons! If you love cartoons and nature, I can assure you, will love this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Movie For All Time...","review":"How times change. I saw this movie when I was in the hospital at the young age of 10. Although this is a cartoon, I don't know if 10 year olds today would be used to something like this. It is a great movie which depicts some violence, but that violence is oh so necessary to make its point. This is definitely a classic movie, and one that tells a must see tale with a powerful moral message. Read the book after you see the movie, it's even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"movie ain't the book","review":"I saw the movie after reading the novel and falling deeply in love with the characters. I searched the net and found that there was in fact a movie and searched for it in all the video stores near my house. When I watched the movie I was impressed by the realistic quality the rabbits are given but disapointed by the butchered story line. I would still recommend this movie to any true lover of the great novel, for the sheer joy of watching characters come to life on screen rather than in ones mind. I only wish a true longer version will come out one day using all that movie magic has to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected better Quality","review":"Had seen this movie a long time ago it's different and very good.

There are some scenes that may be frighting for younger children. Overall this movie is excellent. I only recently watched it and it is one of those movies you never forget. I have also read the novel, which I highly recommend reading first before watching the movie. Either way, both novel and movie are fantastic!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A dark dramatic, yet uplifting film","review":"Some criticize the movies dakr and violent aspect as well as its creator. However, you must understand that rabbits in real-life are not the Thumpers in Walt Disney's Bambi, but wild animals who strive to survive in their world. Also, Richard Adams based his information on a book written by a friend of his who studied the lives of the English rabbit.The book and movie are both beautiful pictures of the rabbits and how they live. There are some mythical elements, which add a whimsical and dramatic air to the novel and is on par with anything written by my beloved Tolkien.I don't think children should be prevented from seeing this film, but be warned that it does realistically potray rabbits being wounded and killed. There is even blood, but it isn't a splatter-fest like in a B-rated horror flick.I suggest parents explain the movie to children and if they do get frightened, then do not show it to them again until theyr are older."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Done, With a Great Ending for an Old Man Like Me","review":"First, as an old man myself, with an ever-increasing clan, I love the ending. I bought the movie mainly to be able to see the ending whenever I needed it.The interviews included about the making of the film are quite interesting, too.Lastly, what is NOT clear (not even on the Warner Home Video website) is that this is wide-screen, evidently just like in the theater (or should I say, theatre).

But it should have stayed there, and never have been unleashed on an unsuspecting world. It's not horror - it's a parody of low-budget horror, so not scary. About as scary as a guy putting a bag on his head. It's supposed to be funny. But I didn't find it the least bit funny. About as funny as a guy putting a bag on his head. It's narrowly focused on these young filmmakers and the making of their film while staying at a remote cabin. Since I'm not especially young, nor a filmmaker, i found it very boring.

The vacuum attatchment was very flimsy, thin, brittle plastic and mounted where it would certainly fail. It only took one time for me to put it down and CRACK! went the vacuum attatchment. The height ajdustment knob has a lot of play, and was cracked on mine but still stayed on. The Plunge action works great If you are a heavy weight lifter and put alot of effort, the springs they use I think are meant for holding up a car.

I must say that I enjoyed Greendaughter, and if you have read any of Logstons previous books and enjoyed them, then you will not be disappointed with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"still a favorite","review":"i have owned this book for several years now. heard about it from the author himself as i was in one of his classes. still a favorite of mine as the comedy is perfect and the classic detective angle is a nice touch when combined with the sci-fi genre. a great read that i have enjoyed again and again. a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freedom in Christ","review":"A condensed yet complete tool using the truths of God's word to set you free. These steps changed my life. Spiritual warfare is real. I was unaware of the darkness I was amidst until it was removed. Using a copy for each of us, my father walked me through the different spiritual areas which had me in bondage. Through prayer and the power of the Holy Spirit, I renounced the lies and replaced them with surrender to Christ's love and goodness. I often refer to the list of \\"Who I am in Christ\\" to keep me grounded in truth. The small book is easy to carry anywhere or share with others in time of need."},{"rating":"2","title":"The quintessential parrot reference","review":"It's unfortunate that this book is out of print, as it's a parrot fanatic's ultimate reference to parrots in the wild. Beautifully illustrated with full-color plates, it covers every known species of parrot, and some that are sadly extinct since its printing. It provides information on all aspects of psittacines in the wild as far as they are known, from size to range to breeding habits to habitat, but it's really the illustrations that make this book so valuable. If you're at all interested in wild parrots, this book is among the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, but old","review":"This is a good review of parrots as of around 1960.

Luminous prose from a poet, including his descriptions of the nurturing of silkworms or of the growth of black truffles and its complete dependence on the natural rhythms of seasons. It took me some time to read this short book because I wanted to relish its language and the metaphors it offered for life, loss, grief, and how we surrender to them.Still, as sympathetic as I felt towards the main characters, I found myself watching them instead of inhabiting their persona (for those moments of immersion in the book, at least)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"Perfect case for the HSF100.

Set in Stockholm they give a glimpse not into only Swedish life but also how a newspaper there operates. The fourth book, \\"The Bomber\\" was a hit here but I thought the first two were even better. I'm going on to the third, \\"Primetime\\" next.Annika, a young newspaper reporter, deals with resentment from many of the permanent staff at the newspaper as the result of a shocking incident in the first book, \\"Studio 69\\", while she tracks down a mysterious organization that seems too good to be true. In the process she is involved with the Yugoslavian Mafia and the dangerous Ratko.

Not just that, but Margaret herself recorded commentaries and an interview on the set, which is something I was surprised to find out considering her recollection of the production of this series in I'm The One That I Want.I cannot wait to see this show, whether it's a great underrated sitcom or a trite mess, I love Margaret Cho and this show is essential viewing for her fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"I got into Margaret Cho because of this...","review":"When All American Girl first came on TV, I was so excited because - FINALLY - a TV show about how insane Asian families can be!While many Asian Americans protested this show, due to the cast not being completely Korean, and that the show played up certain Asian stereotypes, it also showed how tough it is, growing up between two cultures.While Margaret Cho's comedy routine is vastly superior to this show (her impressions of her mom are hysterical! She sounds just like my mom!), this series was great, and I was very distraught when it was cancelled."},{"rating":"1","title":"This proves that they will put out just about anything on DVD...","review":"This is a wretched sitcom. It wasn't very good when it was made, and the production troubles it had are well documented. As we know, this was Margaret Cho's first (and, to date, only) sitcom, and ABC tinkered with it to the point that it sent Margaret into a tailspin personally. They forced her to lose weight (which resulted in kidney failure), and they also hired an \\"Asian consultant\\", as the audience didn't believe Margaret's character was Asian enough. After the show was cancelled, Margaret spiralled down into drugs, booze, and anonymous sex (by her own admission). Her concert film, I'm the One that I Want, details what happened to her in sometimes painful detail. The actual show is garbage, but, perhaps, there is a silver lining to this show being released on DVD. If they put this manure out, they'll put anything out, and if there's a really obscure film you love, it may someday come out on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"This is an excellent box set of Margaret Cho's sitcom, All-American Girl.

Seeing the complete series brought back great memories and also showed that the scope of this show was not only funny but also a real sign of the times.

It's got rhythm in most of its songs and has a passion to the entire album that is very energizing. Although it's relaxing it also energizes. The whole album has a sort of \\"journey\\" or \\"travelling\\" feel to it.

I finally gave up and asked for a refund - that was 2 months ago, and still no response from GroomMate.This is highly unfortunate - I need a clipper like this due to an injury that makes using normal all-metal clippers very difficult.

Album is Great! / Moody!","review":"I was first attracted to this album as a fan of Graham Reynolds (founder / multi-instrumentalist of this group - Big player in the Austin music scene - film score extraordinaire) and I had gotten my hands on a few of the more upbeat tracks from this album (Finster Crumley comes to mind) which give the impression of a very hip, bouncy music akin to a lot of middle eastern vibes (secret chiefs 3 kinda stuff) or almost circus music. However, after ordering the album and listening to it in its entirety, that style of music is not the focal point to \\"Why the Sea Is Salt\\".Don't get me wrong. Order it! You're still going to get a beautiful, meaningful CD that a LOT of thought and talent went into. Just know that you're going to get a lot of somber string arrangements and a more serious vibe throughout.

It has the vast sweep one expects in an historical novel, accurately portraying the mores, speech, and costumes of the day, a tribute to what must have been exhaustive (and exhausting) research. Roger Paulding takes on the grand themes of colonial times - sin, guilt, redemption, colonization, the plight of Native Americans, and slavery - in prose reminiscent of Mark Twain, and with charming and quixotic characters Twain himself might have created. Indeed, Richard Makepeace has been added to my list of all-time favorite fictional characters. The Pickled Dog Caper had me laughing out loud one moment and plumbing the depths of the human condition the next. It is side-splitting, heart-warming, and a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stone Cold","review":"My wife really loves Tom Selleck, so we really liked the movie.

For fans of the books by Robert B. Parker, he fits the image of the very human and somewhat flawed former LA homicide detective turned small-town police chief. The story follows the book pretty well, until the ending, which is quite different from the book yet still satisfying. I enjoyed seeing the characters from the book come to life, but as an avid reader I almost always prefer a book to a movie.

So try to buy it used, or borrow it.(If you want a real book on starting a design firm, get \\"The Business Side of Creativity\\")"},{"rating":"2","title":"Muy Bueno...","review":"Really good design book... an excellent referent if you are going to start your own business...It's not the best but is really good!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiral Poi by Pyro Pixies","review":"First off, let me say that Magic Geek Juggling Store is one of the best companies I've dealt with online in ages. They went out of their way to make sure I got the product I wanted, and I received personal follow-ups from two different employees. Fantastic!Now, the poi. Spiral Poi by Pyro Pixies is a very well-made product; solid and sturdy. Unfortunately they do not weigh as much as I had hoped they would. Their lighter weight makes them more difficult to spin because they have very little momentum. I'll probably add some weights to mine. The scarves are super-long and ultra-bright, which makes for a beautiful effect. I definitely recommend this product, especially if you can get it from Magic Geek.Spiral Poi"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needed more Charlotte","review":"Disappointed to have only three songs with Miss Church. \\"Oh, Holy Night\\" is the highlight of the album. Charlotte Church and Placido Domingo's high caliber voices duet very well. Tony Bennett's \\"talk - sing\\" style announces his aged voice. He should have been left off the album all together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not One of My Favorite Things","review":"Placido Domingo and Charlotte Church must have been singing for charity to share the stage with Tony Bennett and Vanessa Williams. Tony and Vanessa are out of their league. At least Tony used to have a voice, of course, that was forty years ago. Please don't misunderstand, I love Tony Bennett, the classic Tony Bennett of his prime. I'd probably go see Tony today as a solo act for the pure nostalgia, but he has no business standing shoulder-to-shoulder with Placido Domingo.But the real mystery is, \\"Why Vanessa Williams?\\" She's not even a has been. She's a never was, never will be. Her lack of talent is painfully displayed by contrast to the enchanting voice of Charlotte Church.If they were to make one, I'd recommend a duet album of Placido and Charlotte. But, until then, buy their solo efforts. If it's Tony you're after, go buy something from the early 60's or one of his greatest hits albums. As for this album, it's not one of my favorite things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"Yes, it was a huge disappointment. Vanessa Williams could not sing. Tony Bennett tried to drag out his ego by create his own version of bad music. The only three highlights were Charlotte Church, Placido Domingo,and the children chorus of Vienna. I could not understand why Vanessa Williams was a part of this? She was not a singer at all. Did they bring her in for her look? And Tony Bennett? It appeared like he just showed up at the concert without any rehearsal and made up his own tune. And why Charlotte Church was only a small part of this? Certainly she was bigger than Vanessa Williams and a rising star of the European stage, and she had only a minor role?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Tygers of Pan Tang album","review":"Their sophomore effort is their best album for sure, and it is a benchmark NWOBHM album.

I think this album is just as good as his first, and I'm already singing along to some of the songs. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another gem!","review":"This is Mark Schultz's second studio album, and is proof positive that he is no \\"flash in the pan\\". His sound is unique, and he is a bona fide Songwriter with a capital \\"S\\"! He does not bow down to trendy-sounding pop music, but reveals his strength by being simply who he is. I would recommend this even to people who are not Christian music fans, simply because he is brilliant at his craft. I don't doubt that someday one of his songs will bridge over and find its way onto the mainstream charts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Resource","review":"As a volunteer coach and former collegiate player myself this is a must have for new and seasoned coaches.

I don't think it is just a matter of the material inside the case being scratchy, since areas are corroding that don't touch the case. I live in AZ, where the humidity is usually under 20%, so it's not like the case was trapping moisture in it. My friend has the same camera and bought it about a month before I got mine, and his camera body is fine.Overall, I am very disappointed in this case and in Coach."},{"rating":"1","title":"DESIGN FLAWS FATAL TO CAMERA (NOT WORTH A SINGLE STAR!)","review":"Basically, this profuct looks like both a stylish and protective way to carry around your camera...until your LCD breaks. Yeap! Thats right! The metal button sewn into the case is not padded and, if you insert your camera with the screen facing forward, it is very likely your LCD will suffer the same fate as mine.

I think I would damage the camera more trying to get it in and out of the case than I would if I simply didn't use the case at all.

However, I am still think that the quality/price ratio is low."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brought This Case For My Canon Elph Digital Camera","review":"Amazon knocked off twenty dollars off the case since I brought it with my SD110 Digatal Elph camera. I needed a case for my new camera so it turned out to be a great deal. The case is leather and it has a magnetic snap.Things I like about this case...- The magnetic snap is really awesome because it makes closing the case a lot faster without looking.- There is an available belt loop to hook this case to your belt.- If I were to drop this case with my camera in it I feel confident the camera would be protected because the case is designed to take the impact.Three cons of this case are...- It will not keep moisture and dirt out.- While the case fits the SD100 like a glove, the case is too large to fit in your pocket.- It is expensive if you have to pay full price.PS: If you really wanted to, you probably could squeeze either an extra memory card of battery into this case along with the camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard ... Stiff ... Bulky ...","review":"There are much better cases for the Canon SD500. This is a great case if you need to advertise that you have a Coach case. But if you want a case that fits the camera well, is compact and soft, and also offers good protection, this is NOT the case to buy. It is stiff, scratchy, bulky, and it doesn't fit the camera. The Canon PSC-50 is a far better case and much cheaper. Given that the SD500 is a portable, compact camera, I think the case should be also. I returned it for the PSC-50 and couldn't be happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than $10 and I still returned it...lousy case.","review":"I purchased this case on the Coach/Canon deal...what a mistake. The leather is stiff and the fit is very box-like (it defeats the purpose of having a small camera). I thought the embossed, pebble-grain leather looked terrible (the Coach logo looks bad too). The leather inside was smooth, but overall the case did not seem soft enough for a camera. I ended up returning this lousy case (even though it only cost me $10) and picked up the standard Canon leather case for the PowerShot S410 - it is excellent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"strangly, the design of this case it really lacking. when you close the case, there is a hole at the top that allows the camera's strap to come through - this hole is out of alignment, and bends the strap in such a way, that when you carry the camera by the strap, it forces the case open - due to it's weak magnetic snap.lame-o"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed at this Coach case","review":"Besides the Coach logo on this case, you would not believe this is a product design by Coach. It is very bulky. My camera is nice and small and is the main reason I bought it over other Canon cameras, but with this case, it defeats the purpose being big and bulky. It is also hard to use. The only good thing is that it is hard case, so prevents damages. No room for extra batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prime Early Price","review":"A great collection of Price's early recordings, when he was tearing up the R'n'B charts, but before his slightly slicker work tore up the pop charts, as well. All manner of wonderful honking and shouting here, with Price at his most elemental, while still loaded with hooks and melodies. Simply put: if you even remotely think this is something for you, it IS something for you. If you know Price only from later hits like \\"Personality\\" and \\"Lady Luck,\\" this will please your soul and make your heart race.

I thought I would give Macmillan a chance so I decided to buy Linux for Windows. Linux for Windows (Linux Mandrake 7.2 in disguise) has proven to be a bust!! After rebooting my computer, the installation program would not start. I tried many different installation methods offered with Linux for Windows and none of them worked. I even changed the boot order in my BIOS and it still did not work. Creating a boot disk also did not work. Tech support is non-existant. My friend contacted Macmillan many times for tech support and he has not received any support what so ever(it has been over a year now and still now word!).

But the table will do the job, the welds feel strong and the table is quite stable.In the technical details it lists \\"2x light stands, 2x white umbrellas, 2x light holder and 2x 5000k day light balanced fluorescent bulbs\\". THESE ITEMS WERE NOT INCLUDED. Now, in all fairness in the hand written product description it does state \\"SHOOTING TABLE ONLY. ACTION FIGURE NOT INCLUDED.\\".

As a matter of fact I read over a hundered pages of the book yesterday. Each page literally has you anxious to find out what is about to happen next. You know how some authors at the end of the book leave you with open ended questions about some of the characters? The author Shannon Holmes leaves you knowing what happened to each character in the conclusion of the book.

B- more careful is not the book to read if you are looking to read it in didactic form. I mean give me a break! all the twist and turns constantly kept me in focus with the realization of this book really being non-fiction. I may even go as far as to saying that it is a premier publicity stunt to capture the media eye. Dont get me wrong if thats what sells my hat is off to the arthur, but how about making the events as well as characters a little more realistic. If you are reading this for entertainment I recommend it. Its the typical Ghetto story that many writers write about this day and age.

It was a really short read, which I did not mind at all. The author is often very vague in different parts of the book. For example, he may not share feelings or thoughts of certain characters, almost like he was rushing to write it. The story line kept me interested. I know that there are people in the country that do live these lives and I love to look in for a time. His technique was unique. He started in the present and then moved back in time until he caught up with where he left you and continued from there.

I was excited when I ordered this book. I heard great things about this book. Once I started I just couldn't finish. I had to tell myself to read it like it was a project or a assignment. It just doesn't follow through. It goes this way and that. I am telling you as a very concerned 16 year old high school student. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.

With a BA in English, I have had to read many a novel. While I applaud Holmes' subject matter, he needs to develop his skill as a novelist. Many African-Americans (I am one) seem willing to accept low-grade artistic work just because we are the featured characters. This must stop. Unless Holmes is willing to work at it, he will never be another Ellison, Hughes, or Morrison. Yes, there is enough space for every type of author, but, help me out folks...there has to be more going on in a cautionary tale than a lot of gratuitous violence. We all deserve better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really good read","review":"Well i read the book last year and lost it to a friend, so i bought it again.

The using of one's body to get materialistic things is an everyday occurence in this world. So sad to see but that is the sad truth.I recommend this book for every female aged 13 to 35. Pass it down to a loved-one and open her eyes to sex, money and drugs."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'ma Hustla","review":"In this book Shannon Holmes writes it like a soap opera.

If your not from the streets or don't know anything about the streets you have no right to say anything bad about this book especailly if you haven't went threw some of the things the females have went threw in this book. It's a must read hard to put down. It begins with the p-pound basically you could call them high class gold diggers but when the head of the p-pound gets a little to greedy and takes one of the men shes hustling money b/c she believes he'll rot in jail. Things begin to go bad and as soon as life starts to look up. Her past finally catches up with her and then she realizes she has to be more careful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Room for improvement","review":"Poor editing aside, Shannon Holmes possibly could have a career as an author. B'more Careful presents a different world to the naive while glorifying it for those who live in this world or want to become a part of the drama that dealing drugs can lead to. A good writer researches the topic even if they feel they have lived through it. Not knowing how long it took Mr. Holmes to write his \\"novel,\\" a little more time, with a little more rewriting would have resulted in a better product. Don't insult the reader's intelligence by thinking you have to spell everything out."},{"rating":"2","title":"On second thougt","review":"When I first read B-More I didn't care for it. After reading it again I've changed my mind. It's a good story and just when you think that the author is glorifying the street life Shannon Holmes turns around and shows the reader that Thugs pay a price for their lifestyles. Without preaching the author quietly offers a lesson about actions having consequences. It is an exciting tale and if you loved Coldest Winter or True to the Game this book will thrill you too. Hopefully the author will get a better editor and proofreader for the next edition of the book because it screams, cries, and begs for grammatical help in several places."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"Shannon Holmes is one of my favorite authors and this read right here, reminds me just why he is.A great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HOOD CLASSIC","review":"I READ THIS BOOK YEARS AGO, BUT DIDN'T HAVE IT IN MY COLLECTION SO WHEN I PURCHASED IT I READ IT AGAIN.

At first, I felt sorry for Netta, but as the story moved along, as bad as it was, she got was she deserved from Black.

Actually, I read the first 100 pages and left my book at an airport. After a week I was interested enough in the characters that I had to buy another.This book narrates the lives of two girls growing up in the ghetto trying to break out of past patterns and how they are drug back in. They recognize what their value is and become determined to use it to their advantage. But sometimes when you play with fire you get fire, and that's exactly what happens.I found this an interesting read that in the last quarter of the book has some interesting plot twists that make the book even more interesting.

Whle it is a neat looking tool, it has been nearly completely useless. In fact, it turns out to be much more effort to use, and harder on the back, than a regular string trimmer. The wheels are small and hard - they absorb no shock on rough ground, and the wheelbase is so narrow that the thing is constantly tipping and difficult to control. Perhaps it is meant to trim around a manicured, perfectly flat lawn, and it may work well for that. Then again, the two-stroke engine is noisy and does not respond readily to the throttle. If you have tall grass and weeds, or uneven ground, or don't like the mosquito-like buzz of a small, low-quality two-stroke engine, look for something else. If I could figure out how to get it back in the box I'd return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I used it - I can't stand it","review":"I bought this unit recently - thinking that this wheeled trimmer would be easier on my back.

I wouldn't recommend using this trimmer unless you are less than 6 foot tall.Third, the wheels can't handle any uneven terrain - things like going over roots next to a tree require much additional force. Plus if you hit uneven terrain the front of the unit, which has no wheels, has a tendency to tip forward - giving areas you didn't want to wack a too-close trim.Fourth - Since the head is fixed you can't easily position this unit in hard to reach areas.Fifth - I went through two lines just doing 1/4 acre - the lines are expensive to buy.Skip this unit - for the money you can get a very good string trimmer that uses standard line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Weedeaters","review":"I received the first Weedeater and used it for about 45 minutes before the spool stopped working.

I called Amazon back again and they refunded my money for both of these defective products. Amazon was truely great about these purchases.

I buy 2 containers of string everytime I see it on the shelf, just to be sure the store doesn't sell out before I need more. Expensive - NOT! I bought the first one for $150.00, so $50/year of hard labor was nothing to complain about in the end. For those who are getting 'bad' units, I would highly suggest exchanging them. I can't say enough good things about this model... :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"dissatisfied customer","review":"I Liked the easy of use and the unit is light enough to maneuver on steep banks.Now for the negative; I used two strings in about 5 minutes of use, after about ten minutes the string head seperated at the welds a bad design flaw I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell apart after the first use!","review":"Thought the weed eater looked like a cool product, however, it fell apart as soon as we used it.

I didn't find that to be case at all. The trimmer didn't seem to use any more string than most any of the other Trimmer's that I've owned in the past. And...if one buys the string in bulk (3# rolls) it isn't all that expensive.I have no problem recommending this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"continued disappointments","review":"For a machine that I waa so delighted with and has such great possibilities this is a dud. I was given one for my birthday and within two months I had it in the shop. I finally bought another one because I thought it just had to be that one machine. It has been at the shop 3 0r 4 times and has been worked on by an authorized technician at my home twice. The shaft will not stay on so the cutter wheel does not move. The latest problem is that I can crank it but it vibrates so much that the choke lever will not stay up so it quits. I've bought weedeater products for years because they're light and dependable. Weedeater should discontinue this one or beef it up so it will run longer than a day or two without having to go back to the shop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Denso 234-4189 Oxygen Sensor","review":"This Sensor is used as \\"original equipment\\" in my 2003 Toyota Tacoma. If it's good enough for Toyota, its good enough for me. I have been buying parts from Autozone and Advanced Auto Parts (AAP) when I realized (Duh) I could have been buying these parts all along on Amazon. The key is finding out what part number you need. Go to your parts store and act as if you are buying. Get the partnumber and check for it on Amazon. I realized a $20 savings for this sensore. Over $80 at AAP and only $60 on amazon. I absolutely needed this part to get a check engine light to shut off so I kept $20 in my wallet.

The additional music on the box is very good, mostly in the same area as In a Silent Way, and none of it is filler. Particularly the Ghetto Walk and Early Minor; these two songs recorded after the album proper were worthy of release on their own. Maybe they will show up on the reissue of the original album. The packaging of the box is my only complaint, as it is inconsistent with the rest of the series. It doesn't have the metal spine like the other 4, so it doesn't seem to go with them. Also, the type in the booklet (which is very revelatory and a good read otherwise) is white set on yellow in a lot of places, making it difficult to read. But these are very minor points overall, and because the text of the booklet is so well done it doesn't really matter too much anyway. Thank you to Columbia/Legacy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Miles!!","review":"Ever since I heard In a Silent Way eight years ago in college it has remained one of my all time favorite Miles Davis albums.

While they feature the samurai detective Sano Ichiro, for us it is the involvement of his wife Reiko that adds a special dimension to his investigations. Reiko may appear too modern to some readers as she circumvents the normal behavior of women of her class. But her husband relies on her to find evidence and go into places where a male detectives could not. In this case Reiko helps her husband get to the bottom of intrigues which involve a plot to overthrow the Shogun's government."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Samurai's Wife","review":"Gave this book as a gift and the receiver was delighted! Thought it very good and will order other books by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Modern madness","review":"Although a number of prior reviewers loved this novel, I found it impossible to enjoy, despite an overwhelming desire to like this book. As a martial artist, I couldn't get past the silly plot. Worse yet, the characters, especially the main characters, are far too modern (and Western). Likewise, the dialog was stilted, direct, and unlikely to be spoken by even modern Japanese. If you aren't looking for historical accuracy, you may be happy with the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's getting to be too much!","review":"This is the fifth or sixth Sano Ichiro book that I read. The only reason that I keep coming back is the futile hope that perhaps the next one will be different. But it is not. The characters in these books have a one-dimensional comic book quality that does not change or mature with age. The antagonism between Sano and the Chamberlain gets to be boring after so many absurd confrontations. The evolution of plot and detective work is always pathetically arbitrary. The only saving grace is what to the reader appears as an interesting view and description of 17th century Japan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nutshell","review":"Read 25 pages, fell asleep. Forced myself to read to page 100 - gave up in disgust - checked ending (predicatable).Pluses - historical detail, description of costumes and life.Minuses - totally implausable relationship with wife. Reliance on absurd kill-by-glance BS. Overheated prose.Overall - great concept - unexpectedly lame execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Move Me","review":"Ever since I read Shogun I've enjoyed books set in ancient Japan. The Samauri's Wife is really good at capturing life in the Land of the Rising Sun except for one thing:A samurai would've rid himself of a wife like Reiko. Her character is totally unrealistic. The average well to do Japanese lady of this time period did not behave like this at all. Historical fiction is one thing, fantasy fiction is another.On top of this problem, the character of Reiko is annoying. Her prime function seemed to be to get in her husband's way. I found myself hoping that Sano would turn to the bald headed nun. The most compelling love story the book was between Sano's arch rival, the Shogan's second in command and his cunning new lover, Hoshino. There are more books in this series but this it for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic! Trolls! A Wonderous Horse! and family love...","review":"I purchased this book for my son, just because it was written by my favorite author. Although I immediately fell in love with it, I wasn't so sure what my 6 year old son would think of it, but, perhaps for different reasons than me, he insists on having it read to him frequently. Like any classic folktale, it uses a simple style and classic images to present timeless and complicated truths.

They worked great. We usually got the humidifier to pump an entire five gallon bucket of water into the air each day during the first few days of use each winter. Once the air was comfortable, the humidifier would turn itself on and off depending on the humidity. These new filters have been in there for two days and the humidifier cannot bring the house up to the usual comfort level (and it's not that cold yet - and it's raining!) It has been running non-stop. During the first day, it only drew about three gallons of water out into the air.

There are not enough illustrated parts diagrams (exploded views) nor are there any detailed schematics of most systems. I am upset that I wasted $25 on this book.

I switch this off with Kathy Smith's Total Body Lift which uses light to no weights and am getting the results I have been wanting.The abs section is really intense as you don't stop at all for 10 minutes and she pushes you, but now that I see it changing my body, I look forward to the workout.I have been working out for a long time, and on some of the lifts I am at the lowest weight.

There's also a strong American blues influence, mixed in with the lovely folkie balladeering, inviting stylistic comparisons to John Renbourn and Bert Jansch, and Davy Graham. Yet Martyn was clearly his own man, and as future albums would bear out, his self-confidence was well-warranted."},{"rating":"2","title":"I never even knew John Martyn had recorded an album before the Tumbler","review":"I have been a big fan of John Martyn since buying the Tumbler back in 1968. I actually thought that was his first album until I discovered this one. The songs here are reminiscent of those on the Tumbler and it was nostalgic for me to re-live the sounds of that era. A huge talent especially considering how young he was at the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO GOOD!!","review":"Would have given 5*'s, but for a couple of small gripes. Part 2 (of 3) could have been left out; one nut at a time, ok?? Don't judge a book by its dreary cover, *Headhunter* is a fantastic thriller, if you can stand ultimate hard core sicko-sexual. Lots of psychiatric and cop info, this book is very cultivated and succeeds as both a shocker and a mystery.As you will see in other reviews, after reading, the palpitations of upsetness will stay with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Thomas Harris on [drugs.]","review":"Just finished reading this one on the recommendation of a friend and - hooha - it's one crazy book. Take all the obsessive, meticulous research of Thomas Harris, add in the hard-boiled worldview of James Ellroy, and mix it all with a big dose of twisted sexual psychopathology and you get this book. Mind-bogglingly complicated, rich with character and plot, it only misses greatness by having almost TOO crowded a canvass (at a couple of key points, I had to go back in the novel to refresh my memory or catch something I missed - and I am NOT a careless or inattentive reader). Still, where most thriller writers just phone in their books, Slade (a pseudonym) clearly cares about delivering something provocative, frightening, and original."},{"rating":"2","title":"A BLOODY GOOD TIME!!!","review":"This was the first book that I have read by Mr. Slade. I must say that I was quite impressed. Not only is this a truley grusome story, but I actually learned a bit a history by reading this book (in particular about the Royal Canadian Mounties). All in all I would recomend this book to fans of serial killer novels. My only problem was that the killer turned out to be. . .now that would be telling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Headhunter","review":"This book's primary action takes place in Lower British Columbia, close to where I grew up. It's fun to have all the action going on in familiar places....A great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldies, Smooth & Easy listening","review":"This is a very nice collection of older Marley and the Wailers songs that provide very laid back easy listening. The usual superior and maybe unedited vocals, with predominantly male background, unlike most later Marley recordings. The album sounds as if there was minimal work to enhance it, but it's still great. It's like you've got the original Wailers doing a personal, low key live performance for you in a small club. To me it yields more of a 'Jamaican' flavor with a slower subdued beat. Tosh leads on \\"400 Years\\". There's not a bad song here and of the few that I already own, the ones on Crucial Reggae are different - older versions. A nice change of pace, like the Oldie's your radio DJ should be playing instead of the usual overplayed, less creative stuff you're probably suffering through."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best actual italian prog bands","review":"Italian excellent progressive, quite original, not neo prog, from the nineties. Very recommended to quality-prog seekers. Every album is different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tabloid history","review":"The Roman Empire had a well-developed tabloid press, full of wild and quite explicit sexual rumors. This book is straight out of that tradition and is entertaining as such. How much can you take seriously? Not much. It's not history in any pure sense, but kind of a look back at Rome's tabloid spirit. The Roman tabloid differed from ours in that it lacked our veneer of prudery and puritanism. Even South America's blood-drenched tabloids doesn't have the kind of sexually explicit sensationalism prevalent in the Roman Empire. This book is more like fringe sociology than history. Like a good tabloid of any age, the book is fun and entertaining, but weird."},{"rating":"1","title":"Masturbatory fantacies for the truly sick!","review":"I am no prude. And I am not in favor of censorship. But this book,aside from offereing up pure garbage in the disguise of history, probably gets a lot of perverts off rather well. Just hope they stay home and stick to their fantasies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Children or the Squeamish","review":"This book is more porn than history- I found it fairly disturbing. I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly a joke?","review":"I almost think the authors intended this to be a joke but did not include a disclaimer. Whatever information they didn't get from the 1980's porno, they made up. The Roman people are always referred to as \\"plebian scum\\" and when Caligula chooses a human woman to begin his dynasty of incest, his horse is \\"inconsalable\\". The emperor's genitals are referred to as his \\"imperial weapon\\" and the senators have nothing to do other than choosing a color to paint their new meeting hall or getting \\"buggered\\" by Caligula. Even if this is a joke, however, it quickly loses any humor it may have since it begins repeating everything after the first page. (or even the introduction) All in all, save your money..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Buggery","review":"As a amateur historian specializing in ancient cultures such as the Romans, I found this book to be nothing but pure fiction. While the authors do make it seem as though these events could be true, a little common sense tells the intelligent reader that they are not. What I found even more incredulous was that the authors give absolutely no sources for their information. On the other hand, this piece does work as a pornographic salute to the Romans. Hilarious but not true at all would best describe this book. If you are a fan of murder, sodomy, beastiality, and lurid female conduct then buy this book. If you are more interested in the facts of the ancient Romans, then avoid it like a Lybian lion going for the anus of a young slave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caligula: Divine Garbage","review":"This is the most inaccurate account of the Roman emperors I have ever read. It is also one of the least academic. The authors refer to \\"documents that have recently been discovered\\" as the basis for their facts but NOWHERE do they tell you where to find these \\"documents\\". Anyone with the least bit of intelligence will also know that their description e.g. of the sexual behavior of spectators at the gladiatorial games is far-fetched and made up and sensational, to say the least. Their description of how some gladiators were so well trained that they could decapitate another, and have the blood spurting out of his neck then form the letters of the name of the emperor, is absolutely ludicrous. It is a pity that a book like this exists -do NOT waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obscene Drivel","review":"Just a flick through this vile publication in a library was enough to bring the same conclusion as most readers have done in these reviews. Were the details of torture and mind reeling lifestyles to be true, all semblance of credibility is lost in the gleeful writing style. This really is the pits. I suppose some rather empty, sad lunies will revel in it but - hey -get a life."},{"rating":"1","title":"less than zero","review":"I'm not unacquainted with 'the Roman sources,' and I can say only that (a) this book is absolutely shot through with wild assertions that, as far as I know, have no basis in Classical texts -- I can often recognize the textual KERNEL for a given baroque description, but, typically, little of the latter is actually stated in the former -- and (b) I'd be flabbergasted if much of the overplus came from anything more authoritative than somebody's overheated imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak.","review":"very cliched and cheesey. the romance wasn't all that exciting either...there is no real suspense. sometimes the heroine acts unrealistically for her situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Say Yes","review":"I am not usually drawn to these kinds of books but during times of holiday anxiety, I found a detour into the pages of A Practical Book of Everyday Miracles gave me permission to step aside and experience the little big things that matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY POOR WRITING","review":"WHILE I DON'T EXPECT ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE WRITING STYLE, I DO EXPECT SOMEWHERE NEAR THE QUALITY OF HIS WRITING.

After I peel them off, I have to inspect them, because I think it's so cool that so much crap is coming out of my pores.

I love knowing that I can get all that junk OUT of my pores!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Biore strips","review":"I have been using these occasionally for a few years now and have noticed a difference in my pores, especially on my nose. I like how they have added slits around the nose strips to help prevent the wrinkles and bubbles on the strip I used to get. The package recommends not using them more than once every three days. I use them twice a month (or when I remember) and use the Biore triple action astingent immediately after removing the strips. I have had no adverse reactions to this item. You should not use if you have sunburn, blemishes, excessively dry skin or are sensitive to bandages or peel-off masks. Also, stick with the Biore brand, I have tried drug store knockoffs and they ARE NOT the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE THIS MAJOR WASTE OF MONEY","review":"This is horrible.

I wet my nose then put the strip on and waited. It was kind of painful taking the strip off, but I thought that it would be worth it if my pores would become cleaner. But there was no change. None at all, my nose and pores looked exactly the same and there was no dirt or anything on the strips. I wouldn't recommend it. Don't waste your money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"snake oil, waste of money, piece of crap.. take your pick","review":"Yeah.. the title says it - don't waste your money on this.

Not only did it hurt like heck to take it off, but I noticed it was just as clean as it was when I first opened it. My skin did not improve at all. I kept using it to see if it helped over time, but it didn't. I would not recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it really working ?","review":"I purchased one from Wal-mart and keep using it every week.

You can't go wrong with Biore products."},{"rating":"2","title":"YES it works!","review":"I haven't tried these in many many years so I had forgotten how great these work. They work best when you get out of a hot shower since your pores will be more open. I applied to my wet nose and 15 minutes later removed tons of pore clogging oil. I am only rating it 4 stars since I had to use another strip, cut it in two, and apply on my cheeks just where the original strip ends. It works great but the strips need to be a little longer. After using, apply moisturizer."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't work at all","review":"I have been using Bioré pore strips for a while, but this box didn't work at all. After I apply the strips to my face and wait the recommended time, I can't release them since the \\"glue\\" is just a yucky mess and it's stuck to my face.

I don't know what happened this time, but it doesn't work at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It","review":"I found his product to be quite useful. I would recommend though that it should be used more than once a month as you would get the same effect as when u first used the strip"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work too well.","review":"Maybe I'm using it wrong, but it's hard to use and kind of annoying. I tried using it after shower, after steam-toweling my face, and nothing seems to really help. I used up the whole pack without getting any real results. Kiehl's Rare Earth Deep Pore Cleansing Masque works a lot better and easier for me, as well as being a more economical choice (that batch lasts forever!) Also, you really can't use the strips for other parts of your face, unlike with the mask. If you aren't already used to this, I'd say go the other route and get a pore cleansing mask or lotion or some other product that works better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe its just not for me","review":"I got these hoping it would clear my pores a bit or just help reduce any breakouts or oil buildup. But obviously these are more hype than anything. By the time you wash, scrub, and dry your face the issue is already fixed and these strips do nothing more than dry your nose out and make it sticky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only got to a few pores.","review":"We had bought a similar type product a few years ago and had amazing results, however, I couldn't remember what brand it was so I bought these instead. We were totally disappointed. It pulled stuff out from maybe 10 pores onto the strip. We felt as though this product was poor quality. If I had bought it at a store I probably would have returned it, but since it's online I don't want to go through the hassle of shipping it back. Waste of money. Would not buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's this supposed to do again?","review":"Couldn't resist giving this product a free star due to the cool feeling when drying on your nose...Otherwise, the results are pretty laughable. I'd recommend trying another product instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective for your nose!","review":"I was told by a woman who waked my eyebrows that I had a lot of blackheads - I had never really noticed, but it started to bother me, so I tried these strips. I was amazed by how much crap they pulled off my face! It was disgusting and fascinating at the same time. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it only covers your nose - I think I have blackheads on my cheeks too, and it would be nice if they would make strips for that too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"These strips simply don't work for me. They don't appear to remove any blackheads from the center of the nose, even when used promptly after a warm shower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"I guess this product doesn't work on some people. All it did was dry up and then peel off. Pores stillclogged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me :(","review":"My friend raved about these strips and convinced me to try them..I did, and nothing happened! I have an average about of blackheads around my nose and I thought the strips would get rid of them and I'd be able to see all the black gunk on the strip. I followed the directions to the T and yet they didn't remove any blackheads. The strip was clean when I took it off...and let me tell you, pulling the strip off hurts so bad!! My eyes started to water and my nose was pretty red.My nose was pretty smooth after though...but I don't think it was worth it. I will not buy these again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"These are perfect for getting those nasty black heads out, if you have a large enough nose... my nose is smaller than average and i had some difficulty applying the adhesive.

Great product, works great and now my nose is smooth and soft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highest Quality Pore Cleansing Strips On The Market","review":"My Wife and I both use the Biore Cleansing Pore Strips. These work wonderful. We have used Biore and Pond's and these work much better than the Pond's brand. It is unbelievable how much is dirt is under the skin on your nose. When used properly the strip is usually full and looks like a porcupine. They leave your nose clean and smooth and you can really feel the difference. You can also use these stips on other areas of your face as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"So I bought these just to get rid of some pesky blackheads, and they've largely done the job. Its a great product, it really does help with getting rid of blackheads, alot quicker than other products. Although it doesn't get rid of all your blackheads, this is the best blackhead removing product I have ever found, I really do recommend it to anyone who wants to free themselves from blackheads."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"These things work great. You will notice how effective they are immediately after you take them off. Make sure to apply lots of water to the area before putting them on, otherwise they won't stick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unblocked some pores temporarily","review":"The strips when used properly removes about 60% of the blackheads and unclogs pores. This is temporary though because the pores fill up just as quickly as they were unclogged and many times you'll end up with more blackheads than before. The only way to get clear pores is to use this often which can be irritating to the skin and time consuming, especially for guys. The best way to reduce blackheads is just using a scrubbing face wash a few times a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it But I'm not any prettier now.","review":"I thought if I start using all these girly products that I would magically just get prettier, and it's been like 4 months and I'm still the same.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT USE!","review":"Although, yes these strips work to get the dirt out of your pore, they stretch out your pores when you pull them off and getting rid of enlarged pores is almost impossible. And when you stretch out your pores it is easier for them to catch dirt and its just not good! Do more research!"},{"rating":"2","title":"works well if nose pores are VERY clogged","review":"Biore strips work well if your nose pores are really clogged. Like if you haven't used strips or mask or exfoliant in a long time. You can actually see the dirt and gunk from inside your pores get stuck on the strip when you remove it. It's kind of gross but also satisfying to know that all of that is not in your pores anymore.However, I feel like they aren't as satisfying if you use them regularly, or if you regularly use another pore-cleansing product (like a clay mask). If your pores aren't really clogged up, the strips don't do very much.They also leave my nose a tad sensitive, and leave a residue on my nose that I have to wash off afterwards.Definitely worth trying once... but I don't use them as part of my regular routine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"I was really disappointed by this product after hearing all the hype. I have very large pores on my nose and expected a lot of junk on the strip when I removed it. Nearly nothing. I need to try it again, and will update after I do, but it's hard to get motivated to use them again after the first experience. :-("},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good with multiple applications!","review":"These are like magic, in fact its kinda freaky the first time you do it because you can see the stuff that came out of your pores and they stand up due to the glue. These things are so much easier than sitting there for hours picking at blackheads. All you do is wet it, place it on your nose, wait 15 mins for it to dry then rip it off for your \\"surprise\\". I also recommendOxy Maximum Daily Cleansing Pads, 90 padsthese will keep those pores clean after removing them with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work pretty well","review":"These work pretty well. You do have to get your face really wet in order for them to really stick. Pulling them off hurts a little, but not too much. However, I've used the nose ones for my upper cheeks and it really hurts to take them off there. The nose is fine, though. When you pull them off, it feels great to see all the black heads on the strip. The wetter you got your face, the better it will stick and the more that will come off. It doesn't get rid of everything, but it definitely helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Pore Strips","review":"I give this product a 5 star because my mom really likes it. She now uses it on a weekly basis and when she first tried it,it removed 80% of her blackheads. Amazing! Just be careful when you try to remove the strips, don't do it the hard way,gently and take it slow, just as suggested on the back of the strips pack. Overall I believe this is the product that is essential for anyone, try it on a weekly basis and you won't get wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best pore strips","review":"I tried so many different pore strips and this one is definitely the best one.

I was surprised how much it hurt when I pulled it off. I thought it might pull the skin off my nose. I immediately became concerned about the broken capillaries around my nose. They were really red after pulling off the strip. Fortunately the redness has gone down and I don't think it did additional damage. It definitely did remove more blackheads which is why I gave this 4 stars.

I have compulsive issues with my skin and had been hoping that these strips would help, but... au contraire. Just catching sight of my nose now makes me feel slightly nauseated now, and of course that has been no help to the compulsions.

I simply wet my nose as the instructions said to do, put the strip on and forgot it for about 15 minutes. When I pulled it off I was shocked at what it had pulled from my pores. I put the strip under my 'day' lamp and a magnifying glass because it looked like dark stubbles of hair! Gross! Especially since I sure don't have any hair on my nose -- nor was all that black 'dirt' visible to my naked eye! I knew my pores were large there but I didn't know they were THAT bad. I'll be using this weekly now. My nose even felt smoother afterward as if the cleaned out pores had made the skin itself tighter.

Is it to save lost souls, to minister to the Christians,or to make money."},{"rating":"1","title":"what!","review":"my only question for Mr. Franklin is...what revolution are you talking about? God has already shaken up the world through his death, burial and resurrection. Just as His disciples thought He would overthrow the Roman empire, He instructed them that that was not His mission.

It is a shock to many because his style is different. He changed the status quo and taboos about the Christian faith and gospel music. We are in the last days and as a christian, I appreciate that someone is trying a different venue to reach out to our youth. Catching interest from the youth is not easy and music appeals to them. Once they have a haven, they can experience the whole ora of christendom. Kirk is trying to \\"save\\" the youth and many sit and criticize and do nothing but gossip. That is why our churches are falling apart. If many are ready to criticize, find a better way than his! We all must encourage each other...it is what Christ wanted in the first place. Christ said \\"go into the highways and byways...\\" Kirk is trying to do so and if the Holy Spirit leads him to do something, he will do it no matter what any common man says! GOD BLESS YOU ALL!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Liked all but one","review":"\\"Praise Joint\\" was a bit to ghettofied for me. Sure I do like urban style music, but we must remember that when trying to attract the world to gospel music we shouldn't disguise our message with a lout of beats and catch phrases. (ie Get your praise on!) I found it to be slightly insulting. But I especially loved \\"Lean On Me\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Kirk's Passion Gave Me An Idea","review":"Ok for starters, I'm 13, and I hadn't really connected with any gospel music until I heard Kirk Franklin! Now I love his music! I gives me something to think about while I'm having fun listening to one of my kind of cd's. I hadn't ever sung in front of any one until my friends asked me to sing Revolution and Lean On Me by Kirk! I was scared but I did it anyway, and now I'm part of my youth groups choir and band. I thank Kirk for all the great and absolutely wonderful cd's he's put out! His cd's give me strength to do my best for God! It helps remind me of how much I love God and gospel music! THANKS KIRK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent, Lively Performance","review":"A guy from Sudan recently enrolled in my school and brought this CD to school where my drama teacher played it between classes. According to the guy, this is popular music in Sudan. And I can't imagine why it isn't more popular in the United States. It's got rhythm and a nice message. It's 100% better than that Britney Spears style preppy band act that I am getting so tired of. This album is definately the best Christian album I've heard. I really like the unique style, and the background chorus will get you dancing. It definately has a hip-hop theme, which explains why it's so popular in Barbados and the U.S. Virgin Islands (at least someplace in America loves it.) Hurry and buy it today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It has gone another level.","review":"THIS IS FROM THE GOSPEL GROUP DAMASCUS FROM HOUSTON, TEXAS. Gospel music for a while was an old christians gospel. But right now it seems to me that we have found a true New Revolution of stars,rappers,R&B artist speaking up now. Kirk may not be the first one to preach this same gospel to these people, but he is most definitely the first one to reach the underground type as well as the elite in this way. James Cleveland and the Dynamic Clark Sisters are some of the early artists that paved the way for all of us, but Kirk has kicked the door down and now we are invading and attacking satan like crazy! It's on NOW!! Are you apart of the new Revolution?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiration","review":"This is one of the best gospel albums I have ever listened to. The songs are very inspiraring. You need this album, or CD, at home and listen to it all day long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore the beat and listen to the words!","review":"Kirk Franklin is true to his faith in God and Jesus Christ. People need to stop listening to the beat and listen to the words. As he says in \\"Praise Jint\\" you need to praise the Lord more and quit picking on small stuff. Artist like Kirk Franklin and DC Talk are relating to people of all ages. I personally don't like much hip hop music, but after listening to this album, I think I have a lot more respect for the music. This is a fantastic gospel album. Hip hop mixed with slower, melodic tunes make this one of the best gospel I've heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"perfect 'starter kit' for non-believers and baby Christians","review":"There is much merit in this recording for Babes in the faith walk. It will make you tap and feel good, and, on occassion, it does focus on the true reason why we should all have a hope. It conveys basic truth about the effects of Jesus in a format which is not 'heavy' nor threatening to the non-believer/Baby Christian and, from that perspective, it is an excellent album. However, if you're looking for spiritual upliftment this supreme production will not assist as it is sorely lacking in its incorporation of the Word of God which, in my view, characterises other 'successful' Gospel Albums. This is a slick production without the real 'Power' and, consequently, it is disappointingly limited. Nevertheless,it has its place in drawing the young and weak. But make no mistake this is Milk (high tech, funky urbanised beat, with all the latest bells and whistles) but still Milk and not Meat. A good witnessing tool but, it won't feed your Spirit."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the world but not of the World.","review":"I was very disappointed when I listened to this CD. There are about 15 songs on this CD, but only five were good. God calls His children to be in the world but not of the world. There is nothing wrong with shouting or dancing for God. But there is something very wrong when you take things of the world and use it to praise God. Most of Kirk Franklins beats came straight off some of the rap and R & B songs playing on the radio. There is no concord between light and darkeness. God calls his people to be peculiar. We should not seek worldly fame. When Kirk Franklin first came out I loved his music. But now it seems as if it is no longer about God. He seems as if it is all about him. This record is a far cry from his first album."},{"rating":"1","title":"No religion at all!!","review":"When Kirk Franklin first came on the scene I thought, this man is adding a dimension to gospel music. But with this latest album, especially with R. Kelly, Bono, Mary J. Bleige and others it just goes to show that now he's all about the money. The afore mentioned artist have about as much religion as Al Sharpton!! It's a shame that he has already forgotten where he came from, what he's been through and who holds the power. Maybe that stage fall did'nt knock some sense into him after all!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd is an inspiriation to my soul.","review":"Kirk Franklin knows just how to lift someones spirits up high.

I encourage everyone to get this cd. KLS"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice CD, but a little bit too secular for me.","review":"Kirk Franklin is a very talented young man. His music sounds too wordly. It's nice that he's trying to reach the young people, but they can't even tell the difference in what they already listen to, from what he's putting out. They have no reason not to listen to it. It sounds just like their kind of music. There is no anointing behind it. No lives are being changed, nobody is being set free and delivered. I just believe it dosen't take all of this to win souls. It's time for someone to stand up and make a difference the right way."},{"rating":"2","title":"I THINK THIS ALBUM HAS A GREAT MESSAGE","review":"I enjoy Kirk music and feel like there's nothing wrong with the way he express hisself. Just because it's up beat doesn't not mean it's not gospel."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's really gone over the limit this time!","review":"About 5 of the songs on this cd are okay.

Nu Nation may be a collection of heathen artists that certainly can sing and make (heathen) music, but one of the earlier reviewers is right, there's something VERY not right with him. He's a joke to the Almighty, as are those who have given him such positive reviews on this site and elsewhere, and when the rapture hits, trust me, Kirk will still be here trying to go platinum again. That said, if you're just into a good variety of African-American music types and don't mind the fact that he's not really about God, but indeed himself (and selling you this album) then you have a winner on your hand in this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Influential New Orleans Bluesman","review":"Eddie \\"Guitar Slim\\" Jones is probably the most influential New Orleans blues artists ever.

Very reminiscent of Ten Shekel Shirt, Downhere would fit in anyone's cd collection who already has Jennifer Knapp, Sonicflood, Ten Shekel Shirt, and Caedmon's Call. Although this cd has yet to be discovered by the masses, it's going to become a must have. The songs that these guys write are bound to become part of the next generation of worship cd compilations. You just can't pass these guys by.

I was looking for a cool, contemporary, real sound with a good, solid, not corny message. I listened to a lot of samples. And I made the perfect choice in downhere's self-titled album. Their sound reminds me at times of U2, Counting Crows, Neil Young, Creedence Clearwater, even Springsteen (ok, I have a great imagination...).The first track, \\"Larger Than Life,\\" is from the movie Joshua, which is where I heard these guys. Other great tracks are Protest to Praise, Raincoat and Making Me. I can listen to this stuff working out, even! The language is very common and natural,not preachy. Just right for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic collection of songs","review":"I have been a big fan of Downhere for several years and this CD is a testiment as to why. Every song on this CD speaks to me and has a real impact on me. Calmer of the Storm has to be my personal favorite as it really outlines how we need to live our life. Great Are You is a very widely known song and is a classic. This is a great CD and I highly recommend you support this band. You can tell the bands that make songs so they sound good but these guys are writing a message. Way to go guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"Downhere came to my church last night and gave us an awesome concert, so natrally I bought the CD right then and there. The CD isn't as good as seeing them live, but that's always the case.

Downhere rocks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Elevator music","review":"Unlike most artists, Downhere is getting better as time goes on! I purchased the newest C/D after hearing \\"my last amen\\" on the radio, not knowing that Downhere was already an established band! That C/D is awesome! So, I reseached them to see If they ever had released a previous C/D only to find that there were many! So, since the newest was SO good, I bought them all! Well besides a few rays of sunlight shining through here and there on previous C/D's, they just didn't have \\"it\\". I don't know what they changed on the new C/D, but EVERY song is acceptional! So kudos to finding yourselves (most artists best C/D's are there first, then dissapoint along the way), but unless you are an insomniac and need music to fall asleep to, I'd pass on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thundering anthems & honest ballads. Great songwriting!","review":"If you haven't checked out Downhere yet, you need to ASAP! These guys can wail, as on Larger Than Life. They can also be very transparent and open, on Calmer of the Storm. Downhere is one of the rare occurances of great music and a great message combined together. Their sound suggests elements of Third Day, Train, and (dare I say it) the Barenaked Ladies. There's also a subtle but sure influence from the music of U2.What are you waiting for - this is great stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"What can I tell you about downhere? I saw U2 back in 1987 at the Hoosier Dome with the other 45,000 concertgoers and even though U2 was playing for 45,000 they had a way of connecting with the audience to make you feel like they were performing for just you. Well, Downhere has that same gift. It's difficult to explain and that's why I highly recommend seeing them live! If concerts aren't your thing, it least go get a couple, or all, of their CDs. On this indie release I really like the version of Larger Than Life. It rocks a bit more especially after the bridge! You just can't go wrong buying any of their CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"This album is great from start to finish.

Don't get me wrong I heard Sugar, we're going down and Dance, Dance, Dance on the radio...but I never really liked Fall Out Boy. Then this gem came out...and I can't stop listening to it. I even bought 2 Fall Out Boy shirts and a ringtone all from this album cause I can't get enough. You might not be able to understand what the heck the singer is saying...but half the fun is making up your own lyrics. The beat is what I love. The songs are so catchy.Bang the DoldrumsThanks for the MemoriesThis ain't a sceneCarpal Tunnel of LoveThe take over, the Breaks overThese are the best ones in my opinion.

With singles like Sugar We're Goin' Down and Dance Dance, I feared fall out boy had found a formula to exploit for infinity on high...Thank God I was wrong. Instead of taking the easy/safe route for this album, fob decided to branch out and evolve their style and sound. This album is much more complex and layered than their previous attempts. Musically this is by far their best work. Lyrics are still very good. Why this album gets five stars is because they walked away from their bread and butter a bit, and ventured into the realm of rock, good hooks> catchy hooks, and they stopped complaning about their ex-girlfriends and how they should die, not that I didn't love Take This To Your Grave, but it's nice to hear something new!

The package had not been tampered with and there was a receipt inside for the purchased album but alas no actual product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Think for yourself.","review":"(Im giving this album 5 stars just to give it a boost thanks to the jackass' giving it negative reviews based on nothing. 4 stars.)This album comes with heavy anticipation and Fall Out Boy dont disappoint. Hear me out. Yes, the band is uber famous. Yes, Pete Wentz can be a media [...]. Forget all the [...] and listen to the MUSIC.Im not gonna make this long but Infinity on High IS better then From Under the Cork Tree. By a long shot! For example, listen to song like \\"You're Crashing but You're No Wave\\". Truely epic.The reviewer who said \\"Fall Out Boy are head and shoulders above their competition\\" is right on base. It is pop music at its finest and no one among their peers comes close.Simply put, if you're looking for an album with no lack of hooks and a GOOD TIME that listening to records use to bring us before we all got jaded, pick this album up. Listen with open ears and mind. You wont be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"god awful...","review":"There simply is no other way to put it. Anyone who says they can understand one sentence Patrick Stump is able to muster out of that nonsensical mouth is lying. You know, I don't think I hate Fall Out Boy that much. Sure their music sucks and they need to put the eyeliner down, but they're not the problem. It's the fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible!!","review":"OMFG!! do NOT buy this trash its horrible emo krap! seriosly i returned this album as soon as i lisin to it"},{"rating":"1","title":"a fever surpasses infinity","review":"I was a big fan of under the cork tree, so i got this album...I'll admit that im into pop music so get over it already! This band does make pop songs and does make rock songs, and honestly, i was expecting some songs to AT LEAST sound like their previous tracks like \\"this aint a scene\\" or \\"dance, dance\\" but the songs, although original, are not that great. Speaking from a person that likes catchy tunes, this album really disappoints. It certainly has prototypical Panic! at the disco elements, meaning some theatrical songs. At times, i thought i was also listening to Gym Class heroes. Overall, I wouldnt buy this album. If you are smart, you would burn this album instead of buying it because its really not worth it if you are into catchy songs. I hope this helps!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They've sold out, gone mainstream, lost their sound","review":"Take This To Your Grave was amazing. I still listen to that disc from start to finish, nearly once a week. From Under The Cork Tree began the pop, girly, emo, and lets face it, annoying trend that all bands begin when they get their hands on the almighty dollar. This album...I'm ashamed to say that I even know their name anymore. They've lost touch with everything that got them started in music.Oh yes, it will make money, it will be on charts, people will love it. You'll all rip it to mp3, or download it, then add it to your white colored evil (othewise known as ipods). This is what we call \\"trendy.\\" Enjoy being clones."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD Music Review","review":"Product was as stated and a good price..Shipment was fast and no damgage to the CD...would use this company again. thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I'm a bit behind-the-times on getting this CD. My daughter owned it and after having listened to it in her car I fell in love with it and had to have one of my own. Great CD! This band has an awesome singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"They didn't choke!","review":"Alot of bands blow it following a breakthru cd,These guys didn't.Really good cd with some great songs.A real musical growth.Track 4 ....(Me and you)will be huge.Great job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tastes bitter","review":"Horrible album, I don't know how it has gotten so high on the music charts. Truly awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like Pop music, you might like this.","review":"It seems that other than a song or two, Fall Out Boy forgot their guitar's. Very disappointing and slow paced."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible, go back to the original","review":"Fall Out Boy has gone way down hill since Take This To Your Grave. Its to poppy and emo, the new stuff is made for girls. I wish they'd go back to the more upbeat sound with a little screaming like in \\"Saturday\\" this new stuff is trash"},{"rating":"1","title":"List it right","review":"We did a search on Amazon for book book music for the listed band and this was offered which also made mention of note music. Turns out it was a CD from the band and not a guitar book as we assumed. Not sure if it was an intentional fake out or accidental but it was a waste of time for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"FOB lost the formula for growing older","review":"Folks - you listen to this disk and then fire up From Under The Cork Tree - and this is crap. Honest. Any song from the last album SMOKES everthing on this disk. What a total letdown. These guys went from one of my favorite bands to one that I can't listen to anymore - I mean - this is absolute crap. I have listened to this new disk about 6-7 times and the magic from Under The Cork Tree is spent. Do yourslef a favor and don't buy this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst album ever!!!!!!!!","review":"omg this was the worst cd..... I can't believe I wasted my money on this. All of the songs sound exactly the same. There is like only 2 good songs on this whole cd. boooooooooooo........... don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"FOB is now part of today's great bands","review":"I do not listen to that much music going on radio because I often feel like everything sounds the same in today's commercial music.With \\"From Under the Cork Tree\\" and the unforgettable \\"Dance Dance\\", FOB took a spot on the map of the music industry. With this new album, the band shows once more a great creative sense and variety. Except for a few repetitive guitar riffs, the album sounds great, new and innovative in the \\"above average quality category\\" of alternative music.I am pretty sure FOB will get more and more popular with this one and I hope to hear a new album soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Infinity On High-good,not great","review":"This record to me is just Patrick(the singer) showing off his voice. On Take This To Your Grave I felt some deeper meaning but From Under the Cork Tree and Infinity On High seem to lack this. Still great hooks due to Patrick's amazing voice, but the music is just unique,good lyrics and Patrick singing well. I still enjoy Fall Out Boy but this record wasn't playing constantly weeks after I bought it like Take This To Your Grave did(and is, Take This To Your Grave is my favorite album to date). So if you are like me, enjoy the hooks and go back to their earlier works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like OMG!!!","review":"OMG, Fall Out Boy used to be sooooooo good, but this album isnt good. Like...why cant it just be a full album of Pete Wentz just reading his diary? I like to listen to FoB when Im doing my makeup, and then I dance around my room, and like omg so much fun! I hope the next one ruleeez, I love you Fall Out booooooyy!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bunch of whiners.","review":"Fall Out Boy is one of the worst bands ever! The lead singer can't sing for the life of him, the guitars sound horrible, and the songs are so stupid. This kind of music sucks, enough said!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not music nothing nada and not even nada surf move along now people","review":"the most overhyped album of the century next to chumbawumba and the titanic soundtrack. no creativity here and the music just plain is horrible, nonsense takes on a new meaning with these posers. Almost as bad as system of a down but dummer than justin timberlake. do not waste your money and if you want talent look elsewhere. hard to believe people even buy this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF...","review":".. happened to these guys? Lost their angst, their grit, their punk. Overproduced and f*cking boring. I'm glad I listened to the tracks before I bought the album.If you like mainstream drivel, this album is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Stars Because At Least It's Not Rap","review":"I picked up the new Fall Out Boy album today with pretty high hopes that they might go back towards their sound from Take This To Your Grave. From Under the Cork Tree wasn't for me, and Infity On High is more of that trash only even more overproduced. I don't know that I've ever actually listened to a CD and thought: \\"Wow, they really ruined this with a bunch of overproduction.\\" Well, now I have. Infinity On High is not fun to listen to, and that's what I liked about Take This To Your Grave. On this new release Patrick sounds like he's trying really hard to sound like that guy from Maroon 5. Maroon 5 is bad enough, but when someone is trying to sound like them it makes me want to kill myself. Also, Andy's drums are nothing more than mediocre on this album (when they were pretty incredible on Take This To Your Grave).Anyway, if you're a Fall Out Boy fan you might like their new sound, but it's not for me. I give it two stars because at least it's a rock record."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY BUY ?","review":"When you can listen to their commercials for toilet paper, hemorrhoid medicines and the Best Buy chain?"},{"rating":"2","title":"don't care about the hype,this is good stuff","review":"FIRST:i bought the limited edition when it was priced 9.99 and i don't think you should spend a dollar more for the limited edition since it's not worth it (a few cards and a bigger package.that's it)SECOND:i really don't care about the hype surronding these guys,and i couldn't care less about their image. i just know them a few years now and this album is really good. they have progressed alot, and by alot i mean i now can actually can see them NOT vanishing any time soon.great cd for running by the way..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Infinity On Hiiiigh","review":"I've been waiting for this cd to come out for months and it was deffinitly worth the wait! I pre-ordered it online last Monday, 2/5 and I got it in the mail today. I love it! :]"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to FOB","review":"First time I heard this album, I was like, \\"This is pretty good, I like it.\\"Then, from the recommendation of my friends I listened to FOB's first full length album Take This To Your Grave. There is no comparing the two, the first is so much better. If you like this album, you should listen to their better and less popular album Take This To Your Grave.Other than that, this album tends to be way better than most of the mainstream junk out there.Recommendations (Not in order from best to worst):1) Carpal Tunnels of Love2)Do You Know Who I Think I Am?3)Thks Fr th Mmrs4)Fame<Infamyand...Listen to Take This To Your GraveOther than that...LOL ZOMG I LIKE FOOD!!!111onetwo!111!11eleventy!1"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one..","review":"Just buy the singles that you like on the radio.

Beautiful design but just doesn't work with many applications. Due to steel braiding you must ground the wires.

That said, it is surprising more people haven't taken notice to the amount of propaganda our government spreads, and with our taxes. While Fraser gives many examples of past activites he also cites some current ones, leaves you wanting to know what/who is influencing my opinions without trying to do just that himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"1- I'm sorry but i found it to be a very boring book.2- The author's opinion is not consistent with the title, which is somehow deceiving to sell."},{"rating":"2","title":"RAVE REVIEW","review":"TRINI TRIGGS IS AN UP-COMING STAR. HE HAS REALLY OUTDONE HIMSELF WITH STRAIGHT TEQUILA. HE PUTS SO MUCH FEELING AND SOUL INTO HIS MUSIC. HIS VOICE IS SO ENERGETIC.

I AM SURE THAT THERE WILL BE MORE TO COME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not good at all","review":"With weak lyrics poor guitar and to much attempt to emulate other artists in a sad attempt to attach himself to annyone who would listen to his horrible cries into a microphone.

We must hear more of Mr. Triggs.","review":"I have been looking for the album with this song for quite sometime. It does not seem to be available.

So much better than watching TV. No commercials here. Love Atlantis and will watch over and over again. If you loved StarGate SG1 you'll love StarGate Atlantis."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted alantis to get it","review":"The one star gets it right. The behavior of the characters in Alantis needs improvement, I hate what they did to the one character I felt was done right but the replacement isn't bad and the actor is decent. The problem is Alantis needs it's comedic episodes and Shaaka type episodes of Sg1 instead of the rodney character constant and insistant rants. It makes the show predictable and dull, I do like the lead of this show. He would have been better then Ben browder as a replacement for Oneill.the episode itself is dumb, boring and lame. The problem and solution are a bit far fetched, based on what's been shown it was incorrect. Needless to say the episode could have been entertaining if the mckay character had a better actor. I don't get the writers of this show at all. They either do the geeks as know it all jerks or know it all fembots. How about smart and normal for a change......just a thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"welll","review":"another great season, so whos the reason because the spanish lenguaje its not include? only french!, here in latin america a lot of people see star gate on fox and universal channel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parker, Stevens!

There are screams and no responses to his calls \\"Parker, Stevens! Do you copy?!\\" So, without even hesitating, Lorne lobs a grenade into the cave. So long Parker and Stevens--you weren't even redshirt dispensable. You were disposable, baby. That was the only memorable thing about this episode. Some kind of BS plot ran through out the episode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupidity squared","review":"I can't say how bad this episode is, but... it sucked so very, very much.
