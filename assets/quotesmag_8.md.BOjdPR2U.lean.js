In this way, we can often reconfigure an area so that it better serves its intended function without resorting to expensive remodeling projects. But why on earth are there no illustrations or photos at all? The author describes countless examples of homes across America, both landmark sites (such as Washington's Mount Vernon and Jefferson's Monticello) and homes that could be in our own neighborhoods, but the point she is trying to make is often lost among the words when a simple photo or two would have worked beautifully. I'm holding off on buying this book in hopes that the paperback edition will include the photos that should have been included in the first release."},{"rating":"2","title":"The psychology of a living room","review":"Plenty of books focus on interior decorating or rooms which look good: HOUSE THINKING: A ROOM BY ROOM LOOK AT HOW WE LIVE focuses on the feel of living spaces, providing a psychological house tour which pairs renovation and design concerns with psychological and the social impact of a home's arrangements. Her behavior-oriented approach to rooms borders on feng shui but goes further in drawing important connections between design and human health and purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understanding our spaces","review":"Enjoyed this book a lot though it is not a \\"decorating book\\" in the usual sense. I agree pictures would have been a delightful addition but I can see how it would have increased the costs and size of the book too much to be affordable. I found the insights into how our home spaces have evolved over time, and why we use them the way we do to be very entertaining. This book helps you think about how you use your space, and what feels good and right to you so your choices in decorating, remodeling or purchasing a home can be more deliberate. (You may actually understand why you fell in love with a house, or one room just feels so good, and another so bad!) It is easy to read and so entertaining, I hated to put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Garbage","review":"It can't pump tires on a real bike. It says 115 psi but I can't get 90 out of it.

High pressure and high volume settings.CONS: This product comes with little in the way of directions, and is not 100% self-explanatory. I took the pump to my local bike store, and one of the technicians there showed me that you need to place the pump onto the valve and *then* twist it to the \\"on\\" position (with the gauge facing the side of the pump that you are using). With the Schraeder valve side, the pump can put out ~30psi at best before air leaks around the O-ring that keeps the valve in place. Considering that it is a chore to get the pump onto the valve in the first place, this is disappointing. This pump will allow you to get enough air in your tire to get home, but do not expect to get ideal (60-80psi in my case) tire pressure using this pump alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool design - terrible function","review":"Heavy, clunky, poor mounting.

This book clearly presents the difficult life of one incredible woman who struggles to do her part to free all slaves, gain respect as a woman and be accepted as a human being."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nearly Perfect Book","review":"When I read a book, I want to get a lot out of it, as I enjoy the reading of it. On the second point: this book is engagingly written. The author questions her own motives and information as she constructs a biography of a difficult life to document. We see Painter confront the challenges of performing biography. I found it a compelling literary device. On the first point, the book mixes biography with history and feminist criticism. This interdisciplinary focus produces a highly inviting book. Among other topics, we find out about the details of slavery in the North, 19th century religious cults, and the ways in which feminists and abolitionists of the time exploited Truth for their own gain, as well as how this appropriation of \\"Truth\\" continues to the present. On this point, we learn much about contemporary feminism and culture and its need for heroes-especially African American female heroes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superseded by Margaret Washington's 2009 bio","review":"I used to love this book and found it very compelling when I read it several years ago. However, Margaret Washington's new (2009) biography of Truth vets the historical sources far more carefully. Washington's work has the effect of overturning much of what Painter presents as \\"truth\\" (pun intended) and offering a much fuller, more contextualized, and more convincing narrative of Truth's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Award Winner","review":"The Black Caucus of the American Library Association (BCALA) awarded this book its 1997 Nonfiction award.

What a refreshing surprise purchasing this dolly. Not only is it's pricing incredibly reasonable, it is built really well. All the legs glide smoothly from their folded up position (carrying handle is a great feature) in it's little carrying case, to extended rolling position. Wheels also change direction smoothly, without that typical \\"shopping cart wrestling match\\" that caster wheels are notorious for. All of the materials feel very smooth and solid. If you aren't sure whether or not to buy this dolly, just do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good features, but not smooth","review":"You get what you pay for. Pros: great price, compact, easy to use. Cons: small wheels, just not smooth enough. Isn't smooth enough on a perfectly smooth floor, so any cracks or crumbs or anything on the floor and it defeats the purpose of the dolly because it's bumby and shakey (this is taking into account that you are filming while moving. If you only need the dolly to move easier while not filming then this would be a great product). Other con is that these castors (wheels) are not designed to be easily removed and thus replaced with others such as air tires."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good! But...","review":"This is terrific for holding your tripod stable, and allowing you to move it easily. Here are my pros and cons for this product:Pros:SturdySteelEasy to lock tripod legs inFolds and easy to storeMake moving tripod around a breezeGreat for panning shots over super-smooth surfacesCons:Don't try moving shots over anything bumpier than smooth glassWish wheels had a little more give so that every bump isn't transferred to the camera; maybe something like urethaneThe price changes are all over the map!That's about it for the cons, but not being able to do panning shots is a big disappointment.

I couldn't sit through the thing, it was absolutely painful. I have many problems with the film but I will concentrate on the most glaring error. In all of the Pimpernel books, Sir Percy manages to get the aristocrats out of France in all sorts of witty and devious ways. None of these ways include running into the room in front of the guards and fighting out. Also, in all the books I've read, the people who are helping Percy are never caught. Some are even unaware that they are helping the Scarlet Pimpernel. It would have been nice if the movie sort of followed the books, but it didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Adaptations of a Famous Classic","review":"While the movies in this boxed set are not the best Scarlet Pimpernel movies ever made, this is still a very good series of made for TV movies in its own right. Richard E. Grant is well cast as the Pimpernel while Elizabeth McGovern dazzles as Marguerite. The acting and direction is just short of excellent. The problem I have is that the scripts do not have too many good lines and they appear to have been written by hacks. This is a shame since the Pimpernel series was a most well-written series of novels. Still, the movies in this boxed DVD set are better than most of what you will find on TV these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are You insane?","review":"I should not have even given this insult of a movie one star, but I think that was my only choice. This movie and whole set does not even deserve the name of the Scarlet Pimpernel. Percy is supposed to blend in to the crowds of Paris. With his black cape and red mask, he sticks out like a sore thumb. Did anyone read the book? I have nothing personal against Ms. McGovern, but, well, I'm sure that there were better choices during auditions. I suppose that if you were in the mood for an insult to filmaking and hadn't heard of the Scarlet Pimpernel before, this may not be a bad movie, but if you even know a bit of the story, Percy never killed anyone really, and none of his friends would have died. I don't recommend it, but if you don't believe me, go ahead and find out for yourself, but I'm pretty sure that you'll regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the 1930's version instead","review":"Our entire family read the book and then decided to watchthe video.

I was sadly mistaken.The 1930's video, though dated, had superb acting andfollowed the story-line of the book almost entirely.I didn't even recognize the plot in this version, it differedso much from the book...including characters.

The Andrews one left me cold.I know a lot of people look at Mr Grant and only see and evil or as one put it, sniviling character.If you ever read the book you will see a rather unsexy story.Aristocrats in that day and age did not show a lot of emotion in public..in fact they kept seperate sleeping apts and a lot of times married not for love but for money and title. Ever since I rented this version ive wanted to own it.I finally found a like new, used, set and gobbled it up.

This movie brings out all of the fine points of Baroness Orczy's fabulous tale. Richard E. Grant is hilarious and dashing. The attention to historical details are, for the most part, accurate. Those interested in the French Revolution will be tickled to hear \\"ca ira\\" played throughout the first episode. They will also enjoy the actor who plays the diabolical Robespierre, his dead eyes and foppish attire seem to capture the essence of the Incorruptible.If you are looking for a swashbuckling tale, this set is for you.

They dare call this The Scarlet Pimpernel? Richard E. Grant, while a good actor, is not at all suited to play Percy. And Elizabeth McGovern, whom I had never heard of, is no where near what Marguerite should be like. .... Beside the character flaws, the lack of facts was ridiculous. 'La Force Prison'? 'Blakeney Manor'? And the costumes! Un-historical and most certianly not accurate. If you are new to Pimpernel, I beg of you, find one of the other spectacular versions. Read the book. See the musical. Just don't waste your time and money on this peice of trash. ....The Scarlet Pimpernel, the world's first masked hero, should be told of in a far better way than this. Besides, Richard E. Grant's cravat, as Sir Percy would say, was \\"stickin' out like a pincushion!\\" A disgrace to the name of the Pimpernel. ~*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Enjoyable!","review":"When I first watched this movie, I had not yet read the book. I was confused by the beginning since I did not know the background of how Sir Percy and Lady Marguerite met. I really think they could have done a better job of introducing all the characters and the storyline. I was also slightly put off by Elizabeth McGovern and the way they did her hair in several scenes--definitely did not make her beautiful! Also, I wondered if she was a bit too old for the part. But as the story progressed and I saw more of the interraction between Marguerite and Percy as well as the excellent acting, I was completely hooked! Marguerite wasn't just some pretty airhead. She was smart and resourceful. All of the other supporting characters were wonderful as well. Richard E. Grant is superb in this role and I will definitely look for his other films. Can't wait until season 2 comes out on DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with the books or the Jane Seymour version","review":"In France Percy did way too much shooting and not enough thinking. The Scarlet Pimpernel is supposed to be a master of diguise, yet we never saw him don one, instead we got 007 type hidden weapons and accompanying fight scenes. Now I like James Bond, but that's not Percy's style.That said, I really enjoyed the 2nd film, the hints of Chauvelin's past and the delima he ends up facing are simply marvelous... still something's wrong when the villian is the character who won most of my sympathies."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love the books, you'll enjoy these movies!","review":"I've always enjoyed Orczy's novels, and I found this adaptation to be the most satisfying of the movies based on her work.

I love the story, adore the book, and liked the old black and white version. I would like to say first, the costumes are terrific, the cinematography is good, but the actors are stuck with questionable lines. That is not to say that the dandies are not dandy and the ladies are not of questionable morrals. I would like nothing more than to recommend this DVD set to friends and strangers alike, but even my Anglophyle friends have not been able to get past the first DVD in this boxset."},{"rating":"2","title":"I fell for him...","review":"Although I bought this box set JUST to see Ronan Vibert's portrayal of Robespierre, I was taken aback by The Scarlet Pimpernel himself, and all of the stories.Romantic very rarely, he was mostly so posh and funny and very handy with that sword of his, I loved Mm. Guillotine the most.Yes, I did LOVE Ronan's character as well, as evil as he was, and in the Kidnapped King he was the VERY best - he even cracks and it's great to see his uptight Robespierre begin to get a little rough around the edges and show his real nature.I absolutely fell for Richard E. Grant as the damned elusive Pimpernel, and kind of liked the evil cold-hearted Robespierre.This, to me, was a very fun set, and wish I could have seen the actual television show with the guys...Oooo - it's SO not a waste of your time or money.

I kept thinking, \\"Put this turkey down. But no, what if it gets better?\\" So I kept reading. Well, guess what? It never gets better. The primary action in the story appears to be shrugging. It is by far the most prevalent verb. The word shrug is probably used about 80 times (I'm being conservative in my estimate). And that that about sums it up. Lot's of pointless dialog between chatty demons, lots of indecision, and tons of shrugging. Epic conflict between Heaven and Hell? Not here, my friends. Tedium? By the boat load.

I've seen the idea done much better and with a much tighter, interesting story than \\"Gee, I'm just going to go kill a bunch of people instead of opening a simple line of communication!\\" Heck, go read something by Gaiman instead (Sandman or Books of Magic).Two stars - one for the fact that at least I got through it, even if I was wondering why I bothered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"As I write this review, this book is showing an average rating of 4 stars.

But, you can just feel the author trying to cram the plot in to fit the established framework. There's also almost nothing in the book which talks about WHY the characters are acting as they do. Mostly, it's about WHAT they do and isn't it clever how it meshes with the accepted interpretation. Since most of what the characters are doing is pretty sophomoric, having a better idea of their motivations is essential. Some of the anthropomorphisms are absurd, too (i.e., assuming pre-Earth angels would act as we do, make things of steel, and light their homes with torches is ridiculous).Since I rate this book at a mere 2 stars out of 5, I'd say that if you want to read it, get it from the library and save yourself a bundle."},{"rating":"1","title":"walking and talking","review":"I could hardly keep the characters straight. Not enough character development. I didn't care, I don't care and I am very near the end where all the drama is and I still don't care."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe the reviews","review":"I have read several of Steven Brust's books and have never found him to be a good fantasy writer - if you want a good fantasy writer read Katherine Kerr or Stephen Lawhead. [...]It left too many questions unanswered (or ignored). For example, WHY did the First Wave appear? Why were the more complex and powerful angels created first? How could beings who could barely hold Heaven together create suns, planets, and galaxies while simultaneously getting rid of the chaos that had threatened Heaven? Suspension of disbelief is one thing; suspension of intelligence is another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um... It was AWFUL - Wish I could give it NO stars","review":"I read this book when I found it. It was a book \\"gifted\\". That is to say, a book that no one wanted in their house because it was that bad. (We just got gifted with the movie \\"Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter\\", to give you an idea.) So I am real suspicious of the positive reviewers.The premise could have worked. I have no problem with that. But the writing is so POOR and convoluted that I was gagging while trying to read it. I had no idea to the characters motivations. Even the characters from the 1930s and 1940s Space Operas were better drawn than these characters. I found myself not caring one iota about any of the folks portrayed.Save your money and DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME with this one. If you want good religious science fiction read Octavia Butler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Worthless, unengaging piece of trash, equal to his other works.

At best it's a mildly diverting fantasy story -- an attempt at constructing a mythology that falls more than a little short of the classic old myths.

I don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"The story of the Revolt of the Angels.","review":"The story can now be told. How hell came about, and how Satan was tarnished. But, it was not his fault, and God knew. Steven Brust has written one of the finest books I have read in ages, and does not make a meal of it either, by beign either too cute, or too trite. His story should rank as one of the finest in the world!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just not that good","review":"I don't for the life of me see how all of these reviews could be giving this 5 stars. The review comparing it to a 3's Company episode is much more accurate.How is it that one minor angel mangages to fool all of the top angels and just happen to be in the right place so many times? Very weak plot line! I don't see where the imagination is other that the setting which is fleshed out quite well.For about the first 1/4 of book I was exicited about the story due to the setting, but once Brust started down his plot line I got more and more frustrated. I really did not enjoy this book.Notice that most of the 5 star reviews all mention \\"don't lend out this book\\", I suspect that there is a single person who is writing most of these. That must be it... there can't be this many people who really believe this is a great book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy This Book Now!!","review":"I read To Reign in Hell in a day. It was excellect. So good in fact that i couldn't put it down. Do yourself a favor and buy this book today."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Reign In Thought","review":"Stephen Brust's work is assuredly a quick, entertaining read about Lord Satan's (inadvertant?) failed coup of Heaven. With sharp prose and a remarkable sense of humor, Brust makes the most of telling the tale that took place before the events of the Bible but weaving consistently throughout his book foreshadowing of what the Bible says happened and has yet to happen. While the book might not find much support among the religious community, fantasy fans can read the book entirely guiltfree and enjoy what a gifted writer can do with a relatively elementary premise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster","review":"This book did not live up to any of my expectations.

I would have to say that for such a potentially exciting topic; this book is a real waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ambitious and gripping!","review":"I thought it looked interesting, so I gave it a go. I was absolutely not disappointed. Though the beginning was slightly bland, a chapter into it, I could not put it down. It's an epic tale told in an interesting way, with a view on it in the end that both surprises and intrigues.The writing's a lot different from what I've seen in most of Brust's other books, but the unique style suited the subject matter at hand.If you want an epic retelling of an old tale with a new sort of twist, pick this one up.

If you want a book for inspiration in growing locs, buy this book!

This book gives a start to finish description from how to start dreads, to how to care for them, some products to use on your hair, how to repair damage to your dreads, and hair coloring concerns. The book provides overall inspiration for those thinking about starting the process and gives good advice for those that already have dreads. (The book was highly recommended by someone who has had her dreads for 13 years). The book is small so it doesn't cover all the ways of starting dreads for instance, however, I found it complete, easy to follow, and a down-to-earth honest read about locking one's hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!","review":"I made the mistake of buying this book.

Ideally. The stories should also be written with correct grammar. Minimally. These stories lack all of the above. This collection reads like a series of assignments given to high school creative writing classes. Most of these stories are just a good start, but not a satisfying finish.

Perhaps there is some sort of scholarly argument that can be made about this approach being more historically accurate although I doubt it. The drums are extremely distracting and make most of the pieces sounds more like war-marches than dances.

It was fairly easy to use, but a pain to re-set the date/time stamp all the time as I live in a rural area where it's not unusual to lose power. The biggest problems I had were a) poor recording quality -- Messages were very difficult to understand, and B) messages are regularly cut off during recording if the person speaking wasn't talking VERY LOUDLY. I'm talking dropped calls when people were speaking in a normal tone of voice. I buy products to last, and to do their job well.

The only problem - they are a bit pricey. They cost 22.4 cents per sheet (11.2 cents per label) with free super saver shipping here on amazon. I have purchased self adhesive half-sheet shipping labels for 5 cents per sheet (2.5 cents per label) that work just as well (I have shippped over 4,000 items using these labels with no problems at all). The only difference I have noticed is that these Avery labels are heavier weight paper and have a dark backing that is better at covering up previous labels when reusing boxes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avery Shipping Labels","review":"I ordered these labels to use for shippin packages.

Have used generic ones and they always just don't last.. peels off after time but these Averys wont do that.

One lost package will cost you a lot more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does exactly what it claims.","review":"The thought of a special \\"internet\\" label might be a little silly, but if you do a lot of shipping and reuse boxes, this product is very convenient. It does cover the label under it thoroughly, and you cannot read through it. However, a diligent person certainly could lift the label off and most likely see at least part of the old label. But i'm not sure why anyone would bother to do that.The appeal of these labels is certainly not widespread, but for those that do a lot of shipping, this is well worth the expense (and they are expensive) because you'll save a great deal of time by just slapping these on over older labels. Those boxes can really add up, so this is a way to reuse without much hassle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for reusing boxes, and no waste.","review":"Like others who have written reviews,I am an occasional eBay seller.

Another good thing is the back of the labels are a grey opaque to cover over other labels well."},{"rating":"2","title":"TrueBlock comes in handy","review":"I have found that the TrueBlock line of products comes in handy when re-using boxes. Labels from this product line are thick enough to completely cover old labels. They also tend to peel very easily from the sheet, but to stick very securely to packages. I have not had a single label jam in the printer. Finally, they seem to resist wrinkling while being applied to boxes better that any other label I have used.These labels though come in handy in a number of different cases. First, you get a lot of surface area. That has allowed me to include some graphics on labels that just would not fit on standard mailing labels. My labels are now a much more effective communication medium for my brand. These labels will also actually work effectively as mailing label/box sealer for smaller boxes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, but cut in two for less waste","review":"This is a great product. In order to reduce waste, (each sheet has 2 labels) I cut the sheet in half, and tape it to a sheet of regular paper. Your label prints, and the details are on the paper. Separate the label, file the backup. Voila! Saves money, and is better for the environment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great multi-purpose labels","review":"These labels are great for things like the USPS Click-N-Ship service, UPS, or FedEx shipping labels. They're great in that they don't limit use to any particular service.The TrueBlock technology allows me to easily use existing boxes to either return a product or use it for shipping something else. Other labels would frequently let some of the old label show throughIf you do a lot of mailing with Click-N-Ship, shipping, or return items, the time and ease of these labels is well worth the cost. It's much, much easier and faster than printing the label, cutting or folding to be the right size, and taping it to the envelope or box.In the case of Click-N-Ship, it's great being able to print the label for a Priority Mail or Express Mail box or envelope, go to the Post Office to get the box or envelope and just affix the pre-printed label. It's much easier than trying to find tape or bring tape with me to the Post Office."},{"rating":"1","title":"peels easily from USPS Priority Mailers.","review":"These labels are nice quality and print very well from my ink jet printer. HOWEVER, they don't adhere securely to the free Priority Mail Envelopes that are made of Tyvek. They just peel right off.

The defeats the purpose of buying these, might as well use plain paper and save the $."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't stick well","review":"I purchased these labels so I would no longer need to use shipping tape to adhere labels printed on regular paper. Unfortunately, I've found that it is very easy to lift the corner and peel the label off of the surface of the package or envelope. I've used these labels on cardboard boxes, paper envelopes and plastic envelopes - the label does not stick well to any of these surfaces. Often, by the time I get to the post office, the corners of the label are already lifting all on their own. Consequently, I am still putting tape over the label to insure it does not fall off on its way trough the postal system, completely defeating the point of using an adhesive label in the first place, especially one that costs more than the plain piece of paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it looks","review":"I was so excited to get this for my daughter for Christmas.

The Ace through the 10 are pretty standard. All four Jacks feature Senator Allen Thurman of Ohio. (He was Cleveland's running mate.) Cleveland's wife, Frances Folsom, appears on the Queens. And finally, Grover Cleveland himself appears on the Kings. Portraying a President as a King could have produced a backlash.

So, i went online and found this one. The circumference of the coil is much smaller than my older one, and the coils are very tight. As a result, it doesn't pull open as easily as my older one, and you almost have to fight with it to get it to reach anywhere further than about 5 feet! I only use it on my porch, and my other one ( 25ft) works great, but this one simply would not reach.

The motor is noisy and there is a constant scratching noise on the recording--it is very unpleasant to listen to.

I couldn't even finish it and found it to be a waste of money. Worst of all was picture that showed Michelle Kwan crying next to Tara with her huge grin. I thought that in poor taste and a horride-over-the-top addition to a totally horrible book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tara totally full of herself","review":"I was totally disgusted by the picture of Michelle Kwan crying and Tara next to her with a cheshire cat smile on her face. True, Tara skated ok at the Olympics, but I think that when people look back at the Nagano Olympics people will remember Michelle Kwan and the admirable way she handled herself when she won the silver medal more than people will remember Tara Lipinski and her winning the gold medal. Besides, Tara is very childish. When she won, she started screaming and jumping up and down like a two-year-old throwing a temper tantrum. That's our gold medalist? God help us all."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought it was a nice book about Tara's experiences....","review":"....UNTIL I saw that picture of Michelle Kwan that has been mentioned in several other reviews. I'm sorry but why on earth was that necessary to include in a book about TARA? It seemed to me to be a rather immature thing to do, if you've won the gold medal why on earth would you be interested in anything but enjoying that medal, instead of \\"rubbing it in\\" to the silver medalist as it seems to be doing here? Totally unneccesary to a book that should have been all about Tara and her enjoyment of the Olympics. The rather tacky inclusion of that photo made me put this book back on the shelf as quickly as I had picked it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't enjoy it...","review":"I did not buy this book but I checked it out of the public library, I am glad I did not buy it. Thought it had some wonderful photos of Miss. Lipinski I do not think it was written very well, it was mainly just pictures... I think Tara could have gotten a better author to write for her. I do not dislike Tara but I do dislike this book... and I really disapprove of the photo of Michelle Kwan at the very end! That was rude in my opinion, they could have found a much nicer picture of Miss.

Some of the pictures have words written on them, but this is a picture book. Don't get me wrong though, these pictures do a good job of showing Tara's preparation for the 1998 games, and her experiences while she was there. You get a good look inside her training, and her mind set entering the games.So, if you want to see a LOT of pictures of tara, and get a somewhat limited idea of her life, buy this book, but if you're looking for an autobiography...this isn't one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snooze-a-thon with a hint of self-glorifying.","review":"How concieted can you get? This book does nothing but glorify it's subject and belittle her competitors. To add, the writing in this book is minimal.

I'm a language arts teacher, so I plan on using the book when I get a regular gig. Ha! Its effusive prose is a plea for humans to look to nature for more than therapy: for wisdom and guidance.

To me this is an important piece of history. Of course there are books in Faroese language describing this period (late 60's early 70's) - but this visitors' viewpoint really pinpoints the very soul of this tiny population.

This was transferred way too fast, so the tempos are too fast and the pitch quite sharp. The tape used was obviously damaged, so the overture, in particular, is sonically very rough, and there are small sections missing throughout. Finally, Urania has chosen to use a fake stereo technique that I have seen in an alarmingly increasing number of inexpensive transfers of older opera recordings - delaying the right channel by .014 sec. On speakers this gives an unstable image. On headphones makes the recording sound as if it is coming from the left.I recommend the excellent Walhall transfer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have heard better recordings","review":"Recording quality is poor.

We liked the emphasis right at the start on site selection -- what to look for in everything from the overall community to aspects of the land itself and how to environmentally protect that land during construction. A comparison checklist for assessing lots is included. Even though ours will not be a \\"natural House\\" (rammed earth, straw bale, etc.) and though those types of construction are covered, there was plenty of solid information on building a more energy efficient, and less wasteful, home of wood and concrete. Also included are chapters on design, using green and non- or less toxic materials, sustainable approaches to water and waste, environmental landscaping, and enery-efficient design, heating, and cooling. As this will be a retirement home, we especially appreciated the chapter on accessiblilty and ergonomic design."},{"rating":"2","title":"great textbook!","review":"This book could very easily serve as a textbook for a green building course. It's not a coffee table book - the photos are small, and black and white - but very useful in supporting the text. This is a serious book about alternative building written by and about a group of people who have been creatively, responsibly, thoughtfully building for a very long time. It's a good choice for builders who want to learn more about sustainability, students who want to go into the field, or homeowners who are looking to build. It's not so much glitzy and inspirational as it is informative and useful: comprehensive from site selection and design through building options and techniques, to landscaping, it also contains a great resource guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goldfish Plant","review":"Received the goldfish plant one year ago.

There was a small plastic hanger to attach to the pot, so it does hang if you wouldn't mind the water falling all over the floor whenever you decide to water it. The plant looked as though someone had recently taken cuttings from it. It was not healthy looking at all. All that was left in the pot of soil was two lengths of plant and various stumps that had been cut. It was not at all full as pictured and definitely it is nowhere near flowering, since I am left nursing it to health...

They will at least need 6-12 months to even show signs of blooms, if they survive at all. They are 11 4-inch \\"short\\" cuttings. They look like they came from 3 long vine strands because the ends are obviously been cut. They don't spill out of the pot as shown in the picture.

(I've had it about 2 months)However - although it's a hanging plant - it is open at the bottom. There is no attached saucer.That means for an indoor plant - watering is messy. You have to figure out some way of catching the water that runs through the holes at the bottom.I phoned to complain - but got no satisfaction.

One drawback is the quality of the case. I think in order to hold 20 dvd cases, which contain 5-6 dvds each, the case could have been constructed better, maybe out of plastic rather than cardboard. Also, with 20 seasons of an iconic t.v. drama, I think the booklet that was included could have been more robust. Perhaps it could have offered some of the back story of how the drama was created and information on the cast and filming and writing, etc. It simply offers a very brief description of each episode. Why not include the names of the guest stars?

You can figure out just how great this lifestyle is by the fact that the crux of the slender plot is how nancy has to keep her career from her fiance.

There is no way you could survive in New York City on 4 clients unless they were paying very high rates on a very regular basis ( more than every 6 months like one of her clients). And still be able to buy expensive bags, shoes and clothes? This book was more like a Sex in The City type story then a true account of what it's like to be a highly paid call girl. The only character that seemed realistic was Jasmine. She is a go getter, cut throat and very pessimistic. She is always trying to \\"build up her book\\" at whatever the cost.

So basically what is written is not as important as what should have been written. I don't recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"I've got no problem with women selling their bodies for a living, and I normally enjoy reading about the exploits of sex workers. But working as a whore doesn't automatically grant a writer any special insights on the human condition. There's no irony, no cultural context, and no story. The narrator's galling lack of self-awareness makes this book nothing more than a smugly-written laundry list of trendy places and products. The writing is neither funny, smart nor sexy; it's not even fluffy enough to qualify as \\"hooker chic\\" -- or whatever it was trying so desperately to be. I was so embarrassed to own this turkey of a book that I actually returned it to the store. For the author's sake, I hope she's better in bed than she is on the page."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed ...","review":"The book started off good but I was disappointed at the abrupt ending. I'm sure being a call girl is not all fun. I was expecting to read about the good AND bad experiences with johns. The book was also fairy-talish to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Compelling","review":"I wanted so much for this book to work. The sex element carries it, not the plot, not the characters. And like so many C- books in the publishing business, writers who cannot seamlessly shift back and forth from the human condition in the modern world to the most trivial aspects of American culture have to rely on lasciviousness to entice readers. Too bad. Too bad. Maybe next time Quan will have developed more appreciation for the subtleties of humans interaction, rather than relying on blatant lewdness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Voyeuristic","review":"This was a fun book, voyeuristic, easy read about the life of a call girl. Not trashy, but a quick easy read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"I was expecting a humorous juicy story about the goings-on of a Manhattan call girl but that's not what this book is about. Instead I got a tale of an engaged prostitute, Nancy, who isn't sure if she wants to get married and let go of her call girl life style.Her future sister-in-law constantly pesters her about her wedding plans and she never says or does anything about it. She's also a district attorney who might be after Nancy. We never really know. Her future brother-in-law may or may not be having an affair with one of her escort friends. We never really know what happens with that relationship either. And the climax of the story happens when there are only five pages left in the book and as a result the plot resolution is really lame. Also this novel is supposed to read like a diary, but who puts detailed dialogue in their journal entries?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No value of any kind","review":"I read the title and I wanted to get the book cause I thought that such a blunt title might be packing something of value, Intriguing or mysterious may be. All I found were some papers with worthless narration about someone with no morals at all doing anything for money, the main character and her so called friends are simply as the book describes them: hookers.I'm very disappointed that I bought such a book but I should have known better, the title did not lie. I wish that the author had put some effort to come up with a real novel, something of some kind of worth instead of this.I do not recommend it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A witty, observant picture of elite \\"sex workers\\" in NYC","review":"How refreshing it is, after a season of terrorist-caused tragedy, to be reminded of what a frothy, fun, self-absorbed little culture Manhattan can be.It may be frivolous, but that too is part of the New York City we love!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO CLIMAX!!!","review":"At the finish of this book, the reader is left hanging to wonder in anti-climactic annoyance about too many things. Among the many unanswered questions in this book is one particularly annoying question because it is so steadily built up, then left frustratingly unanswered: why is Nancy's district attorney sister-in-law constantly plying her with double-entendre questions & suspicious comments about Nancy's career? Does the D.A. sis-in-law know something? Too, the last chapter jumps 8 mos. leaving a multitude of unanswered questions!

Who in the world dreams of becoming a hooker? And who in the world is a hooker while they are engaged to an amazing man, and continues being a call girl even after she gets married? This is one of those books, that as an author, has you fuming that it ever got published in the first place. Tracy Quan must be sleeping her way through agents and publishers, because this was the most stupidest story ever written!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful, Readable, and Surprisingly Real","review":"... There is no snobbishness; just a comedy of manners, so to speak, that is delightful, readable, and surprisingly real. Perhaps the reviewer didn't know what to make of a prostitution novel that lacked the usual elements of such stories; abuse, violence, degradation, exposure, etc. Nancy is fully aware of the worst elements of her profession, as are Jasmine and Allison, each in their own way. Yet she manages to create for herself a life that steers reasonably clear of these dangers and approaches her chosen profession, sex, with the same professionalism you see in other fields. Those who haven't had direct contact with this world may find it hard to believe Nancy's approach to prostitution can be real, or for whatever reasons, they may prefer to deny that it can be real. But the book is real (subject perhaps, to literary license that's no greater than that taken by any other novelist). Tracy Quan knows. So do I."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype, this book isn't that good","review":"This book is as brainless as \\"Sex and the City.\\" I certainly wish that I didn't get the book from [...], I could have checked it out from the library. The novel is written by a former call girl. The main character, Nancy, has a finace that knows nothing of her being a call girl. I find that repulsive. She sleeps with loads of men for money while at the same time pretends to be true to her fiance. I am not speaking against the occupation of a call girl so much as to her keeping it a secret from her fiance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!!","review":"This book is terrible.

My dogs went from totally flea free to itching after their walks. Then the cat, who wasn't on a flea specific treatment as she never goes outside and the dogs had previously never brought anything in, started itching too.I immediately went back to using Frontline on the dogs and now Revolution on the cat.I also recently discovered the multitudes of lawsuits and websites against Hartz. I know that every product has its side effects and there will inevitably be someone or something with a reaction.

We've tried several different flea collars, including the HARTZ ULTRA GUARD FLEA AND TICK COLLAR. The box says that this collar is supposed to offer 7-months of protection. It's supposed to kill fleas and ticks and prevent the hatching of flea eggs. The collar does seem to work, but it only lasts for about 2-3 months. After that time, our little dog is once again scratching and biting. Until recently, I was unaware of the multiple lawsuits against the Hartz company. Personally, we've never had an issue with Hartz products, but after reading about the lawsuits, it is something one should be aware. Overall, though the HARTZ ULTRA GUARD FLEA AND TICK COLLAR works, it doesn't work for as long as it says it does.

I'm deeply committed to reissues across the board and am very tolerant of their sound. I also find central European idiomatic performances congenial. This CD is below par on both counts. My advice is to buy the Pesek first at $3.69 and then, IF you still hanker for something different, go with the Kertesz and only order the Sejna for three times as much if you want to TAKE A BIG GAMBLE.On this disc the Slavonic Rhapsodies get the better performance, but the composite is overpriced for what is delivered.

However, it's sprung a major leak in the middle of it's length, and is now entirely unusable.I would only consider this hose if one needed something disposable, for very light duty, and probably only in a 25' or shorter length, so that there's less hassle with kinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought I'd Like It","review":"I picked up this hose on sale at the Country Bumpkin when picking up some mums, and I thought it was a great idea.

Plastair offered to repair it, if I paid shipping to Quebec.I have learned a lesson: Low ticket items bought from Amazon effectively have a 30 day warranty. If it breaks after that, shipping charges dominate the purchase price.Postscript a week later: Amazon granted a one time exception and swapped out the hose. Good marks for Amazon. The replacement hasn't broken yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"The curled hose sounded like a good idea.

Turns out it isn't affixed there by anything other than pressure against a rubber gasket and the pressure of my water system overwhelmed the hose. It wasn't glued, crimped, soldered, etc. Just held in place by a gasket. Cheap and obviously subject to failure. I could have pressed the hose back together, but there's no point in that. It'd just come apart again.Your mileage may vary of course, but I won't be getting another of this brand. My previous recoil hoses were made of much better materials than this, and I'll increase my spending to get a better made product."},{"rating":"1","title":"kinks!","review":"The hose is too small in diameter, and the water flow is not the best.

We learned the hard way, but have not had a problem since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Satisfied","review":"This hose was the least costly coil hose I could find, so I purchased it. It is lightweight and stores very very easily. Definitely saves my back from having to wind a heavy hose onto a reel. It does occasionally get a little tangled and I have to really hold onto it while I'm watering so it won't spring back... but I can definitely deal with those issues as long as I don't have to use a heavy traditional hose! Would definitely purchase again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best of by a long shot","review":"I'm sorry if I offend anybody, but this truely is a third rate compilation.

As a blues & slide guitar afficionado I would be embarrased to present this material to someone to demonstrate my passion.

Plus, I was able to use these scripts to hypnotize my sister, which was interesting. That being said, I don't think I have experienced any effects, positive or negative, from doing hypnosis.

So, I suppose I do recommend this book, if only to experience hypnosis."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better books out there","review":"I was very dissapointed with this book. I found many of the scripts were written in a negative tone. For example, the script for clear and healthy skin has a sentance that says \\"As I am free of blemishes and irritated skin...\\". My mind focused on blemishes and irritated. It would have been more helpful if it were written in positive tone. Maybe he could have said - As I have clear, smooth and healthy skin with a rosy glow - or something like that, never making any references to any negative outcomes. There are a few times in this book when the author goes to the negative instead of the positive.The idea that you can hynotize yourself while reading is a great idea, however, it's better for me to either write my own scripts or find a different book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book","review":"Originally, I borrowed this book from my local library.

When I was hyptonizing myself I actually used the scripts in the book but changed them myself to a more positive light. Though I was able to hypnotize myself, it was not a very deep state, but all in all it was a positive experience for me.

It's not just a \\"placebo effect,\\" or wishful thinking, it really works. I get caught off guard sometimes when I suddenly notice that something (in my case, social anxiety) that always had scared me no longer does. I may still notice it, but my heart no longer starts racing and I'm not dreading having to talk to someone- it's something I can control now.You have to be determined to improve yourself, because it does take a little practice.

You don't really need the brightest setting around the house, but it will light up the house across the street unbelievably well! It's very comfortable to wear, and has all the features you could possibly need. The ability to adjust the light to tip down at several angles has been very useful. I usually use the medium light setting on the main beam, but the dim setting is still enough light for most applications. Anytime you need light and your hands free there's a perfect light setting.

This autobiographical approach through which Tharoor links his experiences to India's development does not do justice to India's history.In addition, I was kind of hoping Tharoor would analyze India's current position and maybe give his recipe for future policy. He does a bad job of describing what is the dream behind the Indian republic. A much better book is Idea of India by Khilnani.Finally, as another reviewer has pointed out, Tharoor is very naive about social and political issues.

If the album was released for a karaoke bar he might be ok, he does do a mediocre impersonation. However his lyrics seem to be something he stole from oberst's trash can. And again in comparison to Conor his voice may be somewhat accurate but competely uninspired. That emotion that bring songs to life is what Bright Eyes is known for and has mastered, and what An Angle lacks completely.The bottom line is unless you have never heard Oberst (which most of the Drive Thru generation hasn't) don't bother giving this album a listen.Impersonation-4 Creativity-0"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"I don't understand why you guys rate them negativly, they are almost more poetic than bright eyes, notice there are generes and certain sounds and there always more than one of the same sounding music, look at the bands hellogoodbye and houston calls have the same sound but two different bands with different music, an angle has as much right to play this kind of music as does bright eyes.I recommend there new Cd also (we can breathe under alchol.)God Bless"},{"rating":"1","title":"The sad state of the music industry","review":"Drive Thru records ruins its pristine reputation with this signing. Oh no, wait, they were already awful, and this just solidifies them as the worst label currently out there. How they can make such a blatant ripoff and get away with it is disgusting. Everything from the singer, to th lyrics, to the cover art, to the name of the songs. How can these guys parade around and be proud of what they bring to the table? How can they wake up every morning knowing how fake they are and live with themselves?Not to mention the album stinks. It isn't very good at all.

Stay far away from this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's laughable.","review":"If this really isn't a joke, then good god. What a pathetic and blatant rip off of Bright Eyes. And no, I'm not only saying that because their voices are similar...the lyrics, song structures, titles, and even artwork are all just stolen from Conor Oberst. I was willing to give this band a chance before I listened to them, hoping that since I'd heard so much about the similarity to BE, that they would only be influenced by Bright Eyes and have talent and creativity, but I don't even like the songs, because it's as though the singer tried to paraphrase Oberst's songs and try to sell the plagiarism.

I gave this CD a chance, and I couldn't help but think what is wrong with this guy. I know him a little personally and I just can't imagine how he would steal something so blatantly and still deny it. I think we all know the truth.This album doesn't sound like the new bright eyes stuff (I'm wide awake it's morning, or digital ash in a digital urn).

If you have ever listened to Bright Eyes, you would think this was Conor Oberst who made this CD. An Angle is such a blantant rip-off of Conor that they do not deserve to make money. Don't buy this CD. Nobody deserves to make money off of someone else's hard work. I mean, honestly, \\"Did You? Did You? Did You?\\" has practically the same title as \\"You Will? You Will? You Will?\\"; the singer, Kris Anaya, uses the the same cracking voice as Conor; the lyrics are extremely similar consistantly, and the albums Kris Anaya is ripping off here were made years before this one was.

Highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hogwood Good","review":"I'm one of those Beethoven fanatics who has all the period recordings of Beethoven's nine symphonies, or most of them anyway.

They all have strengths and weaknesses, but Hogwood and his forces could hold their own over the course of the nine. I enjoyed symphonies 1, 2, 4, 5 & 7.If you are looking for one good set, with solid sound at a great price, this is it. Nevertheless, the Hanover Band recordings on Nimbus, originally won me over. Before them, the modern orchestra frankly bored me with their Beethoven, and I hadn\`t heard the other period specialists yet.My favorites ~*The Hanover Band*Franz Bruggen and the Orchestra of the Eighteenth Century*Christopher Hogwood and the Academy of Ancient Music*John Elliot Gardiner and the Orchestre Revolutionnaire et Romantique*Roger Norrington and the London Classical Players"},{"rating":"2","title":"Boffo from the Beginning","review":"This is superior music making!

Given the several other Roach albums I own (and I like all of these a good deal) I was most hopeful, but as far as I'm concerned, this one is a bomb.

Starts out with the description of the sacrificial ceremonies and priest garments etc... As an introduction it's ok, and maybe it's even useful to know, but this goes on for chapters and chapters. I think there's only one chapter dedicated specifically to discussing Revelation and feasts, where the authors incourage you to do your own study. Hm..

Their words of understanding of the scriptures and the words of wisdom and their faith in the Lord is truly a gift from God.

The original is great because it's the perfect blend of hard rock/metal with sweet screeching by Axl and guitar work and lovely lyrics.

This is absolutely a fascinating book which in fact is a character builder if you're willing to accept anything in this wonderful philosophy that is as close to fact as possible. Do not be fooled by my short review, Steven has a pronged approach that is built on solid evidense, no shortcuts are taken in this detailed read. On human nature, yes, but this book truly moves us forward into a desire for a much more civil way. That is what is pleasing to me, Steven, in my opinion is a valuable contributor in that he wishes humans to advance. I have that desire after reading this.

As another reviewer wrote, it feels as if Pinker is paying back a few grudges he's been nursing since grad school.Pinker's knowledge of cognitive psychology is of course immense, and the endnotes and bibliography provide an excellent guide to the literature, but as history of science this is naive at best. I would suggest that anyone interested in arguments for innatism begin with Judith Rich Harris, who sticks to what she knows, and writes far better than Pinker does here."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh really?","review":"Oh really Mr Pinker?If this book is a \\"political work\\" then Pinker should make it explicitly so.If it is intended philosophically, it is just plain bad.If it is a scientific piece it is marginal.I recommend that Pinker SHOULD make a political case for his ideas (much like the late Carl Sagan).Actually, if you really want to read socio-biology E.O Wilson is much better place to start.Please folks don't be fooled."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rampant polemicist","review":"A previous review, dougrhon,wrote: \\"The ultimate conclusion of the theory that society creates personality is that society can re-make personalities as it sees fit.

But it goes on to argue reason with reason and ultimately makes no point of any value.

It is one long (very long) academic essay that can be appreciated more for its research than for any original insight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opinionated","review":"Too opinionated a book. Few believe the mind is a blank slate. But Pinker seems to believe the mind is a TV dinner, and that a chef in the kitchen (parents!) is an almost incidental redundancy.To take a trivial example to counter this, David Letterman once had on his TV show identical twins who only met in middle-age. Well, they weren't exactly identical, because one was quite fat, and the other quite thin!! Now if identical twins are so much alike that--as Pinker states--some of them (Pinker wants to give the impression that it's ALL of them) end up vacationing in the same spot, even if seperated at birth, certainly these two twins on Letterman would have had the same body build!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby jesus","review":"I don't get it.

Also this edition covers why we resist or deny, Socially, what he had written in How the Mind Works. This is a good extention, however I feel one has to be very serious about this subject to enjoy it.Do not get me wrong on being serious, this book is superbly written, easy to understand, was edited well. The ideas put forth of Ideology and Philosophy do go further than most, I would recommend reading All of his prior works however before starting this, without that there is a lack of full understanding. I would like to recommend a good philosophy ideology book, similar, which I enjoyed more, SB or God."},{"rating":"1","title":"attacking a straw man is never difficult","review":"Had this book been written thirty years ago, it would have really been a major contribution. The claim that human nature is not a blank slate is now so widely accepted that Pinker has nothing new to say and this book largely restates the thesis of his last book, How the Mind Works. In fact, aside from the humanities, academic research has now gone so far in the direction of emphasizing the importance of genes that an environmental correction might be necessary now. I was very disappointed in how stale the book seems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Former Fan","review":"I have read the Language Instinct and How the Mind Works and loved them both. I was expecting more of the same well researched, tightly argued, and engagingly written insights into our species.Frankly, it wasn't there. He frequently diverges into facile and trite philosophy, and makes many of the errors he rails against in the first few chapters. For example, when reviewing Stephen Jay-Gould's book \\"The Mismeasure of Man\\" he claims the book was written to debunk any theory of innate talent, not a theory that either follows from or is proposed by Gould who focuses more on the denial of the reification of the intellect.Puts the wrong words in others mouths, and pulls the wrong ones out of his own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Philosophical and rhetorical, but not scientific...","review":"This book has good assumptions, but it lacks scientific data. Many arguments employ observations that are inconclusive at best in their \\"cause-effect\\" nature. For example, the reference about gay men having smaller nucleus in the anterior hypothalamus, is still much a debatable conjecture. Many examples in the book are just too suspicious to be taken seriously.Overall, this book is too poorly researched, and its reasoning too puerile, for any mature readers to stay engaged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Pricing Policy","review":"If I could give zero stars I would. $11 for a paperback but $15 for the Kindle download? This must be collusion at its best."},{"rating":"2","title":"the 2 D's - deal with it, do not deny it","review":"After reading and re-reading it multiple times - I have learnt one of the most import lessons in life, which I now teach fervently. Deal with any issue - do not deny it. Some issues are problems with who we are (such as parochialism), some issues are related to our capabilities and shortcomings such as are our aptitudes and skill. Here is the most important thing though - our brains are wonderful learning machines - we can do anything if we train ourselves and practice it. The more innate skill we have the less effort we have to put, but do deny either the power of nature or nurture is to deny our potential to who we can be.Thank you Steven Pinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pinker continually distorts his opposition","review":"The fact that nobody actually beleives in the idea that humans are a blank slate doesn't stop Pinker from acting as if they do. Over and over again in this book, Pinker quotes his purported opposition and follows up his quotation with an interpretation which is clearly a distortion.This book is merely a diatribe: I can read \\"adaptionist\\" books with great pleasure when they are written by people with some subtelty of mind--Richard Dawkins or EO Wilson, say. But Pinker, either through willfulness or incapacity, utterly misses the nuance in arguments made by anyone for whom he considers to be an enemy.A witless, unsubtle and closing-in-on-useless book.Of course, if what you are interested in is seeing Pinker take a bludgeon to a bunch of strawmen, then you'll probably like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prepare to get pissed","review":"Mr. Skinner likes to show one side of the picture. If you check the facts. He tends to take the statistics that support his points. Oh that is life Lies, Damn Likes, and Statistics. Can't blame him.He does make you rethink my views."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly politicized, non-scientific book","review":"I have been an avid reader of Steven Pinker's books but found this one non-scientific, political garbage. Instead of concentrating on the science, he seems to dedicate his efforts to bashing scientists who don't share his (and his friends) opinions. Highly dissappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ring of Truth!","review":"As in any branch of science, there's always much left to be discovered and understood, but this is a wonderful exposition of what we presently know, think we know and suspect about the nature and development of the human mind. The writing is erudite, elegant and engaging.Dr. Pinker very appropriately airs out some of the most disgraceful conduct ever seen in ivied halls, and calls attention to the curious and unnatural alliance of intellectual facists of the left with superstitious fundamentalists of the right.Anyone committed to free and objective scientific inquiry will be greatly pleased with this book. Those afraid of such inquiry, or who deny the possibility of it, will despise it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cornerstone for 21st century science and policy.","review":"I came across the mention of The Blank Slate while reading Sam Harris' Moral Landscape with an intention of fine-tuning my opinion of human nature. This should have been the book I read first. Though I may not agree with all of the conclusions Pinker presents to his research, the amount of it and irrefutable evidence against social constructionism is something everyone can benefit from. I had many assuptions about human nature with a backround in Sociology and have found many of them to be shattered. Easily readable and a great sense of humor. It is certainly one of the most important books I've read. Should be mandatory reading for every human being."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Blank Slate, Noble Savage, and Ghost in the Machine","review":"I quite like Pinker's book and think that some of the reviews (such as Patrick Bateson's in Nature) are off the wall in misreading it. This in not a book about nature-vs-nurture in the usual sense but a much broader book about three beginners' mistakes (my term, not Pinker's): The Blank Slate, the Noble Savage, and the Ghost in the Machine. Pinker's concern is not only that they appear to be wrong but that the policies based on them are likely to do more harm than good."},{"rating":"2","title":"No mo po mo","review":"A straight forward look at how the sciences of the mind explode the social \\"sciences'\\" standard view of the mind. He also lays into the fraud that is post-modernism.Certain to outrage the lit-crit pond-scum crowd, who will however simply ignore the science. For the rest of us its mostly just common sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Human nature lives","review":"Pinker did what I hoped he would do: framed the nature vs. nurture argument in a bold way that was not afraid to go against the grain (by suggesting that human nature not only exists, but those who seek to deny it may do harm). The icing on the cake is that he writes in a way the layman can understand. I am neither an expert in this area nor an intellectual giant. I am just a reasonably smart, curious guy who wanted to hear and understand the argument. This book offered me that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scientific dogmatism exposed","review":"Scientists and academicians, it is often supposed, are dispassionate intellectuals simply following the evidence where it leads--regardless of the scientist's own personal views. Pinker's fascinating study repeatedly demonstrates that scientists, contrary to popular belief, do in fact have heavy ideological axes to grind, and they defend their cherished views with dogmatic, quasi-religious fervor. Of course, any intelligent, educated, open-minded individual who has been following the Darwin vs. Design dialogue already knows this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"An exceptional book. Well written and well researched. Avoids being politically correct and sticks to facts backed by scientific research."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books ever","review":"Yeah, I dont mean to come across the wrong way but i do have a degree in philosophy and i honestly think this is one of the best books i have ever read. Even in light of Kant, Hume, Locke, (Descartes sucks), Aristotle etc... This book does NOT seem to create an original system of philosophical thinking, rather this book is a synthesis of all intellectual pursuits put together, Anthropology, psychology, neurology, philosophy, history, etc... His main thesis is determinism, which in my opinion will be the next revolution in the culture of mankind... Similar to the so called Darwinian Revolution... In a nutshell our brains, more than our environments or so called free will, control our actions...I highly recommend this book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GUIDE TO UNDERSTANDING","review":"How can we understand ourselves if we don't get a grasp on human nature? This book is a deep exploration of just that. I found it helped me to understand my kids, my husband, and that person in the mirror. Great book. Another book that helped me in this manner that I recommend is \\"The Little Guide To Happiness\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provocative exploration of genetics, cognition and academic warfare","review":"This book covers a lot of ground: philosophy, genetics, cognition, sociology and academic infighting. Steven Pinker, writing with persuasiveness and craft, shows why the doctrine of the \\"Blank Slate\\" became so important to 20th century intellectuals that they were willing to lie, cheat, libel and even threaten those who dissented. Yet, the dissenters were right. Given what science now knows of genetics, the idea that people are blank slates at birth is simply untenable. getAbstract finds that the author, despite a few hints of personal prejudices (ah, there's human nature again), does an excellent job of grappling with enormously challenging subjects."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Author reminds me of someone","review":"I read this book and it had elements in it of my favorite writer. It was philisophical in some cases. Scientific in others. And even at times spiritual. In essence it is a socioligical study of human nature and it's evolution. Our children start out as blank slates. And we can grow and learn, or not, depending on what we write on that slate. This Author reminds me of the same Author who wrote \\"I Talked To God And He Wants To Talk To Me\\" in the sense that he too explores the sociological evolution of man's belief system, only in more spiritual terms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mainly hype.","review":"What's most disturbing about this book-- aside from the arrogance of the author who pontificates about everything from neuroscience to ethics, politics, and religion-- is how reductionist it is, while at the same time claiming not to be. According to Pinker, parents matter little, and even personal preferences (such as number of hours per day spent watching television) are all mainly hereditary. So, psychotherapy is useless, caustic parents harmless, and the only solution for a troubled kid (faulty genes) is to medicate him. I bet the drug manufacturers love Pinker. Forget about poverty and poor education shaping children. This would be funny if it weren't so sad. The book doesn't add anything new to the nature-nurture question, but it's being hyped and promoted nonstop, which seems to work. That's sad, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say over simplify?","review":"... Dr. Pinker would do well to present a more balance view of human nature. To NOT dot his is to discrdit his own main thesis. He is a master of caricatures, poking to poke and not to illuminate. As a geneticist and a neurobiologist I can tell you he oversimplifies to a shameless degree and -- in the process -- ignores large chunks of reality. I support his aim, wholeheartedley, but he does harm to valuable ideas by presenting a grossly lop-sided view, so anxious is he to bulldoze the opponent. It's just cheap. His understanding of many importnat thinkers is also bodering on childish. Lacking in balance and perspective and it's a darn shame. Not for adult audiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong order?","review":"When I ordered this knife I actually got what appears to be a Templar sword instead.

First, there are far too many asides in the novel to explain in one sentence some fundamental law of physics. Being a scientist, I found rather irritating, as the summaries were glib, and intended to have a hand waving effect to make the scene plausible. Second, the character development is remarkably bad. Most of the characters have one of three major personality quirks: Domineering, histrionic, or obsessive-compulsive. There is very little (if any) depth given to any of the characters. Third: The plot.....??? I like my science fiction to be more science than fiction, but that's a personal choice. All in all, not worth the time. At all. It gets a two star rating for having an idea I would like to see used in a much better novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliched Greg Egan wanna-be","review":"I had real hope for this book, but after the grammatical errors, completely unbelievable characters, and cliches I was almost unable to finish it.Read Greg Egan, Vernor Vinge, or Greg Bear instead.

Owning more than 70 albums, I found this disc to be very interesting. It has some of their very first recordings. It is cool to hear a very different sound from Lombardo. The first tracks are almost jazz/hot. There are two cuts of Mississippi Mud that are worth the purchase price alone. As the disc goes on the Lombardo sound starts to take shape. The saxes get sweet, Carmen's singing, the drums disappear. Interesting how long it takes to calm down Lebert's trumpet playing. On some of the early sweet songs it sounds really good but a little out of place. The disc has good liner notes as well. A good disc recommended for the completest. The more casual fan may be turned off by the fact that it takes 3/4 of the disc to sound like Lombardo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great handbook for finding a mate","review":"This book is both an easy read and full of ready-to-use tools for someone serious about finding their spouse.

I own all of their albums on vinyl, through Time. So take this with a grain of salt...I was disappointed with this dvd primarily because of the obvious overdubs done to the vocals and strings. I would prefer to see a dvd that is an honest \\"live\\" representation of the band. Rarely will a band's performance be so pristine live, as they are in the studio. We know that when we go to concerts. When I purchase a live concert video, I want and expect it to capture the nuances of a live performance. This dvd seems fake to me. I would only purchase this dvd if you're a diehard ELO fan.

The worse thing for me was the recording quality. This was recorded in 1955, and it might as well have been recording in the 1930s. Maybe I just expect too much, but it literally spoiled the whole CD for me. Also, I did not care too much for the singing, but as I am not someone who knows a lot about opera singing, and I am not a musician, I cannot really say if there was anything wrong with it or if it was just my personal taste, or if, as more than likely, the recording sound spoiled the sound of the voices. I do not think I am even going to keep my copy of this opera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many errors!","review":"This book would be very helpful and comprehensive if it weren't for so many errors.

It is terrible for anyone attempting to hone skills, because one must not only figure out the problems but also detect the errors in the problems and their explanations. For example, figures are labeled differently in the problems and in the answers (making comparison of your calculations and theirs doubly difficult) and numbers are different in the problems than those used in calculations for the answers. Although this book contains some useful information, it is rendered useless by the multiple errors. Do NOT bother with this book!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unacceptable, Unelectable","review":"Thanks Amazon, no thanks Santorum. Santorum equates gay marriage to sex with children and sex with dogs.

What a mistake that would be! It only takes a comment from Senator Santorum (like comparing a gay couple to a man having sex with a dog) for you to see that this is no charming person. I had to read his book, to see if he could explain how he feels it is OK to lock up two consenting adults for engaging in a sex act that he didn't agree with.

It was mostly opinionated drivel that sounds like a long review rather than a factual account and I will not be buying anything from this bloke again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author says this is his favorite album, but bashes half the songs","review":"The author claims that the white album is his favorite album, but when breaking the album down song by song he goes on to bash all the songs at very cursory levels. Overall this book is a really long really bad review of the white album. I couldn't finish it and had to come here to check the other reviews to make sure I wasn't the only person who hated the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read unless you really like the White Album","review":"I just discovered recently, but have been listening to it non-stop. So much more that I wanted to find out more about it, other than all the crap on the interent. I found this book in my college's library and thought it was perfect for me. I was bitterly dissappointing. Apart from going through every, yes every, month of 1968, Quantick added little knew material to what I had found on the internet. His ripping of Clapton was uncalled for, to the point where it was rude, especially calling \\"Wonderful Tonight\\" effectivley a peice of garbage. And if I had to hear the \\"Let It Be\\" sessions being compared to \\"hell\\" again, I was going to personally go over to England and strangle Quantick. The writing was so poor, I thought several times throughout the book that I was reading someone's dissertation than an actual published book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book about Paul","review":"This book is improperly titled. It should not be called \\"The Making of the Beatles' White Album\\"; instead, it should be called \\"A Tribute to Paul McCartney\\". Quantick constantly shows his love for Paul McCartney throughout this book. He actually says, \\"The world knew Paul McCartney was the greatest songwriter who'd ever lived\\", a claim that could be hotly debated. He also calls him \\"the band's greatest rocker\\", \\"the band's greatest balladeer\\" and \\"the band's greatest singer\\". He says that Ringo Starr was \\"absent in a huff\\" from the recording of \\"Back in the USSR\\"; he claims that George Harrison was the reason that Manson committed his murders; he butchers John Lennon a few times. Yes, he does say he likes Yoko and her work, but mostly he talks about Paul McCartney. Paul himself could have authorized this book, because 95% of the stuff in here about him is glowing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read It","review":"This book was wonderfuly vivid. it is a high action fantasy book.a (Just cant put down)of witch there are all too few. she just pints a picture in your mind. as soon as you think you know whats going to happen she turns it 180 degrees. but it is just as good on the other side."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used Edition of Cycle of Fire (book)","review":"Book was in very good condition (as described), arrived ahead of schedule, and there were no problems whatsoever.Great Job!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good omnibus edition","review":"This book, \\"The Cycle of Fire\\", is an omnibus edition including Janny Wurts' trilogy of the following three books:Stormwarden (The Cycle of Fire, Book 1)Keeper of the Keys (Cycle of Fire, No 2)Shadowfane (Cycle of Fire/Janny Wurts, Bk 3)This story was pretty well-written, and one could even say that there is definitely potential for writting a prequel book or two and a sequel book or two as well.I enjoyed the story, and I hope that you will too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts well, but ...","review":"The first book in this trilogy is good - perhaps very good. But it's all downhill from there, sadly. The prose gets more and more involuted; the dialogue migrates from 'wooden' through 'strained' all the way to 'frankly preposterous'; and the descriptions (especially of the 'magic') strain analogies well past breaking point. The final few chapters are a strain to read :-(Conclusion - if you enjoyed Daughter of the Empire et al, read them again and leave this one alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad plot, worse writing","review":"I don't understand the other reviewers. This book was painfully bad. The plot is slow, the characterization is abysmal (they're poorly motivated and at the same time ridiculously, nonsensically complex), and finally the writing was so bad I had to put the book DOWN--something I rarely do. It sounds like it was written by an adolescent depressive: baggy sentences, fuzzy ideas, and poor, inappropriate metaphors. If you thrive on the sharp writing of (early) Robert Jordan or Tolkein, or even MZ Bradley, STEER CLEAR OF THIS WASTE OF TIME."},{"rating":"1","title":"stormwarden/ keeper of the keys/ shadowfane","review":"I thought the book very good at first with strong characters and plots but by the second book I just had to put it down. For all you peopole who like me like high fantasy with Elves,Dwarves etc this book will be a total letdown. All right its got demons, but the Veare turns out to be a computer that came from a crashed spaceship thousands of years ago, now call me old fashiond but that in my opinion is not fantasy and I considered the books a waste of money due to the fact that towards the end it became more sci-fi than fantasy. I would recommend that anyone who wants a pure fantasy book not buy this"},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate but looking for better","review":"The first small links connecting the key rings to the body of the key chain broke within a couple of days of purchase. So, I just linked the body directly to the key rings without using the link. That took care of that problem.The button that you push to release the valet portion of the key can weaken over time and needs to be bent to reinforce it's \\"grip.\\" Otherwise, your valet key (in my case, the key to my wife's car which she asks for when she loses her own) will slide off over time.So this key chain does the job, but it is a poorly constructed and needs some fiddling with to overcome its flaws. I would not have expected this given its price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in coverage","review":"This book contains brief (less than one page average) biographies of 396 people. Not one of them was a pioneer documented in the 1895 Yukon Order of Pioneers, 40 Mile photograph. Not one of them was in the photograph of Yukon River traders taken about 1885 at St. Michael.The sources cited are mostly Alaska newspapers and magazines, and mainly obituaries or biographical puff pieces. References to the original articles are cited, but there is no indication of whether or how much the author has edited them.The book has no index or table of contents.This review applies to ISBN0788400878. The copy I looked at was published in 1984. There are other editions of the same title out there, one labeled \\"Volume 5\\".

I thought it would arrive by Wed., not Saturday.I expected the book to show up at my house it a like-new condition.It did look ok. As I was leafing through it I soon became aware of a nasty smell. I began to sniff it and came away with the conclusion that this book had been exposed to some gasoline. I had saved the package and soon found that their was a strong smell in the empty sack and none on the outside. Please understand: I am not saying I had a CSI machine to scientifically examine this book. I just used my nose. It was a subjective examination.I can tell you that I think this book will be good for my purposes, once I figure out how to de-smell it. (Does anyone have a suggestion?)

Each woman history is used to set up one of Kabbalah's teaching. I come from a Jewish background which questioned Kabbalah and its mystic element. After reading this book, the differences between these two backgrounds were significantly lessen.

It was a lifesaver, and made our very 1st trip to Disney with our 4 sons, a BLAST! Thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! a MUST buy!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Disney Hype","review":"Birnbaum seems to work as an agent for Disney, giving you fluff and hype for your money. This book seems to be little more than a brief encapsulation of the Disney World resort and park attractions, without the critical information, the good as well as the not so good, you really need in order to make intelligent choices about how and where you're going to spend your money on your next Disney vacation. Pretty pictures, though. A better choice for your money would be the Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World by Bob Sehlinger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great overview of Disney World","review":"This book is a great overview of all Disney has to offer.

Stedman says that masturbation is a tool to keep sexual desires in check and fantasizing about women is OK if it's not a particular woman. (i.e. If you cut all the heads off of the pictures in the victoria secret catalogue, it would be OK to peruse for sexual pleasure). All in all, he's trying to provide help, but humanistic approaches to purity make his book a complete disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Joy? Yeah Right!","review":"I wouldn't recommend this book. Written by a now-married man, it doesn't really speak to singles who will be single well belong his marrying age of 30 - and possibly for life.I'd rather recommend the works of Julia Duin on singleness and abstinence... As a woman who remained unmarried and a virgin and is now her fifties, she is better equipped to speak with integrity and sincerity about how HARD abstinence really is. No sugar-coating needed, we're grownups now!Julia's take on this book: \\"Believe me: The only positive side to single sexuality is not getting AIDS. The only singles I know who consider their state to be \\"pure joy\\" are those who have been through a divorce.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"What I was looking for!","review":"Just the type of diagrams and instructions I've been looking for, clear and easy to follow!

It's a great show, but whoever mastered this DVD took the original footage and inexplicably transformed it from its full screen format (4:3) into a widescreen format (16:9). Bad decision. The result is that Gilberto Gil and everyone else in the film appear \\"squished\\" during the entire 100-minute program. Unless you wear special glasses, my suggestion is that you try to locate the original Acústico album if possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Group or Individual Study","review":"The lifeguide series is a great series for group Bible study.This study guide presents Paul's letter to the Colossians and his letter to Philemon in 10 lessons. The questions are easy to understand and provide a lot of opportunity for discussion, not just simple one word or yes/no type questions. Each chapter usually had our group of 10-15 in discussion for about an hour.I highly recommend this book and series to anyone wanting to start a Bible study group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Do It!","review":"I only have one thing to say, \\"Don't do it.\\" It looks like a great deal...it really isn't. These are penny wise and dollar foolish. They don't fit quite right (have to pry them out of the camera most of the time). They charged up 'okay,' for a few times...then they wouldn't hold a charge for more than 15 minutes of camera time (the original batteries held up for over an hour when they were relatively new). Go ahead and get the original Sony batteries...a little more expensive, but the original batteries lasted for over 3 years, with almost daily use/frequent recharging. These 'copies' were never more than 'just okay,' and quickly went down hill from there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as good as I expected","review":"Really the fact that it works at all should make this product worth it. It works better than our original battery in our DSC-T7. Might not stay charged as long as an 'Official Sony Product' but the price makes it worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Woodman's Drinkwater series","review":"This book describes a British naval family for most of the 20th century. It starts off strongly with the Battle of Jutland and other naval action during World War I. It then continues the family saga into WWII and beyond. However, once peace descends the story looses it strength and putters out. A man's affair with his grandfather's mistress and a menage a trois add some strange flavors to the last few chapters. It would have been a better book if it had ended earlier.All in all, not nearly as good a book as any of the others in Woodman's Drinkwater series which begins with _An Eye of the Fleet_, which I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Positive self-talk = survival","review":"This slender volume takes little time to read, but offers an important new tool to those wanting to learn to focus their minds through meditative self-talk. Mantras are not new, but the idea of applying them to cops and soldiers is. Because Mr Ruge offers many mantras, he affords the reader a chance to discover which ones work best for him/her.

They both taste great, and are only slightly different in flavor from each other. As sugar-free/fat-free ways to eat chocolate, they are wonderful.

Season Two continues the fun, though it's a bit darker, as many have noted.

I have to be fair and say I was not a fan prior to buying the DVD, however I like a wide range of black metal bands like Cradle of filth, Dimmu Borgir, Emperor, old mans child.Everyone mentions how good the sound is, I didn't think so. The music is over the singer, the singer has a harsh foreign accent, and the singer screams like a girl. You combined all these elments together and what your left with is an indecipherable mess. The musicians also make no effort to move around, the singer is boring. The quality is ok, but its very bootleg and not up to current DVD standards. I am giving it an extra star for production, because I have seen much worse DVD's coming from underground bands (ex: bad luck 13) with much worse picture and sound. This is a very average DVD.

The book is informative and well written. We find out how old Scott was when he took up hockey(age 5)and how Scott worked his way up the league and eventually into the NHL. Scott Gomez is a genuine roll model for young people and especially young Hispanics who don't think other Hispanics played hockey(we are stereotypicaly boxers who don't know how to do anything else). I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the sport or is a new fan of hockey. What is really warm about this is how close Scott is to his dad, Carlos, and what a tight knit family they are."},{"rating":"1","title":"A design crime","review":"Type is to read, and therefore, this book is fundamentally wrong. It should not be filed under graphic design, rather, it should be fled under \\"terrible trends\\".Type + illegible = crime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait for the next adventure","review":"As with all in this series, I was delighted with this book and can't wait for the next one. I am 79 years old, have never read a book that made me feel the pangs and passions that I feel for the characters, all of them are like the family I don't have."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hit for 2006!","review":"Another year for Miss Julia and she hasn't changed one bit! Hazel Marie's uncle tries to come back and ruin what happiness she had Little Lloyd have. But Sam and Julia are determined to protect her. Miss Julia looks back to when Hazel Marie and Little Lloyd first joined her and is reminded how special they are to her. That makes her even more firm in her decision to make sure Vernon Puckett stays far away.This book is typical Julia but as always full of laughs and truths. The food talk always leaves me hungry as usual. Thanks for another hit Ms. Ross!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Miss Julia!","review":"This is such a great series and this is a great addition to it. I really like how the author showed the character growth of Miss Julia through her relationships with Sam, Hazel Marie, and Little Lloyd. Latisha is always a hoot in it, Sam is caring and obviously adores his new bride, and Miss Julia takes on that mean ole' preacher man again. Miss Julia is my hero! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"I absolutely adore the Miss Julia books. They are without a doubt the most wonderful, hilarious and touching books I have ever read. Ann Ross is a wonderful lady. I have met her 3 times now and plan on being at her next book signing. My dog even won her contest last year. The books are such a delightful ready, I want another one just as soon as I read the last word of the current book. I am from the South as is Miss Julia and Miss Ross speaks correctly in all things southern. Of course, she is from the South, also, so she knows from whereof she speaks. Don't miss the books. Start with the beginning and read on. I got an e mail from Miss Ross the other day and she has signed on to do 3 more books! Hooray!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MISS JULIA BOOKS ARE A TOTAL DELIGHT!","review":"The Miss Julia series of books are the most delightful books you will ever read!

Can't wait until the next one comes out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"formulaic and unsatisfying","review":"I have enjoyed the Miss Julia books tremendously but this is my least favorite.Miss Julia is married to Sam Murdoch. Poor guy is sent to find the missing Hazel Marie in one part and is gone for a good deal of the story. Miss Julia does not even make a case of those missing hours! It is as if the author could really care less.There are so many little plots that you feel as if the author had several ideas and just took one and expanded it but left the others to show all the complications in this woman's life. There are times when Miss Julia seems to self-centered and the tongue in cheek mood of the other books in this series is really not present here. I found her less likable and also less believable. She has taken in her husband's mistress ad illegitimate child. Now, there is a question about the child's paternity and she is tolerating the whole thing!!!!!Perhaps other books in the series would be a better intro for the uninitiated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sea Turtles","review":"I ordered the Ty Island Turtle to put in our beach rentals for the new clients with children checking in.

Right now, I found a Band Aid brand bandage and used it. I'd say this product, so far, has a failure rate of 100 percent.This product is an extremely thin membrane of plastic that comes with some sort of paper frame that is impossible to remove without destroying the bandage. A bandage that gets wadded up in the unpacking is useless. My husband couldn't get one to work, either, and all 10 of his fingers were in working order.I'm sorry I have to give this thing even one star. Can you give negative stars?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only received 4 of the advertised 5 wall hangings :-(","review":"I received the package on time, however when opened it only had 4 of the 5 wall hangings. It appeared to have been a used packaged, which really was dissappointing because it was listed as \\"New\\" and clearly the package was opened and an item removed.

Was ready to read ANYTHING by J.R. Ward. Was happily surprised that this book takes place in the \\"real world\\", that Grace Hall (our heroine) is witty and intelligent, and our hero (John Smith) is someone you can believe in. The plot is unique, and I really hated it when I got to the last page. Wanted to know WHAT COMES NEXT in their lives! Please, Ms. Ward, consider a \\"sequel\\" to this book about the further adventures of Grace Hall and John Smith. Am also anxiously awaiting the re-release of \\"An Irresistible Bachelor\\".

Yet someone finds and gives them love unconditionally and the the story thread is totally engrossing. In this book, it's hard to feel sorry for the heroine who has not only unflawed, remarkable beauty, but a fabulous fortune to go with it. So her marriage is kaput! Snap out of it and join the club. She's weak willed and at 30 still can't stand up to her snot of a mother! The incredibly handsome body guard would have fit in well with the brotherhood. Just needed a little love. It took the path of so many contemporary penny dreadfuls - stick to the brotherhood, this one left me wanting to slap the heroine aand tell her to \\"grow a pair!\\"i'm"},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit of a retroactive re-hash","review":"Having re-released her original contemporary romances, it was nice to go back and read JR Ward's beginning. The story of socialite Grace and her body guard, rough fmr. military assassin \\"John Smith\\" has all the hallmarks of \\"opposites attract\\". But if you're reading the Crave series, you recognize a lot of Isaac in John and their stories of love's hurdles are very much the same. The only difference being the mystery at the core of Lady...who's killing the socialites and why. She gives you two suspects fairly clearly so you won't be guessing who for long. And if you're paying attention, you'll figure out the murderer and the why of it all long before it's over. Not nearly as hot as the BDB series and less raunchy than the Crave series. It's romance on par with traditional contemporary romances."},{"rating":"2","title":"James G. Blaine","review":"I am related to James G. Blaine and have read most books about him and his times.

The problem is with the package I was delivered. First off it seems like they have some pretty old stock.

It seems kind of extreme that a character should have to die in order to drive home a simple point about respect to these kids. Mr. Pignati is turned into a victim for the sake of making a heavy-handed point, and I hate that sort of thing.Zindel, however, is a unique writer, and I wish kids and teachers would focus on \\"Pardon Me, You're Stepping On My Eyeball\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"the pigman","review":"The book the pigman is not to bad of a book.I liked it & I did not like it but if you want to read it you can you might like it you never know I did not care for it .

I won't tell you any more of the other hilarious stuff that happens but lets just say it includes playing tag on ruler blades in the house. The book ends on a more serious note with the death of one of the mian characters. To find out who you'll have to read the book.

I love the way Zindel alternates the chapters between John and Lorraine's voices. It supplies a great way to teach kids about point of view and characterization. And I'll never forget the story Mr. Pignati teaches John and Lorraine about the woman, her husband, her lover, a boatman and an assassin.

I found the plot dull and repetitive. The author, Paul Zindel, creates the book around two teenagers who take turns writing chapters. The context is boring and not stimulating, and the common references to psychology can become annoying. Also, in my opinion, the plot is also boring. It is about two teens who visit an old man almost every day. I can't tell what this book is supposed to be. A suspense story? No, not hardly. A mystery? Nope. Action/Adventure? Yeah, right.

Lorraine gouted this. She said this because her mother was yelling at her. This book is ok it was not one of my favorite. The book I think is ment for people that like books about kids ,nun and old people. The people in my group did not like the book it was not exsiting at all if anything it was boring.

I'm not saying that this book will make things better or give you the answer or anything, just that you might like it if you are troubled.To those of you who are studying it in school right now, I know it might seem stupid, but stick with it.

It can really be important for them to get to know how we think and feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun book with meaning","review":"Told in retrospection by John and Lorraine, two friends with potential, the novel is chock full of adventure including such beloved teenage pasttimes as ditching school, driving a car without a drivers license, and avoiding parents. The dynamic between John and Lorraine has just enough romantic tension as to make it a bit of a romance without being too sappy. Through their relationship with the Pigman, John and Lorraine are given a glimpse of the types of problems that accompany adulthood. Namely, issues of guilt and regret, doing the right thing, and learning from your mistakes. This is an adventure story, a romance, and a coming of age book all wrapped in a unique format that really captures the ups and downs teenagers face as the navigate the complexity that exists in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"BOOK REVIEW","review":"I think the authors purpose for writing this book was to let teenagers know about responsibility. I agree because I think it is good to be responsible. I think Zindel handled the style very well because he was very down to earth.

I think the book was perfectly done and I think it was wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pigman","review":"I am going to tell you if I liked or disliked the book. I guess if you asked me how I liked the book I would say that the book was alright. There was somethings in the book I didn't much care for, but for the most part I enjoyed it. The parts that I did not much care for was when they were smoking, drinking,and slapping each other. I think instead of them hitting and smoking each other the author could have done something else. The reason why I am thinking that way is because there are littler kids then me that will read this book and they might think that somking is good for them so in turn they might try and do that. Another thing I did not like was when they were cursing. I do kmow that they were not bad words but I now that most people don't want there kids to read books like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great book","review":"I THINK THIS BOOK IS REALLY GOOD FOR TEENAGERS THESE DAYS I AM IN 8TH GRADE AND FINISHED IT ON 3-29-00 AND I THINK THIS BOOK IS AMAZING! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"70's teenage angst and Salinger ripoff","review":"Zindel seems to think that if you write about juvenille existentialism through the voice of a teenager, and use a lot of pseudo-realistic dialogue, you'll come up with something that's as good as J.D.

I noticed that after a few paragraphs the story got tiring and quite boring. You want a book that you would like to read and you cannot put down. This read for me was difficult, as it was a book that I did not enjoy reading and I didn't wish to continue.So, if you're like me then The Pigman is not the book for you especially if you are trying to enhance the level of your reading.

After i read it i wished so badly that a movie would come out about the book, and who knows maybe some day it will. i thought it was sweet that they showed so much friendship between all three of them. But i think the best thing is how a lot of people can relate to the story, because we dont all have perfect parents, and it gives them more hope and shows that friendship it the biggest joy that life can give you, but that there is a point or a line that you just cant cross!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sore Thumb","review":"The book, the Pigman, isn't an eye-catching book. Although, after I read the first few pages, I knew it was going a very, very good book and would be one of the few really well written books that I would ever read. The Pigman is about two teenagers, John and Lorraine. John and Lorraine meet the Pigman, Mr. Angelo Pignati, after prank phone calling him. After a while, they see that this old man isn't just the Pigman, it's their new best friend. The chapters were altered between John speaking and Lorraine speaking. It was really interesting how they both interpreted things, and to see how different their personalities really were. The book made me go from laughing out loud to having a tear roll down my cheek in seconds.

My 12 year old read it, followed by me. It's nothing more than an extended short story and involves two of the most uninspired and wasteful kids you'd ever want to meet; neither one has an attractive bone in their body, and the reader couldn't really care less if they themselves just left the story altogether.

This book is full of different themes such as broken families, friendships, respect, humor, and dealth.

They both have a hard family life so when they meet the pigman they have an excape from their homes. They see that life can be fun. They also learn a valuable lesson on trust. The Pigman trusts them and they betray him by having a huge party at his house when he is in the hospital. They realize true friendship is more important than trying to be popular and having parties. The end of this book was very sad, but it taught a great lesson on not taking people for granted. I will not tell you how it ends becuase you may not have read it yet, but I bet you can guess.

It is an interesting tale about fifteen-year-old best friends John Conlan and Lorraine Jensen and their bizarre escapades. The escapades come about upon meeting with 50-year-old Angelo Pignati, later nicknamed The Pigman, who appears to be something of a child in an adult's body. John and Lorraine spend time with him while secretly comparing that lifestyle to their own, and during that time they find themselves in unexpected, tense situations.The only problem with this book is that the first few chapters give away a very crucial happenstance that takes place toward the end of the book. It doesn't ruin the book or anything, but I think it would have been better if we just led ourselves to that conclusion by reading the book thoroughly. Still, this is a very good piece of literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"A strange but good tale!","review":"This book first set me off. The beginning is a little strange. It's gets a little confusing when the main characters, Lorraine and John, take turn writing the book. The book is based on their experiences with the Pigman or Mr. Pignati. They refer to him as the Pigman because of his last name of course. They meet the Pigman when they're playing phone races with a few of their friends. At first is was just a game, but then they decided to be friends with the Pigman. The Pigman need the kids because he's a lonely old man who recently suffered a loss. I loved this book.

According to the story she made up on the spot, she and John are working for a charity. He offers them ten dollars for their cause, and they two go over to his home to collect it. They find an old, lonely man, and before they know it, a friendship has developed.I enjoyed this book very much.

While reading the book, I hoped nearly all the time, that the action was about to start now. And when it started, it lasted only a few lines. Then the author changed the topic to continue with the most boring stories about the characters you can't imagine.

First, it wasn't the type of book I like to read. I prefer a book with lots of suspense and action. The Pigman didn't have these qualities that should be in books. The story lacked excitement and pizazz. Another reason I didn't like the pigman is because it lacked a steady plot. The story bounced back and forth between situatiuons and confused the reader. You had to pay very, very close attention or else you would get totally lost. The story in general was messy when it comed to organizing a good plot, setting, date, and object.

I started listening with him for a couple minutes to get him started, but then I couldn't walk away, I was hooked and had to listen to the whole thing that night!It is really well-written and well performed! It is often very funny - we were laughing out loud at several places. And the narrators did such a great job - they sound like the real teenagers telling us their story. The boy reads one chapter, and the girl reads the next chapter - and I really liked the banter between them and their entirely different personalities and perspectives. I found it all very entertaining, very funny at times and very dramatic at others.My son got wrapped up in the story and I was so glad I got to listen to it as well. We just ordered the sequel and look forward to listening to that on our family drive to Chicago."},{"rating":"1","title":"It can use some more exitment.","review":"This book has too much of the worst things in life, and I just like a book that gets you away from reality, not one that shows you the worst of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite books of all time","review":"I thought I wouldn't like this book when I had to read it forEnglish class. But now I love the book. It's written basically forteenagers, but I guess anybody could read it. You really get to learn about teenagers in this book, their emotions and such and how one would respect somebody. Mr. Pignati was obviously a role model for John and Lorraine. He made them understand things about life that are hard to understand. You couldn't ask for a better book by Zindel.

John and lorraine made me see that I wasn't alone in the teenage world and that there were others like me and in their own way, also taught me lessons. I was so sad to when the Pigman left me.

The action comes in late in the game, and while it is decent, the rest is awful! The \\"humor\\" is irritating, the love between Figure Four and Alita is so out of the blue; at first they hate each other, but then he's saving her and visa-versa, it's just so random.I couldn't even read it through the first time, it was that bad! I finally finished it, knowing the good action is usually at the end of the books, but if I read Alita starting here, i would have never read again.Oh, and the Tuned equipment being like little bugs is so stupid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb AND Unoriginal!","review":"This is even worse than the big long sports story stretching from volumes 3-4, if that's possible. Pretty much this is a corny \\"romantic comedy\\" type thing. Sound Alita-ish? You're right, it's not. I mean, was Kishiro *forced* to write nine volumes even though he'd already run out of good stories, or what? Anyways, this is SO awful! Entirely unoriginal, the type of story where the girl and guy start out hating eachother, then go all lovey-dovey around the end. Aside from the romance, the *other* story pretty much involves Alita trying to blow people up. Somehow, the author actually managed to make this boring. I'd recommend you buy this book if you're curious as to how such a violent story could be so dull, but otherwise, don't waste your money. If you must, buy Alita #1&2, but don't go any further!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New and Unique!","review":"I've read a few \\"Animorph\\" books, but this is a new and original series that everyone should love.

I love to read fiction stories, basically the ones that have to do with magic, etc... I gave this book a rating of 4. I couldn't give it a 5 because i still felt like there was something missing from it. It was very interesting to read, but I really don't like it when books just end...leave off, and make you wait to read the next, (It is a pretty long series). This book has a lot to deal with Dreams, and fantasy, yet combined into a sort of freaky reality. If you like fiction, or if you just like to read in general, I suggest this book. I'm not quite so sure about the whole series because I have not read the other books yet, but I'm sure they get better by the book. If you are interested in a book that will make you keep wanting to read more to find out what happens next, this is a good one. It close to being rated a 5.

I would recommend it to anyone. When David's girlfreind Senna (hence the title) disappears at the end of the dock, he and four other freinds must rescue her, even if it means travelling to another universe to find her. The only thing some of you might not like about it is that some of the things are a little hard-to-believe. I don't have a problem with that kind of stuff, it's just that I know some people don't like those kinds of things. (I'm just warning you)"},{"rating":"2","title":"So bad its good!","review":"I am not a fan of Katherine Applegate. I think that her book series, the \\"Animorphs\\", was very original, but it definetly lacked pizzazz. I got tired of hearing about all the stupid kids and the changing animals and aliens and yeerks. In her new book series, \\"Everworld\\", I grew tired of how simple the writing was. Again her book lacked a certain pizzazz, but this time the plot was much more interesting. I have never heard of a book where norse gods and Aztecs battle, and I've never heard of enyone being \\"trapped\\" in a nightmare. I still feel that K.A.

It was a little hard to get into at first but a quarter of a way into we all cared what happened to the characters and wanted to know what happened next. My biggest problem with the book was the blatant product placement, I wouldn't be supprised if Taco Bell and Doritos had paid Ms. Applegate's literary advance."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment, gives Animorphs a bad name","review":"I was very disappointed in the language used in \\"Search for Senna. In fact, I only got to chapter 8 and then quit. I'm a major animorphs fan. Read every one from 1-32 and all others and I say, anyone who reads everworld before animorphs won't read animorphs if they don't like language. If you don't like swaring, this IS NOT YOUR BOOK.

I planned on buying it but found out it was the second book of a series. So I went out and bought #1 and #2. After reading Search for Senna, I'm astounded at how good the author's detail is. The ocassional blood, gore, and profanity just add to the book's appeal. I can't wait to read the second book! Every book ends making you want to hear the rest of the story and buy the next book. I never read Animorphs but have seen the TV show once or twice and it didnt seem that great. When I found out the author of the Everworld series was the same author as Animorphs, I thought Everworld would be lame. But after I read it, I saw how wrong I was. I'd suggest this series to any interested in Horror or Fantasy books."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"I'm 21 years old and happened to be browsing through the Young Adults section for books I read when I was a kid when I saw the cover to this book. I simply said ooo... I'd never read any Animorphs or anything like that but this book caught my interest. Well let me tell you it is one of the better books I've read, including more mature \\"adult\\" books. Applegate does an outstanding job showing how real and terrifying dreams and reality can be. But she also shows the heroism that emerges as well. I've finished reading number 6 as well now. Read 1-6 in a little over a day. That's how captivating the series has been for me.

I remember being excited for the next books to come out because I was really curious how it would all end. Definitely worth reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome book! You must read! ~","review":"This book is very interesting throughout and can vary with surprise and suspension. Being a fantasy, it is very well written. If you like Animorphs, you'll definetly love this. At times it can be confusing because you can't tell if he's dreaming or in reality but other than that, it's put together creatively. I highly recommend this to anyone(ages 11+)."},{"rating":"2","title":"ever world #1 search for senna","review":"ATTENTION! You have to read this book! It is the greatest book ever. If you are looking for fantasy this is for you. When I opened the first page of this book I couldn't put it down. It all starts out where Chris, David, Jalil, and April were some how drawn to a boat ramp where a girl named Senna was sitting there on a rock, and then a giant wolf eats her. The group of friends go after the wolf, and then BOOM they all mysteriously get pulled to a dream land which they soon find out is called \\"Ever World.\\" Soon they figure out that Senna isn't with them so they go searching, and then there on then they have to try to survive throught out this Ever World.

Even though I'm in my mid-twenties, I like to read the occasional YA book, especially L. J. Smith's series.I've read the first two books of the Everworld series, and I'm anxiously awaiting more. The combination of mythical elements is intriguing, and the situation itself it very exciting. The characters are three-dimensional people I can imagine meeting.I *was* a little surprised by the amount of swearing and sexual inneundo in this book, but I don't think that's a bad thing. I seriously doubt that many kids today over 12 or 13 would be shocked; a middle school cafeteria is undoubtedly much worse.So, buy it for yourself and then pass it along to a kid. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everworld","review":"Have you ever had a dream that felt so real,you thought mabey you were not dreaming at all?

The only other person there is Senna.Suddenly they all wake up in a place called Everworld, hanging from the mythological god Loki's castle. To avoid being killed they escape, leaving them in a strange knew world full of Unbelieveable creatures and beings. The wierd part is when they fall asleep in Everworld, they wake up at home, but only for a while. They always return to a nightmare. Are there two of each of them?

There are many books to this series and each one takes you to a new and interesting land. I would recommend this series to a child that was interested in learning and exploring different mythological times. Each book in the series takes the characters to a different place from under the sea with Poseidon, to Mt. Olympus, to Merlin, to King Arthur, to Egypt, back to Ireland and leprechauns and to new and unheard of places as well as many more. For a child or young at heart adult that is starting their journey in to the land of books they are well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I picked this book up off the shelf in a Barnes and Nobel.

It is a rather complete excursion into CE app-land.The book is very well written with clear, concise examples, easy-to-understand passages and a simple layout that works.

BEWARE"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moonlight On Your Day","review":"This is an amazing book. While giving you insight into the faith and structure of a rarely discussed segment of the world, the author makes the characters compelling enough that you learn while not being able to put the book down. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good story, especially good on a rainy day or to read at night before going to bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"An everyday pleasure - Why?","review":"Why ? Simply because I am currently about to finish the translation of \\"Moonlight\\" for the French publisher La Table Ronde in Paris. And this certainly is one of the best novel I ever read, let alone translated. Hope the French readers will like it as well. And congratulations to Gina Nahai."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moonlight - a liitle madness, a lot of magic","review":"Nahai captures through beautiful prose the madness and magic of the Jewish ghetto in Teheran, mother and daughter relations and love vs. death. Her surrealistic portraits are truer than snapshots, capturing the essence of each character. Interwoven throughout this painfully lovely tale is the history of modern Iran as lived by its citzenry. Nahai examines the role of the outsider on many levels: unlucky child, unwanted daughter-in-law, social outcast, stranger in a strange land. She concludes that the transcendent power of faith and love is stronger than any code - real or imagined. This is a feast of a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was not impressed","review":"I was expecting a great deal more from this book, especially since I myself was born Jewish. However, I found the characters to be unlikeable, the plot unbelieveable, and the setting (the most interesting part to me) not at all well delineated."},{"rating":"2","title":"#1","review":"Her hard work has paid off, because Gina Nahai is now #1 on the Los angeles Times bestseller list!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't waste my money on this one!","review":"I have heard Ms. Nahai's interview on National Public Radio, and have read part of her book. I find her inarticulate and misinformed. I am sure there is money to be made in going along with the current propaganda, and adding fuel to the Iran-bashing that is going on. Shame on her for propagating such insulting distortions of a counrty she calls her home! She reminds me of Betty Mahmoodi, the author of Not Without My Daughter. Furthermore, I take exception to the comments on her book jacket comparing her prose to that of Gabriel Garcia Marquez. She flatters herself if she thinks that magical wings, levetations and clumsy names put her in the same category as such a master writer. The book doesn't fly as reality or magical realism. I did not buy this book, nor would I recommend it to any serious reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"the elastic cord is JUNK....took off the first 20inches and there is knots all the way through the string..like it was cut and then knotted...NOT worth the money....."},{"rating":"2","title":"runs short","review":"nice casual pant that could even be dressed up a bit with the right shoe and top but the length is short for my 32 inch inseam. if you are looking for something that might actually slim you or take you down a size these aren't it. the pant is good for a smooth look but you will still look the same size as you always do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tummy control?","review":"These pants fit great, are true to their sizes, comfortable and stylish. However, I dont know why they are called Tummy control, because they are not slimming, and do not do anything different in the mid-range area than any other pants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kursk Compilation","review":"I have been interested in the battle of Kursk for many years. I try to pick up anything I can about the battle hoping to glean some new facts. I ran into this title, Images of Kursk and decided to purchase it due to the interesting photos from the Russian perspective. After reading through the dry text which is really just a rehash or compilation of other books on the subject, I was not impressed. If you really want pictures from the Russian perspective, then this is a book you would want. If you are looking for new photos from the German perspective, dont get it. And if you are looking for interesting facts on Kursk, and dont already have reference material, then this is also a good summary book. But I found most of the text was a quotation from some other source I already had!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, the pictures are nice","review":"The book gives a good introduction too Russian and German artillery and tanks. After that it simply tells you that some corps attacked another with x amount of casualties on so and so day. Without any maps, (the book only has two), this long narrative is quite useless to the reader. Furthermore most of the authors conversions from kilometers to miles and meters to yards are incorrect, I found this quite disconcerting. I still found the book an easy read though, however this is probably because I don't mind reading about one attack after another written in laundry list fashion. Without maps though the reader will never remember any of the tactical situations described in the narrative. It is for these reasons that I gave the book only two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sobering statistics, and personal eye-witness testimonies","review":"Filled from cover to cover with black-and-white photographs, Images Of Kursk: History's Greatest Tank Battle, July 1943 by Nik Cornish is a gritty, compellingly accurate, point-by-point dissection of the pivotal tank battle of World War II, between Russian and German forces from beginning to end. Vivid details, sobering statistics, and personal eye-witness testimonies enhance the text of this unforgettable and very highly recommended study of a crucial piece of World War II military history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"It is really handy and the front makes a great surface to write on if you're not using the lined paper inside. I also haven't had any problems with the binding or the side binding tearing as the material seems pretty durable. However, I only use this moderately and do not use it everyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE!!!","review":"Once again LuAn has hit the bullseye on the target!!

I congratulate LuAn for helping me and challenging me to rise to that next level!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Monitor","review":"This LCD is the perfect combination of price, performance and design. I don't have any complaint to report. It is so bright that you have to keep it at less than 50%. The colors are rich and saturated, the contrast is amazing for an Lcd. Movies and games run smooth with no ghosting at all. The built in power supply is a plus. the base is small and steady. The control bottons are the only negative that I can complain about, just because they are located at the bottom edge of the screen and the letters are written in black wich makes them hard to read or see. But once you get used to it you now exactly where to toch. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"The Syncmaster 173S that I very recently purchased is doing fine. However I wouldn't know who to blame for the broken pixels, but most likely Samsung. The constant black dot and then the blue and red one I see every so often are a bit annoying, but supposedly most LCDs come with it. It's too much of a pain to exchange it and demand for a new one or for it to be fixed, but that's a personal preference. Overall though, the crispness and clarity is amazing and i'm satisfied with that. I'd prefer the neck to have more flexibility. Size is decent at this stage in technology~"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until the capacitor blows","review":"I bought this monitor in order to have a matching set (I have a dual screen set up and already had one 173S). I used the monitor without incident for about 6 months until just last week both monitors stopped working. They're both hooked up to a UPS with surge protection so I don't know why they both went at the same time, but I checked behind the back shroud on both units and the capacitors had leaked on both units. I hate having to give such a bad review, but this type of issue cannot be ignored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this album...","review":"This is hands down one of my top 5 albums of the year. If you're into classic rock at all this is the album you need to get. Great opener with \\"Threathawk\\", which is my favorite track on the album, then they change up with songs like \\"Tiny Brains\\" and \\"George Walker on Water\\". Overall and stellar debut that you shouldn't miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"DUDE - Steve Miller - Back from the 70s","review":"Dude - wtf, This is some mince-meat spicy myoosik....It like tickles my tounge when im wearin my lounge lizard suitas a warm up to takin my teenfun babes out for a swing under the crystal ball....Funkalicious....SmoochesBrentkins..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly Kid A","review":"I don't listen to a lot of Zepplin, but, aside from the 1st track, that band does not come to mind when I listen to this album. Pink Floyd, yes; Air, yes; Radiohead's Kid A -- most definitely. Like that album, this one maintains a somber mood throughout, adding sustained keyboard chords and echoey guitar to mostly murmured vocals. There are less electronic beats here than on Kid A, but they do appear on a couple of the instrumentals. Overall the album is a bit too sleepy for my tastes, with few strong melodies, and it certainly doesn't add much to what Radiohead already added to Pink Floyd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!

It's brilliant! For those who find it too steep, read the information under \\"What This Book Is Not\\" (p.3): \\"This is *not* a beginner's book, in the sense of teaching how JavaScript or Perl work, ..., and several assumptions are made: .You're familiar with HTML... .You have an *understanding of Perl, JavaScript, or VBScript* .You have created your share of Web pages...\\" The author is honest from the start. It's a great book if you need some answers as a scripter or (even light) programmer, not as a new-comer in the web or scripting fields. But if you are a scripter, this book will make you look good more than once.

It does not teach you how to do anything. These examples could be found for free on the web. This book was a waste of money, if you are trying to learn Perl, \\"Learning Perl(llama book)\\" is a good one, Javascript, \\"Javascript for Dummies is a good one\\", but it is a thorough language and a C/C++ background would be good for either Perl or Javascript."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect present for an MCR fan!","review":"A must-have for any MCR fan, these are now out of production and extremely rare, so finding Gerard at this price is the best deal you're going to get.

As a member of AA and having read a number of histories of AA and Bill W I was really looking forward to reading something which I thought might throw a new light and tell me something new. In reality it was, with very few exceptions, simply a repetition of the same old stuff and written in an irritating style. Alluding to a biker at Founders' Day on the second page Mr Raphael writes \\"The contrasting colors and textures emphasize the cut of the chaps, how they cradle his virilia, leaving him suggestively exposed.\\" proved to be warning enough that this was not going to be a book I would enjoy or find readable. Irritating prose, questionable and unsupported ideas and theories, and with allusions to being a poor man's \\"Not God\\" this is most definitely a book I would not commend to anyone. And not worth the quite substantial price either!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I picked up this book after finishing Francis Hartigan's fine biography of Bill Wilson. I simply could not finish this book. \\"Raphael,\\" the pseudonym of the author used in accordance with AA's 12th tradition, does a slip-shod job of reserching this subject, and mainly spends his time writing textual rifs based on his own interior monolog.This kind of writing seemed OK in the 70s, but now that Raphael and I have sobered up, it doesn't seem very interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"No CD-ROM","review":"I ordered a secondhand edition of this book on Amazonbut was disappointed to find it did not come with theCD-ROM. There was no mention in the seller's reviewabout the cd missing, so I assumed I was purchasing a complete edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"just not good enough","review":"Considering all the man's claimed wealth of experience this book is short of everything necessary. In aiming to be all things to all writers, published or not, it covers none of the bases in any depth at all. There was really very little of any substance, and plenty of it was so obvious to make me squirm at his 'insider tips' parts.Some of the chapters were 4 pages long, which just isn't good enough. In the whole book there is one decent anecdote about Bob Hope. There are ideas here and there + some information of note, but when you open a book by a guy with 35 years of experience you kind of expect things to interesting and enlightening on every page. It isn't.I expected so much more from this book and was left feeling staggeringly short-changed. There are awful typos too, even one on the back cover - 'myultiply' for example. Laughable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so interesting","review":"This book sounds like it could be filled with wonderful pictures, but the pictures are not of good quality and there aren't many of them. It's the story of a girl and her mother who want to have their home replicated in dollhouse scale. The story is not well written, and the lack of pictures and bad quality of existing pictures don't make up for the badly written text.I wouldn't reccomend this book to anyone since there are so many good books already out there with good pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best locket ever!","review":"My husband bought me one of these 6 picture lockets many years ago and I carry photos of him, my kids and my dog inside. I especially like to wear it whenever I'm traveling alone. If I start feeling lonely, I open it for a quick glance at my family's smiling faces. I bought the same locket for a couple of my friends after they raved over mine. It's pretty, not too heavy and well made. I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you like cutting the neck of your loved one? Then this is for you!","review":"This locket is a jagged, neck cutting, menace. It's like a tiny morning star around your neck.

I have 5 kids so a general locket wouldn't work for me. Within 20 min of me having this locket in my possession the lock messed up. It also tarnishes very easy and is hard to polish.

Worth every penny and far above any other gluten free boxed cake or any wheat containing boxed cake out there. Their spice/carrot cake is also very good. Recommended highly from on Celiac to the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Treat!","review":"This is a quiet book in which to lose oneself. I was immediately caught-up in the mother-daughter relationship, the move upstate, etc. It's character driven [my favorite type of read!], and Graver portrays her characters in a fully nuanced fashion. I felt as if I were a neighbor -- mostly of Burl's [I'm not sure why....] -- probably the bees, honey, nature & the flawed nature of man/mankind/womankind. I just finished this book,and I already miss it, as well the people. Reading this novel helped me to realize how impossibly fast we live in NYC as opposed to life upstate. I've gone upstate so often -- actually seeking a quieter [almost more normal] cadance that life offers. I think that Miriam hoped to find this, as well. I so enjoyed reading about Francis, and Graver csptures his \\"situation\\" with authenticity. It is truly an engrossing book, and I recommend this without hesitation. It offers much more than I've written......"},{"rating":"1","title":"skip it...","review":"I really wanted to love this one and fell right in with the wonderful prose and interesting characters. I thought the initial writing was elegant and didn't mind the slow pace of the book, due to the laid-back setting of upstate New York farm country.However, after about fifty pages or so I got bored and the story didn't go in the direction I would have liked. The writing became too detailed and literally nothing happened. There was to much emphasis on the past and the interrelationships between some of the characters felt weird to me (i.e., Eva's parents). I would have liked the story to be told in the present, in Eva's voice entirely, and to learn about her transition from NYC to rural farm country.I do not recommend this book. Perhaps I was looking for something more like \\"The Secret Life of Bees,\\" which I highly recommend. (Not that bees and honey are my typical go-to topics when selecting a novel.) This one just wasn't as sweet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent Story - Fine Novel","review":"Eva is a honey thief - but not the only one, because isn't Burl, the beekeeper, stealing honey from the hives as well? In Elizabeth Graver's excelent novel The Honey Thief, everyone is stealing a little something: Eva acts out as a shop-lifter, Burl steals snatches of real life from his unavailable woman friend, Alice, and Miram has stolen the ugly truth about Eva's father. All of them must relinquish their loot.The novel unfolds beautifully and avoids the pat ending. A great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"murky at best","review":"plodded through this book. struggled to finish it. kept waiting for something to happen, something to engage my interest. but i was half-way through the book before i realized i should have put it down long ago, yet i'd invested too much time to cast it aside. the imagery is nebulous. the diaglogue is stiffled. explicatory timing is way off. i am a fan of chronology. flip-flopping through time did not work well with this novel, though I truly enjoyed Graver's previous novel, \\"Unravelling;\\" one of the better books I've read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A journey into the complex world of relationships and bees","review":"I thought this was a wonderful book. Graver has an amazing ability to articulate the confusion, pain and joy of early adolescence. She creates believable and touching characters, who you come to care about in spite of their shortcomings. With these characters, she creates a series of complex human relationships with no simple conclusions, and a story that is a pleasure to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the story??!!","review":"I was hoping this book would be good. It wasn't. It was so completely anti-climactic it was ridiculous. I thought it was going to pick up the pace when the story about Eva's father unfolded, but no- it just went through the events and moved on to another pointless chapter. What a let down.PS: This book has the SAME cover as another book called Three Ages of Women. Weird"},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant","review":"I love this novel. The languange is elegant and eloquent, the research meticulous. I was completely drawn into the world the novel creates, and into the inner world of each character. The characters are deftly drawn and thoroughly compelling--I would recognize them if I passed them on the street. I plan to read all Graver's novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak characters in an underdeveloped plot","review":"Is it fair to review a book I didn't finish reading? Well, why not? This book included long chapters in flashback form, the characters were not believable and their relationships were too frustrating for the reader. No one told anyone anything. The mother moves out of New York City with her daughter to find a better life in rural America. Instead of moving to a small town, she rents a house in the country, dumps her kid with a ridiculous babysitter so she's basically alone all day, then commutes to town to work. I kept thinking about what would happen to her commute in the winter in New York state on dirt roads. Ridiculous! This was supposed to be an improvement over the warm protective downstairs neighbor in NY? Too dumb to believe. I had to quit reading it. The plot was as slow as honey and not anywhere near as sweet. For a really poignant young girl story read Elizabeth Berg's Durable Goods and Joy School. Those are truly wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of potential ruined","review":"This could have been a truly wonderful story about a troubled little girl and how the reclusive bee-keeper changes her life. Instead, what you get is a semi-developed plot with a lot of gratuitous and extremely foul language with a perverted and shocking sex scene thrown into the mix. This book is an excellent example of how to debase a wonderful story. Next time I want to experience that kind of language I'll visit my nearby tavern where all the afternoon alcoholics hang out and imagine instead that the filth is coming out of an eleven-year-old's mouth. Sorry, but that is not entertaining to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to turn your backyard hobby into a money making venture","review":"One of several how to books from Lee Sturdivant, this book is an enjoyable look at how to make a buck in your backyard. There are a lot of basic concepts here that are important to master in order to make a success of your homegrown herb business.Written in a straight forward and easy to follow manner, this book is the written experience of those who know how to take advantage of the local demand for herbs and herb products.There are chapters on which herbs to grow and how to sell both fresh cut herbs and potted plants. The advice to keep it simple at first and let the business grow itself is right on the money.Also, the emphasis on a quality product delivered in a reliable manner is an important business motto.Whether you have some extra herbs now or want to plan what to grow in the future, this book will help you, inspire you and give you the confidence to get the job done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book on Ninja Burger ever","review":"I highly recommend this book to fans of Ninja Burger!

Retained is the Mason sound we all love; gone are the pure gems we have come to expect. There is no song on this album as good as Ulysses, Sorry Signs, Birds Flying Away or Darkness Between the Fireflies. What we have here are great, but not moving songs. \\"Moon Sailing on the Water\\" is the my favorite song on here, it reminds me of David Gray, it's very quiet while at the same time telling you everything.He still can write some of the best love song though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Jennings","review":"Boneclouds by Mason Jennings is the best effort he has put forth thus far. Song #1 & 8 kill me each time. Maybe it's the heartbreaking melodies or the heartbreaking lyrics, but they really get to me. There are also some experimental songs on the disc, like #4 & 9, but the disk is worth buying for the other songs which may be simple but moving at the same time. Once again, his themes have to do with love, drinking, and questioning faith, which I can relate to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mason Jenning's Boneclouds","review":"I am a huge Mason fan. I have seen him in concert six times and even met him for an extended period of time. I had so much anticipation for this album, and it was somewhat disappointing compared to his earlier albums. Thats not to say do not buy this cd. Boneclouds just shouldn't be the first Mason album that you buy. I still enyoy listening to the album, and look forward to seeing these songs live. This album is no where near as powerful as others. But i still love Mason and this album doesn't change that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Animal Rites","review":"Read this book twice because it was entertaining. The characters were layered right along with the plot, and kept my interest from beginning to end. Frank was indeed Noble. Marcell and his family provided a different twist on humor, passion, and unique experiences. Rudy even made me laugh, disgusting as he was. They were all vivid and interesting to follow. I've never rooted for a character as much as I did Marcell. This should be made into a movie starring Alec Baldwin."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT DESIRABLE","review":"Having read NJ's first two books of this trilogy (?), I had to purchase DESIRE. Mistake. Couldn't even finish this one. Everything just happened too fast in this book as far as our couple meeting and wedding, and then the story went downhill from there. Marital problems showed up right after their \\"I do's.\\" They really didn't even know each other long enough to get married! What was the rush NJ? Poor plot. All in all, this was not a well thought out book. Pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Can Do Better Nicole!","review":"The Seduction is one of my all time fav books, but Desire fizzles from page one. Yes, lots of sex, but it lacks the warmth of her previous books, so the sex seems gratutious, not a natural progression of intimate passion. Neither the hero nor the heroine have any redeaming qualities that make us, the reader, relate to either one of them. I know Nicole Jordan can do better, as Lord Sin and Vanessa's story is my favourite re-read on my shelves. If you are new to Nicole Jordan, read the Seduction. You will not regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Desire This","review":"I wonder if I should rate this book? especially since I am trying to get rid of it. OOPS I mean sell it. This book was so boring I had to force myself to finish. (I believe in finishing what I start) The plot was really weak, The 2 main characters said I Love you so much at the end I wanted to ----. Also N.J.doesnt even tell you at the end if the hero catches the mystery spy or who the mystery spy really is. I am 16 yrs old and the only reason I can see someone liking this book, would be the sexual scenes or maybe the caring of ones family. This is my first N.J. book, sure hope the others are better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tis..... Tis...","review":"You guys can not possibly be serious, right? If Lucian said \\"Young Bucks\\" one more time I was gonna scream! I love love love NJ. Most of her books are amazing, but Desire was far from it. A retarded curse and a spy who EVERYONE knows is a spy. I did not find myself invested in a single character of this book. It normally takes me a few days to complete a novel, but this book took me nearly a week! I honestly did not want to go on. Oh, the torture! Although it is not a complete bomb, it is no firework. Save your time and read The Seduction by NJ..... much better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Season 1","review":"I liked Season 2 better than season 1 . It has been established more about the Epp's brothers relationship and the side stories concerning the boys father and the love interest of the professor is more established. The plots remain interesting and Charlie's mentor, the physics guy is a nice addition. They have recurring guest stars and are slowly (too slowly) filling out the backstories somewhat. I find that some of the math explanations given in the squad room-sometimes with minutes to spare- un realistic. I would rather they went into them at the end some of the time. It \\"almost\\" is a really good show; but just slightly misses the mark for me; probably because I don 't find Charlie to be a character that has depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Import Drag racing video, bar none!","review":"This video focuses on the Annual Diamond Star Shootout held in Norwalk Ohio for the past 6 years. Thus, it does center around Mitsubishi Eclipses, Eagle Talons and Plymouth Lasers. However, there is also excellent coverage of the annual IDRC Import Drag Race in Norwalk (held the day after the DSM SHootout). In the DSM shootout you will see lots of drag racing as well as road racing. You will also learn about the history of the cars and why owners love these cars so much. Rick Santangelo is a first class producer and has even won the coveted \\"Best Import Racing Video Award\\" in 1999 for this video.

Some of the photographs here are amazing, and the taxonomic information seems to be, from this amateur's perspective, sound and up to date.

One can experience the full range of the composers thoughts and emotions with Mme. Alain's superb recording of Vierne's first four symphonies. The recording on Cavaille-Coll's wonderful instrument at Caen is state-of-the-art, as is Mme. Alain's playing. Marie-Claire Alain has an uncanny knack of being able to literally reach inside the soul of a composer, as she has done with her latest recorings of Franck and her brother Jehan. You will experience the man as well as the music in this double CD set. All we need now is a recording of the last two symphones!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Make It So","review":"While browsing through one of the rubber stamping magazines, I saw an ad for Holy Moly Mackeroly. I was intrigued. It said, \\"....from 3 Art Stamps to the Smithsonian..\\". I had to have the book. The publisher of the magazine forgot to include where to find the book. Fortunately, I emailed them and they humbly asked for forgiveness and gave me the information I needed to get the book in my hands.The book quickly arrived. I opened it with anticipation. I sat down and started to read. I finished the first reading in a weekend. This book has changed my life and I believe if you are a creative person, it can change your life too. It has some simple steps to move forward into taking your art to a new level, great ideas of how to start selling your art and a wealth of wonderful personal stories of the journey of an artist.If you have always dreamed you wanted to be an artist, this book will help you realize that dream and \\"Make It So\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cover is the best part!!","review":"I have owned this book for a long time....I am just starting to read it.

All of the pages are so dense that there is no breathing or white space.I fully anticipated photos and/or illustrations since the book is indeed about design and the business of art cards and similar products.

This is one of June's most relaxed albums, a true jazz outing with the cream of instrumentalists on a tasty menu of standards, some better known than others. \\"Rock Me To Sleep\\" and \\"When Lights Are Low\\" long have been regarded as this album's notable bookends but there is much admirable between.Tracks have been added from \\"The Cool School,\\" June's unusual collection of mostly kids' songs in a jazz setting.

Unlike our previous fairly inexpensive cross-cut shredder from Royal, the SB-80 is quiet, fast, and dependable. It never stops (even when I put in 10-12 sheets at a time) and it has been troublefree. The SB-80 cuts paper into long strips, which is the only security I need. I considered getting a cross-cut shredder, but I was concerned about jamming. The SB-80 works jam-free because, I believe, it is so basic in its cutting operation. The more complicated the machine, the more problems you probably should anticipate.If you have only basic security needs, then this is a great shredder. It should be perfect for the average home office.I highly recommend this shredder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Shredder","review":"This shredder jams up constantly because the full indicator does not work properly. It takes 3 or 4 tries to shred one piece of paper. You have to reverse the shredder every time it gets stuck and then try again. Overall a real pain to shred any amount of paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"shredder doesn't cut it!!!","review":"This shredder is supposedly rated as one of the best on the market. I don't know who came up with that one but it definitely isn't worth the price! This is especially true if you are interested in maintaining your security through shredding documents. The machine does not shred into confetti...only into strips. After several attempts at loading documents in different directions I found most of the data to still be readable. Also...credit cards were not completely cut either! It doesn't take a brilliant mind to realize how quickly someone could reassemble sheets or cards if they wanted to get the information. I would not recommend this machine to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is unique. There can be no other like it!","review":"At first I read the book quickly like a novel and didn't get much out of it. Then a friend suggested I read it again intuitively (not intellectually) and let the words sink in. It has since changed my life. The author speaks of the Spiritual Laws of Nature to which everyone is bound regardless of earthly race or position. It explains all aspects of life in an objective and wonderful manner. It also clarifies the true life of Jesus and His mission and does away with the many myths which have evolved over millenia. The Grail Message \\"In The Light of Truth\\" is not for the faint hearted or narrow minded. This book is for all true seekers on the spiritual path. For the true Christian who is disillusioned by the creeds and rituals of his or her church, this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous","review":"The fabric is light and falls beautifully. i did a double drape valence over an entrance to a room.

I wish I had read the comments for this set before I bought it at the drug store. It seemed like a good idea. I like that it stands up in the cabinet so I can clearly see it, and it takes only a tiny amount of space horizontally. HOWEVER, the pieces are so difficult to screw together, because they want to align crookedly, and they squeak so much they give me goosebumps! I just saw a review from someone who said they made it a bit better by using bees wax on them, so I will try that before I toss them. It seems so simple, but it is quite frustrating to have to make several attempts just to get the thing closed correctly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pretty and handy, but slightly annoying to screw back together","review":"I definitely second the comments of the previous reviewers that this is a lovely pill organizer whose compartments are spacious and convenient, however it is a bit of a pain to screw the compartments together due to the threading. In addition, when filling it each week it takes much more time to disassemble and reassemble than more traditional pill cases.I would still recommend it, though--stack them up in Roy G.

While the concept may seem good, the product is of poor quality. Doesn't screw together smoothly, which makes using this item more bother than it's worth.

The nature of their relationship was established right off. Elvis had the million dollars worth of talent and the Colonel had the ability to cash it in. Elvis went from making $18 a night on the Louisiana Hayride to making $100,000.00 for TV appearances in less than a year. He got Elvis a big money movie contract with an unheard of backend royalty. Elvis had the talent to pull it off; Parker couldn't have done it with Hank Snow. But Elvis was just as talented when he met Parker and was scraping along in the lower strata of middle class.

The problem is with its design and/or choice of materials regarding the buckles.The buckles are plastic and as such they bend and flex. This caused one of the buckles to regularly separate when any weight was applied to the strap as the outer teeth were not rigid enough to stay in place. They instead tended to bend towards the center of the male end of the buckle causing it to slip out of the female end of the buckle which then caused the car seat to fall off the luggage.If another material had been used for the buckles or another type of buckle or fastener was used this product would have been perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Similar products are better and cheaper","review":"I recently purchased the Traveling Toddler and the Tote-A-Tot Car Seat Travel Accessories.

The Traveling Toddler is also less expensive than the Tote-A-Tot.When I put my daughter in the carseat with the Tote-a-Tot, the straps strained when I pushed her around.

On my was home I couldn't get the car seat to sit straight on the front of the suitcase but I think that was my fault because she was on straight and tight on our trip there.

It is not perfect. I like Donna Anna and Leporello better in the Benjamin Luxon version, and Kiri Te Kanawa is definitely my favorite Elvira. However, Samuel Ramey is the only baritone I've seen who makes the role of Don Giovanni believable. He manages to be as dishonorable as Don Giovanni must be while still possessing the air of a gentleman, and he somehow contrives to be seductive without ever becoming lewd. Masetto and Zerlina are a charming pair, Leporello is quite credible, and Don Ottavio has the most beautiful lyric tenor voice. The final scene is rather unfortunate, but the rest of the staging and the costumes are quite good.

That's it -- an eight-game hot streak. Period. Then, it was over. Boston still couldn't beat the Yankees in the 2005 regular season, and got swept out of the '05 playoffs.

It could because while the reading is fine, and the data excellent, BP only writes about the right moves the Sox made, and totally ignores their dumb moves, like signing oft-injured Scott Williamson to be a key cog in their bullpen, or having no minor leaguers ready to help the rotation and leaving Derek 'How' Lowe Can You Go in the rotation all year.Well, they say winners get to write the history books. I guess the same could be said about baseball champs as well.

His no nonsense attitude towards being a healty person made me realize that I have no excuse to not be exercizing or eating right. I could hardly wait to get the dvd once I ordered it. Well the video seems made for people who are already in good shape, and have no physical limitations. I could hardly do the warm-ups, and once the instructor decided to spend a massive amount of time having you put your weight on your knees, I was done. I can't kneel on the ground due to surgery, and his suggestion of putting a towel underneath to cushion you was not helpful.

While Lasdun has great use of the English language, truelly poetic, the storyline is disappointing however.The mystery can be guessed from the first few pages. It starts off being complicated, and strengthens in complexity, until everything comes together at the end. Great, except the ending is NOT surprising at all. Plus, the story gets TOO complicated, and TOO thick with names, events and symbolism that the joy of reading Lasdun's beautiful writing is hampered.I think you should read this book purely for Lasdun's writing, not his story telling. I personally think he should stick to writing poetry, where he excels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Oh dear! I am so glad I checked this out at the library rather than buying it~ I was expecting a good serial killer thriller with college prfessors and a great plot; just this artsy weiting, no plot, no grisly murders, no baffled cops, no real story.

I found that I was drawn in at the beginning but as the story wore on I was hoping more and more that the end would provide some clarification as to what exactly the story was about. Not quite the page turner I was expecting and I found by the time I reached the end I was baffled and unsatisfied. I didn't like the story but it was beautifully written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bewildering to the very end","review":"I am not normally a reader of mysteries or fiction generally, so maybe that simple fact accounts for why I feel as if I have been reading a different book than those reviewers who figured it out in the first few pages. I was fascinated and confused by the text all the way through. At times, I felt certain I knew who the perpetrator was, but then I would be thrown off the trail. How else to explain the 'gift' left for him, the inexplicable reaction of Elaine to him. I may be too literal-minded for this sort of gauzy surrealism, but I enjoyed it just the same. I finished the book last night, and my mind is still trying to sort out the details of the book. As another reviewer mentioned, I may have to re-read this one just to impose some degree of mental order on the story. In any event, the prose is as finely wrought as any you'll read, so even if your sensibilities are more in tune than mine in figuring out 'whodunit', the book is worth reading for the writing alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going nowhere fast","review":"Has its moments, and the prose is good (what one would expect from a poet). But the bright little fragments of the mosaic never coalesce into a larger picture. Confusing, episodic, rambiling and disconnected. The ending disappoints. Hardly the page-turner others have made it out to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oedipus again","review":"When Anthony Burgess came to write his first novel long ago, he had the good sense to choose Vergil's Aeneid as his model. The old stories are still the best. Though critics seem not to have noticed Lasdun'influences, he has subtly modeled his story on Sophocles' Oedipus the King. The Horned Man tells the story of a man on a quest for a killer, though the audience knows all along that the guilty party is really the detective himself--always a sign that Oedipus lurks in the background. Lansdun has sprinkled the narrative with a number of clues pointing directly to Sophocles; mention of the Theban prophet Teiresias, the city of Corinth, pollution on the land, strange mythological creatures, etc. A very worthy first effort. I hope that Lasdsun turns out to be as prolific as Burgess."},{"rating":"2","title":"a rare treat from a wonderful writer","review":"I'm not usually a mystery fan, but this isn't the usual mystery. It's heady and tense without being ponderous. Lasdun is an accomplished poet which is evident in the economical way he uses language. The writing is glorious; there's not a word too many or too few. And the story is as compelling as any I've read. Forget genres.

The screen doors are thick and the seams are well constructed, I don't think my cat will be able to scratch, claw or gnaw her way out of this one :) It's built to FFA carry-on regulations, and includes a traveling info label just in case something unforeseen happens. If you have a small pet and travel frequently I would recommend this to you. Also, it has a conservative color scheme, which I (amongst others) appreciate.

NOT D-rings. This binder has D rings, but the description doesn't say. They were listed under round ring binders, which usually implies O rings. None of the reviewers bothered to say, either. Binders that have D-rings should definitely specify D rings. I hate D rings, they are next to worthless for anything other than a photo album.If you want D rings, this binder is of OK construction. Nothing special for the price. The faux leather is nicely padded and stitched. The binder itself is made of some pretty lightweight cardboard--nothing as sturdy as my old binders. The label holder has no slot and no cover, you need to tuck all 4 corners in rather than slide it in. It comes with 10 letter sized page protectors and one page lifter for the round side of the D rings.At least with this review you'll have a better idea of what you're getting. Wish people were more helpful in their reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused","review":"I am not reviewing the product, but I am commenting on the page.

The book is actually a play through which her use of a Brechtian style of theater keeps the reader in a sort of shocked confusion and not very comfortable.

The characters seem like nice people, but they stay stuck in the same antagonistic phase of their relationship for way too much of the book.

When she wrote this book under it's other title, she was based in Oklahoma City. Her resourcefulness is evident when one realizes there probably wasn't a corner Indian store from which to purchase the necessities to produce these great Indian dishes.

The lack of pictures is lamentable. The glossary/index towards the end is useless.

I bought a program for $50 that fixed that problem (EASEUS Partition Table Doctor) and then backed up all my files to DVD. Today, the computer wouldn't recognize the drive. By looking at other reviews, I found that the solution was to cut off the power to the hard drive and then power it up again. Now I have a functioning hard drive, but for how much longer?

You can also run a routine to delete files you later decide to trash. You can view backed-up items from the system (a la a ghost drive). Transfers are quick.

The only way I've managed to work around this is to unplug the power cable and plug it back in which becomes annoying after a while. In addition to that I only found out that the firewire and USB connections are on separate modules after purchasing it, which requires removing one and attaching the other one to use the two different interfaces.

Finally I just tried dragging and dropping my files onto the drive. That worked for a bit, but today the drive tells me that it is corrupt. Hopefully I can recover all those videos and photos.

The 120 GB worked really well for about a year and then suddenly the files started corrupting. Figuring I had done something to it to make it do this, I replaced it with a 360GB. Within a week the 360GB started corrupting files, and giving me 'serious error' messages - restarting itself, and not allowing me to save data. I back up my data in a number of files, but still managed to lose a day's worth of work on my PhD thesis and an entire endnote library.

I had installed it a month ago and now Windows (Vista Premium) does not recognize the drive. It used to recognize the drive when it was first installed, but for some reason it has now ceased to. I have been using the USB connection. Contrary to the claims, the back up process is neither user friendly nor intuitive as claimed on the packaging. And to worsen matters, I did not even realize that there was on an on/off switch on this device - blame it on the very sparse documentation. When I did finally discover the on/off switch, (that switch is embedded in the metal casing) I found out that it requires considerable pressure to be turned on or off.In retrospect, I would have been better off just buying an external hard disk and using Windows' in-built back-up software rather than plunking down $200.00 for this poorly designed but creatively marketed device"},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to turn on","review":"Horrendous customer service: after one hour on the phone waiting, the CS agent tells me that if I want to turn off/on the driver, I need to disconnect the power supply!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Al Hoffeld's review is right: the drivers gets extremely hot after being connected for while, so it is also dangerous.Regretfully, due to work trips, it is just in these weeks that I have been able to test fully the product so it is too late to return the product back to Amazon.

While it has a 5 year warranty, it might be replaced with a refurbished one with a 90 day warranty, beware! Yes, it looks cool, has lot of storage at a reasonable price - that's what I thought when I bought it. I read these drives have had a lot of problems, might be the reason why I got them at a hundred bucks months ago! When you loose hundreds of gigabytes of data, there is no point in listing it's pros.

That's all cool, but in the fine print, your mailing cost to send it back is on the buyer and the returned unit will still have the 5 yr warranty but may be factory reconditioned.

Sometimes it doesn't even mount or recognize ANY files on it!And now that I see it sells for only $90 now versus the $130 I paid just 4 months ago really frustrates me.I would stick with Maxtor products even though I had one die on me...which I know any will do after time.I would NOT recommend buying this product no matter how little you pay for it.

On the advice of a local techie guru, I bought seven of these drives to handle all of my data. Over the next 18 months, SIX of them failed... half just up and died, and in the other half it was the plugs that physically broke when we unplugged and replugged the drives while moving them to dust the shelf. From my examination of the units after the broken plug incidents, I came to see that the build on these drives is at a level of Chinese toys. These drives have caused us great frustration and lost productivity. I cannot say enough to warn you away from them.

Thus Far..","review":"I've only had the unit for a month and a half or so.. but so far I am very satisfied with the drive. I'm running it with a Mac mini and the transfer speed with my firewire is very fast. I'm using it mostly to back my up music and video files. It's very quiet and doesn't get too hot at all. I really like the design and look of the unit as well.My only problem is with the managing software that I got as a download from Seagate.. it doesn't recognize that the drive is attached and running. I just drag and drop on the drive's icon, by-passing the software, which does what I need done anyway, transferring the file. Also, I waited 48 minutes to talk to a human on the Seagate tech service line... a major bore.Being that they give me a five yr. warranty, I'm guessing it will perform well for some time.

Tech support couldn't solve the problem.2) On the second of my computers not only won't it initiate a backup when connected, when a new plan is created it continuously says \\"No backup plan detected\\" and cannot backup at all using the software.

The rest of the 2 CDs are as listed, and do include most of JR's best known numbers. So if you don't particularly mind not having \\"I'm Going Upside Your Head\\", this collection is really pretty good (4 stars).

Reunion specials are fine, but do it for the actual fans of the show who watched it, not to lure new viewers who MAY get they chance to see back episodes and piece it all together.

Overall it's a good buy.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Would order again","review":"The order came quickly and was in the condition that was described. I would definitely order from them again!

In fact, it's just bad. The first, fifth, and ninth tracks are much the same, just with slightly(!!) different lyrics, and frankly there are better places to find really good Mambo. This album reminded me of Janet Jackson's The Velvet Rope in what it was trying to achieve. But where Velvet Rope was an interesting album, with its excellent music, spoken word and other effects, A Little Bit Of Mambo lacks depth and never develops beyond the commercial appeal of the first cut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who really likes it?","review":"I think anyone who rated this album 5 stars, is a bit out of it.

All the songs after that are highly annoying pop-dance tunes with basically one line of lyrics that he repeats over and over and over again. I couldn't stand it, even after the second song, \\"Baby Keep Smiling.\\" Ugh. And all the songs are practically about the same thing, some guy who goes out and gets any girl he can for one night.

My dad pulled out an album by Perez Prado. On the album what should appear but mambo 5. So I put on the record and I came to the realization that Lou Bega watered down all the mambo and fenced himself in using the same old electronic-hip-hop beat to begin and break up the song for the sole reason of making it generic enough so r&b and hiphop listeners will like it. Mambo should sound like mambo, polka like polka, and swing like swing. Everyone, right now, search for Perez Prado, he blows Bega away. Plus there is a song that is one of the best i have heard in a LONG time. It is called Que Rico es Mambo. The trumpets Bega's version sound dead.

The album came out and I really didn't think it was possible.Just as I thought, the songs all sound pretty much the same, eg. the synthesised tamborines and that little yell he uses as his backbeat which is possibly the most repetitive factor of this album.The lyrics of the songs are all the same too, with the lists of women's names and countries just as an example.

Even though the quality of the film is less than state of art, I much rather prefer it this way, because it has a rather vintage and authentic appeal to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Deck for Dog Lovers and the Dog Curious","review":"This is a fun deck of cards with 52 breeds of dogs pictured. All the photos are taken with a wide angle lens, which is comical in many cases. They are definitely not precise breed-representative photos but are cute and make for a fun card playing experience. Might as well use this review to promote adopting dogs from shelters rather than buying from breeders.

There's no depth to the characters.The ending is anit-climatic and I couldn't wait for the book to end. Enjoy halfbreed but leave this series there.

Like a few other reviewers said, this book was a disappointment.I didn't like Annabelle in the other books, and I didn't like her in this one either. Also, there really wasn't enough information about her or her and Stone's relationship. I felt like it was too rushed and it just didn't feel real or good or worth reading. The scene that is most long-awaited sucked. She suddenly wanted to sleep with him and so she just sneaked into his bed? And was she a virgin or not?This is why I've never liked Evelyn Rogers because she always leaves questions unanswered.By the second half of the book, I was more interested in reading about Clare's comeuppance. But still, it wasn't worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I couldn't wait for this story to end.

Support sent a new release, and this fixed some of the more egregious errors. But a few weeks later I added 1GB of new files to my computer and Memeo only backed up the folders, not the files in those folders, and stayed completely quiet about its failure. This is unforgivable for such a critical piece of software.After 5-6 months, the drive hardware failed, and my computer could no longer recognize it.

I don't know what Seagate what thinking when they designed this, but wow, talk about total failure. I'm taking this back to the big box store for a refund and will never buy another seagate external hard drive.There is also no on/off switch, another major failure. How are you suppose to know it's safe to unplug it? Will pickup the Thermaltake N0012US aluminum external enclosure with a 120mm fan and a separate hard drive.

If I touched it while it was in use it would freeze the hard drive and my computer. After several weeks the hard drive died, I sent it back to Seagate. I figured it was just a bad drive. Although when I got my replacement it was dead on a arrival, so I had to call up Seagate for yet another replacement. My third hard drive worked, but showed the same problems as the first one.

I cant use it I even bought eSATA cords and adapter for my computer! second the customer service at Seagate is by far the worst that I have ever dealt with. they have no way of fixing this it is not covered in the warranty and if they were smart obviously they are not they would sell the little adapter that comes of separately so people can buy them.

Fortunately, due to heat problem, I had everything backed up on redundant USB drives.

Since I was using this drive for backups, I did not access it often, and there was no visible indication that it was not connected. I had to start checking in Windows Explorer that it was connected.

The tech support is adequate enough. The eSATA interface is blazing fast, but hang on a second:If you are drooling over the Transfer Rate of the eSATA interface, here are a couple things to consider.1) If your motherboard drivers are not up to date, your eSATA interface may not work for you. Mine did notwork well at first.2) The included utilities do not work when the drive is connected via the eSATA interface. You have to connect it via the USB interface to use them.3) This drive does not use a regular USB 2.0 cable. It uses the less popular Mini USB. Amazon does not tell you that anywhere.

Her original material is great. The opening song, \\"My Little Red Harp\\" Is quick and infectious, while her song \\"My father's song\\" is a gentle ode to her father and the \\"old songs\\" he sings. My favorite song, however, is the old classic \\"Home on the Range\\". I enjoy listening to it, and it gives me a feeling of my days a a five year old cowboy out in the suburbs. The entire album is a mixture of classic songs such as \\"If I had a Hammer\\" and \\"Shortnin' Bread\\" with Ms. Salidor originals, including \\"The Ice Cream Truck Song.\\" I highly reccommend this cd for any child."},{"rating":"2","title":"cinematic yet intimate","review":"A slower tempo follow-up to Kaas' previous \\"Dans Ma Chair,\\" which I found to be the best so far. Yet this CD has a mellower, enveloping sound with melodies and arrangements that grow upon you the more you listen to it. No disappointment with Kaas' unique, cool, smoky voice, of course, and that's enough reason to buy it. Choice cuts include \\"Une fille de l'Est,\\" \\"Ma liberte contre la tienne,\\" among others. Go buy it. Get swept away.

I've been listening to it all day and it's a decent album.Take the original Turn It Out album, re-think all the tunes, throw in samples from the originals, add some bumping bass & turntables, overlay it all with a heavy hip-hop beat and sprinkle some rap on top. That's Turn It Out Remixed.Fans of Next will appreciate this album, it's got a similar feel (although it takes Next's \\"concept\\" even farther). My personal favorite tracks are Doin' Something Remix (feat. Meshell Ndegeocello on electric bass - wicked!), Cash's Dream Remix, and Arruga De Agua Remix.If you aren't familiar with Turn It Out, I recommend you listen to that first - the tunes on Turn It Out Remixed are cool, but you can appreciate it more when you know the originals.Overall, it's a solid album. If you know Turn It Out and you like Next, definitely check this out. It's like a merge of the two."},{"rating":"2","title":"totally unexpected and good","review":"I saw the band this morning on the CBS news show and dug it so I picked this up today.

She is just a very talented writer that develops great characters and stories. I didn't want this one to end. All of her books either written as JR Ward or Jessica Bird are worth reading and you will truly enjoy them. The sexual tension she builds causes tingles and the love scenes are just right, the hero makes you swoon. The heroine is likable and you could see why he fell in love with her(unlike some books where the heroine is so shrewish you wonder what the appeal is).

The things she wrote were repetitive and concentrated only on her narrow range of colors. The book doesn't inspire you for new ideas that you can create when you do go out on your own to flea markets, but only about the selected items that she bought from the markets. The book would probably be better if it's a all-picture book.I don't know how she can live with only used clothes...I guess it's just not my kinda thing. I don't mind a few used items, but ALL? ick!One thing, though, I really liked about the book is the \\"how-to\\" pages on how to clean various materials, and that comebined is about 4 pages of the entire book. I wish she didn't use the handwritings as some areas are hard to read.I am glad that I got to read it as a library book; that I did not buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"The text is boring and uninspiring.

With that profit margin, she doesn't need to waste her time pushing books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice photos, boring and self-serving text","review":"In a few years or less, people will look back on the Shabby Chic trend and on Rachel and laugh. Flea market decorating has always been fun and it will remain so as long as shoppers relax, buy what THEY love, and be creative in reusing secondhand objects. Ms. Ashwell's narrow definition of what's cool and what isn't puts a damper on that fun. Already, her beloved faded fabrics and sloppy slipcovers are becoming dated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my thing","review":"Per the previous review, I love gracious living, quiet style, unfussy decorating, which is precisely why I am not a fan of fussy floral fabrics, nasty peeling paint, and tchatchakes everywhere.

And take the rest to Goodwill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiration for antique/flea market shoppers.","review":"While some of the people who have read this book dislike Rachel Ashwell's chatty tone, I find it personal and very informative. I think that she has exquisite taste and is a genius at vintage decorating. This book will help you to ferret out the quality finds at a flea market or antique mall and put them into use by providing tips on what to look for and how to restore them to charming beauty. There are sections on collections, decorations, and vintage clothing, among others, and the book finishes with a look at some finished homes done in impeccable Shabby Chic style. The pictures are beautiful, the text is as if a friend were talking to you, and the whole package is entertaining and inspirational."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming and Inspirational","review":"This lovely book takes the reader on a delicious trip into flea markets and other sources of Shabby Chic style. Hoping to find more direction on how to achieve Ashwell's style in my own home, I was instead inspired to achieve my own look by using some of her decorating principles. But don't expect these principles to be outlined for you. The chatty and personal style of writing is more like reading her personal shopping journal. Overall I found this book more enjoyable than instructional, but there is quite a bit of useful information in it, especially for first-time flea market shoppers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic photo gallery of clients' and friends' homes!","review":"I enjoyed Ashwell's first decorating book, but this \\"guide\\" is among my favorite decorating books. I enjoy the wide range of homes she shows. The only drawback is that a few of the little homes seemed so nice and perfectly organized--and then the photographs were limited. If the pictures for these homes were more extensive, I believe I would have given this book 5 stars. I love the white, off white, and antique white walls. The rooms have a very pure look to them because of the wall color and a limited wall decoration, and yet there are delightful splashes of color in the prints. Ashwell's restrained, yet lovely approach to decorating is welcoming and relaxed. I like it a lot. I'm even starting to enjoy pink!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I discovered I've been living my whole life as \\"shabby chic\\"","review":"I really loved the photos and text in this book.

I would recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking photography - provacative possibilities!","review":"I was afraid this might be redundant with the original Shabby Chic but its not. This is a super book. If you like this look, this may be the best book on the market to teach a decorating style. And what style - the book is fun fun fun! It teaches you to appreciate the beauty in old things and helps you enjoy and even celebrate the flaws. It will get you out in the flea markets and junk stores looking for treasure - you'll delight in the process as well as the result. I'm glad I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not so shabby, very chic","review":"This is the most gorgeous how-to-book out there! Mrs. Ashwell takes you along her journey, as she visits her treasure-hunting grounds for furniture and fabrics that convey a sense of history and adventure. Her style is very romantic and feminine, so this book is a find for all you girly-girls out there. Shabby Chic is presented as a life style, and she consequently adds a chapter on clothes and accessories. You will find plenty of inspiration to embrace a more eco-friendly and glamourous way of life through her tips on what to select (quality) and how to restore and clean out your \\"new\\" treasures.

It's a good strong rack, and I have put things like bottles of vegetable oil, boxes of cake mix, cans, etc. on it, no problem, no sag. It's also high enough that standard sized cans fit underneat just fine, as well as large Bush beans cans, and standard sized bottles of pasta sauce. It's long enough that it fits almost the entire width of my pantry, so I'd suggest measuring your pantry before you buy.The only downside to this product might be the cost + shipping, especially if you're getting a few of them. I noticed my local walmart carrying racks now. However, if you believe in paying for a good product, this is a good, strong pantry rack.

I say this because the author seems to be just writing stories and viewpoints without concern for who may be reading it. This created a web of stories with many jolts and turns, and you can dislike one and like another. Itàs more like a CD in that way than a book.As a lifelong resident of Milan, Italy, you can imagine how the author's view of my city. His view of Milan is sometimes irritatingly supercial but other times profondly accurtate. Come to think of it, both sentiments apply to Milan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design.","review":"I have a very large house with numerous windows - cleaning them has never been easy. A friend mentioned the Ettore Pro Window Cleaner - it's great! I'll never go back to Windex. As for the Ettore Backflip I found it difficult to use as originally designed. The scrubber when wet felt extremely cumbersome although I would try to squeeze out most of the water so it wasn't dripping all over the place when I flipped it to use the squeegee. A friend recommended using a bath Gauze Sponge - it got off bird droppings, dirt, etc. without scratching the windows, perfect and cheap! Cleaning the windows went quickly once I gave up the scrubber. In short the design of this item doesn't work well, I regret purchasing it. I should have just purchased the squeegee and saved some money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works good","review":"This cleaning tool works well but I wish it were a couple inches smaller as my house has a couple windows that this tool does not fit into well.

On the package it says the balls are actually taken and re-coated with a clear coating to bring them back to a like new condition. Would have been nice to have this listed in the description. One other observation was that some of these balls were several years old. I could tell because some of the logo's were for events several years past.

At best it was only briefly mentioned at the end of a documentary on the subject but never fully explored. While Monte Cassino was truly a bloody conflict, and involved the participation of many allied forces including Americans, British, Indians, French Colonials, Canadians, South Africans, New Zealanders and the Poles, it was the Polish forces and their sheer guts and determination who won the final battle and opened the way to liberate Rome from the German and Italian fascist forces. At last some of the surviving Polish veterans were given their long overdue opportunity to tell their story. The documentary covered every facet of the battle and also had American and British veterans recount their stories of what was one of the bloodiest battles of WW11."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I had it to do over again...

You will learn very little from this video. i wanted something that will teach potty training, simple commands such as sit, stay, down. I also wanted a video to teach how to break a dog from biting and barking as well as lead training. This had very little of any of that. Essentially it was a filming of one of his classes. I had great results with the VHS from many years ago, so I expected better from Dr. Dunbar. I decided to stream his other video Sirius Puppy Training Classic.

The videographer did a nice job, however: No background information is given regarding the puppies. How old are they? (i.e. What is the acceptable age range for puppy kindergarten?) I also hoped for footage of how a shy puppy would be handled and how a rowdy or bullying puppy would be handled. I've seen Dr. Dunbar's brief comments about these situations on his web site but I wanted to see a demonstration in action in a class setting.

But after several listenings I have concluded it does not rank with his very best. While the recordings are of high quality (especially given the circumstances), there are a few weak links here in the material (Flying Blind and Couchiching come to mind).That said, it's great to still have GL with us, and I hope he recovers to where he can publically sing and tour again.

Saw him in person last month in a wonderful concert, and even with a weaker voice he can still belt out a tune, and of course his band is top notch. Hope he puts out another album before too long.

Other retailers list the diameter as 3/8 inch which is to small for most watering sprinklers to work properly, which I discovered by trial. Average size hoses run from 5/8, 3/4 to 1 inch in diameter. The second thing is that the coiling wears out very quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"Where to start, the diameter of the hose is too thin first of all, many cheap plastic components were used at points of pressure which do not hold up to the mild abuse of outdoor gardening, gaskets do not seat/seal properly (this is why everyone complains about leaks, I'm one of those complainers), and the worst offense, the darn hose kinks/tangles ALL THE TIME which is partially due to the coil losing it's shape quickly after some moderate usage.

I have other curvy hoses and they have big facets to them that make it easy to tighten and loosen; not so here. Also, the pressure seemed lower with this hose, I'm not sure why (maybe gasket leaked so much, or the diameter of the hose is larger than other coiled hoses)?

This CD really shows you how much influence producer Howie Epstein has had on John Prine's recent success (because Epstein isn't involved with this project). Things look bleak the minute you discover that John Prine only wrote one song (the title track) on the entire CD. To his credit, that one song shines light years above the rest of the tired, mediocre, bare-footed yahoo country songs that fill out the rest of this CD.

Here Brother Prine holds forth in duets covering mostly modern country music classics (or ones that he just likes) with a who's who of women vocalists. So what is not to like about this CD. Nothing, especially if your tastes run to the country music genre. Although mine do not as a rule I note that my \\"Arky Angel\\" Iris DeMent is one of the women vocalists here on several songs (\\"The Jet Set\\", \`Let's Invite Them Over\\", \\"We Could\\", and the title song \\"In Spite Of Ourselves\\"). I have mentioned elsewhere that I would walk many a mile... No, I would drag myself through many a desert to hear that voice. As for the rest I notice that Lucinda Williams does a very nice duet on \\"Wedding Bells\\" and Emmy Lou Harris (as always) on \\"I Know One\\". As for the rest I am not familiar with their work.

He has been played at Sunday dinners often enough that he is nearly a member of the family. Unfortunately, his latest effort will be in the light rotation mode. The guest artists appear to be pasted into the arrangements and none of the Prine wry humor comes through. If you are a loyal fan then you should spring for the disc but if you are new to John then stick with \\"Sweet Revenge\\" or the terrific \\"Missing Years\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Honorable Disappointment","review":"When my sweetheart sings \\"Angel from Montgomery\\" at his club gigs, he often remarks how amazing it is that a 21-year-old kid from Chicago could have gotten so completely into the head of a southern housewife. It is amazing, and worthy of admiration, that Prine's work has always dealt with women as real people. That's the good thing about this album, too. He's chosen women of substance to sing with. Unfortunately, the material he's chosen is not what we hoped for from a guy with his incredible gift for words. If you like western swing, this album will delight you. If you like John Prine, only the title song, his own composition, will satisfy. We were left disappointed and hungry for a new \\"real\\" Prine album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops!","review":"Oh John, what a mistake! An old and very dedicated John Prine fan, it grieves me to say that this is a major bummer. Nope. This one pancakes, flat as can be. Please, John will stick to his own music in the future. Song writers, at least ones as talented as John Prine, should write songs! This was a big mistake!"},{"rating":"1","title":"In Spite of Ourselves","review":"Great musicians. Disgusting, unintended, parody of all that is stupid in country western themes. Not a redeemable song on the disc. Does not even deserve one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRENDOUS","review":"I've been playing and listening to country for more than twenty years and this collection of outtakes is/was the worst ever. I say was, because I threw the CD in the garbage. The list of duets on this recording looked great but in no way lived up to my expectations!"},{"rating":"1","title":"In Spite of Ourselves","review":"This one isn't as good as I expect from John Prine. Maybe he was trying to tell us something, but I missed it. The gals he picked to sing with him are not great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"John Prine, In Spite of Ourselves","review":"John Prine, a kind of cross between Bob Dylan and Ernest Tubb, sings the songs older country music fans have been missing. Without the glitter, heavy electronics, or stage acrobatics, one can hear some great old country. Makes you want to shout \\"More!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A new sound--same great Prine.","review":"This CD is a must for fans of Prine who also share a love for country music. In Spite of Ourselves is VINTAGE PRINE! His way of turning an ordinary phrase into a memorable variation is spectacular. \\"Cut off your nose to spite your face\\" becomes \\"we're going to spite our noses right off of our faces.\\" John, you're our big door prize!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eclectic, innovative and pure!","review":"Prine utilizes his dry wit and relaxed style to deliver some of the great country laments of our time. From the classic \\"It's a Cheatin Situation\\" to his own irreverant title track, Prine once again proves he is still the master of delivering of a well written song. Also, kudos to his selection of duet partners and high honors to Iris DeMent for being as laid back and effective as Prine. Worth your $!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"it woks","review":"I rescue retired racing greyhounds.

For instance, in 1Cor13 the Greek \\"agape\\" is rendered as \\"charity\\" rather than \\"love,\\" as it is in 20th century translations. In my opinion, telling evidence for the esteem in which Jerome's Vulgate was held when an authority was required for context (the Latin is \\"caritas\\") when the Bible was originally translated into English.This one is a must to lend context to difficult passages when a checkpoint is needed.

This is an extremely well written book that is virtually impossible to put down. It provides the novice as well as the professional celebrity grave hunter with juicy little tidbits regarding their favorite dead celebs. It also provides accurate information regarding grave locations and precise directions as to how to find each one. Oddly enough, no other book on this subject has managed to do that.The author also includes background information about each burial ground. I found that not only interesting, but in one specific case actually humorous.I didn't want the book to end. I definitely will buy subsequent books by this author. In fact, I ended up buying three copies of this book as xmas gifts and the recipients enjoyed this book as much as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad customer service and product","review":"The description of the item was false and it was a hassel to get part of my refund back."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst kind of melodrama.","review":"I started reading this book confidently expecting a well crafted book in the mould of Gallico's other works and at the end of it I was shocked.Not only was the story melodramatic and apparently not reaaly going anywhere but it seemed only an excuse to insert something of the seamy side of life .There seemed to be no point to this story and when I discovered a particularly distasteful sexual situation implied at the end I threw this book out .One of the finest pieces of real trash that I have ever read ,this only served to disgust me.Gallico's unfailingly beautiful language is the saving grace but its only a wrapping for a sordid tale that never rises to the emotional heights he achieved in earlier books.I am surprised that anyone would even publish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book.","review":"I read this book year ago on the recommendation of a friend,and just bought a used copy at a booksale. Although slightly dated(Bear in mind that the copywrite is the early 50's),it is a well crafted story of faith. Its the type of book that you would like to see a sequel to(I know how much time it covers!) One word of advise.... If you have never seen the movie,don't! Just read the book. I understand that it periodically comes back into print. If you can latch on to a copy as I did,go for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring Bolan? Say It Ain't So.","review":"I thought that the Mack Bolan series was supposed to be wall to wall gunfire and explosion. Imagine my disappointment when I found one that someone tried to sneak a plot into. All joking aside, this SuperBolan features a KGB/drug dealing/American turncoat/Pakastani plot that does nothing but confuse. One can hardly tell one KGB agent or American agent from another which makes keeping track of the villain or identifying the traitor almost impossible."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Project Album To Buy","review":"Since this has almost all of the Project's best songs on it it's the one you wanna get.

Never have I ever been so annoyed in watching a DVD where you are sent back to the main menu after every song... very frustrating and takes away from the performance.Since I wanted to add the Commadores to my DVD music collection, this was the only one I could find.

The suction power is very good and the Kone did a great job of sucking up the pet hair and dust that accumulated on my hardwood stairs (and it worked great getting around the balustrades). Actually, it did such a good job that I started going around the baseboards in a couple of rooms and was surprised how much my vacuum had left behind...and I'm a clean freak!As other people have mentioned, this does blow air down towards the floor so you spend a little time retracing where you've already vacuumed, but it's not bad enough to rate this product below four stars or not to buy it. This is one of the only appliances that I would leave out in my home due to it's good design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Form doesn't even begin to follow function","review":"The whole family hates this gimmicky thing.After the 'cool' factor of taking the Kone out of the box and plugging in the spaceship, it's downhill. It's NOISY. The nozzle is so small that you practically have to hover the vac over each piece of dirt. It is also hard plastic which scratches the floors. The filter fills in no time requiring very frequent dumping. Still want to buy it? It's hit or miss returning the vac to the base since both are circular. You must swivel it until it seats into the recharger. Next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great, performs poorly","review":"I bought the Kone Cordless Hand Vac because of its look -- it's sleek and stylish, and I could leave it out in the open. Dirt Devil has a good reputation, so I figured it would perform just as well as any other hand vac. I'm very disappointed with this product. The main problem I have with this product is the placement of the exhaust. It's placed above the nozzle, so it scatters all of the dirt and hair I'm trying to vacuum up! I feel like I spend more time chasing the crumbs, dirt, and hair than sucking it up. Plus, it's pretty loud for a hand vac, which was surprising."},{"rating":"2","title":"Replacement","review":"The first one lasted about 18 months (with daily use). It died, so we bought another one. -1 star for only lasting 18 months, otherwise it's a great product.

It is sometimes difficult to get the vacuum seated in the charging base correctly because it has a weird fit to it. The charging base is extremly light weight so sometimes when you're trying to remove the vacuum from it, the base comes with, due to the weird fit. This vacuum might be okay for picking up minor debris on a hard surface but in no way would I recommend it for carpet, its just not going to get the job done. The nozzle is pretty small as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome product","review":"We were very impressed with this little vacuum. Not only is it stylish and compact but it works amazing. The charge does not run out like most hand held vacuums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great dinner music for fuddy duddy's :)","review":"Actually this is a very nice total collection.

I thought it was boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily my least favorite of the series","review":"Instead of using sound science, explaining it, and sometimes extending it like in the other fourteen books, this one stoops to one of the oldest premises of B-movie sci-fi - and it isn't even scientifically sound.Just because it's easy to shrink people on screen doesn't make it possible. Particularly the way it happens here - accidentally falling in the machine, getting dismantled, and waking up in a compressed duplicate (with the originals still in the machine) and then being able to reverse the process and coming out exactly the same size they were before! How did they even survive dismantling? Even if the process worked how were they able to walk?The whole premise just shakes me up, even twenty years after first reading it. (Might be all those movies and Hanna-Barbera cartoons.) The only reason why I give this two stars is the familiar, endearing characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total waste of money","review":"The game is very slow and some of the important features don't work.

The balls were in good shape and when lost in the woods or creek, didn't make him feel nearly as bad as having paid full price for new ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Game contains StarForce","review":"I was excited to play this game. I'd read great reviews of it and couldn't wait. I finally got it, installed it and it wouldn't run. After playing around with it and looking online I found that it uses the dreaded Starforce protection software. For those of you who don't know, this is a driver that is installed on your system without your consent that opens security holes and degrades performance of your CD Rom and DVD Rom drives. Don't believe me? Look it up and see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to hear this game contains starforce","review":"I had read great review of this and I purchased it from BestBuy, but I figured I better do a quick search to see what copy protection the game housed. I was very sad to learn that this game contains Starforce, so this means I will be making a trip back to BestBuy to return it. So sad publishers decide to use this copy protection.mark"},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Force protected despite Bruce's comment","review":"I purchased the game based on Bruce's assertion that Starforce had been removed.

Try it, you'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to bad . . . .","review":"Every now and then I like to pick up a fantasy book and this time around I read this one. It wasn't horrible by any means but it wasn't the greatest either. It kept me entertained for the most part and that's what counts. As with other books with short stories written by different authors some of the stories are better than others, but all in all it wasn't to bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"better than a soporific....","review":"After trying two stories in this book (Nora Roberts and Jill Gregory's) and falling asleep through both several times every time I tried to read this I just gave up. The writing wasn't bad per se, just SO boring as to be pointless. Nothing new, exciting or original in any way. Hackneyed and formulaic. I disagree with the other reviewers-I HAVE seen Nora Roberts write better than this. Unless you are having trouble sleeping -then I'd suggest skipping this mundane book.1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Struggle to finish....","review":"I have read almost everything Nora Roberts has read, and am a big fan. I have read and enjoyed all of her other anthologies in this series. This one, though, was a struggle to finish. The Nora Roberts story was good, because as someone wrote, I don't think she can write anything bad. The other stories were awful. The characters, the storylines, the dialogue--boring, unrealistic--ugh! I can usually read a good romance in a day or two at most--this one took me about two weeks to finish because I was so disinterested in the stories, I would put it down (in the middle of a story!) to read something else. I finished each one hoping the next would be better, but no such luck. If you are a Nora Roberts fan (and like me have to read everything she publishes), maybe you can get this book at the library, but otherwise, don't bother!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much of anything","review":"To call this book a travel book is really stretching the definition. I would more describe it as a collection of rambling unstructured snippets of other authors' accounts of travelling in Germany. It rarely puts these into historical context, or relates them to what you might find in modern Germany.The author inserts a few annecdotes of his own travels to the Harz Mountains, Weimar and Berlin and a small account of his life in Hamburg.There is little original material and insight into living in Germany, travelling in Germany and modern German attitudes to themselves, their history and their place in the world.The prose is often convoluted and frequently pretentious, and the name-dropping of other authors becomes irksome after a chapter or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"The second generation ogf surviv","review":"I read this book many years ago. I was greatly moved by it, and through it understood the special burden children of survivors have to live with. Helen Epstein was the first to really explore the feelings and situation of the children of survivors. The secretness she writes about it, the things which were in the air but never spoken about play a large part in this.I do remember having one point in which I felt the author did not do enough. While she deals with the individual psychological of problems effectively she does not really consider the ' collective side' of the disaster.The imperative to keep the Jewish people alive after such a great disaster is not a subject she dwells on intensely."},{"rating":"1","title":"To bad you can't rate 0 stars!!!","review":"WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ!

Any fan would love this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puh-leeze!","review":"First of all, this run of the mill attempt on cashing in on the most marketable band in history doesn't even bother to get it's facts straight. For example, it says that Emma was born in 1978, which would mean she joined the band at age 17! Add that to the fact that it was written purely for brittans, and how it ended up in the states is a mystery. To add incompletion to the list of complaints, this book was published way back in 1996, before they even were released in the us! The only saving grace is that this magazine sized book has a lot of good full color photos, but once again, they're so old that any spiceaholic like me has seen them over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgia","review":"This book was published in 1947, and tells the story of a panda family in Tibet who come in contact with a little Brown Bear named Willy.

Kumon has many learning centers for kids in USA, and my son attended one of them. But I canot recomend the present method since they just rip off money from parents.Many assitants at such centers are not qualified for teaching at all. Students cannot ask any complicated questions for most of cases.I can find the similar pattern of the way of making money in this book.I know, this book might help some of people who have a really decaying brain. I think this is a book for at least 70 or 80 years old who start to show a sign of decrepit behaviors. Many people can make such contents by using PC by themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just wanted to learn how to do the triangle math puzzle","review":"I returned the book.

He has MANY books, but wants me to read this one every night. It's so nice I din't mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite","review":"This book is a favorite of mine and my children. The illustrations are beautiful and the book just gives you a warm, cozy feeling. We read it year-round, not just for Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"very cute Christmas story","review":"This is a very cute Christmas story. In a nutshell, Bear typically hibernates through Christmas and this year has his friends wake him up so he can celebrate with them. It's a good book for preschoolers with only a sentence or two per page, a lot of rhymes, and pictures with great details. If you're wondering, I wouldn't call it secular or religious. It mentions the carol \\"O Holy Night\\" (by name only) and has a brief visit from Santa. The focus is on the friendships. I have a two-year-old and a five-year-old, they both enjoy this book, but the little one has asked for it more times.There is one line in the verse that is grammatically incorrect to force a rhyme. This is minor of course (the kids won't even notice), but since preschool books tend to be read over and over, it might grate on some moms or dads."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this book","review":"this is a funny, sweet book about our good friend Bear.

The rhyming gives kids an opportunity to participate and so much fun! Yeah!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite series, not favorite book","review":"I LOVE this cute series and so do my two little boys. Two things that make me give this specific book 4 stars instead of 5 are that it was a much smaller book than I was expecting (maybe 8 in. across - the one you check out from the library is more like 12 or 13) and that the story and rhyme are sweet and fun but a little less 'meaningful' than the other books in the series. There's less of a message applicable to children. The friends end up falling asleep after trying to keep Bear up all night and then it ends. Still a fun book though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice New Size for a Nice Holiday Book","review":"This isn't a new book. It came out \\"full size\\" in 2004. And, I'd say, it's not the best of the series by these two talented women...that would be the first \\"Bear Snores On.\\" However, this new smaller size and \\"library binding\\" (which in library/bookstore lingo means it doesn't have an extra cover & the cover is printed on the hardback of the book) is really a big plus for lap-sit reading.If you are buying it to share with groups stick with the original size. But as a gift for your favorite little storytimer, this is a perfect holiday treat.Bear's friends (smaller animals who he met in previous picture book outings) try to keep him up for the big winter holiday...and though they nap (as bear wraps and Santa sneaks up to fill stockings) Bear is successful...but gets his nap in the end under a cozy blanket. Sweet & definitely worth this new cheaper price too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Book for little ones","review":"This is the perfect book to teach little ones the real meaning of Christmas. There is way too much hype about presents and in this little book Bear and all of his friends have a great Christmas together. Bear's friends get him to stay up for Christmas instead of hibernating. In the end Bears friends all fall asleep on Christmas Eve and Bear stays up making gifts and cooking for his friends. This is a great story to remind everyone that Christmas is a time for family and friends.My grandkids loved this book so much I will be looking forward to more books by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite Christmas stories","review":"I originally bought this book because I was looking for some unique Christmas books, I couldn't read The Night Before Christmas one more time!

The design of the bookÑby Scott Taylor with Katherine GoÑperfectly captures the impassioned experimentation that occurred in cities all over central Europe before it was snuffed out by political reactionaries who hated free-thinking artists. A few familiar namesÑBrancusi, Moholy-Nagy, and El LissitskyÑflit through these pages, but most are as little-known as their movements. All were, to some degree, revolutionaries and even participated in street battles in Berlin and Budapest in the chaotic aftermath of the first World War. The world changed around them, and its fascinating to discover, so long after that vanished era, how well they expressed the progressive spirit of the age.

This product works great on my Ruger Mark III 22 caliber pistol. I have found that by running the BoreSnake through the barrel 2 or 3 times removes most of the grime from my handgun. It does not replace completely tearing down the gun for a good, old fashioned cleaning...but it does do what it is intended for...removing residue from the barrel. I will be purchasing more BoreSnakes for different calibers that I currently own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoppes Pistol Sized Version","review":"Just received mine about 30 minutes ago and gave my Ruger MK III a quick barrel cleaning since it had about 90 rounds fired since disassembly. These pistols are a bit more work to disassemble than most so in between tear downs I just use a BoreSnake. I had been using my rifle sized 22 cal snake and I need the longer length for my CZ Super Lux with 28\\" barrel. Contrary to what another reviewer reported, the pistol version has a shorter lead string and the portion after the bristles is also a bit shorter. I just held them side by side. Makes it easier to use on a pistol when there isn't so much extra material. A great buy and I highly recommend this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, especially if you have trouble taking apart guns","review":"This is a great product.

Then upon connection to several computers, Macs and one PS3 all consoles failed to detect it while making an annoying beeping noise.

It comes with software that adds various functionalities, which I don't really use, so I can't comment on how useful that is (however, I will say that as someone who doesn't use it, the software doesn't make itself intrusive or get in the way, which is very nice. Combined with the fact that it takes up a very small fraction of the disk's space, I can just leave it there in case I ever decide I do want to make use of the extra functionality).I only have two minor complaints: one, that the USB cord is rather short, and two, that the plastic film covering the lights on either end seems a bit shoddy (slightly creased). Neither of these is a big issue for me though, so overall this product is quite excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constant Problems","review":"Totally Worthless.The Seagate FreeAgent GO 120 GB drive, that I bought, has been replaced twice, and the third one is unreliable too.It also uses two usb ports.

As an impressionable young teenager I read and reread this book, and I'm quite certain that it did something (good) to my brain. The protagonist is a high school student with the ability to film through his eyes. Unfortunately, he is unable to get the film out of his head to show anyone. I noted with interest that Egan has re-used the notion of being able to film through the eys in \\"Distress\\".The book is not exactly a conventional narrative, rather it is a series of episodes that allow Egan to make witty, thought provoking and at times poignant observations about (the Australian) school system, and life in general.In short -- I recommend this book for anyone, but _especially_ for younger readers (say 12 - 16). I am now 26, and have never forgotten the brain-twisting joy this book brought me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A funny debut about Australian school-life","review":"Greg Egan wrote this book in the summer holiday at the end of school.

Here, the prose seems forced, the plot stilted and boring, and the characters lifeless--none of the magic captured in 'Sheep' crosses over into this semi-sequel. The lack of the Marikumi touch here makes some of the book's weaknesses ever more glaring, particularly the author's tendency to rush an ending after doggy paddling in characterization for 300+ pages...not his masterpiece, for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his masterpiece","review":"If you have read Murakami before, you will find that Dance Dance Dance is not his masterpiece.

With each new novel, he spins ever-increasingly complex tales that read like paintings in a gallery: The juxtaposition of light and dark, funny and sad, quiet and clamorous. Truly a work of art and an outstanding book. Murakami's characters haunt and mirror us, and perhaps this is what makes his work so irresistible! Standing ovation for this book. Keep writing, Mr. Murakami, and whatever you do, don't stop dancing"},{"rating":"2","title":"A hair less enjoyable than Wild Sheep Chase","review":"Not quite as immersive as before, but worthy nonetheless. Murakami's literary love lives are as strange as they come. In a vain search to find a glimpse of a woman he'd known before, Murakami plows the depths of the protagonist's pysche. The clarity and disclarity of his writing never ceases to amaze."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Piece","review":"Having read A Wild Sheep Chase just before this, I can attest to the complexity of Murakami's writing and character creating skills.

I like a bit of dream/supernatural in my books, just a little bit of it, and even though i didn't in the end understand what the hell happened, i still liked this book so much i immediately went out & bought another, Kafka on the Shore. There's a sense of greater things in these books, and a high degree of readability that keeps dopey people like me reading them even when we don't \\"get it\\". So i found its not a bad thing to \\"not get it\\" & learning that alone is worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another surreal twist in time","review":"This is a good book. Murakami's writing involves detailed characters who do not always know where they are going nor who they are. The characters and environment are detailed and exquisite, making one want to visit the places written about.This book includes a sideline into a metaphysical world for the narrator, which helps to drive him and guide him. By the end of the book, typical understanding of all the events and characters may not be achieved but a sense of peace is created.When you read this book, do not expect typical Western narrative structures, details or a sense of closure. As with other Murakami books consider the leaves, on the trees in the forest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Your Normal Senior Prom","review":"We interrupt this review for a Public Service Announcement.

We now return you to your regularly scheduled review.I got so wrapped up in the book I almost thought I was a part of it. There was that gnawing at the edge of my mind - a glimmer of understanding. Then an insight: I am in the book! Murakami has a way of writing the reader into the story; making the reader an unmentioned character.This is too real for magical realism; it's post-modern with a reliable narrator; it has a tinge of science fiction and fantasy but is really neither. It's simply Murakami."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stuck with me longer than anything else by Murakami","review":"Not his best, mind you, but I find it to be Murakami's moodiest, most \\"atmospherically\\" delineated, most theme-driven work.Worth a read.Also, if you're going to read Dance Dance Dance, you should be aware it is a sequel to A Wild Sheep Chase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book , so so translation","review":"After I read Dance, Dance, Dance from cover to cover and over and over in Japanese. I find that it is exciting the translation version is available. First of all, I must gave the credit to the translator, who did its best to translate the \\"thinking\\" of the writer, not just word-to-word conversion.

I thought this was a beautifully written love story set in an interesting fantasy world. Her writing style shows a wonderful restraint and simplicity, and what is left unsaid is just as important as the words on the page. I found this refreshing compared to fantasy writers that feel compelled to describe too many irrelevant details or preach a philosophy and lecture the reader ad nauseum. I thought there was definitely enough information given to understand how Ephemera worked (I thought Sebastian, which I subsequently read, was actually more confusing). This is a book where I found myself re-reading sections and getting even more out of it. Read and enjoy a story of love, courage, hope and acceptance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Belladonna","review":"The conclussion to the Ephemera series.

The cover art is beautiful as well as the story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging world & characters","review":"If you love good fantasy this series is a must read. Anne Bishop's style is engaging and colorful. The characters are well developed and sympathetic. The struggle of powers between the benevolent and manipulative is relatable and I often found myself in favor of the under-dog regardless of the odds. The ability to transform landscapes makes this world unique and with the interlacing of other fantasy characters, once I picked it up, I couldn't hardly put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I'm a fan of Anne Bishop, especially her Black Jewels 'verse. Sebastian - the first book in this set - was lukewarm, but I've noticed that about the first book in a Bishop series. The book tends to be lots of explication, without much in the way of action, with main characters having only cameos or minor characters trying to carry the plot.I was looking forward to Belladonna....and to be honest, I'm still waiting. The plot was as thin as mist, the characters were static and didn't react well with one another, almost like they were in the same book only by happenstance.The ending came out of nowhere. The story trudged along for a while, then WHAM and the reader is left asking 'did you get the number of that bus that just hit me?'I love the Black Jewels 'verse, and the second and third books in the Tir Alain series, but Belladonna and Sebastian should definetly have been sent back for re-writes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster at best","review":"While the first book (Sebastian) held some promise for this story, Belladonna was lacking. The mighty Eater of the World was pretty impotent. The world itself consisted of a couple islands and a few small towns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of errors","review":"I know this has already been said, but this book is TERRIBLY riddled with errors, at least one per page. Many are easy to spot if you are a relatively conversant spanish-speaker just looking for a refresher, but it would be horrible for someone new to the language who doesn't know to be wary.The grammar explanations are okay, I wouldn't go farther than that though. Also, the vocabulary section in the back (which, admittedly, isn't the focus of the book) uses a lot of regional terms without saying which region uses those terms, rendering it all but useless.Honestly, I'd be a bit embarrassed if I were the publisher, editor or author for putting out a book that looks like it has never been edited. Overall, it is just NOT a good resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"thought provoking messages for parents of all ages","review":"This little book is a source of invaluable insight.

If you view all text/type as the same and don't know the difference between serif and san serif, have no idea what a cap height, ascender or decender is, but you have to use type to design...this is the book for you.

In defence of these tools I do like the U gouge and i havn't yet had problems with the strait edged ones. BUT...The v gouge is terrible! It comes with a terrible angle for cutting ( your hand has to be pretty much verticle) and while reshaping and sharpening it just started to crumble away! Now I know this was not something I did because I had my teacher ( college professor/Practicing print maker) sharpen them for me! She said the temper on the steel must be bad. I have also noticed what seems to be cracks or deep scratches along the sides of the steel on my u gouge and v gouge. I think this may be part of the reason my v gouge crumbled away to uselessnes. The u gouge is still hanging in there but i don't know how long that will last. So now you have been warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The metal on one of the gouges broke in half on a basswood carving. This should never happen with this type of soft wood.

An assortment of synthesizer sounds are uninspiringly mixed along with the occasional Gregorian monk or native chants, or other natural instruments sounds, that seems all too familiar. I do not understand why this album is entitled \\"Erotic Moods 2\\", because it hardly conjures any sense of eroticism or sensuality in their music. I'd rather pick up a Sade or Vanessa Daou album for that purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Trilogy","review":"Finally, just before it is ending, Denning decides to actually use all of the characters and shows us the point of view of a phaerimm, the points of view of Vala and other characters (still not Aris, though!) etc. This book is by far the best of the three, and it was nice to see Galaeron finally stop whining about his shadow and what he did ot Evereska and all of Faerun.The book's characterization was better than the rest of them too. The characters were more believable and had more individuality. The novel, in general, seemed better edited, less hasty, and more sure. The ending was not all that I'd hoped for, but I am interested in seeing what will finally become of Malik, after he gueststars in two different series.Better than the other two, but is it worth reading all three? I would say no, unless you have a couple of days and twenty dollars to kill. A good book, though.Harkius"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good finale","review":"I really liked this series, and though I do think some of the characters were a bit too unbeatable, overall I enjoyed them all, and the somewhat unusual ending to the book.

Granted this \\"High Tide\\" didn't get too many glowing reviews (and I haven't checked the reviews of the other two books I read), but I think from now on I will pass on her books. There are too many great authors writing now whose work demand respect and their stories deliver, if not every time, almost every time.

I loved that they did not like each other at all - in fact hated each other. They definetely took time - and the circumstances that they were under contributed - to fall in love. The mystery was a good one because you couldn't tell exactly what was going to happen. I would have preferred the story within the story to have been better explained. That is the only thing that keeps this from being a ***** (5 stars)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is great","review":"This book was an extremely good book from Jude Deveraux. It's only and main fault was the fact that with all these nails and maps we got confused. It also had this little problem with the plot it was as unrealistic as they come. What I liked about the book was the fact that at long last we had a heroine who was not short I was getting bored with them she was realisticly tall like a lot of normal people are.And at long last people with normal tempraments you always have these perfect little heroines who are always right and can never do wrong.Fiona was slightly rude and Ace was too but under the circumstances(They were being accused of murder and for some reason the person who was mudered left all his money to them and they couldn't figure out why since they had never met him or each other before.) I think allowances can be made."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Tide","review":"I usually love Jude Deveraux's books, but this one was NOT one of her best. Although the love story between Fiona and Ace was good, the whole plot was a little sketchy. It didn't reveal enough of the story to draw me in. This was no \\"Knight In Shining Armor\\", that's for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm very disappointed.","review":"There are only a few writers whose new books I wait for with eagerness and Jude Deveraux is one of those writers. I have always enjoyed the way her books flow, the romance involved, and the wonderful plots (A Knight In Shining Armor and Sweet Liar spring immediately to mind). I couldn't find any of those attributes in this book, however. I've never been so confused about the characters in a book, and in this one I did a lot of wondering which character was which and who did what to whom. The story line jumped from place to place so fast that my head was spinning. I thought perhaps I had read it too fast the first time and slogged my way through a second reading, but came away with the same sense of disappointment as I did after the first reading. This is not a book I'm going to keep or read again. I'll be selling it at my next garage sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor example of Jude's work","review":"This book was a big disappointment to me as well. I am a big fan of Jude's, and dont mind paying full price for her books if I have to...but this was not worth the money in paperback and certainly not in hardback(if it came that way.)...Confusing and convoluted mystery, minor romance, minor humor(where she usually shines)unresolved dilemmas, no continuity. I would almost say this was written by somebody else!! I certainly hope the next one will be back to her old form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"Somehow this book did not catch my fancy. I can ignore some large plot holes, but this story had huge canyons in it. I loved the various stories of the Montgomerys and the Taggerts, but this one is not up to her usual interesting style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about B-O-R-I-N-G","review":"I didn't like the hero, or the heroine, or the story. I had to struggle to finish this book. There was nothing even remotely special about it. There was absolutely no chemistry. Such a waste of time (and paper)."},{"rating":"1","title":"All wrong","review":"These two could not be any more wrong for each other. Fiona's materialism got on my nerves from the beginning. And here comes Ace, this reclusive man who couldn't have anything less in common with this woman. Not once did I get a sense of chemistry between them. Jude does better historical novels than contemporary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too impressed !","review":"I'm still waiting to find a really GOOD Jude Deveroux book!! I finished reading this book a few weeks ago and the longer I reflect on this book, the less I liked it! I bought the book mainly because I'd seen it in all the bookstores and newstands. A book by a popular contemporary author - I thought I'd give it a try! I bought it while on vacation. What a disappointment! I found myself somewhat entertained by the two main characters, Ace and Fiona but even that relationship was soooo predictable! At times I found the book confusing and downright dumb!! Why all the mystery during the first part of the book about WHO Kimberly was?? There were too many characters who were confusing at times and who really didn't enhance the story much. This was my second read by Jude Deveroux and I'm not that impressed. Maybe I should read some of her earlier books??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't high on this one!","review":"I am an absolutely loyal JD reader, however the last few books has started to make my loyalty waver. This one was no exception. It definitely had the feeling that she was just making up the story as she went along and there was hardly any pre-planning involved. To be honest, I found at the end of the book I still wasn't really sure what the big cloak and dagger intrigue was actually all about. Unless you're in need of a JD fix (and if you've read A Knight in Shining Armour and Sweet Liar, I can't say that I blame you) give this one a miss. This one had a decidely amateurish feel to it. Will the real Jude Deveraux come out, come out wherever you are?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Jude's usual standards!","review":"I have read nearly every book written by Jude Deveraux...some, like A Knight in Shining Armor and Highland Velvet, are among my very favorite books of all time. Although I have not loved everything she has written, I have always enjoyed reading a new release from Jude. Until High Tide. The story, at its most basic level, had potential but the execution of said story was abysmal. Ridiculous plot twists, trite and uninspired dialog and an insultingly mindless storyline...in short, don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone's Too Harsh","review":"I think everyone has judged this book too harshly especially considering that it is pretty consistent with a lot of Ms. Deveraux's works. If you've read her other novels, you should know that this is a lot better than \\"The Taming\\" and \\"The Conquest.\\" Since when did any romance novel had to be realistic? If this story is farfetched, what about \\"Remembrance?\\" Ms. Deveraux has put forth a wonderfully warm and funny addition to the Montgomery and Taggert family. Keep them coming!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is happening to Jude Deveraux books?","review":"I've read this book and i must say that i prefered it to An angel for emily and the blessing! However, i don't like her contemporary romances, she should stick to historical romances and expand on her montgomery tree among others. She ahd the right idea using montgomery in the book but the plot i thought was not very well done just like the preveious contemporary romances she's done"},{"rating":"1","title":"2.5 stars - in terest ing","review":"this book was interesting, only because it was crafted by jude deveraux's magnificent wit. fiona seemed a little full of herself. ace was your typical romantic hero. if you want a good jude deveraux read, pick up \\"THE DUCHESS\\" and you will NOT be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I laughed my way through it.","review":"It's hard to find a romantic novel with characters who can actually make a reader laugh. Well, this book was one of the few and reminded me why I liked to read romance novels and reminds me why I stopped... there just aren't enough books out there like this one. The story line might not be all it could be, but I fell in love with the characters and they're sense of humor. Now, I can only hope the next book I read is as good...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fans of Jude Deveraux - Don't Read!","review":"I have every one of Jude Deveraux's books that are out on bookstands so far... Except this one. Probably like many other Jude Deveraux fans, I want anxiously for a new book to come out and I was excited to read this one when it came to the local library. I wondered why a new Deveraux book was still on library shelves, but I didn't think much of it. I knew why when I read it... This book was horrible! I felt no connection betweent the main characters (Fiona & Ace), infact I felt disgust by them... Reading the other reviews made me realize I'm not the only one who thinks this book was not written by Jude. I'm going to add it to my collection--just to have it though--I doubt I'll ever waste the three hours again to read it. This book was trash, it should have been thrown away when being edited."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than Blessing!","review":"OK, OK--so this wasn't one of Jude's best books, but I have to admit that I liked it much better than the Blessing! I personally like hearing about those too perfect, too rich, too handsome, too lovely and too loving Montgomerys and Taggerts! I was glad to see the family return. I felt that I learned a bit about both Fiona and Ace, and could see how their relationship grew. I like my ends tightly knit though, and wondered if Ace's family had felt rejected by him or if he felt estranged from them because of his unusual choice of lifestyle. (I am talking about his parents here, not his cousins.) Of course, the outcome was obvious, but I want my romances to end happily. All in all though, I think that Historical romance is the genre in which Jude excells, and I wish she would return to that. (I am glad to see her leave that goofy time travel/reincarnation stuff behind!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a poor job, from such a great writter!","review":"After hours & hours of reading pleasure, I found my self wondering if I was really reading a Jude Deveraux book. Romance/mystery/suspends is not her cup of tea, she needs to go back to what she knows. Deveraux has a Montgomery interacting with Taggerts, without another Montgomery in sight. Be for real, this family just does not roll that way. There are too many holes in this story, and no answers. Who the heck was Rose? Why would the main characters trust Susie right out of the blue? Why would four childhood friends sit in New York and wait while their friend was being hunted down for murder, and not one of them try to reach her? I have read everything Ms. Deveraux has written, but I will not buy another of her books just because she wrote it. She has been going down hill since An Angel for Emily & The Blessing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Jude?","review":"I have enjoyed all her previous works- but this one was very uncharacteristic of Ms. Deveraux. The story was cheesy and unbelievable (even for a romance novel) and I didn't care about the characters. I hope her next book keeps in the former tradition that rocketed her to fame because this one was a loser!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HIGH TIDE","review":"I LOVE JUDE DEVERAUX AND THE MONTGOMERY/TAGGERT SERIES BUT FELT THAT THIS BOOK WAS NOT UP TO JUDE DEVERAUX'S NORMAL INTENSE STORYTELLING. THE CHARATERS WERE GOOD BUT THE STORY CAME TO AN ABRUPT END JUST AS WE WERE GETTING INTO THE STORY. IT NEEDED A FEW MORE CHAPTERS TO WRAP IT UP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointing!","review":"I've read most all of JD's books beginning with the Velvet series and I must say this one was a total disappointment. The plot was stupid and senseless and the there were so many unended sentences that I was totally frustrated. I find it hard to believe this was even written by Jude Deveraux--more like a 10th grade ghost writer. If her next one is this bad, I think it will be my last one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is the ghostwriter?","review":"I have read all of Jude Devereaux' books and I can't believe she wrote this one by herself. Careful readers will see exactly the spot where she took over a good mystery story and stuck in a little bit of poorly thought out romance so she could put her name on it. It seems almost as if she collaborated with Linda Howard. I am sorry to say I not only bought this book for me, but I also gave it as a Christmas present. Never again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN!","review":"I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR A NEW MONTGOMERY STORY FOR MONTHS!

No true to life adventure but pure escapism and romance to boot. I put the book down after a marathon read and thought, \\"darling\\".

Colorful characters, lots of action, this book is everything but a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and corny","review":"Well, my title sums it up.

The setting and story idea intrigued me enough to stay with it; however, I have never read a published book that was so poorly written! I was actually stunned at the lack of creativity and spent most of my time agonizing over the poorly structured sentences, paragraph by paragraph, page by page - all the way through! In fact, I threw the book in the trash immediately upon completing it, too embarrassed to pass it along to ANYONE! I have read several reviews that indicate this does not reflect the author's usual good work. I'm afraid she won't get a second chance with me. My advice would be to get off the beach early and don't get caught by High Tide!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Too Bad!","review":"I have been a Jude Deveraux fan for many years. The first novel I read of hers was \\"A Knight in Shining Armour\\" and I have been hooked every since. I agree with most of the other reviews that this is not her best, but I still found it entertaining and enjoyable.

Keep up the good work Ms. Deveraux and I anxiously await your next story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very exciting","review":"I enjoyed reading this book very much. I am not familiar with Devereaux, but I thought this was a real page turner. A real who dun it!

Unfortunately, in this offering, the author has lost her focus. Neither Ace the hero nor his female counterpart are worth reading about. They hate each other on sight and it isn't sexual tension..it's just plain hate!! The story rambles from Ace's obsession with a bird sanctuary, to having his female counterpart learn her father was some kind of underworld character. She thought he was a map maker..in this day and age of global positioning?? I read the book hoping it would get better and it got worse. I hope this author won't waste these good family names again on an unworthy story. Give this one a BIG MISS...even in paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Tide is a Total Washout!","review":"I had great difficulty believing that Jude Deveraux even wrote this book. I have been an avid fan of her wonderful stories for years and have never been so thoroughly let down before. High Tide totally lacks veracity, interest, romance and the usual great storytelling that I have come to expect from Jude."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Tide","review":"I am a huge Jude Deveraux fan, I have read all of her novels; most exceptional, some good, and a few not-so-good. Unfortunately, this falls into the not-so-good category.It was as if there were pages that were torn from the book. I would have rather read another 100 pages to get the full story than have to be satisfied with this version.I would definitely bypass this and read Sweet Liar for a second time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Being a long time Deveraux fan, I found this book to be very disappointing. I had to keep referring to the cover to make sure it was really a Deveraux book! The story was good but the writing was disjointed. It was just not up to Jude's usual standard, historical or modern day. If this is someone's first time reading a Deveraux book and you were less than satisfied, please try again. She has written many excellant romance novels that will be worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time and money","review":"I bought this book and as I make plans to enter counseling for my horrendous choice, I tell you who are considering this book, don't. The writing is flat--all flash and no substance. If I had turned the page to find that through some miracle all of the other pages were blank, I would have counted it as a blessing. I can't believe Deveraux wrote this. She's can be a much better writer than this and her fans deserve better. \\"Disappointed\\" doesn't begin to describe how I felt as I pitched my copy of _High Tide_ in the trash, \\"betrayed\\" or simply \\"cheated\\" seems more fitting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disapointed","review":"If I could I would give this book 0 stars, I would.

The Cupertino does not. After a month of light use it's showing noticeable wear on the mousing surface. The silver is wearing off already.It doesn't even look that good next to a Mac. It's too thick and the glossy plastic looks cheap, even though it tries to mimic Apple's style, which looks good.There are far better mousepads on the market. Several of them are made my Allsop. They just blew it here. Avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great design, but poor manufacturing and poor choice of material","review":"The design of this mousepad is very nice and stylish. The mouse area is large, and it is embedded in a plastic frame with curved edges that feel smooth on the wrist. When new, the material from which the actual, silver-colored mousing plate exerts only little friction on the mouse and yet provides good control of the mouse position. However, the material is too sensitive against scratching. This is particularly bad since the manufacturer is apparently not capable of making the surface sufficiently flat. The surface features faults -- like a curtain. While the mouse doesn't touch the valleys, it excessively wears the ridges, which then become dull and ugly-looking patches already after one day of use. I have returned my first mousepad because of this problem, but the second one has the same problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"GIFT","review":"Another happy St Louis fan.

The mostly inherent, but occasionally explicit guidance for parents is how they can help children become involved.

This new Pro Football Prospectus is a slick looking production, but I was surprised at the \\"same old, same old\\" inside its covers. There is nothing in this book I have seen I cannot find through either my own logic or in countless other magazines on the market. In truth, this book is really just another of those magazines.Coming from the FootballOutsiders, I did expect something marvelous, but unfortnately this is watered-down, typical writing with countless errors. How can a book like this be published with so many spelling errors?

Having read the previous three editions, I was very much looking forward to another volume. What I did not notice is the authors had changed. Sadly, with that change comes an almost amateurish approach to what they call analysis, but I call pseudo-science.I am not sure what the motivation was for letting a two-bit dot com take over what was a fine football annual, but I sure wish I had known. Yeah, the cover is a little slicker than the previous books...but the content, in a word, sucks. Revolutionary formula?

Aukerman takes one significant passage of the Bible after another and insightfully brings out meanings clearly in the Bible which speak precisely to the contemporary world (he does this rather like the close readings of Erich Auerbach in Mimesis). This may be the best book I have ever read on the issue of a Biblical view of war and peace. Timely, urgent, readable, timeless."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed","review":"I loved the illustrations, the popups, and the vintage feel. I didn't love that there were so few categories, so little space to include things that might have been fun and interesting, and so much space dedicated to things that I felt would have been very dry and impersonal to look back on.It was so beautiful and lovely to look at. I wanted to find ways to frame some of the pictures, but as a baby memory book, it was, well, boring. I wish I could have combined the inclusion of categories like 'what was going on in the world the year you were born', 'what things cost when you were born', 'what were baby's first games/words' and such like modern books have with the lovely aesthetic of this classic looking album. I didn't end up using mine, unfortunately."},{"rating":"1","title":"old-fashioned","review":"This baby book is a bit out of date.

One could fit possibly two pictures on a page, due to the illustrations and pop-ups. The Christmas/birthday pages do not give enough room to fit a standard sized photograph. The \\"firsts\\" page does not give ample room for more than a date and a phrase for description. Finally, a large portion of the book is relevant to only children who have a doctor for the birth, attend out-of-the-home school, and only have one page of \\"memories\\". I expect some of these conventional things to be in these books, but this takes up a large amount of the book, as the book is not very many pages long. The paper, as others have mentioned, is glossy and therefore writing is difficult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby Pop-Up Book","review":"This book is unique in that most pages have pop-ups right at the top of the page. This makes it hard to open the book and if your child goes through it when they are older, it is likely to get ruined. It is also quite a distraction on the pages and a lot of them tend to fold over and land on the page itself. Also the pages are shiny and have a coating that if you use certain kinds of pens it smears all over the page-like the new acid free pens. Also, there is trouble mounting photo's because of the coating. It seems that photo corners do not stick very well and there really is little room for photo's anyway.That being said, the pictures are beautiful, but I found that it really wasn't very functional in terms of getting down your baby's firsts, keeping memento's and photo's in.

If you really want some good books on the subject, stick with Brian Weiss, Newton or Elisabeth.K.Ross who are easy to read and make so much more senece. If it is a first for you, start with Shirley Maclaine or Raymond Moody. They are a pleasure to read and make a difference in your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIZZARE","review":"Dr. Steinpach talks about how even in sleep our material body is loosened from the soul because the body is producing a radiation that does not bind as well as the radiation that binds body and soul when we are awake. He speaks about an \\"astral body\\" that is something between the material body and the soul and that the three are held together by an umbilical cord he calls the \\"silver cord.\\" He misquotes the Bible and gives only two or three vague examples of people who have had near-death experiences. He also writes that the soul does not always leave the body immediately upon death and can still feel pain such as the fires of cremation or even the removal of body parts for organ transplant.

The reason it sounds so-called sloppy is becuase it isn't recorded but if you listen after a while it is music to your ears. but if you listen you can hear the correct melody in the singer even though his mask muffles his voice the guitars are awesome, the turn tables have a great effect on the music, the samplings adds great touches to it, and the drums sound better live! really the only thing I have to say about this album is sit, listen, and hang on for fricken life!

It is by far my favorite live CD; it captures the show perfectly. If you haven't been fortunate enough to go to a Slipknot show, this is your chance. It is by far my favorite Slipknot album.Ha, it's impossible to review all of the songs on the album (there are 24!) but my favorites have to be The Heretic Anthem, Spit it Out, Vermillion, Wait and Bleed, and The Nameless.Buy the CD to re-live one of the best nights of your life, or buy it to have the chance to finally hear a dream come to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but less than expected","review":"After reading some of the hype about this, I was expecting a new experience.

An quasi-all star cast livens the movie up with their absolutely astonishing attempts to act convincingly.The premise is, of course, completely believable (assuming you're on a 2 week drinking binge).And be sure to watch carefully for the single most politically incorrect scene ever seen on film.For some reason this film left me with an incredible craving for breakfast cereal.Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than I remember, plus wrong bonus feature info","review":"When you see a movie with your sweetie on a warm summer evening when the world was young, you tend to remember it through rose-colored glasses.

Yes, the diologue and acting are both bad, but not the kind of bad that I found funny.

No gore or anything out of the ordinary, just a bunch of stunt people covered in real live bees...yawn!

The lessons are two pages long; enough to teach him each sight word without him feeling as though it's a chore. Word search reviews are fun and they reinforce the sight words learned in the previous lessons. (such as; the, and, of.) The feeling of accomplishment is achieved after the lessons, not of failure. He looks forward to doing the work. And he has started to notice his learned sight words around him and even in books I'm reading. The smile on his beaming face is priceless.

He is a wimp; he is a coward; he is a neocommunist.He is also an excellent, excellent writer.Setting Douthat's politics aside (because, in actuality, Privilege is not overwhelmingly political), let us focus on what matters most about book reviews: the prose here is sharp; the observations compelling; and the message relevant and provocative.

I totally recommend this game to peop,e who love graphics, cars, and/or racing!You can just use the keyboard, you do not NEED a joystick or steering wheel. Another cool feature: when you are driving, to accelorate you press the up arrow. And you don't have to hold it to keep going the same speed! to slow down, press the down arrow.

When he dies in an accident, she is left pregnant and with no proof the marriage existed. Her husband's illegitimate half-brother, Jason Fonsell, steps in and offers her a marriage of convenience in exchange for a sum of money from her aunt. She accepts and enters into the Fonsell household where the untimely death of Jason's stepmother looms over the family many years after the fact. Our heroine deals with her strong attraction to her new husband and questions the circumstances surrounding the Late Mrs. Fonsell's death after someone else turns up dead. This book is definitely for fans of romantic suspense--there is a real electricity in the relationship between Irene and her husband Jason (they have that love/hate/misundertanding thing happening). I guessed who the bad person was long before it was revealed, but,then, I usually do. : ) Have fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series.","review":"Okay , everyone else went over the book pretty well so here's a short review .

This edition by the University of Chicago Press is one of the few complete editions on the market today (and, its completeness shows, as it is quite hefty). It is essentially a facsimile of the 1904 edition by Edwin Cannan, with Cannan's original introduction. It also includes a new preface by the economist George J. Stigler. Both the preface and the introduction are fairly useful in laying out the main ideas that influenced Adam Smith in the writing of the Wealth of Nations. For its size and completeness, this edition is also quite cheap. It is perfect for anyone wishing to have the Wealth of Nations in its totality. Students (like me!) will also find it quite useful in their studies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to listen to, with real insight.","review":"This record reminds me of a cross between Cat Stevens and Tom Petty.

Kevin O'Donnell would not know an intersesting turn of phrase or clever wordplay if they bit him on the backside. Boring, dull repetitive lyrics and slickly played and produced insturmentation add up to one thing, an album that sounds like a man with too much money going through some sort of midlife crisis. Also note Kevin does not actually play any of the music on this album. That would be excusable if the songs were well written or if he had a voice that didn't sound like some aging coked-up executive doing his worst Cat Stevens at a seedy karaoke bar. Save your money for cat food."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice, light, stress free reading","review":"This is such a great book. Its basically not a read-once-and -done book.

The games have a very 'clunky', awkward feel to them and are totally lacking in excitement. There appears to be very little need for any amount of skill on the players part.

Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you would expect or is it?","review":"The graphics for the game are amazing. If you like the old style pinball machines, you'll like it. You don't have a lot of flashing lights or bumpers, there is not much control. Frankly, if I wanted to play the old style machine, I would rather locate an arcade with these machines. With a plethora of pinball games out and most of them using more modern style games, I would recommend something more in tune with them.

However, if you want a really good trip into retro pinball land then this package is a sure winner and a great value. Lets face it, I can't go down to my corner drugstore and play Knockout or Slick Chick or any of the other oldies. What is wonderful about this package is I can sit home in my underwear in front of my PC and experience pinball the way 2 generations before me did. On my first few plays on Humpty Dumpty I was like, \\"this is dumb\\", the ball just drains, no flippers at the bottom. But spend some real time with this game and you see why Microsoft choose to include it in the package. My thoughts are that the 1st five games are totally retro and I enjoyed them immensely, however, the last 2, Haunted House and Cue Ball could of been left out and I wouldn't of cared, hence the 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Although these pinball games can be a lot of fun, they lack the realism and feel of real play.

Well, in Microsoft's Pinball Arcade it proves to be pretty bad. None of the pinball tables are really that great. The 1931 pinball table, \\"Baffle Ball\\", is certainly baffleing to us, with no real guide as to how to play it, you only can guess on what to do, and the best way to go about scoreing points. Game critics tend to say that the best feature about Pinball Arcade is the sound, and I'll have to agree with them on that, but thats not saying much considering the ball physics of Pinball Arcade are frustrating and unrealistic, and the designs of the tables are unimaginative. All in all, the tables are either too easy, or because of the lack of realism, very difficult. It almost put me to sleep the first few times I played it. The ball drifting around the table makes me sleepy just thinking about it. Buy Pro Pinball: Fantastic Journey, it's much much better.Leader..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment!","review":"The box looks exciting, but the looks are decieving in my opinion. If you expect flashy arcade fun, pass this one by. The older games are no classics in my book, and if I had found a demo to download I would have NEVER bought this one.

The work will be helpful to researchers interested in such subjects and could be a lengthy appendix to /The King of the World/. For those who found that book a revelation, the necessity of owning Guénon's companion works like this one should go without saying. However, the book is a rather short collection of essays between which several reviews of academic and occult texts have been scattered like palate cleansers. Most of the chapters are unrelated to each other and it has none of the decisive quality of /The King of the World/."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brass Band Music","review":"The disc was in almost perfect condition an at a great price.

The song list is intense and doesn't leave you wanting for more. My son, 7, has been taking bass guitar for just under three months and he was stoked to find songs he's been learning in his music classes and one on one lessons in here.

A plastic spiral binding would bea simple and vast improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Mixed Bag","review":"The good thing about this book--and about this songbook series in general-- is that it includes many popular songs that are good for a guitar player to learn, both to learn basic chord technique and build repertoire. The bad thing is that they are rife with errors, including unconventional and sometimes frankly incorrect music notation, some incorrect chord changes, and even some wrongly transcribed melodies (and it includes far too many of Shipton's own compostions, which are of minimal value). If you can find another songbook or songbooks that include most of the songs you want to learn, it is probably a more faithful and useful reproduction than this book. However, it does give good practice in basic chord changes, and has a good amount of good (and bad) songs, mostly folk and pop from the 60s and 70s, with some traditional tunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A++ Songbook!","review":"This book has some great songs that are easy to play.

Continuing throught my day the remainder pealed off due to perspiration or something. In the end, I just used Krazy glue and it stayed strong for 3 days. This stuff probably only works on cuts that are not on the hands and are not on joints. I had a cut on the joint of my pinky finger. After the initial 10 minutes of burning and drying, it maybe lasted 30 minutes before I bent my finger and it cracked down the middle, allowing more pain and such into my cut.

The product worked great on two of the cracks by sealing off air contact and stopping the pain. On the third crack, I applied several coats of the prodcut and could not get the pain to stop for several days although the pain intensity was reduced after application of Nexcare. I continued to work with my hands and did not have any additional pain or cracking. All three cracked were healed within a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't understand all the positive reviews","review":"Bought it from some other site, for a little bit less than on amazon.

It does not have a strong smell at all which is good. However, I was disappointed at the lack of effectiveness. It almost seems too thin and watery to give my small cuts a sufficient barrier.

While the skin crack care does seal the crack, it's so thin, I don't think it stays for very long. And I haven't noticed that my cracks are healing any faster using this compared to what I usually do (vaseline). The Advanced Skin Care Cream that is advertised to use with the skin crack care is very good; using that alone is better than the skin crack care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work.","review":"I work around wood a lot and my hands dry up and crack. I use lotions but that is not enough. As another reviewer said, I used to use the Band-Aid product that was essentially super-glue and it really worked. But Band-Aid took it off the market. I had no choice but to try this Nexcare Skin Crack Care in the hope that it might help. It does not. It is useless. I apply to clean dry skin and it initially covers the skin crack but then not long after the crack will reopen. I've tried applying and applying this Nexcare Skin Crack Care but that does not help. It doesn't seal the skin crack and does not help in healing the skin crack. A complete waste of money. I've tried getting a dermatologist to write a prescription for medical-grade super glue but they would not do it. So I'm stuck using bandaids and/or bandage wrap.If you get skin cracks on your fingers/hands, don't waste your money or time on this product, it does not work."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT good","review":"This stuff has all the adhesive properties of Jell-O.

The pictures are fantastic and it covers a broad scope of information on setting up the tank, reefs, fish and invertebrates. It gives information on what they eat, who they get along with, and what conditions they prefer. In some cases, however, the directions for caring for a certain type of fish were not as detailed as we would have liked. If you want a general saltwater reference book, this is a great investment.

It covers such places as Iguazu, Torres del Paine, Peninsula Valdes, Nahuel Huapi, Vicente Perez Rosales and Tierra del Fuego in a very thorough fashion. If there is any criticism to this book is that it is a bit incomplete. Since 1990, when the book was first edited, a number of others national parks have been created in South America, and they are obviously not included here. Also, the book concentrates in the national parks of southern South America (perhaps because they are the best organized and are easier and safer to visit) and it lacks a bit about parks in the northern part of South America. But this is a very good introduction to really fascinating places. All in all, a very worthwhile book."},{"rating":"1","title":"flywhisk","review":"the end piece already came off also the hair is falling out, i only have used it a couple since i bought it. very disapointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product - great price!","review":"I was very pleased with the quality of the whisk, I have a friend who paid a lot more for one from another source, and mine was just as nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try a different pinball","review":"A great concept but very disappointing. The toy seemed to spark interest in the box however once it was put on had many flaws. The first being the background music that plays the minute you hit the on switch. Very loud and annoying. There is a button where you can hit the music to be off but that does not keep a childs attention. They should have put music on that was not as loud and annoying. Also the 2 figures do not stay on. If you touch them the slightest bit they fall off. The toy would have been better off without them. The biggest flaw is the trap button in where you score the most points. You have to hold the button down in order for the ball to fall into it. How can you expect a 5 yr old to hold that button down while also manuvering the flippers. It is impossible. I would recommned nixing this toy off your list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clinician loves this game","review":"I use this game in counseling sessions with adolscents and adults.

The whole thing was recorded in a bar in New York - The Scene Club ? - somewhere in 68 so yes, it is the real thing ... jammy bluesy screatchy electric guitar and all but for some reason, is very depressing and painful the play and hear.

Between the thinness of the cards and the flaky gold stuff, I'm concerned about how these will hold up with ongoing use.I would also have liked some mention in the promotional spiel that they appear to be written for a very young audience, with several passages in the accompanying booklet basically boiling down to \\"ask a grown-up\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oracle cards","review":"very pretty and uplifting.

It doesn't look anything like it's pictured above. The water splashes everywhere, it makes a ton of noise, there are not enough rocks to cover the base, they fall into the canal where the pump is housed, in order to adjust the flow of the water, you have to take the entire thing apart, It's not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely fountain to aid sleep or just watch...","review":"First off, my fountain is quiet...I have excellent hearing and bought it to help sleep and it does this well. I had no real problems with set-up, despite the fact that I read the instructions only after assembly! There is a bit of splatter after many, many hours of running, but adjusting the pump to about 1/3 between the \\"-\\" and \\"+\\" setting fixes most of that. My room humidity stays about 45% and at that level you need to add water every two days or so. Mine is visible from over 180 degrees and it looks nice from all sides. I found there were plenty of stones supplied, despite others problems. Oh, and please fellow-shoppers, unless you have bought one or have used one of a friends, it isn't helpful to rate a product based on speculation.All considered, a fine product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am not sure what the other reviews are talking about...","review":"I love to have a fountain on my desk at work. It is very peacedul and helps me concentrate. I have been looking for a \\"natural\\" fountain and I saw this one. One of the reviews below said something about it being small, so I thought that would be great - it would fit on my desk. A saucer roughly the size of a dinner plate sits on the base - bigger than I though. I found there to be plently of rocks... the slate is fully adjustable so I just turned the pump down, moved the slate around and it works fine. No splashing! And it is quiet! I would have given it 5 stars - but it was too big to go exactly where I wanted it on my desk, so I had to move some things around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This item was given to me as a gift and within a few months the motor started making a lot of noise, then in addition to that it would gurgle up the water, needless to say it got really 'unpeaceful' pretty fast.

This one looked good and I trust the HoMedics brand. Trouble is, the sound of the pump is louder than the running water, and the pump hum magnifies if you set it on any hard surface (and where else are you going to set this, on carpet?). I fiddled with water level and putting it on rags...no good. After a few minutes, the hum of the pump was driving me so crazy, I turned it off. Then my cat discovered it, and in no time I had wet paw prints and rocks all over the house (not the product's fault, I know, but beware buying one of these if you have curious kitties). Twenty minutes after opening it, it was back in the box and under the sink. Hardly a zen experience.I would recommend going to a store and listening to different brands. When you find one without pump noise, come back to Amazon and buy it.Peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"works well, sounds pretty good, low upkeep","review":"works well, my first fountain. it tends to splash outside of the fountain if you fill it where recommended. over time, white stuff builds up. maybe i'll try distilled water next time? is not as loud as i thought that it would be. overall, i think homedics makes quality products. i've also bought a shiatsu massager from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Fountain","review":"I received this as a gift.

I used it on a daily basis, but putting it together was not fun. It did look nice once it was together, but very wobbly on the top and flimsy. But one drawback is that you can only display it with it set against a wall. The fountain finally broke, but the pump still functioned so I ended up being creative and making my own fountain out of the slate pieces and river rock. Eventually the pump gave way and that was the end of the fountain. The fountain itself was soothing, but it did splash and you have to keep up daily to refill the fountain. Overall I give this fountain two stars. This fountain is not for daily use and not made well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value!","review":"This is a nice little fountain, not too difficult to put together if you're fairly handy, good tabletop size, amazing price. The only thing that drove me bananas was that they put stickers on the slate pieces to match up to the construction diagram, and the stickers wouldn't come off easily. But, I just put a few of the little rocks that came with it on top of the sticker residue and it looks fine. Just be sure to keep it clean or it won't run properly. Oh, and this is definitely a corner unit - the back doesn't have any decoration.Update: I put this on a high table in my baby's room for a nightlight/soother. It works great to help relax her so she can sleep (she fights sleep almost every night, so it's been a bit of a life saver)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke","review":"My 9 year old daughter loved the design, but the arms broke off within a week.Great looking but not durable enough for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I debated whether or not to leave a review and finally concluded that I would have wanted this info when considering to purchase the product.

It seemed to fit like a glove. Looking back I'm not so sure I did the best thing for him. He wasn't a big eater, and my milk supply dried up at 5 months. I think I would have been able to breast fed longer, and he would have been more healthy had I demand fed like I am with my second. My second son, has a ferocious appetite. There's no way, I'd be able to put him on this program without many tears from both the baby and I. It is not worth the undue stress to try to adhere to what in the author's opinion is the \\"right way\\" to do things.

Google him, or go to [...] .His early infancy parenting advice is in direct conflict with the AAP, La Leche League and WHO on Breast feeding practices.Focus on the Family & the AAP have issued statements against his advice.In addition, his assertion that His way is God's way may make a person feel righteous for following it, but is much closer to spiritual abuse and control.Jesus way was to feed those who were hungry & to take special care for the children, loving on them, taking them on His lap, and blessing them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Founding church offers a review of \\"Prep\\"","review":"While many parents insist that \\"Preparation for Parenting\\" is as Biblical as it purports to be, the church where it all began does not allow it to be taught there any longer, in part due to theological problems and a lack of Biblical support for the infant management advice, such as schedule feeding, avoiding the use of slings, etc. For a brief statement of their major concerns, please visit http://www.fix.net/~rprewett/grace-ezzo.html"},{"rating":"1","title":"Biblical?

Jesus listened to the needs of the children and we shall do the same. This books asks us to put aside the Jesus side of God.

I found very helpful in my study of on the history of ghost hunting.Warning a bit wordy, but remember it was done as a scientific document, and just enjoy the base information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice puzzle","review":"This was a birthday present for my 14 year-old. Overall, it was a good puzzle for that age group. There were none of the strange shaped pieces (which are currently driving me crazy on a 3,000 piece Starry Night puzzle!) But the picture quality was not what I expected. The picture was somewhat fuzzy. I've never had this problem with a Ravensburger puzzle before - and I've done a fair number of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bit Challenging","review":"I think this puzzle would be better for older kids or adults.

Rameses II is one of my great grandfathers so I thought it would be a kick to try this one. I am a 42 year old woman and I have to say that this game is a challenge. You have to have quite a bit of patience because you have to do each scenario several times until you actually are victorious, but it is worth the time you spend. My husband rarely gets time on his games anymore because I just have to conquer again. Ha-ha."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"First of all, The historical accuracy of the game is laughable. The missions are semi impossible. I hope that aoe2 is better done. Strategic this is not. Swarming your enemy with the best troups you can. Not at all what I had expected when I first heard about. Just about the only good thing about this game was the way soldiers look. I love the middle ages but this dumb attempt is laughable. For example, one centurion can knock out a war elephant. Give me a break. Another example is that the helepolis loads extremely fast. Impossible. What a helepolis was was a giant crossbow. If you have even a rudimentary knowledge of the medieval times you would know even crossbows were extremely slow to reload. Then you get this big helepolis that fires like a machine gun, come on."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Conveniace for the Age of Empires/Rise of Rome player","review":"If you already own Age of empires and Rise of Rome, you will probably find this more convenient since it has both on one disk.

Trust me, whether you are completely new to the Age of Empire scene, or are just looking for conveniance, this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product was incredibly boring","review":"There were not that many campaigns; some were way too hard and some were way too easy. The units were incredibly stupid, because whenever I sent boats somewhere they kept getting stuck in harbors, and the land units that I sent anywhere kept getting stuck behind allies' walls and allies' units kept bunching up and stopped me from moving anywhere. Once you've played all the campaigns, whether you win or lose, the game becomes incredibly boring. There were not that many new campaigns in the Rise of Rome. I suggest that people should buy Age of Empires 2 rather than this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly addictive...","review":"I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I picked this game up. At first I was struck as to how much it resembles WARCRAFT (ORCS VS. HUMANS). Most of the level advancing, character animation and general game play is almost identical. At then end of the day, the purpose is to beat your enemy by advancing through civilizations and either conquering them, retrieving artifacts or constructing a wonder. The game is addictive, especially at the higher levels. If you can, try the multiplayer versions. There's nothing quite like playing against someone else. There are a few annoying little things. You can lose your people behind buildings and, in some cases, they get lost if sent on a roundabout route to their destinations. However, still a fun game and highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated","review":"I would probably have had more fun if I hadn't used Age of Empire II before this one. Age of Empire II/Conqueror has so many more functionalities. Not having these functionalities requires much more manual 'handling'. For instance, in AOE II, double-clicking on a unit will select all units of that type present on the screen. It wouldn't work with this version, very annoying. I played 15 hours, just to give it a fair chance, then I gave up. The disk will be forgotten in a drawer, too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice story, but...","review":"This looked like a very interesting story, and it is. If they had a few million bucks they could have made a great film out of this story. So, while the story is there, the production values are, um, lacking to say the least. I appreciate independant film makers, and I give Leopoldo Laborde credit for getting this one out there. I'm sure his later films are just fine. This film was made with no lighting (which is why everything happens during the day), no microphones save the one \\"on the camera\\", and I have a feeling he used his own house for the set. The subtitles get a little humorous with typos. Overall the low-budget nature becomes just distracting, taking the viewers mind off of the story, which is fairly well played."},{"rating":"1","title":"DE MALA CALIDAD","review":"LA HISTORIA ES MUY BUENA PERO ESTA MUY MAL GRABADO PARECE QUE ESTA GRABADO EN UNA CAMARA DE V H S LA EDIDICION ES MALA ESTA MUY ALTA LA PISTA DE LA MUSICA EN RELACION A EL PARLAMENTO DE LA GENTE CON ACTORES TOTALMENTE DESCONOCIDOS AUNQUE BUENA ACTUACION POR PARTE DE LOS NIÑOS Y COMO DIJE LA HISTORIA ES BUENA PERO LLEGA UN MOMENTO QUE ME PUSO NERVIOSO POR LA MALA CALIDAD DE LA GRABACION"},{"rating":"1","title":"PAINFUL","review":"This game is so easy sometimes and yet extremely difficult when it's not supposed to be.

It is set in 1970's Vienna, and explores female sexuality and the body in ways that had never been attempted before. The protagonist, Anne, is an artist who becomes obsessed with the idea that aliens, called Hyskos, are taking over people's bodies. As in her other films, like Menschenfrauen (1980), Export experiments with blending different audio and visual medias within the film. For example, she makes the main character an artist and in this way integrates different styles of art. She also blends in montages,still photographs, performance art and video clips. The effects are jarring and they transport audiences into Anne's mental state. The film continues to break from conventions and offers an incomparable experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great....","review":"I recently purchased this for my kids age 4 and 2. They love to blow bubbles so I thought it would be cool to do really big ones! Unfortunately it didn't work very well. You are suppose to slowly pull the wand out of the sword and let the excess solution drip back into the container. I did this and the solution that makes the bubbles and 'sticks' to the wand would 'pop'before I had a chance to make any bubbles. So, I just skipped this and it made some bubbles but they weren't as big and I expected--you can make the same size with a regular wand if you just blow slowly. I just don't think it's worth the $. I know there is a better product out there that I had when I was a kid it was AWESOME but I don't see it anymore.

There is a common comparison to Bon Jovi-meets-Yngwie Malmsteen. I wouldn't go that far. But lets be clear - this isn't old Nocturnal Rites, and if you had a problem with their last 2 albums then you'll probably hate this.Now with that all being said, this is a GOOD album for what it is.

It is not so much a strategy game, but rather a slow adventure game (the \\"slow\\" being a positive quality, for you become immersed in the creepy atmosphere of it all). It has an awesome chase-scene ending that takes you all over the sprawling mansion and into the bowels of the mansion- you find your knowledge of the house which had served as your background on the past 6 discs being put to the test as you flee your attacker- perhaps one of the best- and scariest- game endings ever.

The interface also makes for a rather liniar, simplistic game. My greatest complaint, however, is the time it takes to complete the games.

Oh wait...oh yeah...DRY MY CAR OFF MAYBE? I've had the same Original California Water Blade for about 10 years now and I LOVE it. It's still going strong, I just decided to give this jelly blade thing a try. Absolute waste of money. It's so flimsy it ends up only wiping about 60-70% of the water away and leaving the rest beaded up on my car's surface - similar to a worn out pair of windshield wipers. I'm a car person. I take very good care of all my cars and I've managed to get washing them down to a science. Buying this was a huge step backwards. Did the product developers even try their own product on an actual car? I am very disappointed in this item. Fortunately I still have my original water blade because it actually works. The jelly blade now resides at my local landfill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Move on - nothing to buy here!","review":"I have to agree with most of the other reviewers on this one - suggest buying a different product. Unfortunately there werent a lot of reviews when I pruchased this a couple summer back - I was in the market as my original Calif. blade had gotten worn and flimsy...this one is NOT the answer, unfortunately.The plastic blade itself is so spongy and flexible it can't possibly remove all the water without multiple swipes.If I could have physically seen it in the auto parts store before purchasing, the design problems would have been obvious...I'm tossing it as soon as I find a suitable alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Blade","review":"I bought this product because I made the mistake of buying a black car. I always have water spots after it drys. Inow use a rinse that helps the water not bead up and I get far fewer spots on the vertical sufaces then without the spot aditive. I got the blade to run over the enitre car after I wash an area. It does an okay job but not any better then the window blade I was using before @ $5. This blade has a nice feel to it and a smaller tip for the mirrors.This should last a long time but I don't think I would buy another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for clearing windows","review":"Bought this for my car to clear dew and rain off my side windows and mirrors. Works great, and I've ended up using it on my car and in my bathroom.The wide blade makes clearing the condensation from my windows very quick, and since it's flexible, it conforms to the shape of the window. It also makes it easy to clear off condensation from side-view mirrors, which is hard to do with standard squeegees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh no","review":"this is the most pretentious and hollow book I have ever read, and to think it came so highly recommended.

In other ways, I never will. This is because my hectic, American life does not allow for things like five weeks of vacation or having two-hour dinners every night that are made from scratch from the freshest ingredients the farmer's market had to offer that day. Although the author arguably has to put forth an ideal (because why the heck would you want to model yourself after something commonplace and mediocre?), the images of the women presented are a bit fantastical. So, French Girl, I will gladly have some of your real butter, but I'm also keeping my bagged salad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Balancing act","review":"Ollivier is an American who is married to a Frenchman and lived in France as a relative insider for ten years. Her observations are fascinating as sociology alone. Her advice is very valuable for this typical over-achieving self-improving self-effacing German-American woman. Of course, it is ironic to read a self-help book that tells you to imprrove yourself by not trying to improve yourself, but the advice is wise. Having only travelled to Paris and known but a few French people, it did ring true as far as the stereotypical French style. It also rang true that pleasing yourself is far wiser, and I find, more attractive than doormat pretzeling yourself to change to please others. Be cool; be French."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honestly about 3.5 stars, but a fun, light read","review":"This was an informative little book, I don't think to be taken too seriously. Just a bunch of information to compare how you live to how many French people live. I will admit that there is a lot we can learn from the European cultures, as they are already masters of their cultures. That's what makes this kind of read fun -- seeing if there are customs or mindsets you may want to introduce into your lifestyle to give it a little spice. Nothing wrong there. I did enjoy learning about their social system and healthcare. Wish we cared as much about our mothers/children here. I always say take away what's good and works for you and discard the rest. I am not interested in becoming French, but I love finding little details that can enhance your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"To much fluff","review":"Great personal account of life in France. However the book was too long and included to many superfluous excerpts from other books and movies.

When I moved back State-side after having the years of my life in France, this book soothed my spirit and filled it with fondness of life in France. Beautifully written! I plan to re-read this again a few times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Icky and embarrassing","review":"If you want a book full of steriotypical whitewash and teen-mentality superlatives, go ahead. Read up. Personally I thought I was going to throw up at one more reference to what \\"THE FRENCH GIRL\\" did, said, thought, ate, drank, etc. That phrase must appear on an average of half a dozen times per page, and in itself is enough to turn a person off. Give us names, give us specifics, or anecdotes -- fine! But I got half way through this and thought I'd had enough of Olivier's unxious descriptions and ridiculous generalizations.

I speak French, and I like different culture exploration, like most people. But- she says that at one point she wanted to die and be reborn French. It has redeeming qualities, but this kind of thing shouldn't be published, it should be in a blog, not in the market. I wonder if there are people in France buying books that say \\"How to discover your inner American woman\\". It makes, this book, out of being French, an unequivocable quality, like being happy or being sad. That is lite non fiction at best. Something for the plane, at least. Musn't be too harsh on it, it is cute. Worst things have been published.... oh yes. Everyday. What can we do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silk mou-mous","review":"It's all very well telling uncultured, non-French women that they, too, can be glamorous, mythic and mysterious, but I don't know that incorporating French style and culture into your life is really all it's cracked up to be. After perusing this publication, my wife has begun dining on sliced pig's trotters, substituting perfume for basic cleanliness, and pouting rudely at anyone who smiles at her in the street. She's become passionate about fondue and unwatchable experimental black & white films. She has also professed a previously absent desire to collaborate with Nazis. And best not get me started on the silk mou-mous and padded zebra-skin mules..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh Take on the French","review":"ENTRE NOUS provides new insight into what makes French women tick. Debra Ollivier's specific examples of her own French friends, excellent movie and book recommendations and even recipes make this a light, fun read while being informative. And she's not gushingly adoring of the French - she provides a balanced look at at what works and doesn't work for both French and American women. I especially liked the comparisons. Of course there is poverty (and McDonald's) in France but this book fulfills its purpose of examining the chic French women many admire and would like to emulate."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Clever Guide To The Ideal French Woman","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Every few months I take it back out and review some sections that I enjoyed such as specific recipes, cute tidbits about shopping, and even a quote or two.The book reads easily and lines up well with other books I have read abotu France written from an outsiders point of view. I would recommend this book if you are looking for a jaunty ride through France's eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculously pretentious","review":"This book is so full of ridiculous stereotypes and affectations that I could not finish it. I know dozens of French women, lived with two of them as roommates and count a few as my close friends. None of them looks remotely like the portrait in the book. Ms. Ollivier repeats herself and makes ridiculous statements unsupported by any statistics, they are just her romantic wishful thinking about French women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the simple, everyday things","review":"I found this book informative, as I have never been to France, nor studied French. I am, however, very interested in the lifestyle of a culture who takes pleasure in the simple, everyday 'pleasures'. I also love to cook and eat, and view food and wine as sensual pleasures to savor and enjoy, like the French do. I was hoping to get other ideas from the French to make everyday chores into something that delights me and makes me feel good.I did like the little boxed 'footnotes' Ollivier included all over. Most of them included movies or lists I want to commit to my file for examples of French and simple living...and I do love movies, books, and lists!The reason I gave the book 4 stars out of 5 is, though I really enjoyed the book and will keep it to reread, there are no color pictures. The book could have been so much better had there been photos to 'see', as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"This book is incredibly TEDIOUS.

Next time I'll go to a bookstore for a recommendation!It's a fawning love story about French \\"girls\\". Throughout the book I kept thinking \\"EVERY French girl is like this? No exceptions?\\" Her description is an idealized version of French women. It grew tiresome about halfway into the book.I've lived in Europe, and yes, cultures and customs are unique. People do things differently in Europe than they do in the US. Does that make Europe superior? According to the author and her French friends, the answer is yes. Americans are loud, brash, too busy, and have too many cereal choices.Why doesn't the author write about French hygiene habits, their incessant smoking, and their entitlement-based, socialist government?"},{"rating":"1","title":"superficial","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. Although the portrays of French girls the author gives are not wrong, they are more stereotypes. Instead of giving interesting and original observations of French, the auther just gives individual episodes on French girls do this, Americans do that, which are not even original and seem to be like examples that fit those stereotypes. Maybe this will be a good starting point, but if you really want to know why and how French girls do it, there are much better books out like Frederic Fekkai's A Year of Style or Geneviere Antonine Dariaux's A Guide to Elegance. Finally, if you believe that the author knows French in and out because she is married to a French and lived in France for 10 years, as I did when I bought this book, unfortunately it just shows that if someone does not have an observant eye, living ten years does not improve that."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"French Lessons\\" Made Easy","review":"Entre Nous is a delightful, easy read about French women's \\"certain something\\".If you find the French intriguing (French WOMEN in particular), you will most likely enjoy this lighthearted look at the culture, lifestyle and attitudes of the women and people of France.Not meant to be taken TOO seriously, this book is the author's personal take on why so much mystery surrounds French women.

And I have to admit, that before I arrived here, I had visions of berets, perfect stockings, cigarettes, and street accordions dancing in my head. But I'm getting this feeling that it is basically the same everywhere, at least in cities. There will be large department stores, chains of McDonalds, KFC, Starbucks, homeless people, fat people, scruffy people. Which is of course a \\"duh\\". The characteristics that Ollivier attribute to French girls can really be seen everywhere; New York, Rome, London, Chicago etc. Girls honestly look the same everywhere generally; boots with slim jeans or pants tucked in, wearing a short fitted jacket, yada yada. So really. Stop being such a poser.

And while I don't mind the new updated cg effects. I still prefer the original animation. Just something about how it looks keeps the soul of the animation. I feel the Cg areas sorta loses something from the process and it gets lost. On the plus side the animation here looks beautiful and truly amazing especially in HD and because of that I have to recommend this blu-ray if only for the updated remastering of the animation parts. The sound track also sounds amazing and if you have never seen Ghost in the shell ,but have seen the Matrix and love it or dark city or anything cyber punk sci fi thriller, then Ghost in the Shell is a must see movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 for the price of 1.","review":"It has both the new remastered and the original version of the film on one disk.

But if your old school and prefer the original version (like myself), you will be happy to know that the original is on here as well, untouched. It's in the extras.

Certainly the CGI additions though good at times are a bit inconsistent in what they add overall but the remastered original animation for blu-ray is fantastic as is the audio. The spoken audio appears to be original (re-mastered I'm sure) so don't expect the flow of any scenes to change. This isn't likeEvangelion: 1.01remakes just an very strong update to the original classic Ghost in the Shell. Special features include the original version of the movie but it does seem to me a bit rough in part going straight to blu-ray.

While the first anime that I ever watched was one of the big known ones, known as 'Akira' and enjoyed that one. With Ghost in the Shell, it reminds me of how Akira is and with this one, it is near how well Akira is but is much different from that. Ghost in the Shell deals with a organization better known as 'Section 9' with Chief Aramaki leading the unit. While the top two are sent out to investigate a hacker that is known as the Puppetmaster and find out what his motives are for what he's doing, but just when they think they found him it wasn't him.

As far as Cyberpunk goes, this is it. Plain and simple.Let's talk about what's wrong with GITS: 2.0They took the 2008 Japanese Bluray and ran a blur filter over it. Want your DVD to look the same? Turn the sharpness down to about 20%. Ta-da!Added in new 3d animation that looks like something from a Playstation One or 2 at best. Low rez, crap quality that has artifacting and residue. We're talking Youtube video quality. I'm not impressed. Going from one type of animation type to another in mid movie is really painful.On top of all that, deciding to change entire color pallets, substituting Amber for Green. Ya that's great.

It was easy enough to assemble and it was fun and entertaining but it only lasted for 30 minutes at most. He was very disappointed that it ran out so quickly.The biggest thing to beware of with the Crayola Sidewalk Paint is that it DOES NOT wash off the sidewalk or driveway easily. (Side note: I washed his clothes right away and the paint did come out of them) A month has passed since my son used the sidewalk paint - a month of spraying the paint with a hose and frequent rains yet it still will not wash off. I love my sons creativity but I don't need to have bright pink and blue staining my sidewalk & driveway. I think we will need to rent a pressure washer to remove the paint. Stick with sidewalk chalk - it is economical, fun, lasts longer, and washes off easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"The motor was running but no paint was coming out.

It was actually a lot of fun until I stored it away incorrectly.Tips:You need to follow the directions closely.You need to add a lot of water to the paint. If you are having spraying problems with a new setup make sure you try adding more water, a fresh set of batteries and pointing the sprayer down to the ground as it says.When done, make sure to pump through a lot of hot water to clean out the tubing--if not the paint will harden up and make the entire device worthless.Something that people need to keep in mind is that this is not an expense toy nor is it going to have a lot of force behind the spray as it is a little kids TOY for goodness sake! It may not work exactly like the ads, but it is still lots of fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"This paint sprayer was a birthday gift. I should have read the reviews before opening the package because it would have saved me time and my son some tears. Only one side of the sprayer worked from the get-go.

We tried to switch it back to pink and nothing, I tried to see if maybe there was a clump and flush the line- nothing. Couldn't even get the motor to run except on and off for a second or two. The second sprayer had the same problem only it never sprayed for even a second. It would turn on and then it wouldn't almost like it had a short somewhere.

Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific!","review":"This book is a fascinating study of the history of rational thought. Dr. Nuland traces the evolution -- the victories and the failures -- of various thinkers in history. He successfully avoids the condescending spirit of the modernist approach to history.It is very informative, and his anecdotes could not be better.This book will definitely appeal to anyone who is interested in the history of science or medicine.I disagree with some of Dr. Nuland's conclusions -- namely, that religion is not a form of superstition and that science will always be intertwined with religion. This, however, does not detract from the fine quality of this work (as other readers may form their own opinions on such matters)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I read a review of this book in the Boston Globe and ordered it on Amazon immediately. It sounded fascinating, but overall the book turned out to be quite a dissapointment. I found Dr. Nuland's anecdotal descriptions of his surgical experiences riveting -- the stuff that keeps me tuning in to \\"ER\\" every Thursday night. Unfortunately, the true \\"guts\\" of the book, the history of mankind's understanding of the organs and how they work was very dry and at times repetitive. I wished that Dr. Nuland could have told the story of the discovery of the function of the liver, for example, with the same intensity as he described his first personal experience with open-heart surgery."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"Sherwin Nuland lost himself in his own circuitious, excessive prose in this book. He comes through in a few spots, such as when he describes what a jerk he was to the husband of the liver patient described in the book. For the most part, most of this book could be condensed to about half of it's space. I was misled when I thought each chapter would contain observations of an operation and was instead forced to read pages and pages of a long-winded history of science, through the eyes of this author. This book can be easily skimmed without missing much. The Rembrant painting on the cover was nice though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A History of Medical Thought and Lore","review":"\\"The Mysteries Within\\" is a book about the myths that have developed in medicine over the last several millenia. In it Dr. Nuland discusses the evolution of thought concerning various organs. He also goes into detail describing where some modern words and expressions have come from.

The graphics are great, and the puzzles are neither too easy nor too difficult. But it does get progessively harder and more complex the more puzzles one solves... One drawback (and the reason for only 4 stars) is that I have to completely exit each and every application running at the time, even those in the background (that's right: CTRL-ALT-DEL and close everything in the list except for Explorer and Systray) before I can play Pandora. This also happens on my other computer system. It sure ties up resources, but other than that: intriguing, and it has the power to keep you at your PC all night (no kidding!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puzzles turn into a dull click fest","review":"The 10 puzzles here get really old really quick. Most of them are rehashes on the jigsaw puzzle theme or the sliding square puzzle theme. And that's the best of them- on the bad side there are some really irritating click fests like \\"lens bender\\".As the levels advance the puzzles simply add more pieces rather than becoming more interesting or difficult. Solitare and minesweeper are much better Microsoft products. Get a copy of Uncle Henry's playhouse instead (the puzzles from 11th hour & the 7th guest). Those puzzles reflect a real creative effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't solve just one","review":"My sister gave me Pandora's Box for Christmas, and I find solving the puzzles just like a bag of potato chips-- you can't solve just one and stop. The puzzles are nicely varied (although they are all spatial-relationship puzzles), so you don't feel stuck doing the same things over and over. I'm not so good at puzzles, so I may never get past Level 3, but even that will have provided hours of entertainment. My only gripe? The HINTS are not well done. When you need a hint, you want some strategic advice, not to slide piece A to the left."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Slow Gamers with limited hand movement!","review":"This game is excellant for gamers like myself who have limited hand movement for whatever reason. For those who's brains work fine but hands don't, then fast games are not usable ......but this game is very challenging without requiring hand speed. It is very addicting and holds your interest well from level to level with difficulty increasing as you step up in levels. It is very satisfying mentally and is great excercise for the brain. You can walk away and come back without having to relearn anything due to the great save features that keep you right on track. Recommend it as a \\"must have\\" for your collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was sick of this after a few hours","review":"Looks like a great game, doesn't it? Hundreds of puzzles! Don't let it fool you. All the puzzles involve composing images (some three-dimensional). Most are about as fun as a sliding puzzle. I can't believe this is the best they could come up with. There really are only about 12 puzzle TYPES. The hundreds of puzzles means basically that they have hundreds of images you can play slider puzzle on. It was fun for a few hours, but many of the puzzles are tedious after a while, and when I realized I'd played all the puzzle types, I didn't want to continue.The puzzles aren't even particularly intellectual, either. Most of them involve matching, like a jigsaw puzzle. How long can that keep someone interested? There's no planning (ala lemmings), there's no figuring out how things work, there's no creativity for you. The images you form are sometimes pretty, but they pale in comparison to the lush interactive environments we are used to from the likes of Riven."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not get this game !

It shows the story of a typical teenage girl leading a typical teenage life until one night at party she devastated by being a victim to rape. Speak is a very good movie, it shows how a young female would react if she were to be a victim to rape. This movie also shows the effects of what can happen if you keep things bottled in for to long. The only thing that I did not like was the leave-you-hangin' ending that it gives you. Overall the movie was great I would recommend this movie to any class.

Even the more adult areas were softly spoken, one is not forced into a graphic rendation of love but a wonderful rendation. This is a book I can very much suggest you read, even with its adult orintated sections. One is left wondering what happened after the last page. It is a book I will give to my daughter to read when she is old enough. Quite honestly, I rarely like sequals yet in this case I very much hope she writes one.

If you skip it, you will not have missed anything at all if you've read his first three books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sloppy and lazy story","review":"I give this book two stars rather than one based solely on the potential of the ideas at its core. Which is exactly why the book is so disappointing-- what a rich opportunity for a story, and what a lazy, uninspiring, pointless execution. Some of the worst dialogue I've ever read. You get the feeling that the author has become a little too enthralled with himself, and assumes that his readers will be on board no matter what he chooses to feed them. To say that the book is on par with 1984 and Brave New World is nonsense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Novel","review":"Having read Ishmael and other Quinn novels years ago, and recently having read The Holy, I was expecting something a bit more along those lines... A bit of entertaining fiction with some interesting ideas behind it.But After Dachau was a brilliant book. I was a hundred pages in, lulled into the idea of a book \\"about\\" reincarnation, when it gut-punched me with an historical twist that ends up tying into a number of themes from Ishmael, My Ishmael, The Story of B, and others.It presents Quinn's ideas in an altogether new format, and while I'd certainly continue to recommend Ishmael to others, After Dachau is a great primer to have friends and family who refuse to read books that have \\"ideas preached\\" at them... a common objection I get. It's a rather incisive historical lesson wrapped in an enjoyable tale.A thoughtful, insightful and well written book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Destined to be a classic.","review":"Though I'm an unabashed fan of Daniel Quinn's work, readers can take my word that After Dachau is another gem. My criteria for recomending a work of fiction is that it must entertain me, keep my attention, and leave me with something I didn't have before...some lasting understanding, or at least a \\"Wow!\\". Readers who like Orwell, Huxley, Heinlen, will love this. Readers of Quinn's Ishmael may have expected something else, but...give this new book a chance. It's really is worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quinn does it again!","review":"I don't know how he does it, but he's done it again; another thought-provoking, chilling, absorbing book by Daniel Quinn that left me reeling. Right up there with the works of Orwell, Bradbury, and Huxley--After Dachau is a brilliant look at a world gone worse. A beautifully written, gripping, and compelling story. Read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"While noble at heart and definitely carrying its ingenious moments, this book lacked in real depth and character growth/background. I was most disappointed with the hokey ending, utterly guessable and also the author's use of simplistic descriptive terminology. I've heard this book described as 'life altering', and 'deeply moving' and while I don't dismiss it altogether, I cannot imagine it classifying it as either when it merely plays on ideas which have been well versed in the past. A good short story at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating read","review":"i actaully never read a daniel quinn book so i just picked this one up because i thought it looked good. this book has the power to change lives & minds. his story leads you believe in reincarnation (or not) but has a better underlying suggestion fior humanity. i think it should be in all readxing lists. don't pass this one by! it ewas the best book i've read so far in awhile!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel let down","review":"It seems that DQ has tried to write a shallow summer-beach-novel. I can't see the depth in the story. There are too many parallels to stories such as The Matrix, The Time Machine, etc.His disclaimer at the end felt like a slap in the face. I am reading DQ because I feel he has important ideas to share about the world and our way of living. I wish that he stays with this concept.The whole idea that everything is the white man's fault is rather immature and short-sighted. Every race has its racist tendencies. I don't want to give away the story of the book, because it certainly was a page turner. Sadly, at the end all I had to say is \\"And?\\".For the reader unfamiliar with DQ's thinking I would recommend \\"Beyond Civilization\\" and our dear \\"Ishmael\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was terrible!","review":"Quinn has done it again. This time he really caught my attention. ...AFTER DACHAU is actually one of the best novels I have read in recent times. He is a master story teller, and has to be to present ideas like his. This book is a great starting point for those who wish to understand Quinns' style and tone as a writer and also progress into radicalized politics. Although it comes some time after his original literary successes, I recommend this to highlight current domination of conquering peoples and lands, and all that has been swept under the rug and left out of my \\"history\\" books. Read Quinn, read all of Quinn, and then work to stabilize your own community around common needs and common existence and to eliminate those structures and systems around you that work away from unity. We cannot survive unless we get to know thy neighbors. \\"Can I borrow some sugar, and your copy of Ishmael?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Best investment for any drummer","review":"This is THE BEST hard case i have seen out there.

The interface is consice and the story starts off good. About the 4th mission I started to give up. All the missions are scripted. The AI usually won't do anything until it is triggered which gives you plenty of time to get an army, or not, together. Usually I would spend all my money and still not have a big enough fleet to complete even the 4th mission. Your ships, money, and resources carry over from one mission to the next so be careful. Bad management could leave the game unfinishable."},{"rating":"2","title":"5+!","review":"Spectacular! This is easily one of the best games I have ever played! The graphics are wonderful, and the ease of scrolling and views you can take are second to none! Some RTS games such as Far Gate, Star Trek Space Armada and Empire Earth slow up to be impossible to play when you have a lot of units in play, but with Homeworld this is not a problem. Game creaters could learn a lot from this!A great feature is the amount of space warfare you get to do. I love that! As I was going through the game I started to feel a bit as though the missions were a little too easy, as I was using the same strategy for aboutt hree of them with success, but I realised that I has spoken too soon! I am right on the last part of the game now and I am finding it impossible to beat. I can't believe that after only just managing to beat one wave of ships, another one appears immediately with the same fire power.I haven't had any problems with the inteface. I find its complexity adds to the realism of the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best 3D Strategy game yet","review":"The game has the best graphics i've ever seen in a 3D stategy game i tip my hat off to sierra for this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not hooked","review":"If a game doesn't hook me within the first half-hour then I'm just not going to see it through to the end. Homeworld just seemed like Age of Empires: In Space to me and the slow, confusing gameplay really got on my nerves. I know that this game has an Army of fans who will denounce my comments, but I simply could not get into it.Usually, I like space games and I was hoping that this would have a Star Trek-ish feel to it. I also quite the Wing Commander games and since it only cost me 99p then I thought I might as well give it a go. Call me shallow, but it didn't give me instant satisfaction and uninstalled it after only 45 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't waste your money!","review":"At first the game was great. The graphics were excellent and gameplay was fun, but after I started getting into it, it all changed. The ships would only follow my orders after nagging and begging them to do so. It was as if they were to good to fight for their colony and just decided to stay at home and eat cold pizza. I tried over and over to correct this problem. I ended up shooting several bullet holes in the CD. Basicly, the game just has to many glitches and is very poorly made. So, please do not waste your money on this game. There are much better ones out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth your time and money","review":"I've been a somewhat lukewarm fan of RTS games over the past few years in that I've played them, and enjoyed them more than most other genres, but never really felt compelled to complete them when I ran into difficulties.This game is different.It's at least as hard to get through as any other RTS I've ever played, but it's so involving that I'm willing to go back over and over again to complete the mission and go on to the next episode in the story. It's gritty, yet beautiful.The interface is not the easiest thing in the world to master, and I could suggest some improvements. Movement of ships over long distances can be a hassle. I didn't have too many problems with camera management, but in the chaos of battle I used the Pause function many times to try and sort out my forces. Playing this game does require some eye-hand-mouse coordination, more so than a lot of RTSs I've played.But I think the gameplay and storyline make it well worth those small few glitches."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Breath of Life for RTS","review":"This game got me interested in the RTS genre all over again. It is wonderful: full three dimensions of movement, a camera that's easy to use, beautifully-rendered ships and an engrossing storyline. The only strikes against it, in my view, are the near-identical ships of the playable races, and the lack of variety in Homeworld multiplayer missions.Still, this game is the first of the 3D RTS genre (or at least, the first to do it with any real style) and the yardstick by which all future comers will be measured - it's still a wonderful game."},{"rating":"2","title":"The One and Only","review":"The one and only Charmaine Clamor outdoes herself in her debut album, that only whets the appetite.

But it's almost charmless (except for the Canadian accents, which are pleasant). The characters have idiosyncracies, but they're not interesting. The plots are either downright dumb (as in title story) or so quickly sketched that it's sort of just starting by the time it's solved. It's nonviolent, inoffensive, and it passes the time, but just that."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"This knife holds an edge really well.

But its still a reliable knife though."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY disappointed!!!","review":"I find it rather odd that Amazon will not ship this knife to Colorado yet SOG will from their website. Just because state statutes regard a knife with a blade over 3.5\\" as a deadly weapon, Amazon finds this sufficient to be scared off from making knife shipments to this state? So am I to assume that kitchen cutlery is illegal in Colorado as well? Apparently we're only allowed to use paring knifes here because we can't handle anything larger. How about automobiles as people have been killed by them before too? Highly disappointed in Amazon being cowed by political correctness...This is not a review of the knife in any sort of way. I've had nothing but praise for the quality of work from SOG for years, I'm just very irritated with Amazon.

This is a wildly original and entertaining novel. Michael Guinzburg has a wonderful way with words and possesses an amazing imagination. He apparently has written only three books. I have also read Plumber of Souls, so it's two down and one to go.He committed a big error in the title, however. If you read the book, it makes total sense. However, for anyone who has not read the book, and is considering doing so, the title gives the powerful notion it's something you might find at a vendor stand at a Trekkie convention. Would be a good idea to reissue the novel under a different title.But let's not quibble. Wonderful piece of work. And let's pray he writes even more novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bukowski it ain't","review":"The story seemed promising enough at the beginning, but ultimately failed to deliver.

Among the topics that he covers are the FIDE conrtoversies of the mid 90's. Another one of the articles is a very interesting idea about what really happened in the first Karpov - Kasporov match. There is a long article about the KGB involvement in chess. This is a topic that still hasn't been completely explored. As a person who has studied Soviet History, I think that while many of his conclusions are valid, most Westerners have basic mis-understandings of what Soviet society was really like. There are also a couple of short biographies about famous and not so famous chess players."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right on!","review":"This book really is comforting. I didn't start it until about a month after my husband of only 8 1/2 months passed away, but now I'm reading it a second time around. It's uncanny how timely each day's reading has been. I'm ordering it now for a friend who was recently widowed. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME BOOK","review":"This book has helped me so much! I've let many friends borrow my copy and it's helped them too. The main part of this book that helped me the most was that it \\"allowed\\" me to feel... whatever I was feeling.

You can start it anytime. I started proper grieving for my grandfather 20 years later when my grandmother died. So I grieved for both at the same time.It's like a friend there with you everyday and comforts you. It doesn't take the pain away, doesn't even try, it says let the feelings happen.

It's beautiful to look at but a few important features were left out.There is no leg support, if your child wants to lay down for a nap, his little legs will have to dangle down.The way that the stroller reclines is by a cord, you need two hands to make the seat go into an upright position.It's not as lite as I thought it would be. It's definetly lighter than a Graco but its still heavier than comparable strollers.I have a Zooper stroller from my son who is now four. I have already replaced the seat and will just call to have the new tires sent. The zooper comes with a full leg cover and rain cover. The only thing I don't like about my 2001 Zooper is that the basket is so small, but I believe the newer models have easier access and bigger baskets.

Furthermore, the rubber cords used to fasten it onto the body look a bit flimsy to me.Now mind you this is a good costume for $30, but for $60, I feel very ripped off and a bit deceived about the weapons.

I was able to cut an entire grapefruit with an ordinary knife 80% faster than with this specialty knife.The blades become clogged with pulp, which is nearly impossible to clean from between the blades.A novel idea, but an impractical execution.My Amazon order simultaneously came with two paring knives which I feel were by far the value in my order and the way our home will cut grapefruit.

The lead character is more easily identified with, she may not be the most positive person, but she portrays any lethargic 18-year-old very well.

I was only able to spend 20 minutes with this snoozer of a show. Showtime let this show die for a good reason. Try six feet under instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny look at death (?)","review":"funny look at death, as if it's appropriate. anyhoo, I've heard about this show because we don't have showtime. I borrowed a friend's copy and liked it.Too bad that the show's creator left the show for creative reasons. He apparently had fought Showtime because they wanted the show to be more like 'Touched By An Angel' (happy endings, lesson learned, etc).After Bryan Fuller left, the storyline of George's father being Gay was completely changed among other things. You'll notice episode 1 when her father hugs the other guy in George's funeral. You'll also notice that after episode 5 or so the tone/direction of the show changed.anyhoo, the show is still good, funny. thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show!","review":"Original and very funny. The characters use pretty raunchy language so may not be appropriate for all ages. Totally engaging. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead Like Me","review":"We first saw this series while on vacation. We were so immersed we didn't want to stop watching! It really grabbed both of us; not just the unique story, you really love the characters right away. We did not see much of the first series on vacation-then recently we picked up watching it on the SciFi channel. It only took a few episodes before we decided we may as well own it; we bought both seasons. This is a show I can watch anytime, it's hard to stop-a lot like a really good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great series!","review":"My husband bought this series for me for my birthday, and I LOVE IT! I had never seen the show, and when he told me about it I was a little wary of it,b ut I gave it a shot anyway.This is without a doubt one of the funniest shows I have ever seen, and is definitely my favorite. The humor is so off key and sarcastic, but that's just what I like."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't be disappointed.","review":"This is one of those shows that you wish you would have known about sooner. You definitely won't be disappointed. Not only is the show well written and well acted, but it's also fresh and interesting.

Can't wait for more episodes."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing show!","review":"Clever, witty, and thought provoking.It brought me back to watching a series, my whole family and all my friends love it.A terrible shame that Showtime is cancelling this, I have the DVD set and am patiently waiting for the second season to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show!","review":"This was such a great show, and we were so sad to see it taken off the air.

Too smart for an America that elected George W. Bush."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I streamed this from Netflix, so it didn't cost anything, thank goodness. In my opinion, the creators of this show have failed to create characters that I care about. They are more like caricatures than real people. The only people I really like in this show are the mom and the sister of George, and they aren't on enough to make the show worth watching. 6 feet Under was such a great show, as are many of the other pay TV shows. This one just doesn't measure up to the usual calibre of cable shows I have become used to watching. I like the actors in the show, except for the lead. She reminds me of \\"Skipper\\" (as in Barbie's family). She has no personality, or maybe her personality is just uninteresting to me. If you must see for yourself, stream it from Netflix, try before you buy. Maybe you'll like it more than I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead like me series","review":"When I first started watching this series, I thought it may develop into a good regular. Unfortunately, it spinned into just another woman's soap opera that went nowhere, and had nowhere to go. The main character was not suited for her role. That's automatically a killer.... The concept is good, the implementation was a disaster, obviously that's why season 3 never happened...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts out with promise and fails to deliver","review":"I brought this movie based on the great reviews that it had received.The initial couple of episodes were interesting but as the series progressed, it was repetition without substance.Overall, the series had a cute concept but the writers /directors just didn't take it anywhere and by the end of the first-series, I promised myself that I would not invest in the second-season.At the end of the series, I no longer cared what happened to \\"George\\". She's going to be doing much the same activites, with most of the same people that were in the first season and I really don't care if they move on or stay where they were."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely boring series. Very large let down.","review":"The pilot episode was decent, and it certainly had great special effects. But I'm afraid that the plot line seemed to limp. The character Roxy was flacid. Rube seemed pretty good as a leader (middle mangagement). Mason has more potential, but sells out.The series drags along, and has no real momentum. The story lines are lousy, and the season finale was dreadfully pitiful. One of the later episodes in the first season is about the gravelings taking a day off, and the grim reapers having to file paperwork for the souls that have been taken over the time.-It seems like they were already running out of bad ideas, so they came up with another poor one. If anyone here agrees with me in the slightest, I advise to check out Nip/Tuck, or Sopranos, or Six Feet Under, Curb Your Enthusiasm, Seinfeld.-Guaranteed not to be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!","review":"I got hooked on this show watching it on the Sci-fi channel, but decided to get them on DVD so I could watch them whenever I want. I had no idea these shows were so edited to put them on regular cable television. Watching them as they were originally intended makes a huge difference.My husband and I are addicted to this show. Sadly, there are only two seasons, but every episode is high quality with excellent writing and acting. An excellent choice!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead Like Me - The Complete First Season","review":"I absolutely loved the first season of Dead Like Me. They casted the characters so well.

This is a truly addictive, smart and funny piece of television. Ellen Muth is doing an amazing job at portraying this lost, tormented, \\"lazy\\" girl who slowly discovers what life is all about.

However, as the season progressed I thought that the characters were fleshed out better (you learn more about the supporting cast's past) and there was even a storyline (rather than each episode being independent).Anyways, why four stars? Because it's entertaining, full of dry humor and the characters are human and imperfect...which makes it better then 95% of the shows out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another classic...","review":"This series will undoubtably become another one of showtimes magnificant series, ranking alongside of Stargate SG1.

It is about a young woman who dies and reluctantly becomes a Grimm Reaper, plus she has to hold down a day job. The plot and premise are great, but the really beauty of the show is in the characters and the acting. All the characters are interesting, funny, and very different. The great dialog is advanced even more by the acting, which is wonderful.

I guess I won't be watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This show is on of the great ones","review":"I don't know what to say that others or the product itself cannot say for itself. The show has great characters portrayed by the perfect actors and actresses, and it was over too soon.

I can't recommend this show enough to people. The good news is there's a second season that is almost as good as the first, the bad news is that Showtime cancelled the show and there will be no more episodes. Still, this show, particularly this season, is just a pleasure to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!","review":"If you are one of the few who gave this series only one star, I can see why. You really need to view this program with a grain of salt and an open mind. If you are being ultra critical or just plain not up for the idea of \\"grim reapers\\", then I can see the disappointment. \\"Dead Like Me\\" is great! The funny, ironic situations the characters get into are so clever. It is written well. The waffle haus is just fun, not stupid. The post-it's? that is unique, and there is the whole mystery behind the who gives the list. Oh, and the post-it's only come from Rube. He gets his list of deaths and then transfers them to all the others. Rube is so Mandy Patinkin--dry and witty, very \\"take it or leave it\\"--love him. And Mason is a just a quirky burn-out. Love the \\"drug search at the airport\\" and the \\"need sex\\" episodes! Anyway, it is a crying shame that they cancelled this series!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best shows i have ever seen","review":"i love this show so much. i will dedicate weekends to Dead Like Me marathons.

Even though it's filled with mostly 'gallows humor' storylines, it's intelligent, well written as well as really funny. You care about the characters and want to see them succed (even though they're by and large all dead). It's cathartic, too, in a society that so seldom deals in a straight foreward way with death. For anyone who thinks about the quality of life and death, both one's own as well as anyone we care about, this is a great series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead Like Me= Humorous , Poignant, and Very Entertaining !","review":"This is the story of a teenage girl whose philosophy on life is Not To Get Involved with Anything. It is only after her death that she learns to appreciate Life.In the first episode , she dies and comes back as an undead Grim Reaper which in this series are just those souls appointed to help the newly departed on their way to whatever there destination may be.But what made the stories so interesting is, that while doing her job as a Reaper she actually learns about life and to appreciate what she might have had in hers .The series is a Dramady : It has humor and drama.

Witty. Humane. Black humour. Great scripts. Unusual plots. Unpredictable. Quirky. Intelligent. Modern. It brings both laughter and, sometimes, a lump to your throat, or even a tear.

It reminds us we are all gonna die some day, so better see this while you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"One hit wonder","review":"I bought this (from REI, not Amazon) pedometer and was highly impressed the first time I used it. I loved being able to have pre-set radio stations instead of the typical scan feature on most of the FM pedometers. The signal was even pretty good for the radio throughout most of the first use.Then the second time I went to use it, the screen was blank & would not turn on. The batteries were brand new, and I had turned off the radio after the first use, so I the battery should have still had plenty of power left, but it would not work.Buy this at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made, overpriced","review":"Product bought on impulse for $22 at retail store. I would not have paid half that if I could see it for 5 min. Radio sound is mono with poor reception. Headphone plug is not the normal headphone jack size so you cannot plug your own headphones into it easily (you would need an adapter if you could find one). Right out of the box the display was malfunctioning and needs to be jiggled to work right. Battery compartments requires a screwdriver to get in and even the slightest bit of overtightening of the screw will crack the plastic eye that the screw passes through. Both battery compartents are frustratingly awkward to access. Controls are clunky, and the methods for setting things are obtuse. Battery drain on the AA's is absurd, draining fresh batteries in just a matter of hours. Belt clip is flimsy and I fully expect it to break in short order. Overall feel of the product tactilly is cheap. Avoid this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly one of the most candid and intimate insights of a band in recent times.","review":"Possibly one of the most candid and intimate insights of a band in recent times.Oasis were a band that comes along only every generation and touches millions on the way.

This is certainly not true of Oasis, but I wanted to know a bit, so I picked this up from a dollar store. It is not only boring and poorly written, it makes me hate the band even more. They are so morally reprehensible, with all this \\"look how working class we are\\" and \\"we're tough\\" crap, I think people in the UK have forgotten that the strength of British music is in innovation.

Sierra tech support is the most evil thing in the universe. But I digress. This game was awkward. The plot seemed weird and random, so that if you did one wrong thing you lost all your stuff and got in near-impossible fights. Also, the graphics were stiff and weird. For example, in combat, if you miss someone, your sword still plunges straight through the enemy. Overall, it lacks stability and quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anticlimactic.","review":"This has to be the most horribly produced game from Sierra I've ever played. The storyboard artists and creators must have been off their rocker. The graphics were pretty, the battles were somewhat exciting, but the delivery fell completely short. The combat and stats were horribly unbalanced, to the point where when I played the game the first time, I found it extremely difficult, and the second time I played it, it was a breeze just because I spent time levelling my characters up. The voice acting was mediocre. The story sounds promising in the beginning, especially with this series' reputation, but it finds itself to be completely anticlimactic in the end. So if you like pretty graphics and good music only in a game, pick this one up perhaps. But I'd rather just throw Lord of the Rings in my DVD player, because this is a sore excuse for a game or a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT HAPPY","review":"Wish I could write a review on Return to Krondor.But thats not what you sent me.

But that linear quality keeps the narrative tight and limits the boredom of talking to every peasant in a town in order to learn what you're supposed to do next. The visual style is, too me, more immersive than Baldur's Gate's tiny sprites (though I'm not knocking BG--it's great too). The combat system is subtle and requires tactical thought. Best of all, it plays well on a less-than-state-of-the-art machine. Ultima Ascension may be great, but I can't afford a new computer to play it."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's Better Out There","review":"I was expecting so much more from this game. I Betrayal at Antara was so much better. I bought RTK anticipating an even better experience. At first, I was pleased. The Gfx and Sfx are good. Moving about gets frustrating though since the controls are not intuitive and you quickly find yourself moving back and forth between screens. There are some instances where you simply can't see all of a screen at all. My biggest complaint though was that just as I was beginning to really get into the plot, the game ended! I was completely shocked. It was as if the developers simply reached a deadline and just ended the game. There were many loose ends regarding the plot. I wondered whether or not this meant another sequel is forthcoming. I won't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Talented pianist, but far too fast","review":"The songs on this album sounds like the person playing just wanted to show off how fast he/she could play them without regard for how fast they're supposed to be played.

The prose is lucid and poetic and flows evenly. A very good example of Romanticism tweaked and taken to the nth degree. Historic bible of misanthropes, misfits and today's darky gothy kid types. Typical arthouse fare. A must read for those who desire to become literate in the Modernist classics. The 'Natural Born Killers' of the Symbolist Poets. A work to savour, enjoy, and then throw in the trashbin. Or to let collect dust on the bookshelf, placed cover down, lest the reader be reminded of his exquisite culpability in sharing vicarious pleasure in Mal's anti-social exploits."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Music, Very Dissapointed","review":"I bought this dawn simulator250 mainly to wake-up with my favorite music with their advertised MP3 player.But lo and behold..... this very expensive almost $200 dollar radio/alarm/ etccouldn't handle a FAT 32 sim card.

But It's just that it cost to much money. I payed less for my external 200gb hard drive. So took away a star for that. Quick note: The price has gotten a lot better since it first came out though.

This suprised me as the Iowa concert is of the same year and is quite good. That said, this concert when it comes on is really blurry like 50's video, but just like those, when they move onto the stage it gets acceptable. The artists are the same, this one is 58 min. long with the songs being, in order, On Green Dolphin Street, Polka Dots and Moonbeams, and Tanya. The performance is fantastic, you will not be disappointed, unless you are expecting the exact original versions. As with all great artists, they can not do something the same way over and over, that is stagnation, believe me that is not jazz.

The pole features a sleek design which is adjustable to your height. It worked fine the first hike I went on, which was mostly on flat terrain around a lake. My second hike was through rockier terrain, but I was surprised when the bottom third of the pole suddenly snapped off at the joint. When I looked closely at the pole where it broke off, I noticed the break was irregular along the interior plastic, and that the pole was truly busted.I give the pole two stars (instead of one) because I found the handle quite comfortable, and the appearance good, considering how little I paid for the pole. I did not expect the pole to last forever, but I am frustrated that it broke after less than three hours of moderate use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little worth","review":"This short book, written from a Protestant fundamentalist view, reads like a collection of a few sermons, (certainly not academic!). The authors have a few good insights. For example, that the ecological crisis does not come from Christianity, but from modernity, but then, while praising medieval, traditional Christianity, they don't seem to see that this is contrary to Protestantism. Furthermore most the book rests on special pleading (not even solidly grounded, but using a citation here or there from other fellow protestants), some citations from the Biblical writings or some historical misunderstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mild but pleasant......","review":"I have managed to read some of the Biggles books when I was younger and this movie was very much like what I would have expected, a very tongue in cheek version of the written works.Only those who have been able to follow their adventures more fervently would be able to pick out the obvious flaws, but all in all, I had fun with it, even to see why a helicopter could outmatch a plane in the air.

Stannard has taken part of the topic penned by Alan Moorhead in \\"Fatal Impact\\" and analyzed specifically the impact that foreign contact had on the people and environment of the Hawaiian Islands. In spite of the thesis-spoken language of this book (indeed it is part of a larger scholarly work), any student of Hawaiian history would do well to wade through the information and conclusions that Dr. Stannard presents.If Dr. Stannard is correct in his projections of population sizes in Hawaii, pre-Western contact, the accidental and purposeful introduction of foreign disease wrought destruction of a scale not comprehended by most students of Pacific history. A careful read of this work is warranted and a careful reflection of his data and analysis will give the reader a more significant appreciation of Hawaii's history."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really liked this book!","review":"This was a great book because it appealed to every kind of reader. It had suspense, romance, violence (to a certain degree), and humor. At first when I started reading this book, I thought it was just going to be about some wrestler who has a hard time. However, the author really does a good job of putting you in the main characters place. She also used very descriptive words that gave you a mental picture of what was going on in the story. If I had to recommend one book I would recommend There's a Girl in my Hammerlock by Jerry Spinneli because I know it would entertain whatever style of reading that person had. The genre of this book was contemporary realism."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's a girl in my hammerlock","review":"I enjoyed this book and even went back to read it a few more times. This was a few years ago, and now I foud this site because I was looking for it again. I hope that every girl gets a chance to read this book at some point because it deals with the real consequenses of taking a risk. The main character is a strong girl who is able to stand the ridicule of her teamates and eventually earn their respect. The book is also about changing friendships.

The diagrams are exceptional and can assist anyone from the novice to the professional.

I work with a bunch of programmers (my peers) who are 20-30yrs old (I'm 40ish) - and I did find the book to be helpful in understanding a bit of their world view.I kept a dictionary handy while reading this book - and found as I looked up the words that I don't hear in every day conversation, there could have been a half-dozen more effective ways to make the same statement. (Okay, so my vocabulary got stretched a little <grin>)I did like how the author steps you through the case for Jesus' subversiveness (where's my dictionary?).

When I pointed out that it wasn't fair that we should pay the postage to return a broken item, the clerk agreed and told me that she would send my brother an email that included a postage stamp that he should glue on the package when he returned it.

This up to date map gives all the major suburbs and highways. Useful for outsiders.Note the inexorable spread of the perimeter. Once, suburbs like Bateman were at the southern edge of town. Now they are squarely in the interior. In fact, going south you can see suburbia marching towards Mandurah and Bunbury. Also take a look at how Yanchep to the north is coming within focus. And whereas once, decades ago, Freo was its own self, now it's just another suburb. Greater Perth is not one filled urban clot, yet, mind you.

A fledgling police officer with high aspirations, Lecoq struggles with rivalry and jealously within the police force as well as his own inexperience. Unlike much early detective fiction, this novel shows its sleuth in his humble beginnings, dramatizing the making of the detective. Lecoq's criminal past and status as policeman make him an interesting detective figure. Although the novel is a little lengthy, the pace is energetic. The twists and turns of the plot and the foibles of Lecoq and his assistant keep the reader engaged. Those who enjoy classic detective fiction and a good plot (and don't mind a lengthy read without closure), and who are interested in the stories that influenced writers such as Arthur Conan Doyle, will appreciate this early work."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i thought","review":"did you know there was other stuff out there?

There seems to be this awkward juxtaposition between the mystery story line and the personal story line which doesn't jive at all. I got the impression Lanyon wrote a novel about Adrien and then threw in murder just so it could be called a mystery. There are time line issues which, when you think about them, make you question \\"just how long ago did that happen?\\" Adrien, himself, is a problem. I didn't think he was very likable, everything seems to make him whine and complain. In fact, the only time he comes across as mildly pleasant is when he's had too much to drink. Of course, this may have been a prelude to issues in the fourth mystery, but at this point I don't really care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Anticipated Return of Lanyon's Work","review":"I have been waiting for Adrien English's return for several years. The publication of Josh Lanyon's newest book is possibly one of the most exciting ventures in the past few months.I reserve my review writing for those authors that I feel really reach out with their words and characters. Lanyon does this and more. The main character, Adrien, is engaging in his flaws and personality. He is a real person within those typed lines, engaged in a life that sometimes runs away from him, leaving him breathless to catch up. The simmering personal plots that run under the main mystery plot are as engaging as the puzzle of who-dun-it.I cannot wait for this book to finally arrive in my mailbox."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing like a good murder for Christmas","review":"Since another reviewer has already given everyone a good idea of the plot, I am not going to repeat it here. I'd say Christmas is definitely a good time to read this story. And if you're already an Adrien English mysteries fan, this revised 3rd instalment is unmissable.I'd say it's best one yet, even though I am heartbroken over some part of the story development, so be warned.This newly revised (steamier/erotically enhanced) edition is more than just \\"more sex\\". The newly added bits offer quite some pivotal points regarding Adrien & Jake's difficult relationship. And also shaded more lights on Jake's inner struggle.The mystery itself, needless to say, is tightly plotted and highly engrossing to read. To me, Lanyon's main attaction is always his charaters, the main and the supporting cast, all so well written, you just can't get enough of them.And of course, I am begging for 4th one to arrive soon.

Sure, there are the oddball exceptions, but why do we feel the need as a society to appeal to the crudest, most ill-mannered behaviors to attract readers?It is sad to see so many talented writers, this one included, make the choice that they need to include profanity and sexual references in order to sell to this demographic. The truth is there is an entire group of tweens/teens that would be reading their books if not for the unfortunate inclusion of, well, trash. While I hate to waste anything worth saving, Thirteen and The Fashion Disaster That Changed My Life will be joining a few other books at the bottom of our trash can where they belong, as in my opinion these books are not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not appropriate","review":"The concept of the book sounded good. It appeared that it would be humorous and a relatable story. I was offended that they assume that young girls are this raunchy and exposed to such inappropriateness. I simply do not understand why people choose to include such sexual content and language. Newsflash: everyone is not exposing their young girls to such filth. Why not bring your reader up a level instead of belittling them. I am mad at myself for not researching the book better before my daughter brought the book to me and said, \\"mom this isn't appropriate for me.\\" Seriously folks - just write for adults and you can say whatever you like!

Some of the things that were said to be inappropriate definitely caught me off guard, but they honestly don't bother me anymore. I hear worse things everyday. In my opinion, the appropriate age to read this book is 7th grade. The reason being is that the main character in the book is in 7th grade, and that it is the age where many kids start to mature. Overall, this was a very well-written and enjoyable book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This story could have been told very differently ...","review":"It is just too bad. After going through this book myself, I asked my wife to look at it. It was a no brainer - there was no WAY we were going to let our little girl read it. Cursing, explicit body parts, etc. I can't believe someone actually thinks this is appropriate for middle-school girls. I can see what the author was trying to accomplish, but the way the story was conveyed really leaves a lot to be desired. All the bad language and sexual subject matter could easily have been left out. There is simply too much of what is wrong, and not enough of what is right. I hope that in the future she decides to take a different path when she writes for young ladies. As a group they need something that inspires them and serves as a model for good behavior, not something like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks","review":"I got one of these mounts when I bought a used boom pole.

I don't have any problem to hook it up with 3 audio sources: one from my PC, one from my MP3 palyer, and one from my cellphone. I listen my music any where within my house (about 150 feets) without any problem. If I take it over 150 feets, there is a hissing sound. I give it 4 stars for this reason.

Except that I wanted to take them outside. The range is suppose to be 150 feet, but I guess that must be without any obstacles in its path. The receiver sensitivity is very poor so it does not take much to get hissing and popping noise similar to your FM car radio. This unit is a FM transmitter and receiver with a very poor sensitivity.

First off, the box was completely falling apart, with sharp pieces literally jutting from the sides. When I opened the box, many of the metal pieces were bent way out of shape (such as the bottom piece and the side shelf holders), making for a lopsided grill. In addition, the directions were not at all easy to understand (I have put together a few Weber grills in my day and never had any problems) and I highly recommend you don't drop a single screw/nut/washer, because they don't give you any extras.

The short poem-like chapters this books is written in are perfect for short attention spans and the book reads very quickly. The situation with the mother dying, the girl being separated from best friend and boy friend and going to live with mysterious father are good. I had trouble believing the whole Hollywood star father. If he made so many schlock movies where did the Oscar come from? I saw almost every twist a mile down the road. Don't people in LA bolt the bookcases to the wall? I have enjoyed other books written in poem form, but these seem particularly shallow. The novel True Believe is especially good. Read this book if you must, but I think there are better ones that you would enjoy more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christina Bald's review","review":"In \\" One of Those Hideous Books Where The Mother Dies.\\" There is a girl named Ruby who moved to LA,California. Her mother dies and she is forced to live with her father. She's upset because her aunt and uncle couldnt take her in. Ruby's father told her to come live with him. She left everything she'de ever known, ever loved. She finds out that her boyfriend Ray hooks up with her best friend Lizzy. Also that she has new problems, she begins to hate her mother for dying.I didnt really like this book because it doesnt really relate to me, in any way. Also, the way the book was written is very different than any other book I've ever read. This book didnt really want me to keep turning the pages, it made me want to shut it. The book sounded really good, just by the title and the front picture. Once I opened it, it wasnt as good as I thought it would have been. I didnt like this book also because comparing it to other book's I've read it just wasnt that interesting to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I can't believe there is not one review describing how utterly disappointing and predictable this book was. The poem format gave only a minimal plot and all the things that happened are just so cliche. The girl leaving town and asking ur best friend to watch your boyfriend. hmmm. let's just let our minds wander and come up with the same tired conclusion that the author did. Nothing surprised me and the whole story was just tired, cliched and horrible. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than I Thought","review":"This is the first book I've read from Sonya Sones but will definitely not be my last. I like to read young adult fiction from time to time because it helps me remember that I was a teen once and that many times you really get a raw deal during these years.From the title alone you know that Ruby has lost her mother but the character is not at all what I expected. Ruby has to move from the east to the west coast because her mother dies. The only lifelines to the east coast are Ruby's boyfriend and best friend, will their long distance relationship last? It's the way that the story is told in poems and e-mails that make it an interesting read. The story is cohesive even being written in this style that's becoming more and more popular.The ending with Ruby's father is a little predictable but heartfelt nonetheless. This is a great read that I encourage anyone to give a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun free-verse novel","review":"After her mother dies, Ruby is dragged 3,000 miles across the country to live with her father, whom she has only seen on the big screen. She has to leave her best friend, aunt, and best friend behind in Boston and go to L.A., where they give tickets for crossing the street. She is determined to give her father the cold shoulder-- after all, he did ignore her for fifteen years, but she befriends his assisstant, which is some comfort. Her new school is like the biggest game of charades ever, and she's not sure where she fits in, but it's certainly not in Dream Interpreting class, where she can never remember any of her dreams. It takes a natural disaster-- an earthquake, to be exact-- for Ruby to realize where, exactly, she fits in. This book, despite the title, is not at all hideous or sad. In true Sonya Sones style, it is funny, touching, and written in free verse."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story to touch your heart and your funny bone.","review":"When Ruby's mother dies, she flies across the U. S. to live with her movie star, scumbag father, who she's never met and who left her mother before Ruby was born. She leaves behind her best friend, Lizzie, and her boyfriend, Ray. She misses her mother, but Ruby's quirky sense of humor and her attitude keep this from being a sad story. Look for a lot of surprises along the way.

Great enough for me to track it down on this site just to give it a plug. The entertaining ideas are fresh and very do-able without a full-time staff like those required by other gurus such as M. Stewart. I rarely cook using recipes but found some in this book so intriguing that i actually made them. I found them to be concisely written and delicious.In regards to a review below referencing someones bad luck with a brownie recipe, all i can say is that I had no problem with them and they were as beautiful as they were scrumptious.

A lot of extras for family members though, which must be the ones rating this item with 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Young Things","review":"Jack Hill's Spider Baby (1964) is a genuinely creepy romp through the finals days of the Merrye family, complete with cannibalism and homicidal jailbait. The plot is fairly straightforward: family chauffeur Bruno (Lon Chaney, Jr. in one of his last and best roles) has taken on the guardianship of a trio of deranged \\"children\\". He tries to protect his wards from their own psychotic tendencies, and from the grasping relatives who try to make a profit from the children's tragic dementia, but ultimately it proves too much for him. It's a wickedly delightful film, full of surprises."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pre-Human Condition of Savagery & Cannibalism","review":"Here's a story of one messed up family, afflicted by a genetic condition that gradually deteriorates the mind and reverts the afflicted to a savage state, behold the Merrye Syndrome. \\"The unfortunate result of inbreeding.\\"Now this movie isn't exactly gore driven, it's more of an eerie creeper that implies alot with out actually showing. Which might anger some of the sadists out there. But it works pretty darn well. The cast is really good, especially Sid Haig. This movie is an obvious precursor to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre which should make people want to see it. Besides it has Lon Chaney Jr. in it.

Watch out for the ending!"},{"rating":"2","title":"B-Movie That deserves a remake","review":"This movie has been a summer party classic around my place for 12 years now. My wife really doesn't like B Movies, but stayed awake for this one. While it has flaws, I think that you can enjoy it in either an ironic way or as a true B Movie sci-fi/horror enthusiast. My advice for you to really enjoy it would be to fire up the grill on a hot July night, have a few beers with your friends and then, after the sun goes down and everyone is tipsy, throw this at them. Soon enough, they will understand. Then, repeat the procedure next year.Honestly, this is in my B Movie top 10. (Along with classics like The Giant Gila Monster and Killer Shrews. The back story is unique and the movie could be great if it was remade with a budget above the $16 they had to make this version."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOW BUDGET GEM!","review":"This 60s era low budget horror flick is a fun film. Despite a really nasty opening that I can only describe as overly cruel, the film quickly settles into a groove of dark, campy humor from which it never deviates. Most of the performances are top-notch, especially by Lon Chaney, Jr. who turns in an exceptionally funny turn as the family retainer. All in all, your money is well spent on this dvd, which features a lost scene with Chaney not included in most prints of the movie. Well worth the cost, and a lot of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"double-distilled pure purple psychotronica!","review":"This is an unashamedly crazy little movie that's lots of fun to watch. The title doesn't lie: This is the craziest story I've ever seen on film. And what a lineup: Lon Chaney Jr. in what may be the best role of his career; comic relief veteran Mantan Moreland; Carol \\"House on Haunted Hill\\" Ohmart (who feels compelled to model lingerie in a haunted house); Mary \\"Dementia 13\\" Michel; Sid Haig as the \\"big kid\\" Ralph; and the girls \\"Virginia\\" and \\"Elizabeth\\" -- never was degenerative disease so appetizing!

From the very first shot of Stacee Jaxx (Tom Cruise) emerging out of bed to the final song that included the entire cast I LOVED IT! I have been waiting for this movie to finally hit blu ray so I can watch it again. This movie is funny, quirky, shocking, and exciting.

Took out all the amusing and good parts from the original musical and left a mediocre shell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"The best part of the movie was the final credits. All 3 of us who watched it couldn't figure out why this movie bombed with so many stars. The acting was bad and the singing was worse. My bluray player is going through detox after last night's screening."},{"rating":"1","title":"the good music elevates this movie to 1 star","review":"the music is great; tom cruise was funny. the movie itself was not worth the price. overall download was easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your typical musical.","review":"My husband hates musicals and shows like Glee but he loved this movie. Growing up in the '80's made this movie really fun to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"nostalgic","review":"I had been dying to see this movie, and it did make me feel nostalgic, as I was in college during this time. Russell Brand is especially funny, but the ending's a bit corny."},{"rating":"1","title":"bored stiff as a rock","review":"I heard so many great things about the musical on Broadway that I had higher expectations for the movie. This is classic example of when a play / live show does NOT translate to the big screen. The music was tolerable but it felt like everyone was \\"calling in\\" their performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"could have been better!","review":"I though this movie could have been better. I don't know why i expected so much from it but, i did and now im disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad,very bad","review":"This movie was so bad I couldn't finish watching it. I was really disappointed because Alec Baldwin cracks me up, but it was so bad I didn't laugh at any of it. It just sucked!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This was one of the worst movies I have seen this year. Tom Cruise was excellent in it, and he was the most enjoyable part of it all. Other than that, I couldn't believe what I was watching and that someone actually green lit this film. Horrible! I would definitely not recommend, even if it's free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted less of a musical","review":"Loved the classic rock but would have enjoyed stage performances from the headliners instead of using the music as communication between characters, ugh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock of ages rocks!!","review":"The story line was OK,along with the acting. Tom Cruise was very good. The cast is excellant. The music is great and makes the movie worth watching.The vocals are amazing !I am glad I purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the music, but...","review":"Maybe it's Hollywood. Maybe it's the glitz of film musicals. Maybe it's Tom Cruise. Whatever the 'it' is, I quit looking at it 2/3 through. There are people who love to see musicals in the cinema. There are people who don't. I am in the latter group. On stage and live makes musical theater, musical theater. (The only musical I ever enjoyed on film was The King and I.) Hollywood is too slick. The people are too pretty. And far too often their personalities overwhelm characters they portray. I wasn't looking at the character Brand was supposed to be, I was looking at Russell Brand. He acted like the Russell Brand I see when David Letterman interviews him. Who was Brand in the film anyway?Why did I watch? I love the music. Just close your eyes and listen. I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fot me","review":"If you like late 80's early 90's rock or the dream of being a rock star. You would enjoy this movie. But it was not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was not expecting a musical!","review":"Ok, maybe it's my fault. I guess I didn't pay enough attention to the trailers. But I never noticed that this movie was going to be full of people singing songs throughout! And yes, I knew it was \\"based on\\" an actual musical. Anyway, I was really excited to watch this movie, given all the great celebrities in it. I even made my husband watch it with me. Now I need to figure out how to give him those two hours back that he wasted watching this with me. I'm in trouble! LOL. The stars are still great, and the music is actually pretty good - love the 80's! But it was not what I was expecting, hence the 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"No plot, bad acting.","review":"We really wanted to see this in the theater, but it was pulled before we got a chance. It came to video pretty quickly, so we decided to rent it. We had high hopes. They were crushed. We liked it for the music, but the acting was horrible. The plot is non-existant.So instead of wasting your time on the movie, just buy the soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, and not in the good way.","review":"I had high hopes for this movie but it was terrible with a combination of mediocre acting, less than mediocre singing, a story line a 13 year old could have written, all wrapped up in an annoying package...and I was around and enjoing the rock scene in the 80's. What a disappointment, skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Movie Ever Made?","review":"Horrible! Misogynistic! Terrible, terrible writing, god-awful acting except for Tom Cruise. He was wonderful. A delight to watch and to hear sing. He's the only one worth seeing in this movie. The absolute worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"All I will say is if that was Tom really singing he has a great voice. The movie was horrible in my opinion. I hate Musicals."},{"rating":"1","title":"see the show!","review":"See the show! I don't know what everyone raved about this, some of the music was great ( my generation), but frankly, I fell asleep. Tom Cruise is not one of my Fav's!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"there really isnt much to say other than this is a bad movie and not very entertaining. Tom Crusi is basically wasted in this movie. However one redeeming quality is the songs. When they are singing it's great. When they start talking just fast forward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I watched this movie just because Tom Cruise was appearing in it. My wife and I wanted to turn it off after the first 5 mins. We were thinking that this was going to be a movie similiar to Grease. But it seemed like this movie was just a long music video. So we ended up finishing the movie by fast forwarding it to the parts with Cruise. If this was the last movie on earth I would burn it just to entertain my self with the flames."},{"rating":"1","title":"wasted $4.99","review":"Awful, awful, awful. Love that era and the music but this was not watchable. I was in my early 20's during this period and I can say there was not 1 realistic moment in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Even the lip syncing was off. Not worth the time, much less the money. Should have, could have been a fun classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A New Low","review":"This is the last nail in the coffin of rock and roll. It is a conglomeration of rock and roll cliches that were overpublicized to begin with, and in this film, they are pushed beyond the outer limits of parody. It's just weird. The younger generation doesn't understand rock and roll. This is more like the spangled glitz of Xanadu."},{"rating":"1","title":"loved the play","review":"hated the lip-synced, badly acted, changed plot, that was this movie. What a waste. Russell was bad. Tom C was in a stupor. Good music didn't make it to the screen. This review is more effort than this one deserved."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible movie","review":"this movie runined so many good song.. the plot was horrible, and for alot of well known actors it in.. i was mighty disappointed.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to the hype.","review":"Very disappointed in this movie. Storyline was dull, acting mediocre at best.A waste of Tom Cruise' talents. I was at the very least hoping for good music, but that did not happen either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rock of Ages","review":"Funny movie, but was not impressed. good for mindless entertainment only. Would not recommend unless there was nothing better to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love musicals, just not this one","review":"This musical did not hold my attention. The performances were great, the story was lousy, and the mix of the two just left me feeling ambivalent."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible, pass on rock of ages","review":"bad movie, tom cruise was awesome though. the lead-female was not very good. the British actor (katy p's X) dog crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful movie with great music and wonderful comedy.","review":"Enjoyed watching the movie again. I saw it in the theater and then went to the music theater production. Wonderful music and so many laughs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this supposed to be a comedy?","review":"Ouch! Is all I can say. I lost my movie picking privileges with my husband after choosing this one. This movie was so cheesy and painful to the ears, that I thought maybe they meant for it to be a parody of the broadway show. Russel Brandt and Alec Baldwin need to stick with comedy and stay out of the recording booth. I'm surprised to say that the best part of the movie wasTom Cruise, who put on a fantastic performance and can actually sing.Looks like it's all action and sports movies for me for awhile. Thanks Rock of Ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie","review":"It just wasn't what I expected. I did love every song that they sang though. I wasn't expecting a musical."},{"rating":"2","title":"We really enjoyed this","review":"I usually don't like it when Hollywood converts a book/show/whatever into a movie. Wow! They did an amazing job. The casting is right on point. Most memorable is Tom Cruise is incredible as Stacee Jaxx the \\"infamous\\" rock star of the movie. He totally pulls off playing a character that is probably 20 years younger than he really is. Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand - perfect. Obviously, changes from the original Broadway Show story line and different songs performed/not performed. The \\"mash-ups\\" really worked. This is what happens when you take something else and make it your own. I thought this was \\"right on.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"It was okay","review":"I think this movie was over rated. I guess we were expecting at least some of the real band members to appear in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Only 2 reasons to see it, if any: Baldwin & Cruise. The rest -- zip. Hangs together only cause it's all put in one movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie for an eighties child...","review":"The song selection and performance were top notch. I didn't know Tom Cruise could sing! This movie is definitely going to move into my top ten."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Foreigner! (Sarcasm)","review":"Let's take a Broadway show, which already features too much Foreigner (and I love foreigner), and turn it into a movie in which main stream actors do terrible jobs at lip-syncing. And stop ruining Foreigner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hated it,","review":"this was very stupid movie. I wouldn't waste my time. We eventually turned it off. Was star packed, but dumb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say Cheesy?","review":"I know this was supposed to be campy but it really was hard to get through. Julianne Hough has a great voice and I like her. The acting was good but the script and all the rest blew what this could have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"Please don't waste your time or money on this. I was eager to see it after viewing the trailers in theaters, but (very fortunately) did not get to it in time in theaters. But I was very disapppointed in the film. Too bad. I like many of the actors in it and the director as well. It's just awful. So glad I only wasted the money on a streaming rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"sucked","review":"Recently saw the stage version and it was soooooo much better. Some of the changes made in the Movie made sense but most of the changes to the characters themselves were stuuuuupid! Bummer too because the music is so much fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame...","review":"Well...it's not what I thought it would be. I thought the entire thing was a joke. I wasn't expecting a serious movie, but I wasn't expecting what I got either. I thought this film wasted a lot of talent from the cast and I really think it was poorly done. Kind of sad that I wasted $4 renting it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst ever","review":"I couldn't take it. I turned this movie off.It was horrible. I will never get the time that I did waste watching it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny weird","review":"At 18 in '87 the music was a trip down memory lane. So was the hair and clothes LOL. Have fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"The music was the ONLY reason I made it just over halfway through. It was so bad I couldn't finish it. The memories of the music just couldn't get me through."},{"rating":"1","title":"80's Grease","review":"Gave it one star because I like the music. Wait for it to come out free on cable. Not worth the money to rent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rockin' Rock of Ages","review":"This is one of the best musicals I've seen! Very excellent parody of 80's rock!! I'm glad I finally got to see it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"rock of ages...ok","review":"it was ok. expected more. i liked the songs/music best. it seemed to drag on too long. the theme has been done before....over & over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh no, this is a musical?!?!?","review":"About five minutes into this, my wife and I realized this was a musical. We sat there in shock looking at each other like \\"Is this really happening? Is this a musical?\\" We hate musicals. We made it through about ten minutes of it before we said no way, we can't watch this. Kinda disappointing, as we heard such great things about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"For a musical...","review":"I was REALLY looking forward to this movie, then heard friends say \\"it's a little much, even for a musical\\" so I kept putting it off. I'm so glad I finally got around to it renting it. Julianne Hough is so damn cute, and all the stars delivered! The cameo's were great, and as much as I think Tom Cruise is a puke, he really REALLY did a great job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music","review":"Don't watch this for the storyline, but for the great music performances and the 80's glitter rock ambiance. The acting is fun to watch...even Russell Brand was able to stay somewhat normal!
