The one above the garage door has caused me the most problem. At first it seemed it was always on at night. The light on the left as you face it burned out. The one on the right was OK. I had the light bulb replaced and a couple of weeks later it burned out again. The right one is still OK. I am not sure what sets this light off. I have tried adjusting it and it still seems to be on most of the time. The other three lights do not seem to be as unpredictable, but in general I have problems with the lights staying on or coming on for no reason.

The only time it activates is when it's in the test mode and thats only for a few seconds.I have done all the trouble shooting tips in the manual but nothing works. The light has its own 15amp circuit/breaker, it's wired correctly and is mounted at approx. 8\\"6\\" from the ground.

The neoyorkino feel for all these flavors is evident, and they seem just as strong with any of the styles. My favorites include 'Angeles', 'Gotcha'. 'A Veces Me Pregunto', and 'Eres Mi Vida'. Fraga's raps flow seamlessly on that last track, and Huey and James always show and prove. Plus I think it's dope that they're bringing Chika and Cyndi to the forefront as well, letting them show skills.

The large buzz shears that I normally use are cumbersome and have way too many attachements.I like the 'Just A Trim' because it's easy to handle, portable, and has just the attachements that I need.The only downfalls that I see in the product is that it needs to be lubricated occasionally (with a silicone lubricant, or, WD40) and it also needs to be cleaned often (with the little brush that's supplied).I doubt this tool would work well with longer hair, but with shorter hair, it works great.

You could easily have the children relate this to their own families, and integrate an activity in which the students make their own patch and write a story about it.The only downfall is that younger students may find this story a little slow or confusing, as it deals with the sickness of a Grandmother, and may be a touchy subject.

I don't really use the 14 second (or so) of video mode as there is no sound and such a low time limit.On my pc, I run \\"XP\\" and have had no problems with the driver or the picture software. I've had it for seven months and have since bought a $100 digital camera.

Every track held attention. I was constantly suprised at the diversness and fluidity of the music. Lots of stringed instruments, oddest being ukulele create a delicate backdrop for the CD. I'd compare ni Donovan's vocals a bit of Enya mixed with Elizabeth Fraser of Cocteau Twins and Suzanne Vega. Lacking a lyric sheet, the lyrics I could make out seemed enigmatic and personal. Excellent introspective bedtime or reading music.

Some famous performances include Hank Williams, Johnny Cash, Elvis Presely, Jimmy Reeves, etc.Even if you don't appreciate for the music's sake, this collection represents an important period in the development of American music.

I am sure that there would have been many that would like to put the record straight after 25 years. The author is relying too much on press articles and passenger interviews while the official inquiry results of the Dutch Shipping Inspectorate are barely mentioned The book is also full of inaccuracies as to emergency operations on board a passenger ship.For those readers interested in the disaster and rescue efforts as seen through the eyes of the rescue organizations involved, this book will be very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cruise Ship Prinsendam","review":"A very interesting tale of disaster at sea.

I think there were 2-3 lines in the book talking about him. Yes, I know this is about Brian but when the author gave a background check on the Beach Boys it seemed like David was left out. This book is really interesting and I think it shows Brian perfectly at every stage in life. Sad how he gets treated most of the time, but he always comes back. Next I will read up on Dennis, but this book is simply amazing.

Neither the Palestinian Authority nor the State of Israel escape responsibilty for the present impasse and inevitably some of the criticisms of recent actions by the Israeli government have raised hackles in Academe especially in the US where any criticism of the Jewish State arouses ire in certain quarters-the first review above is a classic example of this phenomenon.

I have about 60 excercise videos and I would say this rates in the bottom 2. The instructor explains a few of the basics badly and then rushes into a confusing dance routine that only a practiced dancer could follow. So who is this DVD for? Not for dancers who don't need to learn this. Not for those like me and I bet most average people who can't follow it. This isn't easy to follow, has no warm up, thus probably could give one a bad back or a knee injury. If you enjoy dancing for fun like I do this is not the tape for you. It is like the humiliation you would suffer if you signed up for a dance class for dancers and aren't one. Don't fall for the instructor's winning and relaxed smile on the cover of the DVD package. She doesn't care if you can follow her routine. Even the people on the tape with her are all doing different routines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good.","review":"This was the worst dance DVD I have ever had. The moves are confusing and she does not explain them. Far from getting a good workout and feeling cool about dancing (as I usually do) I mostly just felt spastic.

I'm returning this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"The warm-ups for each section (jazz, latin, and hip hop) are the best parts of this video.

I've given it a few tries, but I don't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too confusing","review":"I love most products by Gaiam, but this is not one of my favorites. It is too hard to keep up with. The instructor will add moves without careful explanation, or sometimes without explaining it at all. Alot of the moves are instructed with the wrong side of the body, and because there is never a rear view of the dancers or even a side view, it is hard to tell what the move is supposed to look like in full. I have a kickboxing DVD with this same instructor and it is wonderful. It is much easier to keep up with, but this dance video was a let down. The base moves are really easy, but the combos are really complicated. I just do the base moves for all three."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Came quickly and in good condition.

I found The Phase Plan: Base Your Life on the Alpha, Delta, Omega System and Banish Dieting for Good by Dr. Lola Greene (ASIN 0972165363) more realistic as it was based on individual differences in what foods to eat instead of a flat 40-20-40 division of food content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Curves On The Go","review":"This book is very helpful and it is a companion to the Curves Book(which I already have).

The program, in my opinion, is for the beginner/shy execiser. It is not a challenging routine because you are allowed only 30 seconds to utilize each hydraulic machine. According to certified exercise experts (and general knowledge) this is hardly enough time to fatigue the muscle you are targeting. Another set back is that you cannot determine how much weight your body can take. The machines are preset, which means as your body becomes stronger you cannot add any additional weight. You have only 30 seconds to utilize each machine and the musical recording tells you when to switch. At that point, you do your own light cardio. I think it is a great idea for those who are not used to a challenging workout.

This was mostly predictable if you have any experience with prior Disney compilations.The real problem with this video is the LONG and MANDATORY preview section. On a tape you can fast forward through the commercials but Disney has chosen to embed them in the protected area of the disc that forces the viewer to see them all at 1X speed EVERY TIME you want to watch the video. Disney charges full price for this disc, around [amt], so this intrusion is unacceptable.I wanted to spend some time with my young daughter watching a cartoon video but by the time the feature started we were both in a sour mood.This is my first Disney DVD.

Basically, the Disney characters just walk by to get to their seats or are shown as part of an audience who come to Mickey's house to watch him entertain them.

Sure I can skip to the good stuff but I shouldn't have to!Kids might enjoy this, though, because it has many characters featured, even if just for a glance. For other Mickey fans: get the \\"Walt Disney Treasure: Mickey Mouse in Living Color\\" DVD set, that looks much more promising... wait until Christmas Carol is featured by itself (maybe with the making of.. or some other special features). Do NOT buy this only for M's CC because the rest is annoying and of poor quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don&#65533;t waste your money!","review":"Absolutely disappointing!!! If you want to make a Christmas surprise for your little one forget this expensive DVD. Mickey Mouse and all his pals (old and new) are meeting at the House of Mouse and spending time on uninteresting conversations, unimpressive gags, and non-catchy songs. There are four cartoons interjected in Ricky Lake-like show. \\"Donald Duck\\" skating lesson and Mickey Mouse Christmas tree picking are classics and worthy of watching but they are only 5 minutes each. The only feature on this DVD my three-year old was salivating was the story of Scrooge with Donald Duck, Mickey Mouse and Goofy. But do you really want to spend over (dollar amount) for 25 minutes worth of cartoons? I grew up on Disney cartoons and I am initiating my daughter to Disney, but this is simply a rip-off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY THIS VIDEO OR DVD!","review":"Not only was it very corny, but I expected to see alot of characters from my favorite Disney classics. Instead, Disney went and put a compilation of christmas shorts including the short story, \\"Mickeys' Christmas Carol\\", and rolled 'em all up into the \\"new\\" \\"MICKEYS MAGICAL CHRISTMAS\\". Its so OBVIOUS The Disney co. is going downhill with (aweful) movies like Atlantis, the Emperors New Groove, etc. Are they running out of ideas??? Look at the (aweful) \\"direct to video\\" sequals theyve made. Disney should just leave the great memory we have of their greatest classics, and leave 'em alone. When they make these \\"direct to video\\" sequals, they do nothing but leave a very bad taste in my mouth. The Little Mermaid 2 was a bomb. The worst! But anyways.....Please save your money from purchasing this video. I wish I did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Viewing All Year Through","review":"I bought this movie and enjoyed it a great deal. My granddaughter liked it (age 2).

Of course perhaps the target audience is the big pants crowd from Ohio, and I suspect so.

Both were acquired at a local thrift store which I frequent. The Jehovah's Witnesses use this book as a basic apologetic resource. From within its pages, the average Witness will find the logic path and scriptural proof texts for many of the standard arguments which they will encounter as they do their door-to-door ministry. Sometimes, the logic path this book uses is sheer beauty in its simplicity. Other times, it is down right ugly in the torturous use of scripture. Generally, the arguments fall somewhere in between. No matter where in the spectrum it falls, I find their apologetic explanations both fun and fascinating. Perhaps, you will as well. I encourage you to pick up a copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"JW's gameplan to deceive you","review":"I have a copy of this and was reading it last night to see how the JW's who come to your door will twist your honest questions around and try to deceive you. That is called their Theocratic Warfare Strategy and lying is rationalized. This book doesn't even mention anything about the gospel of Jesus Christ. Refer to 1 Cor 15, and Gal 1:6 and you'll see that they teach a different gospel entirely according to their own book. I recommend that Christians get the book if they want to be a strong apologist and reading the other team's playbook gets you a head start."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 AUTRY CLASSICS!","review":"This is a review for the dvd as pictured which is presented by MOVIE VENTURES.

The central message of Christianity and the Bible is the cross of Jesus Christ. The central event in history is the cross of Jesus Christ. Without the cross you have no gospel and you have no Christianity. So why would a respected Christian publisher like Thomas Nelson omit the story of the cross in this Bible? I am dumbfounded. This Bible does contain the account of Jesus' resurrection, but without the cross there is no context in which to understand the resurrection. My children will not be reading this cross-less Bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I purchased this book to introduce our children to reading the Bible on his/her own. I really like the format of the book. It has a theme verse, uses Bible verses to tell the stories and concludes with questions. However, when looking through the book, one thing stood out to me. The story of the cross is not included. It tells the stories of the Last Supper and the resurrection only. It also does not include the story of the Passover and Abraham and Isaac. It contains such stories as Josiah and Nebuchadnezzar eating grass. The story of the cross is the heart of the Gospel. This is why I have given the book a low rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Cross?","review":"We love this Bible because 1) it uses actual scripture instead of the storybook paraphrasing that many of the children's Bible's use, 2) there is a memory verse at the beginning of each story, 3) the illustrations are very nicely done and help illustrate the story so that our children stay engaged, 4) there are good discussion questions at the end of each story. BUT I have to give this a low rating because the most important story--the Cross, the central message of the gospel--is missing! Why would they leave that passage out?I'd love to see a second edition of this book with that story included. I would give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I called Sony and explained that my laptop was running through a battery before I could complete my workload.

Its amazing how much i got into some of these races. Not a good game for someone with a bad temper as you'll ocassionaly find yourself getting beat in the last 5 feet of the second leg of an end boss race. There is nothing more disappointing than have that happen to you several times in a row. However, the intensity of this game is great. I really got into it. At time i felt like it was almost impossible to control certain levels well, however with enough practice you'll get it. Just don't buy cars that are low in handling. Overall handling will win you many more races than high speed. I never once touched the nunchuck on this game and i beat it in probably less than 20 hours of play.. The steering is tough at times but its manageable, and probably a lot better than your average controller or joystick. Great game overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.","review":"This game is absolutely littered with ads! They are not only on the billboards you go by, you get \\"text messages\\" from T-Mobile. The story line is OK. The controls are clunky, unless you hold the A button while turning you won't be able to go around sharp curves (the oversteer control). If you turn the wheel too far while going around it will sometimes reset to 12 o'clock while your controller is still angled to turn. Without invoking the oversteer control the wheel will only turn from about 10-2 o'clock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic experience... playing nfs on wii is really bad.","review":"i just got the game and played one night with it.

Don't rely on the reviews that panned it--the default controls make the game arguably more fun than burnout 4.It's pretty straightforward--turn the remote left to go left and right to go right. If you're a flailing maniac and you don't have the coordination to handle the remote like a steering wheel then you may want to try another game.The only use for the alternate control schemes is on the drift tracks, otherwise stick with the default control until you get it.

There is a lot more depth here as compared to \\"Excite Truck\\", which is fun in its own, but not deep at all.

They will turn out to be creative and independent thinkers. But the emphasis of the book is typical of Arnold: reverence for the child and the childlike spirit.

If you are too mechanical, i.e. thinking too much, someone will figure you out, and in poker, and described in these type of books, requires almost instaneous reaction, or live with the consequences.This book is a mandatory read for one who intends on being successful at poker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another useless poker book","review":"I have bought them all, none would teach you anything you wouldn't learn at the tables and if you aren't are the tables there is no good for any poker book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book of Bluffs","review":"Anyone can win with good cards that hold up.

Wish they were longer. Good action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than I Expected","review":"Let me start off by saying that after the first two seasons of Smallville I was no longer a Kristin Kreuk fan. I got where I absolutely despised her as Lana Lang. She was so weak and whiney and even after she toughened up in later episodes, I did not find it very believable. So when I caught wind that she would be the star of Beauty and the Beast, my heart faltered. Even so, I love a good Beauty and Beast story so I couldn't pass trying this out. I give it a rating of not too shabby. I like the spin on how the fellow became Beast. I'm ready for the next episode to see how the story progresses. I found our lovely heroine portrayed as a DETECTIVE a bit far fetched. Even so, I didn't hate Kreuk in this new role.

Come on. It's hard enough accepting the premise that every cop in the precinct--male or female--is drop-dead gorgeous, but that some chick weighing no more than a fistful of feathers can be sucker-punched by someone she has no reason to suspect, right out of the blue, and come back like Bruce Lee calls for way to much belief-suspension. I might give it a couple more views, but if the pilot is the best they can do, then I'll pass on the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The show started out well. It had a lot of promise, but then it cut to 10 years later, and that is where it lost me. The acting was not believable. There was a lot of tough girl attitude that the actors in this show didn't pull off. The first five minutes or so were great, though. They really held my interest, and made me think, wow this show could actually be really good. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the original television series","review":"It's alright.

Remakes seem to be the way of life in Hollywood nowadays. So when I heard there was going to be a reboot of a series my mother used to love and I used to watch with her because I was 10 and lion-faced guys were awesome, I made a mental note to watch it when it came out.I think I made a mistake. It was nothing like the original with a few name exceptions, and seemed to be geared more for the Twilight crowd than anyone who may have liked the original show.Rename it, and I probably wouldn't think it was so bad. But it definitely wasn't worth the time I spent watching it.

Written with humor and a unique perspective, Lanza's book explores the cocktail culture and its influence on America. From James Bond to Hugh Hefner, Elizabeth Taylor to the Rat Pack, this book charts how cocktails have influenced everything from politics to popular songs. Learn about Atomic Cocktails, see a Human Cocktail Shaker, and puzzle over Girl Drinks. For drinkers and tee-totalers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great subway reading","review":"While this book is interesting to read, written in a prose style that keeps one reading, and flows logically through a wonderful historical framework, I felt at the end of every chapter that the author should have done a more thorough job. He should have developed his theses more, provided more depth to his topics, and offered information that is less general and more useful. This is an excellent introduction to the history of cocktails and drinking in the United States, but as a useful research tool, \\"The Cocktail\\" is of little value. But, as a strong point, I doubt that there are historical errors in the book - Lanza did do some research, that much is certain. But I still have the inclination that Lanza wanted to get another book in print without having to strain too hard writing it. I give this book two stars under the assumption that two stars means \\"okay reading for the subway\\", and one star ratings are solely for romance novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wordy and obtuse, Mr. Lanza's book is a big disappointment.","review":"I bought this book thinking it would be a fun look at how social drinking has influenced and shaped our society.

My first pipe had the G reed stuck so it made no sound. I called the vendor and they sent me another one. It is OK, has a little rattle at A, and is a little quiet on G, but it is passable.I ended up grabbing my electronic tuner from my cello and I use that to tune my ukulele.All in all, not my most favorite purchase, but better than a sharp stick in the eye."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tuning for Dummies","review":"I bought this ukulele pitchpipe to replace tuning it using my cheap electronic tuning device. The electronic tuning was never accurate enough and also a bit uncertain. I have always used a pitchpipe so I wanted to go back to this effective and simple method. It works as advertized and never disappoints. Do not blow too hard, as this could impact the pipes reeds. Also, do not wash this in HOT water... if you must clean, use a mild dish soap and cold water, shake out excess and let air dry.

The first segment is a seated flow that focuses on building core strength. It is a stand-alone segment that leaves you feeling relaxed. The pacing is quick enough that you stay engagedI typically practice a standing flow but enjoyed the change in staying grounded. The second segment is good for days when you are looking to unwind but don't have much energy to spare.

Part 2 all the games were Ok and some of them were fun. In the 3rd part the first level is not difficult but boring. The second level in part 3 is soooooo dificult (and if I say difficult I mean difficult), I think it's impossible. And because I didn't make the the second game in the 3rd part (there are only 3 parts)I coudn't play the third game (wich is the last game in part 3, because you have to finish the game befor you can go to the next game)and that sucks.Anyway I just gave this Lizzie game 2 points in all because some of the games were kind of fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinky","review":"This game is the worst game I beat it in one night and there is only 3 levels I wouldn't have spent $30 on it if I knew how much the game stunk.

Not only do I like the cartoon, but I also have never seen such a restored copy of it!Speaking of restoration, the company that released this DVD is a public domain associate, so don't expect the same PROFESSIONAL refurbishment as you would with such collections as the LTGC or Chronological Donald Duck sets- don't get me wrong, though- most of the cartoons look great, while some are poor or average with fading, spots or lines.Overall, I recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"no room for mouse or cords","review":"I like that it is hard shelled with a soft cover, but it has no room for a mouse or the cords.

The Dwarves are a weird band that knows how to push people's buttons and aren't afraid of trying things that may alienate their own fans. For me, this album does a lot of good things. There are some elements of hip hop, still with a lot of the old \\"blood guts and pussy\\" attitude that you have come to love about the band. This album makes me feel good when I'm driving around, and its good for listening to multiple times. You get catchy poppy punk tunes like \\"Runaway #2\\" and \\"Salt Lake City\\" and some more 'unique' songs like FEFU and \\"relentless\\" that are still badass tunes, but again, not traditional punk.I think this is a great record from a great band, not a total crowd pleaser, but it is an uncompromising and refreshing album."},{"rating":"1","title":"very weak","review":"Well, this is probably their worst album ever.

His humor was one of the first to be storytelling rather than composed of one-liners and shorts.

Several times I have looked up a condition in the index only to find that it is either not in the book at all, or it is talked about in 5 different chapters without one central entry on the condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"This is my first read of Stewart O'Nana.The Night Country is an excellent book.It took me a bit to catch on to how it was written with so many different perspectives but once I got that down the book read like watching a movie.I would definitely recommend The Night Country to teenage readers.The story is vary detailed and you feel for every character as you read.

It's a good book, one that will stick with you awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just left me not caring....","review":"I have a hard time understanding the great reviews for this book. I'm an avid reader of many different authors and while I can see O'nan has a gift for writing true-to-life dialogue, I found myself simply not caring about the story or any of the characters. They were written a bit too thin. I finally stopped around page 150.

From the wanton streets of Harlem, to the prizefighting arena, to the lascivious speakeasies and night resorts, Babe's intense passion for men and wealth lead her on an unscrupulous and uninhibited journey. Set in the pre-libertarian 1930's U.S., the story takes its most notorious turn when Babe begins a love affair with a Black racketeer, Money Johnson. Gripping, racy, poetic, articulate, this book is exceptionally well written. The Constant Sinner is one of those rare novels, so perfect and original in its content and style, that its presence assumes a classic or cult-like acclaim. However, it's Mae West the entertainer whose celebrity has become that of legend. So, let the truth be known...West is nothing short of genius... an outstanding writer, artist, historian, and cultural critic."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a moral","review":"The Constant Sinner has the famous line, \\"She would not have known what a moral was if it could be made to dance naked in front of her.\\" Negligently shrugging off any concerns over such aspersions, Mae West's \\"unmoral\\" character Babe Gordon breaks the 1930s' conventions that maintained rigid color lines. A fascinating story that shows a street fighter trample over all kinds of barriers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, cerebral comdey...","review":"I saw Bruno and Borat first, and then went to Ali G.

Watch one per night, or do a marathon. I did notice one glaring fault in the video, but i don't have the dvd to compare... in Magnum Force when Brigs? enters the movie in a scene outside, his face goes completely blurry/out of focus, and does it again later when he's got the gun on Harry with the bomb, I'm thinking it was a directorial/ cameraman error in actually filming, but like i said i don't have a dvd copy to compare it with.

While I appreciate that TokyoPop discs have the original Japanese soundtrack with English subtitles, they distract from the action. It seemed the Funimation dialogue more closely matched the scene. Love the fact that they packaged them so compactly. One nitpick, I kind of wish the green S.A.V.E. band was on the right rather than wrapping around the spine, it makes it harder to see the title of the disc (in tiny print) when stored on the shelf.

Its alittle work each time. But when trim is dry, i spray the trim area good, use a cotton cloth and wipe it down, armorall removes tar and other residue.

Actually, the applicator could get better- I went to the hardware store (and the $1 store this last time) and bought some foam wedges with a handle in them to get in the tight spots. I used painters tape to seal off the flares so I wouldn't get any on the body. Even if you get it on paint, it comes off very easily.

In actuality, I love lifting weights, getting stronger, and building my body. I do not do it to attract women, intimidate people, etc. I also believe that steroid use is a very personal decision and that it is alright as long as you are an adult who is knowledgable and aware of the risks associated with their usage.

However, no crisis can be \\"secret,\\" if it truly IS a crisis. This \\"crisis\\" has been invented. Certain interested parties (who are products of the 1960s) consider this payback for the supposed \\"damage\\" that has been done to women in past generations by society's foisting on them of its perfect body image ideal, ala Barbie.The fact is, the many \\"surveys\\" done to support these assertions have been conducted among out-of-shape men (and women). Has the input of in-shape, attractive men been considered? Hardly. Many of us are proud of the work we have done (naturally, mind you) to stay in shape and attain an attractive shape, yet we are dismissed.Yes, there are indeed those of us out there who take care of ourseleves; we are also talented, compassionate, and worthwhile people, and make valuable contributions to society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written by some bookworm who has never lifted weights","review":"We are not all in this for looks.

The picture quality on non-HD programming is mediocre at best although the HD picture is amazing. The problem is that only a handful of shows are in HD on DirecTV.

After it would shut itself off, it would need to be fully reprogrammed. Now it has frozen on and you cannot shut it off, change channels or work the receiver with the remote or directly on the box.

Also allows you to record HD content. It obviously won't be true HD....but it is still recordable without shelling out money for Tivo or another unit.The menu interface is great and the HD signal is crystal clear on both DirecTV and Over the air.

Daily camp life gets attention as well as what the soldier wore and what equipment he used.

If I never see this plotline used again in a television show or a movie I will be a happier person. I love FARSCAPE but I really hate this episode and all it's gag inducing unoriginality.

Sound familiar? It did to me.I really enjoyed the first half of the book, it was certainly motivating for me and from this perspective alone, I would recommend it to you. But as the work progresses the story becomes too predictable and somewhat trite. A bit like 'The Alchemist' but without the mystical charm. The meetings with the folks from Cirque Du Soliel too contrived, each with a moral to fit the occassion.

Cheap batteries are a sure death to the remotes as they will leak and ruin your unit. La Crosse should make the plus and minus marks on the battery case so you can see them. I marked them with a permanent marker so I could see them in low light. You should number each remote. Pull all batteries out to start.

Then, after a few uses, the stem (the thin piece that actually pushes the pit) fell out! I could only keep using it if, after each pit extraction, I re-inserted the stem into its hole. Hardly an efficient way to pit cherries, especially considering the cherry pitter is supposed to be saving me time. I would recommend finding one where the stem is more securely connected to the body of the piiter. I'll be returning this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell Apart! :(","review":"It worked great the first 3 or 4 times I used it. Then the stem fell out.

I borrowed my neighbor's before purchasing this one and it worked fine, but was obviously made of some zinc compound and was not what I would classify as a quality tool. The Dalla Piazza Lustro cherry pitter works well and has a shiny slick finish (stainless steel, maybe) and it is very ergonomic. What a joy!

I was so bored I quit after two issues, came back for the last and thought he phoned it in. Did he really need to bring back Henry Bendix and Rose Tattoo? Yawn. It's truly disheartening that given a series that once had so much creativity and verve, Brubaker settles for formulaic predictability. I really didn't care for the art either. Great premise with the Authority overthrowing the U.S. government but the execution was completely fumbled and lifeless. The Ellis Authority is infinitely better. The Millar run starts fun and sadly deteriorates into a heartbreaking fiasco. Don't even bother with the later series.

The first is base on \\"The Monkey's Paw\\" as a woman dabbles in witchcraft using tea lights and a sheet with a spider's web on it. In the second feature, a psycho killer tries out for the part of a psycho killer. The third is a weird stalking film.The first two stories had merit if they were longer and done right.

Thinking this might just be a few \\"one-offs\\" in the reviews I thought I'd try because I order from Amazon frequently and have always had a good experience.What others say is very true though. Mine ran for 15 minutes and the hands stopped working. The clock was great in every other aspect for what I wanted...size, nice luminous dial...except telling time. The $5.00 return charge is ridiculous because by the time you pack it up, drive to the local PO, mail it and send them $5.00 to return it to you...well you don't have to be a math wizard to figure out that one.I'd explore other brands and pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clock is poor quality","review":"The clock only kept time for a month before it began sticking everyday and became worthless.

This clock ticks loudly. It's electric, not wind-up. It sits on a nightstand but it ticks annoyingly. Why? Unless you like that. The old one was nice and quiet, humming along, doing the job. It ticks even louder than the Advance Black Electric QA Alarm Clock that I bought at the same time (which also ticks!). Wonder why Equity would change a quiet clock to a loud ticker?Otherwise, the styling is fine. The lighted dial is okay. Just like the old one. The time/alarm knobs are firm unlike those on the Advance clock (which move easily when grasping the clock to hit the snooze button--and moving the alarm setting).Clock now sits in the workshop. Meanwhile, I had usual prompt shipment and delivery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Equity 33100 Electric Alarm Clock with Lighted Dial","review":"I am very pleased with this clock.

This clock, sadly, doesn't even keep the time - it's not a few minutes off, but more like half an hour or multiple hours. I have reset it several times, to no avail. The dial has a very bright blue light which didn't bother us since the clock is not kept in a bedroom, but some buyers might be concerned about this bright blue light feature. Next step: I'll try to return the clock for credit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product has changed - for the worse","review":"I had an old Equity 33100 clock which I needed to replace. After buying something in a local store which I found to be annoyingly noisy, I was glad to find that the Equity 33100 was still available on line. However, when I got the clock, I discovered that although the model number was the same, this was not the same clock. The old clock had a \\"sweep\\" second hand, which moved smoothly and silently. The new clock has a second hand which jumps noisily every second. So, I'm still in search of a silent electric alarm clock (like the old Equity 33100). If anyone knows of one, please add a comment to this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tick is unbearable","review":"This clock functions well but it's loud tick is a real drawback.

The first thing we both noticed was how BRIGHT the blue dial light is, and there is no way to turn it down or off. To make it so we could sleep, I put the clock face down on the floor next to my bed. It worked fine, though I never looked at the time, I just used it for the alarm. Now however, since changing the time for Daylight Savings, the clock can't decide if it is 4 hours slow, or 20 minutes fast...in one day it lost 4 hours, and over the course of a two hour period I had to adjust the time 3 different times because the second hand kept stopping, though this morning it was 15 minutes fast for some reason so the second hand must have decided to speed up.I need an accurate electric alarm clock, not a whimsical night light. I kept my old 40 year old clock, I think I'm just going to have the cord replaced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't depend on this clock!","review":"I'm sorry to report that this clock is a useless clock -- it did not keep the correct time! I have never had an electric clock that didn't even keep time. Other failures (alarm, lighted dial, etc.) with a clock's old age I can understand, but to not even keep the correct time right out of the box is nothing but a useless clock. I was very disappointed with my purchase.

When I opened it I loved how it looked and even delighted that the dial colour was blue rather than the advertised orange. But the ticking is so loud I cannot sleep with it in my room and the dial is SO bright I can read by it in the middle of the night. Obviously I can't sleep in the same room. Not what I had hoped for. So if anyone knows of a clock that is quiet and does not tick loudly and does not shine so brightly please comment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redesigned for annoyance","review":"I used to like this model is because it was very quite, at least until it got to be 2-4 years old. It was virtually silent. It never ticked. It just ran. Now, they've made the second hand to twitch and tick with a rather annoying \\"chunk!\\" sound, and the light is tinted purple rather than white-yellow, and seems much brighter.I've gone through 3 of these over the last 10+ years, and I was ready for another, but I got a noisemaker and a light show instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"clock that does not let you sleep","review":"Lighted dial is too bright, lights up the whole room; it is impossible to sleep.

Although it was being sent from America and the postage was high I ordered it. Unfortunately I didn't realise that America worked on a different voltage system i.e. 120v. I plugged it into the UK system whereupon after 10 minutes it ceased working and is now useless. The clock itself was exactly what I wanted but I have now got a battery one. Expensive lesson."},{"rating":"1","title":"False advertising!","review":"Do not believe Amazon's advertising of \\"Lit by a small light bulb, the clock gives off a soft orange glow\\" The light is an extremely bright blue. I guess Amazon has my money and I got stuck. I tried getting the problem solved, but either I have to drive 20 miles to UPS of pay for USPS which they will refund later. I notice that Amazon doesn't properly back up their products.I've now spend two hours on this and have to now fill out a complaint to my attorney general. I guess Amazon cares more about their profits and not enough about their customers or they would have been willing to have mailed me a shipper. All of this over a stupid clock? It's simply not worth it/Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud & bright","review":"The ticking is loud and annoying. My old windups were either quieter or at least less unpleasant. They went tick-tock two or three times a second, while this one (and the other quartz clocks, I presume) go TICK...TICK...TICK..., once a second, slow enough to mimic the Chinese water torture. The light could be used to read by or light the room dimly.

He was truly remarkable in this movie. The movie was very well written and acted out. It's not often one has an employer who will go out of their way to help employees in need, but in this movie, that is exactly what happened.

It was boring, typical heavy-handed Tyler Perry mush with a totally unbelievable storyline. Gabrielle Union was wasted in this film, and Thandie Newton must be desperate.

Part of the time it is so low that you can barely hear it and you must turn it up then it is too loud. I suspected piracy, but was assured that this is how it came to them from the factory. So, since I can't concentrate on the hearing the story because I am too busy adjusting the volume I can't say much except maybe I'll find a good copy somewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Disappointing Title From The Perry Production Line","review":"I'm surprised this film only has one \\"one star rating\\", maybe the cast and crew submitted these reviews. The film was dull and predictable, I'd rather spend my hour and change starring outside my window and counting atoms within raindrops.

On the positive side, it was great seeing him do some real acting. He's a natural, with a warm charismatic personality. On the downside, it was very disappointing, to say the least, to see how his script allowed him to be in a sexually immoral relationship. Perhaps I'm mistaken but I was under the impression that he upheld Christian morals, and this film clearly does not. If he does profess to be a Christian, then in this movie he has compromised those beliefs and the reputation that he should stand for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skiptastic","review":"Very dissapointted in this DVD!!! it arrived in a timely manor but has skipped three times in the first quarter of the movie.

This would be that film. Tyler Perry was exceptional, proving there's more to him than a wig and a bra. Thandie Newton was, as almost always, a revelation in emotional range. Gabrielle Union also showed her chops and dug into her character with honesty and, in the end, joy. It left me wondering - how did Mr. Deeds' life work out and did his brother ever challenge his personal demons.

The 'story' that tied the screens together was laughable.The only good thing to be said is that it was really quick and easy to play... and that it was cheap. Still, save your money and pick up one of the MCF games instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good to play with kids","review":"As most other reviewers said, this game isn't really that well done. I find it rather boring. But I have to say that I am playing it with my 10 year old and she is enjoying it. She and I take turns reading the cheesy dialogue aloud. So I think it has a slight redeeming quality in that it can be fun to play with a child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proofreading, Anyone?","review":"I recently purchased this game, and I have to say I was very disappointed. The puzzles weren't very challenging, the game itself was fairly short...but the worst part was the editing! I could barely stand to pay attention to the storyline, because not only was it short and without any attempt at depth, but the grammar, spelling, and punctuation were just appalling. Duplicated words, misuse of similar words (they're, there, and their have different meanings, people), sentences that didn't even make sense...it's like the developers forgot that word processing programs have spellcheck! If you're going to charge $20 for a game, at least TRY to fix this kind of thing. From the demos included on the disk, it looks like the next ???-ville game is just as bad in that regard. Since there are plenty of other hidden picture games out there, I would suggest you skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A decent way to blow 2 hours","review":"Had played this game on a 60 minute demo through Real Arcade and was just getting into it when my demo expired. When I saw it on Amazon, I thought \\"great, now I can finish the game.\\" I didn't realize that I basically HAD finished the game while playing the 60 minute demo. There's not much to it...I played through from start to finish in a couple hours and that was it. I have yet to see how the kids (age 9) like it, but I'm betting even they will get through it pretty quickly as well. Not bad for the money spent, just no challenge at all for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not very well-done","review":"There are a number of problems with this game. The storyline is insipid, the graphics are repetitive and animation is almost non-existent. I enjoy the occasional mindless activity of \\"hide and seek\\" puzzle games and this is game is not even as good as the web-based games I've played. Keep looking, you'll find better games available."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"OK\\" sums it up nicely.","review":"It's not the best game--I consider the animation to not exist, and, for all the talk about finding the cats, there wasn't much going on. The story wasn't much either. I found it amusing, though, that the makers put themselves in the character roles. I feel that the game has some major potential, but I wish the execution was better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it, but it caught on fire!","review":"That same burning electric smell happened to me as well as some have said. Then there was a fire inside the control panel. Yes literally a fire! Needless to say...back to Costco it goes. I loved the oven before this and used it all the time. It is true, it does suck as a toaster, but as an oven it became my goto cooking appliance instead of my high end convection kitchen oven I bought.If it did not catch on fire I would still be using it...but that is where I draw the line. The fact that there are other reported incidents of this out there , lead me to believe this is not an isolated incident...so be careful and always unplug this puppy when not using it. I wold feel uncomfortable about walking outside while cooking with this thing if I were any of you.For whats it worth..It did work well for the year and a half I was using it daily. But that is no excuse for catching fire.Consider yourselves warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"It's dead Jim\\"","review":"Today my Oster died. It was 8 months old. It caught fire internally when I tried to heat up some toquitos. The flames were coming near where the chord entered the chassie. I think it committed suicide with the intention of taking me and my family with it. I wish I could say it lived a good life...but alas I cannot. The controls were so frustating and non-intuitive.

It is therefore difficult to know if you have pressedthe button hard enough for it to register.The second problem is that the toaster is under-powered. It takestoo long to make toast. My old toaster oven was much quicker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst possible instructions","review":"I am an 87-year old widower who tries to do all things for myself. The user manual that came with the toaster leaves a tremendous lot to be desired. There are things that come with the oven that are not even pictured in the book . . how am I to be expected to use this? The real payoff came when I called Oster and got some \\"snip\\" who essentially let me know that what I got is what I get.

I found several conversion charts on the Internet, but the time given isn't always correct. The Oster's convection may not be hot enough to cook the recipes as directed. It wouldn't have taken Oster anytime at all to include a Convection Oven conversion chart with the purchase of the unit. I have a very nice looking appliance that I can use for crisping up yesterday's pizza when using the Convection oven, anything else, I have to either stand and watch the whole procedure or keep adding time! I went to [...] and didn't find any help at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead in 6 months (made in China)","review":"It made good toast, but was slow (over five minutes for medium). After six months of light use, the bottom burners completely stopped working. The model 6058 felt solid and looked nice. It's a real shame the electronics are shoddy.The price is low enough that having it repaired feels silly, but high enough I feel robbed by the short life. I decided it must be an oddball lemon, and bought another Oster (different model) and it was a complete pile of junk (I'll review the model 6078 separately). I had mistakenly thought Oster was made in the USA or Canada, but printed on the back: \\"MADE IN CHINA\\". This explains a lot.One last complaint: We burned ourselves repeatedly on this thing. There are design clues that lead a body to incorrectly think \\"cool to the touch\\", but instead bring blisters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burns toast. Too many steps for toast.","review":"This baby takes toooo long to toast. Too many steps for simple toast; push on, adjust temp up or down, wait forever and watch that it dosen't burn, as it is wont to do, and listen for that meek beep, and it will not shut itself off. Also, can not maintain a preferred temp. for toast, because it always goes back to manufacture preset when power is stopped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"While I found this toaster oven to be more convenient than using the oven, its controls are not particularly intuitive, and it feels cheaply made. I tried baking a pie in it, and one side was much darker brown than the other.Then, after a few weeks, it stopped working. The clock stayed on, but the buttons stopped responding most of the time, and when the buttons did work, the oven would reset after the heating element had been on for a few seconds. If you look around here on Amazon, you'll see this exact same toaster sold under a few different brand names. (VillaWare is one example)This oven also used too much counter space for the amount of cooking space it offered. The roundness wastes space.In short, I would recommend going with something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent, slow toasting & baking!","review":"There are cheaper products that do a better job than this. I was disappointed in this product because Oster products usually are good.There is one of these in my office and everyone agrees that it takes \\"forever\\" to toast bread (about 8 minutes) and the baking/broiling results are inconsistent. The bottom element seems to be hotter than the top one because toast is always browner on the bottom. We sometimes flip the bread over during the toast cycle in hopes of getting it consistently brown."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy","review":"My unit hasn't been used two hours total when the digital display went out. Do not purchase an Oster toaster oven with a digital display..In a follow up to initial review I contacted Oster and was amazed how fast and courteous they handled my complaint.

I have changed my opinion of the Oster brand, but not the oven I reviewed, and would deal with them again in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"toaster oven","review":"I was thrilled with how fast this item arrived. I plan on using it mainly during summer as I don't use the stoves oven so as to avoid heating up the house and making air-conditioning work harder.

I've not used the oven at this time, so I can't review how it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"We had an older Oster toaster over (3-5 years old) and while heating leftovers up on a Sat afternoon the heating element had moved, touched the glass, and caused the glass to shatter ALL over the kitchen....while our children were sitting at the island! It was definitely not a good situation. I called Oster to inform them of the problem. Even though the toaster oven was several years old they replaced it free of charge with a newer model...the one from this review. Now, less than 6 months later, the front door doesn't close all the way (it literally gets stuck so we have to put a canister in front of it to keep the door held up). To add to this, a rubber piece broke off and they will not repair or replace the toaster b/c it is past the warranty. So in my opinion, not only is the toaster junk BUT I will never purchase another Oster product again....one explodes across the kitchen and w/i 6 months (4-5 I think, but I don't want to stretch it) the new one doesn't function properly...junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"No surprises","review":"I hate toasters because they make me jump every time. It's stupid I know, but I don't do well with suspense. Our old toaster oven popped when it was done, and I couldn't be in the same room when it was on. This one beeps nicely (it's not obnoxous), and gives a count down.It is a lot bigger than I had thought it would be. But I'm not bothered by it.I have noticed like others, that it does get really warm to the touch. I kind of worry about putting it too close to the wall or where there's not enough air movement. I think it gets warm enough that it could potentially discolor the wall over time."},{"rating":"1","title":"great price if you dont have an oven","review":"Didn't work as expected-didn't receive baking tray with it. Tried to make pilsbury french bread in it -just to try it out-did not cook well-took longer then it was supposed to. Also used convection because I heard it bakes cookies evenly-NOT and took an additional 4 minutes to bake them. Perfect for someone who doesn't cook a lot-but I do and this was not for me. Great price-thats about all I can say-Oh and I did like the way it looked!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"toaster? Convection!!!","review":"Does NOT toast...but great convection oven. Great for cooking for two but don't count on it for the all in one function.Cooks much faster than you would expect and has preset times that turn it off if you don't set the time. Overall great if you don't expect to throw a bagle or bread in for toasting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until it went Kaput just after a year!!","review":"I loved this toaster/convection oven until it just quit 2 days ago. We've had it just a little over a year with no problems. Used it every day for toast, bagels, mini pizzas etc. Was a big foot print, but that was fine. All of a sudden the controls went haywire and wouldn't start or anything. My husband called and talked to Oster and was told they don't make this model anymore and therefore no replacement parts either. So I'm very dissapointed and not encouraged by what's out there on the toaster oven front."},{"rating":"1","title":"dried out toast","review":"This toaster oven is so slow to toast, and the element doesn't get hot enough, so that by the time the bread is toasted, it is completely dried out.

I've had this \\"toaster\\" oven for seven months now, and I've finally give up and am now searching for something more akin to the old \\"fire hazard\\" model I had a decade ago. The quartz bar technology in this model takes forever to heat up, and in the case of toasting, never truly toasts-- it just warms the item up, never making it truly crispy or golden brown (unless you put it in for multiple cycles, in which case, it dehydrates your item completely and *still* doesn't make it any browner). As a mini-oven, it does work, and the convection is nice, but be prepared for insanely long preheat times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Danger! glass explodes unexpectedly","review":"After almost 4 years of moderate use the toaster oven baked its last pizza. After having it on convection oven 400 degrees for about 10 minutes the glass front door exploded outward. Luckily it was safety glass and shattered into finger nail size chunks but it scared the crap out of me. It had about a 2 foot blast radius.It used to be a good toaster, cleaned well, the temperature only slightly changed over 4 years but that just meant putting toast on 3 instead of 4. For the three very good years of service I upped its stars from 1 to 2, but I would steer clear of this bomb."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your $","review":"Takes soooo long to make toast and it is so aggravating.

I live alone, so it always seemed like too much trouble to fire up the stove oven for doing a little baking.

It is very attractive on my counter top and it cooks very well. Other reviewers have complained it does not have enough insulation, but I don't think you can expect this in a counter top oven. I put plates on top of it to warm them while I am cooking in the oven--helps to keep food warm-a cold plate pulls all the heat out of your food.

I cannot recommend this oven due to safety issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"This is just a terrible oven. First of all, we had it for maybe 1 year and then it caught fire. I called Oster Customer Service and they DID send a replacement with no trouble, but the replacement has a timing problem so that the clock runs fast and so consequently, the timer for cooking runs fast, too. Also, the temperature seems to turn itself off after the oven preheats to the temp. you set, so nothing really cooks. I'm NOT getting another OSTER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Caught on fire. Beware.","review":"From other reviews, seems like it is not unusual for this product to catch on fire. I would avoid it, as we were lucky to be next to it and catch it early.

When standing at normal height and loking down to a counter top it is imposible to read what each button does. There isn't ever a light behind the buttons nor is the printing easy enough to see. In the window at the top there are red bars with something printer above them which I still have not been able to read because the printing is about 1/16 of an inch and not even clear. They don't tell you these things when you read about it. We like Oster products and always found them reliable. This one works fine, but it helps if you are 4 feet tall.Mel Bronston"},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE controls. Otherwise mediocre toaster oven.","review":"Decent sized toaster with some of the most horrible controls you could possibly think of. There are no knobs for anything. A \\"correctly\\" designed toaster oven would have one knob for temperature, and one for a timer. This one defaults to 30 minutes and 300*F temperature. To fan-bake something at 450*F for 10 minutes, I'd have to press the \\"oven\\" button twice, then the \\"Down\\" button about 20 times to change from 30 minutes to 10, and then the Timer/Temp button to switch to the temp controls, and then press the \\"Up\\" button about 5 times to reach 450*F. Then I have to press start. On any decent toaster oven, all of this would involve twisting two knobs.Whoever designed these digital controls should never hold another job.Oh, and the outside of the unit gets so hot that you can't touch it. It's not very well heat insulated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Went through two of these before I gave up...","review":"I purchased our first Oster Convection Toaster at Costco as a Christmas gift to myself. I was very happy with its performance, using it to toast or bake a few times a week. However, in May, only five months after purchasing it, I started to smell a terrible burning electrical smell when I turned it on. It got worse, and I kept thinking I should return it. After a week of the burning smell, it just stopped working completely. No display, no nothing. So, figuring it was just a fluke, I returned it to Costco and got another, identical one. I had that one two weeks when all of the sudden, an E-2 message showed up on the display. It wouldn't let me do anything - every time I tried to press any button, it just displayed E-2. I looked in the manual for some kind of a code, but couldn't find anything, so I returned it again to Costco. I figure I've learned my lesson and won't buy a third."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!!","review":"This Oster toaster oven is the king of the crop.

There are far too many memoirs of this type already; do we really need another?The good -- though extremely brief -- discography is one of the few segments of the book that's worth reading. In all, a huge diasppointment, especially given the publisher's claims of authenticity. Do yourself a favor: buy (or borrow) some flamenco CDs. They'll give you far more insight into the music than Webster's book ever will."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Mills & Boon than Lonely Planet.....","review":"\\"Carlos continued to speak as my educated brain drew on years of intellectual training to justify what I'd done\\" - this self-absorbed sentence should be enough to ward anyone away from this tiresome account.Apparently Jason Webster went to Oxford, a point he makes repeatedly in this book. Not since \\"The Great Gatsby\\" has there been such name-dropping of this institution, and at least in Fitzgerald's novel 'Oggsford' was not incidental to the plot.As a travel novel, Webster's effort hits the spot sparingly. There is much information on Flamenco and bullfighting for the beginner, however the style of writing owes more to pulp romance than to quality travel writing.I must agree with other reviewers on the point that this is more a fiction than a memoir, and also that it will appeal more to the romantic than the traveller.I was HUGELY disappointed. And to think, this book was written by an Oxford man..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spanish passion!","review":"My daughter bought me this book as she knows how much I love anything to do with Spain and Latin America, and, oh boy! did it deliver. It tells the story of the writer's experiences in the Flamenco underworld, with everything from a love story with a flamenco dancer to car chases and a real Gypsy wedding. I couldn't put it down, in fact I read it in just two days. Wow! The most exciting thing I've read in months."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD","review":"This book is a joke the only people that would like this are those who dream of one day running away to spain with a gypsy and living a romantic life. It is pathetic how he speaks of flamenco in the way that he has been playing it from childhood, at one point he says \\"Ole,they dont know the meaning of ole\\" sorry but neither do you mr Webster.

This book purports to be a memoir, but it more nearly resembles a fictional account that plays fast and loose with with the facts. The author's knowledge of the history of flamenco and facts about contemporary flamenco is very incomplete and more often than not inaccurate, yet he presents himself as an authority on flamenco. All the professional flamencos I know who have read this book have died laughing at the numerous mistakes and misunderstandings found on each page. This book fails on all counts--it is not a reliable source for information about flamenco and it is so poorly written that I wonder if the author wrote it for a freshman creative writing class.

So, if you have a problem with text laced with tough street talk best set this one aside. I'm not a prude but I found the salty language a little over-seasoned for my taste.Ms. Hoag's tough homicide detective, Kovac and his foul-mouthed sidekick, Tinks, are on the trail of a sexual sadist. Kovac knows who did the awful deed right from the start, giving us an insight into the tunnel vision that often seems to affect non-fictional cops. Go after the suspect with everything you've got - due process is for wimpy liberals.Plot was a bit telegraphed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best effort","review":"I'm a Tami Hoag fan, but this book was weak at best.

Hoag is definitely capable of a more intricate plot and better writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can remember when books were better than t.v.","review":"If you pick up a mystery at the grocery store, you don't expect Hemingway. Or even Russ Francis. But this is really just like a bad novelization of a middling episode of \\"Law and Order CI\\". The good men are all craggy and strong and sensitive to women. The women are all good unless they're hookers or junkies. All of them, at some point, beat up or kill a man. The bad men had bad experiences with their mothers. Wives are more successful than their husbands, who are as petulant as a teenager with a used Chevrolet.In all fairness, there is a decent plot, but it has petechial hemorrhage from the ligature of Dr-Phil-level psychology and daytime-drama characters.The least you expect from a cheap mystery is that it will be better than the average police-procedural tv show. This one fails the test. Save your $5 and watch reruns of Bones or NCIS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoag should've filed her manuscript under \\"prior bad acts\\" and not published this one!","review":"I'm an avid Tami Hoag reader. I own every book she's ever written and anxiously await the release of each new one. But, Prior Bad Acts wasn't worth the money or the read. The characters are under-developed, unsympathetic and difficult for the reader to establish a \\"connection\\" to. The plot is weak. The villian is evident from the second he's first questioned by police. There's no romance between the lead detective and the victim that the reader is \\"waiting\\" for -- something Hoag is famous for. She definitely failed on this one. Prior Bad Acts doesn't even come close to A Thin Dark Line. If you want to read a Hoag thriller, pick up that one. Perhaps Hoag should re-read it too. Maybe she'd pick back up on the style she's lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Acts","review":"Three older adults listened to the audio version of this story at the befinning of a long vacation drive. After painfully listening to three or four chapters of the book, we all agreed we didn't want to listen to any more and turned it off. We concluded the author was enmphasizing violence and crudity over the story. We prefer it be the other way around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prior bad acts","review":"Prior Bad Acts by Tami Hoag was full of surprises and twists and turns.

A smart woman makes it as a judge, regardless of her political agenda, and she does the Hillary Clinton with her husband when the marriage is already over? Hello, if you married this man in the first place, you have no business on a bench! Dingdong cop is in love with her, and another dingdong cop--who has witnessed these things for years, by the way--manages to crack up over this one murder. Hell, I knew who the killer was half-way through the book, and he was smarter than all of them. Tami was hard up for material on this one, and the only person in this book I truly felt sorry for was Carl Dahl. Come on Tami, you've done better, so keep the storyline alive with Ann and Vince. Prior Bad Acts just sounds like a self-fulfilling prophecy at this point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cardboard characters","review":"I usually like Tami Hoag's books, she is a story teller with a surprising twist. The twist was there this time also. However,the characters were way too predictable. They all seemed on the dark side, even the \\"heroes.\\" Surely there has got to be a non-divorced person in this world. Not in her book. Well, unless you are the guy who kills people because they're in the way. Then you can be single and never married.The bad guys had no redemptive features -- too cartoon-like.And the unnecessarily bad language was a turn-off. Surely even in cop land not every one uses the f... word in every sentence.The plot was somewhat interesting but felt undeveloped, kind of like the characters.Of course tastes differ. I like a bit more psychological depth with my murders than Tami Hoag offers in this story. Maybe next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After reading virtually everything that Connelly, Crais and Block have written, I cast about for some additional mystery authors that I might enjoy. Because a number of Hoag's books were highly rated on amazon and other sites, I tried out Prior Bad Acts. Unfortunately, I found it quite unappealing. The language was overwrought and the plot was silly and unbeleivable. Peter Robinson, Ian Rankin, T. Jefferson Parker and (on the somewhat lighter side) Harlen Coben are all better suited to my tastes."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was way too long for what it was","review":"This was my first Tami Hoag book. I won't say it's the last, but I probably will choose other authors over her. This book was like a mediocre TV show at best. Too much time was spent on irrelvant issues and facts. I mean, the (paperback) version is over 500 pages! Way too drawn out. And the author seemed to take a few incredulous shortcuts to satisfy a plot point. I have to admit that the last few hundred pages were the most gripping. Maybe I've been reading John Sandford too long!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Average; She could do a lot better","review":"The judge has really gotten herself in a bind in this book, however it's the classic \\"damsel in distress\\" here and also the \\"only one man can save her\\"...same old same old. I think Ms. Hoag ran out of ideas with this one. Some authors crank out books when they're running out of money...this appears to be the case with this book.The storyline is okay, but predictable. To be fair, there is a lot of suspense and violence, but I was sick to death of the constant sexual descriptions and the \\"perfect\\" body descriptions, especially at the age of the two main characters. If MY body was as perfect as theirs are at that age, then why are they cop and judge and not Mr. America and Ms. USA?Ms. Hoag needs to take a vacation to drum up new topics to write about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't put it down type of thriller....but...","review":"I've been reading a lot of books lately that are just so-so. When I picked up \\"Prior Bad Acts\\" I was thrilled to find one that you really can't put down. The only thing I didn't like about this book was the amount of profanities the characters used. I would have enjoyed reading it much better if it had been toned down some. I think the characters can be tough/and/or evil without using so much bad language. If you can overlook that, though, it is a great novel that keeps you guessing until the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better and Better","review":"Hoag is clearly an author at the top of her game. I find it very impressive when an author who has written alot of highly acclaimed books keeps coming through with books better than before, and this is just such an example. Great characters, great plot, a dynamite ending and excellent dialogue. Everything you'd want in a good suspense/mystery/thriller and more. And the one flaw I've seen in her books (likely coming from the fact that she started as a romance novelist)-- the rather overblown love scenes -- is even gone. This is one of the year's best novels of this genre, and a must read for old or new Hoag enthusiasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be Prepared To Get Your Thrill On!","review":"An Evil act scars a community. Every one has a past, yet it is Karl Dahl's criminal history that's held to a higher scrutiny when a judge rules his prior acts inadmissible. The community is outraged, Dahl escapes, and the judge finds herself a target of a killer who is among a community with a growing list of suspects. Detectives Sam Kovak and Nikki Liska are assigned to the case which takes them on a hunt with leads that spiral into the community where everyone's prior acts are called into question.If you haven't experienced a Hoag novel, here's one that'll fulfill your thrill!

On \\"FALLEN ANGEL\\" (1978), there's a certain touch of gospel in many of the songs but don't let that scare you away because Uriah Heep manage to keep the rock feeling all along the way through the album. The great John Lawton stayed with Heep for only three albums (\\"FIREFLY\\" 1977, \\"INNOCENT VICTIM\\" 1978, and \\"FALLEN ANGEL\\" 1978), and I dare to say that this period was the peak in Uriah Heep's career.This album includes great (but unknown?) tracks like \\"Woman of the night\\", \\"Falling in love\\", \\"One more night\\", \\"Love or nothing\\", and \\"I'm alive\\".

As a result, gems dating back around this time from the hard rock and heavy metal world are few and far between. Case in point is Uriah Heep's \\"Fallen Angel\\". On this particular outing, the band finds themselves musically confused, FALLING if you will from their former glory days as a raw, heavy psychadelic prog rock unit (i.e. albums like \\"Look at Yourself\\" and the self titled realease) and into a smoltering HEEP of boogie woogie rock cheesedom on par with the likes of the Bay City Rollers and that really lame \\"OOGA-CHAKA\\" band.

Even the U.S. Navy revealed in the Spring, 2003 that they have been clandestinely researching Cold Fusion for a decade. Their conclusion? Cold Fusion is real and it warrants an official government funded research effort. Dr. Huizenga, well meaning or not, missed the boat on Cold Fusion. It's too bad he put his closed-minded scientific views in writing for the whole world to see. I wonder if he'll be writing a new book when Cold Fusion re-emerges into the scientific mainstream in coming years? Cold Fusion is being replicated all around the world, and the skeptics are just flat-earthers at this point."},{"rating":"2","title":"EARTH, WATER AND BEAUTY.","review":"Creating a water garden is yet another way to attune oneself with nature.

The violin sounded weak and uncertain, the piano overwhelming and a bit bombastic, and the Ives idiom seemed missing thruout.Why oh why doesn't Philips re-release the Druian/Simms performances? So far, none have compared to those guys. OK, I haven't heard Thompson/Waters yet & am looking forward to that. And from what I heard over the web, Fulkerson/Shannon sound encouraging, if you have enough equity in your home to second-mortgage it - I also thought the Zukofsky one was OK, but again not comparable to Druian/Simms, and I gather also no longer available.Someone needs to rattle Philips' cage on this.

They said the two different types are identified, but I was looking, am a smart guy, and still made this mistake. So, I'd say, their labelling was unclear. Then I had to ship the filters back, at my expense, where they were going to be replaced, but when they got them, they refused. They will return them. So, now am out another $13 for shipping. Not to mention the hassle, and lack of use of the filters for over a month while I mess around with this stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great air purifier","review":"We have had one of these units for years and recently bought another to help another asthma sufferer in my family.

On high, this thing is pretty loud!However, I had a more inexpensive model (I think it was Honeywell 50010) and it was deafening, so this is an improvement.Otherwise, this machine is giving me EXCELLENT results. I can sleep through the night without my eyes watering or dry mouth. It's improved my breathing (my family tells me 'I sound better') and helped with my snoring problems. At the price they're selling it for here, I'd pick one up. If noise bothers you just keep it on the low setting.It really is a good product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent air cleaner at a good price","review":"I am a board certified allergist. I have this in my office and home. It is a great little air cleaner. It has a very good fan/air flow. The air filter is very easy to clean. I even clean the \\"disposable\\" prefilter by simply using the wand on my vacumn cleaner or a shop vac. The main hepa is rated permanent, I doubt that, I would suggest replacing it every 3 -4 years.

The unit is not as \\"whisper quiet\\" as the model name would suggest - but I do not have trouble sleeping while it is on. It sounds like a small box fan on a low setting - which is not too bad at all really.For the price - I would highly recommend this unit over others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Great Product","review":"Several people have commented that this product is too noisy. Either they got a \\"bad\\" one - or I got a really good one.

Rogelio Ramirez's life as a Comanche captive--Tlalcoyote, or \\"The Badger\\"--taught him that he had everything needed to survive. Fascinating in its authentic portrayal of untamed Comanche life, colorful with its images of early New Orleans and riverboat days, sensuous in its erotic fantasies, this is a book that will hold the adventurous reader's interest until the very last page. Viva Tlalcoyote!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very complicated","review":"This is a very complicated book. The two stories themselves not so much. Both Ulysses' and Olive's story are well written (olive's was a little depressing, but it was better written i think). Figuring out the connection between them is more the point of the book. The two strange sections (3 and 6) were really key to the whole thing. The essay at the beginning was pretty convincing as well. This seems to be the type of book that needs to be read a few times. All in all, i think it was great entertainment. In a hundred years it will probably be one of those 'masterpieces' that they make you read in school. Those aren't really my favorite type of book, but i think this is a good one. Its always nice to have a book to discuss, where mentioning it makes you look smart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice ideas","review":"This book brought home decoration to a new level for me.

Every once in a while, there's a helpful hint about something, and I enjoyed the bagua part (that's about placement issues), but that is not much of the book.

By clearing out the old 'stuff' that accumulates in our life- both material and emotional - that we hang onto for no reason, or for the wrong reason, Ms. Kingston shows that we can make room for more abundance and blessings to come to us. Written in a straight forward and easy to follow manner, I read the book once through first, then again as I prepared to do the Space Clearing, then again after as followup. I am already seeing the results in my life and recommending this book to friends who want to change their lives. Note: I also ordered THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO FENG SHUI... by Lillian Too. It was helpful, but should be read after this one by Ms. Kingston."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many \\"shoulds\\"!","review":"I bought this book because I loved (and highly recommend) the author's other book \\"Clear Your Clutter with Feng Shui.\\" However, I was really disappointed when I read this book. Ms. Kingston does describe space clearing rituals used in other times and places, but her own space clearing ritual is extremely detailed and requires the use of specialized equipment which you can only buy from her. I think INTENTION is much more important in rituals than, for example, what kind of bell or incense you use.The other feng shui books I have read can be extremely limiting because they have so many rigid rules for what one can and cannot do. It's quite difficult to live with ALL those rules, and it's confusing because various authors contradict each other. I liked \\"Clear Your Clutter With Feng Shui\\" because it didn't make me feel constrained to do things \\"the right way\\" - but I found this book to be a let down, and I wish I had not bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely for an advanced reader on this topic.","review":"This book was one of three I ordered recently when I realized this was a subject I wanted to learn more about.

She's definitely a pro and weaves in the metaphysical in a sensible and understandable way. She's a little heavy on Bali and their customs - and definitely has her \\"fundamentalist\\" tendencies - but in general, I think she says what needs to be said about this topic better than anyone else I've read.Great tips, if you can let go of the \\"this is the way it's done in Bali and this is the ONLY way it will work\\" vibe.

The passcode is actually on a separate card and was missing when the book was delivered (which was very disappointing). You can purchase the passcode separately using information that is in the book, but it costs an additional $75 to buy the passcode for both volumes of the online workbook. I wound up buying the book new from the University Bookstore. It really did include the passcode which provides access to both volumes of the online workbook, so it was considerably less expensive overall than buying the book from Amazon.

As Mr. Blair mentions, Burgdorfer's book does cover some tours that are only accessible after roads have melted out or that require some mountaineering equipment, but that just makes it more interesting. The majority of Burgdorfer's tours are suitable for skiers of intermediate or better ability and do not require any non-skiing gear (i.e., mountaineering equipment).Martin Volken's guide toBackcountry Skiing Snoqualmie Pass (Backcountry Skiing)is also worth checking out as it does provide new and different options from Burgdorfer's guide in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised...","review":"Does anyone besides Seabury Blair's friends like this book?

Blair has written a pamphlet for beginning cross-country skiers and then stretched it into a book by printing the same route descriptions over and over again.

It showed no paranormal activity to me. The \\"Ghost Hunters\\" said they were scientific but I find it hard to believe when their office is filled with New Age crap. They try to crack jokes and be funny but they seemed to try and let the guard down of the viewer and/or skeptic.

The girls seemed to scream on cue when the \\"Ghost Hunters\\" walked down to the door ready to save them. The \\"paranormal\\" thing caught on tape appeared to be a bat with it's flapping wings.

I did not find the examples clearly written at all-the lack of fit test, and some of the stuff about partial F tests could have used a few more sentences.No, I cannot write a glowing review of the text, but the only reason for the second star is because I also had a terrible instructor for this course.

The book has 18 projects, one following each chapter, most of which were personally helpful.While being a Bible based book, this work has direct practical application that will fit nearly any kind of vision in any field.

Naturally, when I took the hood mat off the hose barbs on my nozzles were \\"L\\" shaped and these are straight. I ended up using a needle and compressed air to revive my clogged nozzles. The original nozzles go in and out easy enough, but there is no way to \\"adjust\\" the little plastic tangs to keep the nozzles tighter on the hood so they spray on the windshield and not the roof. The second time I had them out to clean them (Make sure you run plenty of fluid out of the system while they are off.)

The spray pattern and adjustment is very nice and works well. When installing these, be sure to take precautions against over tightening the plastic retaining nut as you will strip the threads on the nozzle.

I added music (mp3) to the 1gig card and when I played the slide show, the frame automatically played the music. The calendar is a great feature to have. I have not tried anything else. So far, the quality is great, no pixilated pictures. The sound is good, though I can only control the volume with the remote and not the volume knob in the back.

Many deep fryers in this price range are built very flimsy, with lids that don't close properly or brake off easily. (See how often the display model in the store typically has a broken lid !!!)

One drawback is the lack of a temperature adjustment, which most fryers have, but I'll trade this for the better construction anyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep Frier Good; Deep Frying a Messy Process","review":"This deep frier has so far been great. Easy to use, top quality materials. From the picture I expected it to have a timer, but it does not. Simply use a microwave or kitchen timer instead and consult the handbook for time for certain foods. The tube makes removing oil easy, but it's still a messy clean-up because of all the grease and left-over food bits - hard to get the full bowl in the sink & scrub the net.Keep in mind that you will need 2 liters of oil on hand if you ever want to use it. You can reuse the oil that's left after a frying session, though it isn't the most appetizing reuse.Overall, it's simply the process of deep frying that can a bit messy, but this deep frier is so far great in function, material, and a nice looking piece of kitchenware."},{"rating":"2","title":"great fryer","review":"I recommend this to eveyone we know. we had received ours 6 and 1/2 years ago as a wedding present and loved ever since. i only gave it 4 stars becuase i have noticed that the tempurature slide and timer are no longer on there. these features are nice but you can still use this will confidence. the oil gets hot really fast and with the ability to raise the basket without opening the lid is really nice. we use it for everything from french fries to deep fried halibut balls. enjoy :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell Short of Expectations","review":"There are many things to like about this deep fryer, especially the ease with which the grease is drained from the fryer. I could have lived without a timer, and could have lived without a temperature control, but I just can't live with its inability to heat the grease past 340. I checked the temperature with 3 different thermometers, all of which said the same thing. The highest temperature it was able to reach was 345, when most fried foods require a temperature of 375. I tried letting it heat for nearly 30 minutes, and tried stirring the grease - but was unable to get the temperature up to even 350. I tried twice to cook fish and french fries. The french fries almost burned before they got crisp, and the fish had to cook longer than usual in order to get it crispy. I supposed this unit could have been defective, but I'm not taking a chance with a replacement - I'll just get another model/brand, and, alas (I hate to return stuff), this one is going back."},{"rating":"2","title":"DLonghi Deep Fryer","review":"I had an older model that worded great so I was looking for a replacment but this one is not as good as the old model it is still a great fryer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delonghi Cool Touch Fryer","review":"This product is unreliable.

Despite her degrees in history, her history of the West is very poor. When introduced to the writngs of Kant, she assumes that he is still a role model on the philosophy of women in the western world.The saddest part is when she writes about her collegue Kemal, no matter how much he abuses her verbally, she always crawls back for his approval, while trying to tell us how liberated she is.I feel sorry for all her fears, and she has many, having crossed roads, that thank god, I didn't have to cross.So give this book a skip, hopefully the author made enough money on it to travel a bit more and read alot more before she writes another book about the West"},{"rating":"2","title":"Value for money...","review":"These are refurbished but nevertheless, u will be thrilled to have them.They deliver crisp and clear sound.

Even grade school students who were polled often find the pictures both useless and distracting. The chapters of this book also waste space, while providing very little mathematical content. If you are reading this book, or thinking about getting this book for a school environment, you should seriously consider that this book in no way prepares students for high school math courses.

Her sister finds herself with an unwanted pregnancy and gives the baby to her; but she finds herself obsessed with the idea that her sister and husband have had the baby together. This didn't seem reasonable to me at all. With the heroine's hormone fluctuations, you would have thought that she was already pregnant. There was no romance in this book.

Our main focus is portraiture, and I was looking for a smaller, more easily portable answer to my beloved studio softbox. The lightsphere delivers a nice warm quality, and doesn't require bracketing, as the exposure stays true. I've yet to shoot any large group shots with it, but with couples or individuals, it works well. The DVD that accompanies it is laughable in it's low-budget quality, but was fun to watch. Overall, I'm happy with the (bulky- someone likened it to a tupperware bowl) addition to my camera bag, but will continue my search for other flash-diffusing accessories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as Advertised +++","review":"I am very pleased with the cloud diffuser on my Nikon SB-800 and Nikon SB-600 flash units. While the 600 and 800 are great units, I am very pleased with the softened light that I now have with this diffuser. I have used it close up with great results. Have not tried it in large room with large groups - but, that is not what I bought it for.It is true that people DO LOOK at you when you have this thing mounted on your flash.

I can't tell you more than this is just yicky. I wish there was a zero-star rating!I didn't finish the first cup even (but I'd already tried and re-tried another Miso-cup flavor and hated it). Therefore, I only used one envelope before giving away the rest. Oh, why did I stray from San-J? Actually, I thought it might be worth trying Miso-cup's different flavors to add variety to my afternoon broth experience. It was this flavor, in particular, that I was most interested in trying for variety. But now I know that ALL the Miso-cup brand are equally dreadful!!!I gave these and the other Miso-cup boxes to a Food Pantry BUT I told them first why to warn others it might not suit them. Get the San-J brand!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG LET-DOWN","review":"I purchased this CD based on previous Hed Kandi releases and the other reviews. This release didn't chill me out, it got me angrier and angrier with each unimaginative, annoying, and cheesy track. This is bad pop music at best. Not electronica chillout AT ALL. Every track is exactly the same, with the same uninspiring female vocal in EVERY SONG. And the vocals aren't even soothing, at points as aggravating as a pack of rangy alleycats in heat. And a remake of oran' juice jones's 'I saw you walking in the rain'? Give me a break. So if you are into an ... 2CD collection of a bad carpenters' cover band, this is for you. I would recommend instead Serve Chilled 1 or Cafe del Mar volumen cinco if you are after good chill-out music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it's just me but this CD was a horrible waste of money","review":"Well, I have many, many CDs and few from Hed Kandi. Most are good, some not but none have burned me more than this compilation of crap. I spent $30 and I wish I could return it. I amazed by the reviews for this, I actually went by them to decide to purchase it.

The characters are well defined and you root for them along their investigation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the first","review":"Julian Kestrel is still an interesting character, but I found the plot here stretched my credulity to the breaking point. If the murder victim was so stupid as to act as she did, she was asking for it! And the \\"romance\\" between JK and the \\"hooker with the heart of gold\\" was a credulity strainer too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have...","review":"My daughter is only 3 but this is one of her FAVORITE books. When she was 8 months old she loved looking at the pictures and as she has grown she has enjoyed having the book read to her. It does a fabulous job of explaining the adoption process and giving you a starting point to talk about it. Our daughter was adopted at 4 months old so she has no memories of it except our home movies and pictures and this book. I think every person adopting or that has adopted from Vietnam should have this book. I also think it is a great book about adoption in general. If you buy only one book, it should be this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just beautiful","review":"This is a beautifully photographed, beautifully written book. It presents a story of adoption from Vietnam gracefully, from the time a child is given up for adoption, including a gentle musing on the reasons, time spent in an orphanage, up until the time of an adoption. I have already read it to my two and a half year old and we look at the pictures often. I imagine we will have a tradition of reading this book every year on the anniversary of his adoption. It is extra special to me to recognize people we met in Vietnam in the pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously?","review":"I read around 50 pages and gave up!I've recently read quite a few novels about Nazi Germany, really good books, I may add, and this one I found SILLY!Maybe it's intended for young adults which I'm definitely not, and I found Zusak's approach to serious matters almost ridiculing and quite ridiculous!Sorry Markus!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have ever read","review":"I am not even sure where to start with this review. There are so many reviews for this book whatever I say won't add much so I will just say that this book was a magnificent story! I cried at several points in the book especially at the end!

The last statement in the book still haunts me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"The way this is written is SO inventive and unexpected. The first bit confused me but it all became clear as the book progressed. This author as some others books out there too, not as good but well worth reading such as The Messenger.

I also purchased The Messenger because I liked the way this book was written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, moving, worth reading til the end.","review":"A book set in in Nazi Germany that was not centered on someone Jewish? Never read one before this.There are two things that I think made this enjoyable for me: first, I really liked the main character and wanted to know what would happen to her. Second, sometimes Death would actually tell you what was going to happen, long before it actually happened. When you know the ending in advance, you aren't so concerned with what ultimately happens, but instead with everything in between, so it keeps you reading. At least, it did for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Book Thief\\"","review":"A different type of story about a young girl alone at the begining of WW2 in Germany. How she survives and what life was like during that time. The author has done a good job in describing the characters in the book. Anyone who lived through this historic period probably knows about the war and the battles but little about how people survived on the home fronts. The book held my interest but I am not sure I liked how the book ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Destined to Become a Classic","review":"What can I say about this book that the other reviewers have not said? I was lucky enough to get a signed copy as a gift. Markus is an amazing author.This is a brilliant book that is bound to become a classic. After I finished it, I contacted all my reading buddies and recommended this book. It is a beautiful story that makes you think about our humanity and the definition of courage. This is truly an inspirational story that should be read by young and old. Set in Nazi Germany, the reader travels with death as it tells about the horrors it sees during this sad time in our history. During its journey, death comes across a little girl various times throughout her life as she deals with the deaths in her life. The lessons learned are unforgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best reads of the year","review":"I randomly found this book and began reading and was hooked within ten pages. I found it to be a startingly fresh view of World War II and the horrible predicament many good people found themselves in. What a great read!! Very clever choice of death as narrator---it adds so much depth to an already excellent book. I would recommend it to everyone I know. It is a shame that many will skip over this book due to its young adult classification---a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting perspective of a girl's life growing up in a hilter germany","review":"This book was recommended to me and I enjoyed reading it. I have never read a book from deaths perspective. I felt like I was riding along with him from above as he told Lesile's Story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"This book is a \\"must read\\". The characters in the book are developed in such an interesting way. It's a book that I wanted to keep on reading and yet at times I had to ponder the contents. I belong to a book club and we will be discussing it soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book Thief","review":"This was a very well written book. The subject of the story and the point of view from which it was written were very different, but it was a good read. After I had gotten into the story I found it hard to put the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"Reading The Book Thief was like being a fly on the wall during a terrible part of our world's history. There was great sadness, but there was continuous hope. Markus Zusak created characters that became very visible. With Death as the narrator, he hooked me on the first page. I can't wait until my children are old enough to read it. This book is a treasure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"beautifully haunting","review":"This beautifully written book captures the essence of adolescence in a war torn time.

The foster dad is kind, loving and always says the right thing. Oh, and he likes to smoke cigarettes. The mom on the other hand is harsh, critical, demanding, and never says a kind word, you will find out she has a heart--but that is later. Come cry with me as you read this totally amazing book of Nazi Germany and the holocaust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable!","review":"This is the first Amazon review I have written. Very rarely have I felt so strongly about a book. I finished it last night and instantly started reading it again. The characters, plot, and intricacies of the narrator make this book compelling and unique. I agree with what others have said... this is a book that adults can and SHOULD read. I am an avid adult reader who reads 1-2 books per week, including all the new books on the NYT bestseller list that everyone calls \\"must reads.\\" This. is. a. must. read. Hands down the best book I've read all year."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read","review":"Of the books I've read in the last year, this one is one of my favorites!

It is fiction, but very good fiction!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book Thief","review":"Interesting use of language, sad in places and a totally different perspective on war torn Germany. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading historical novels and the resilience of the human spirit and the devastation of war. Excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique, engaging, beautiful story","review":"This is the first book I read on my Kindle and I was not disappointed! Although there are many options for historical fiction set during WWII, this story is a unique, engaging, beautiful story of a German girl dealing with horrible circumstances well beyond her control. The fact that it is narrated by \\"death\\" gives it a unique mood, but not as you might think. As the narrator, Death is compassionate and eloquent. Although my husband could not get into the story, I was hooked! I would highly recommend it, placing it at the top of the list for anyone interested in WWII or a great book about the perseverance of a girl growing up in unimaginable circumstances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost melodic in its beauty","review":"This book is challenging without question. It challenges the mind and heart. It is told from the point of view of Death. Death appears to struggle with the necessity of being objective when dealing with Liesel; she has strength and sweetness that is rarely seen in life or fiction. She seems to charm Death. This story is about relationships and how complicated they can be. It is written very well and should not be rushed. It takes time to absorb all of its nuances."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"When I picked up 'The Book Thief' at the store, I was a little wary -- it's narrated by Death. I'm not sorry I decided to bring it home.This is a story about a girl during the Nazi occupation of Germany. And yes, parts of it are heartbreaking - and parts of it are humorous. Zusak is very talented, and his writing in this particular book is the strongest I've read in quite some time. The story rings true all the way through, and the ultimate message is that of hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"This is my #1 book - and I've read plenty. The writing style of \\"The Book Thief\\" is so different from anything I've ever read. While I was skeptical for the 1st chapter or so, I quickly got into the rhythm of his writing style. Using Death as the narrator was brilliant. The characters where rich and the story extremely intense and thought provoking. It really makes you feel (as much as possible), that you're that \\"fly on the wall\\" watching this incredible story unfold. A must read, and in my opinion a must own!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Read for All","review":"This book is a must read for ages 13 to 100. The perspective of death as the narrator, and the innocence and bravery of Leisel, the main character, will leave lasting memories of joy in spite of the destruction in the small Nazi-German village. The neighbor boy, Rudy, will burn a hole in your heart with his bravery and spirit...the characters will live on in your heart. Read it and rejoice in the great human spirit that thrives where there is love.I think of the images and events, and they fill my soul. Enjoy, and be sure to watch the video of Markus Zusak giving a book talk in Australia. The part he tells about his family, when they were painting houses, and it was time to break the eggs for lunch. Well worth the google search. (It illustrates Zusak's rich writing style and his sense of humor)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book Thief","review":"The format of this book was a bit daunting in the beginning but as I got into it I began to enjoy it. Not one of the best books ever, but nevertheless interesting abd worth the time spent. I have read quite a few books on WWI, the Jews and persecutions. This one gave a different viewpoint and although it is fiction, the conditions it describes were believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"the book thief","review":"although this is rated for young adults ,I found this book(as a senior citizen) a very moving story. Every emotion was touched, fear, anger, hope and the innocence of youth.The mature theme of adults trying to survive yet not losing compassion for others. The young people are fearless and hopeful ,but inspite of it all are still children growing up with different rules of survival. read it if you dare, you will never forget it and learn to complain less.This book was part of my local book club, but I knew that I wanted this in my own library to share with others and bought a copy from Amazon as I do with all my must have books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, sad and thought provoking.","review":"Loved it from start to finish.

Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"75 Pages in and unimpressed","review":"Because of the solid reviews on this book, I ordered it (although I, like many others, was hesitant to purchase another book on the often exhausted topic of the holocaust). I'm 75 pages in and I'm already wishing I hadn't made the purchase. The author's style of writing strikes me as being contrived, disingenuous and unoriginal. I don't think the narrator - death - is all that clever. I just finished \\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\\" by Carson McCullers and switching from her work to this is almost painful. It's simply not good writing (and I don't think if I were to continue reading it would improve). Perhaps if I were sixteen and reading this I might give the author more credit. But as an adult whose read a substantial amount of great works by great writers, I can't continue on with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"B.O.R.I.N.G.!!!!!!!!","review":"I can't believe all the positive reviews of this book, it is literally the most boring book I have ever opened.

I kept reading, waiting for this to get really interesting, and it never did. I don't like how the author writes, and I find the way Death narrates to be really annoying.

The use of random German words in dialogue (right before typing the exact same word in English mind you) got really annoying really fast.

The story is told from Death's perspective, with hand drawn pictures inserted throughout. I enjoyed the non-traditional aspects of this novel.

For once a lengthy novel that didn't seem like a chore. Zusak is a writer that understands what the reader wants. There is nothing else to say other than buy it and read it. How can the opening line, \\"Here is a small fact, you are going to die\\" not make you want to read on. Honestly...You should read it.

Well written, intriguing, but very different.A Final DanceRemarkable writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.","review":"I guess I'm one of those people who just doesn't see why this is a 4 or 5 star book. It feels like the author over-reached his abilities. The Death narrator didn't work for me, it felt like Zusak was trying for Vonnegut's ironic narrative without Vonnegut's talent. The title also was problematic as the thievery didn't feel integral to the story.Lastly, the characters were mostly caricatures and felt like stereotypes we've seen before. They lacked backstory or explanations for their behavior that would have made them more credible.This is one of the few books I actually skipped about 40 pages towards the end just to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"What a wonderful story about human perseverance and hope.

It captured my heart right away.","review":"The Book Thief deserves the highest rating possible! I was totally captured by Liesel's life during wartime Germany. Markus Zusak accurately describes the atmosphere of the time, cleverly using the character of \\"Death\\" to narrate the story.I especially loved Hans,(Liesel's adopted father), Rudy, (Liesel's friend), and Max, (the kind and caring Jewish man hidden in the basement). The atmosphere of war and prejudice was carefully and accurately narrated. I especially liked how cleverly Markus Zusak interjected humor into this story.The book captured my attention, especially since I personally spent close to three years in Germany (16 years post war). I appreciate Markus Zusak's effort with translation of the German language. I recalled a great deal of the language I thought I had forgotten.I have read this book twice, and probably will read it again.

The problem was the writer's habit of writing down to the reader. He seems to think it's necessary to explain his points, even when they're clearly made. For example, after describing acts of kindness done by one of the story's characters, he tells us, \\"She was a good woman.\\" It appears that he doesn't trust us to draw such conclusions for ourselves. Or maybe he doesn't trust himself to tell a story well.In any case, I found the writing ham-fisted, perhaps appropriate for readers in the 9-13 age group but not for older - or for that matter, more sophisticated - readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review #218","review":"I do not think that I can add anything that has not been said about this book but wanted to cast my vote.

The package was well protected and I would order again from this source."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This was a very well-written book. Its style was different than any other book I've read and I enjoyed it. Death has a cynical way of telling its reader what is going to happen and for some reason I kind of liked knowing what was going to happen and the suspense of not knowing when it was going to happen. The characters will forever be imbedded in my mind. They were all likeable and quirky! Thanks for a good read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrogant, weak writing","review":"I usually love young adult books, and the premise of this seemed so original and fun, but I was sorely disappointed. I couldn't get past the first 30 pages. The voice of the narrator was so irritating I wanted to scream. If you have to write \\"obviously\\" or \\"clearly\\" once every sentence, you shouldn't be writing anything at all. I couldn't shake the feeling that the author was trying to force a style that he was not that adept at, and at the same time seemed so pleased with himself for what he was writing, I gave up on it way before I usually would. Not worth the hype at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow!!!!!!!","review":"\\"The Book Thief\\" has been on my library shelf for sometime now just waiting for me to peruse the pages. Finally, I chose to make it my selection and began reading yesterday. Today I made it to page 195. Very rarely do I not finish a book but this novel is so painfully slow that forcing myself to continue is out of the question. In reading the many reviews again, with an overall 4 1/2 star rating, I'm baffled by their positive comments. Most books have a least some redeeming value but the only one I can find for this book is the credit I will get at the used book store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird, boring, overdone...","review":"A friend handed me this book and said \\"Incredible. This is required reading!\\" so of course I assumed it was going to be amazing. I like stories about WWII as well, so I thought I was in for a good read. I struggled to get to page 50, the writing was so dry and the voice of Death was annoying and distracting, not clever or witty like the author aimed for him to be. I figured the book would get better later on, so I continued reading. I got to page 350 and decided that it wasn't going to get better and I put it down. I could not understand how someone enjoyed that writing style, or why someone enjoyed such a boring story...I'd rather read Anne Frank's diary, thank you very much. This book is all hype!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very sophisticated prose and symbolism","review":"Unless your teen has good knowledge of what happened in Germany during World War II, an exceptional vocabulary and the ability to read flowery and vague symbolic passages (many) and make sense of them, it will be a tough read. The book is fine if you're reading it with them, but if they're reading it independently they will be quite frustrated and only get about 70% of what's going on. Knowledge of communism, Nazi philosophy, what happened in concentration camps (specifically), and why Germany would have been bombed by someone (the book never says who is bombing) are essential. The end of the book leaves too many unanswered questions - it's as if the author thought 550 pages was enough and didn't finish his story lines well at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Xmas present","review":"Haven't consulted the recipient of this present, but assume it was good, as they would most certainly have told me if they didn't like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So boring.","review":"I simply don't get what everyone loved about this book.

Another frustrating snooze."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculously SLOW! Worst book I've read","review":"This book was so boring and so paced. It is the first book I have started and didn't finish. I managed to get 50 pages from the end and couldn't take another second of this. I hate the way \\"Death\\" narrates, he is beyond annoying! This book just drags on forever.

It is told is some of the most haunting prose I've ever read. The characters and scenes are rendered so beautifully, they linger long after the book is put away.Markus Zusak seems an amazingly young man to write with such lyrical beauty and poignant insight.

It has been my favorite book for six years. I have read it several times, but never finished it; I always stopped 1/2 way or 3/4 through it. Then a few months later I would pick it up and start over. I never wanted to finish it because I never wanted to know how it ended and I to say good bye to the characters. The first time was difficult because I began reading it right after my cancer surgery and I didn't know how much longer my story would last. And, it is narrated by Death, a very objective observer of the main character's life. It may seem morbid at first, but I learned that Death has nothing personal against me through this book. Thank you Markus Zusak for writing such an amazing story and such an amazing piece of literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reignited my love of storytelling","review":"After a lengthy hiatus, this beautiful well-told story has reignited my love of reading and reminded me of the power of books.

Thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning!!","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read. I had a hard time putting it down. I sat in utter stillness and awe as I finished the book. I thought it was profound and stunning. Through the eyes of Liesel, the main character, I experienced a story about WWII and Nazi Germany in a way I had never experienced it before. The fact that the book is narrated by Death is a clever and interesting twist. Liesel, Rudy, Hans, Max...and, yes, Death....I shall never forget you and I thank you for your courage and your lives. Bravo!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It took me three times","review":"It took me three times to get into this book as the author's writing style is different. However, when I started it the third time, I read nearly 350 pages straight through. I don't know what was different but this book is definitley different. I know this is recommended for high school students although I only know a few who would really be able to get into the book. The reader's guide was helpful and the imagery that Death provides is very provacative. Unlike make books in the genre of Holocaust/WWII fiction this one touches on the lives of \\"ordinary\\" Germans which makes it worth reading. I would give it five stars but for the difficulty in getting started. All I can say is buy the book and don't give up. There will come a time when it makes sense and then you can't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most incredible book I have ever read!!!!","review":"I can't adequately express how moved I was by this book.

It is one of the best, most moving books I have read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"you have got to read this!","review":"If you like quick reads. This book.is not for you. What i loved so much about this book are getting to know the characters and how they grow on you. The ending of a book never made me emotional like this one. Its an amazing read narrated by death which makes this book so different from the rest.

This fictional account of a German family during WWII shows in a compelling manner how lower economic families may have reacted to Hitler's rise to power ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"What an amazing read! I found the first 30 pages a bit weird, since the book is narrated by death, but once the book becomes solely about the adopted daughter of a german family during WW2, living in Germany, I couldn't put it down.The author had researched the underlying subject matter thoroughly and wrote a realistic impression of WWII.A highly recommended read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable","review":"This book is unlike anything I have read before.

A solid punch in the gut.Made me miss a day of work to complete (Warning!) and had me howling in the end, something I don't remember doing from \\"To kill a Mockingbird\\" and \\"The Snowgoose\\" over two decades ago.Maybe a little slow initially nad sentimental towards the end, but a true masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read!","review":"Well written. In spite of my promise to myself that I would avoid WWII themes (too many currently), i couldn't put this one down. Not the very best literature - but a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bookworm","review":"This book is very moving. The way it was written, transports you back to Nazi Germany and shows what it was like to live during World War II. The relationship that forms between the girl and the Jew says that even is someone or something is repressed because of the beliefs of one person, it doesn't mean that you have to believe that too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book ever!","review":"I've been reading 2-4 books a month for years and I can honestly say THE BOOK THIEF is my favorite read of all time. I never reread books....I just have too many to read. But after reading this book it's hard to resist going back to page 1 and starting all over again. I read it last year and just reread it. I think I may read it once a year! The story was so real for me it's hard to believe these characters don't exist. Do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of this book. Liesel Meminger, Rudy Steiner, Hans and Max will stay in your heart for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Unique Perspective","review":"This book was not what I had expected it too be when I started out. It was written from the perspective of Death, during a very dark part of the world's history . . . The Holocaust.Very well written, very moving.It proves that some people know the right things to do . . .even if they are on the wrong side. They knowgoodness and compassion.Very well written. I highly suggest reading this moving story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, wow..","review":"This book has the saddest twist ending ever, but it's the most endearing story ever. For real, this is the best book ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written","review":"The Book Thief vividly illustrates the very best and the very worst in us, the soaring heights of the daily happiness of life and the drowning feeling of grief in sudden loss. Zusak manages this without the reader (or at least this reader) feeling manipulated. He puts forth a powerful message of living life in the present, of realizing that happiness happens everyday in so many small ways, by showing time and again how everything can change in an instant. Beautifully written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive!","review":"Fantastic imagery, descriptive, emotional and addictive. This book was recommended to me by friends and I am delighted to pass on the recommendation. Read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to put down","review":"I read this book as a preview for my 10 year old daughter. I wanted to make sure it was worth recommending to her. I found it engrossing and had trouble putting it down. It's so heart breaking and compelling. I sympathized with so many of the characters. There's goodness even in the darkest times. The characters are so real you want to hug them. The harsh sounding foster-mother with the heart of gold. I highly recommend this book. Sad but hopeful...life can be harsh...but there are many wonderful people in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book Theif","review":"On my top ten list. Beautifully written. Although the style is very different I got used to it quickly. A side of the holocaust I have not often read about. Characters a very well drawn. I just loved this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beatiful Heartbreaking","review":"I have read many, many books in my life, but seldom have I found one as beautiful, rich, and heat rending as this one. This book plunges you into another world and shows both the beauty and the horror of it with unflinching honesty. You live through the eyes, mind, and heart of the main character. You would have to be made of stone to be unmoved at the end of the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I bought this book and started reading it, one week later a bought a Nook (my husband had The Book Thief on his Nook so he lent it to me) so now I'm reading it on my Nook.

I'm getting everything he wrote before it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have ever read","review":"A hard book to pick up, but even harder to put down. When I first started reading it, I put it back on the shelf. After some time, I took it up again aand was mesmerized with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Masterpiece","review":"Simply amazing, breathtaking and brilliant. There is so much I could say about this book, yet I almost can't find words fitting enough for such a fantastic novel. Death is a unique, strange, but wonderful narrator, who speaks bluntly, yet often apologetically. Liesel's story is one of the most moving tales I have read in a very long time. This book affected me more deeply than any other I can remember. A must read for teens and adults of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for children only!","review":"The Book Thief is so much more than a *young adult book! While written simply enough for a young adult to enjoy, I think an adult would get so much more from it. The use of Death as the story-teller gives a dimension that I can only sit in awe over. And what a beautiful, sensitive depiction of death it is! It is one of the very few books I will read again. Five stars aren't enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read this book","review":"This book must be read by everyone. It is a little hard getting into and had I not had to read for book club I wouldn't have. BUT!!!! Once you are grabbed, it is an awesome book. The characters are well developed and the message is something that must be gotten out. The writing is creative and imaginative as well as realistic. The author captures the nature of each person with much insight and sensitivity. Really, if you don't own it yet GO PURCHASE IT AND GET STARTED NOW!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was brilliant!","review":"This book was amazing. At first I was skeptical as it was formated a little differently than most \\"typical books,\\" and through the first part of the book, I remained skeptical and considered just putting it away and not finishing it, but I am sooo glad I didn't. I soon forgot the different format and was hooked. The story was told beautifully, and the ending would not have had the impact it did if it had been told any differently.This book made the holocaust and the World War more real for me than any other book I've read on the subject. I loved the writer, and his straightforward style. This book was pure genious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful Read","review":"Trying to finish this book can only be compared to a dentist appointment. You feel obligated to show up, but it's not fun for a second. The book wanders through over 500 pages without ever really making up its mind about the central plot. As a result, the reader feels like there is no end in sight.The writing style may be beautiful, but it ultimately was about nothing. I felt no connection to the two dimensional characters. The content is trite and have been done better in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice book","review":"I haven;t read the book yet but it feels great. I am listening to the audio book now.

Read to Part 4, then skip to Part 9 and you won' t miss a thing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster","review":"The underlying story of a book-stealing foster girl harboring a Jew in Nazi Germany was certainly interesting.

I started it years ago and put it down. I found it hard to get into. Then enough people have told me how much they enjoyed it that I gave it another shot and really forced myself to read it. NOT WORTH IT. By the end I was skimming. I found it quite slow except for a few moments in the book. It was only after discussing with someone again that they agreed that some people love it and others, not so much. My recommendation is if you don't love it after reading the sample, don't bother. The rest is just more of the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Book Thief","review":"Most likely you'll like this book. I'm NOT into sad story or this kind.

He said it's GOOD. Sad story"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow.. Slow.. Really Slow..","review":"Picked it up cause of the great reviews on Amazon, but was disappointed.It is not a 4.5 star book for me.The narration is interesting but honestly the story takes forever to take off, drags a lot n depresses you by the third of the book.But again, some people dig depressors. :)There are better books to recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have recommended this book over and over!","review":"The Book Thief has been a favorite of mine. I recommend it to anyone who asks for a good book to read. It gives you a look back into time and perspective of some of what the people were going thru. What you had to do to survive. It's a good book with good characters and it's a novel in which you can learn something. I recommend that you read it and that you have your children read it. It's a wonderful thing when you can learn a lesson from a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull reading","review":"I would have never bought this book, except we were reading it in book club. Very dull, slow and not work the effort"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent","review":"I'm surprised to see this listed as a young adult book. It is written from a very different perspective and a different flow than usual. I didn't like how it jumped around a little. However the story itself was very gripping and I wished for more information at the end. Like, if Liesel and Max got married or stayed friends, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely overrated.","review":"I found this book boring and basically uninteresting. I had to read it for a teen book group and I struggled to get through it. I don't know why all the hype -- I have read many novels and many nonfiction books on the Holocaust that were much better than this one. I did not like the narrator \\"Death\\" nor its point of view observing the action and remarking upon it.Apparently I'm out on a limb as a lone dissenter on this forum, but I'm a school librarian at a high school and the kids in my book group didn't rank it highly either. They preferred other titles such as Sarah's Key, The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, The Upstairs Room, I Will Plant You a Lilac Tree, Skeletons at the Feast, and The Final Journey -- to name a few."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I agree with all the rest of the one star reviews. Because it was chosen as a book for my book club to read, I tried it and after 200 pages or so, decided not to finish it. I thought the writing was aimed for the young adult, unsophisticated readers...about an 8th grade level, and for those of the population who are not very familiar with WW2. I just don't see all the hype...I've read so many novels that are superior and far more interesting. This is a book that someone who likes the Harry Potter series may enjoy...I guess. I like more realistic writing with more depth. I hope our next book club selection is better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY OVER-RATED","review":"The Book Thief (Readers Circle)AN OVER-HYPED BOOK--I THINK THIS IS A PSUEDO INTELLECTUAL ENDEAVOR--IMPOSSIBLE TO GET INTO THIS STORY- THE WRITING IS RATHER POOR- THE AUTHOR TRIES WAAAY TOO HARD- BUT I YHINK I AM IN THE MINORITY BASED ON PREVIOUS REVIEWS"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so happy :o)","review":"I've ordered used books on many occasions from amazon before.

Boring, slow, extremely weak plot. The multiple stories of Liesels life were very disjointed and did very little to push the story to its ending, which after reading I still don't know what it is. And the foreshadowing ensured that there was not a single surprise to be had. Waste of time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Book Thief","review":"How can I give it less than 1 star? Or negative? I can not imagine how this book received so many positive reviews. I want to know what psychotropic drugs the author was on.

I will never buy another Kindle book without the preview feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Why the large number of positive reviews? Does this mean that the book is yet another one chosen for first one book group and then another? Red flag!!! I found the narration by \\"Death\\" to be so contrived that I couldn't make it past the few pages. No matter how compelling the actual story might be, this self-counscious, annoying literary device made the book unreadable. Pay attention to the negative reviews, and spare yourself this tedious narrative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whine, whine, whine, whine","review":"I made it through about 50 pages. I stopped in the middle of what seemed a never-ending whiny rant by the washerwoman about her clients. A good author would have found a way to capture it all in a sentence or two. I found the same wordiness in the prologue during which the author tried to establish the narrator's MO. An author supposedly wrote a friend \\"I don't have time to write you a short letter, so I'm writing you a long letter.\\" This author should have found the time to write us a short book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much swearing...","review":"Initially, I thought this book was great.

Too drawn out."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought this book was pedantic, sentimental and ridiculous","review":"I found \\"Death\\" supercilious, snide and surprisingly sentimental. Obviously written for children, very repetitive. Also, I think calling Leisle a \\"book thief\\" was a little over done. She doesn't become a thief until she's shown that the books are hers for the taking, even destroying.This book covered a serious time, was filled w/redundant, often unnecessary cursing, highly repetitive and irritating.I deeply resented this book and found it tedious. I do not understand these ridiculous praises for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slooooooooooooow!","review":"I got to page 267 after two months.

You need to read this novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Literary work of tragic art","review":"IF you lived during WWII and the aftermath, you will find this beautifully written work a reflection of what must have been experience of all the children in Germany, Nazi or otherwise. It contains such an undercurrent of sorrow (assuming you lived in that time) and, at the same time the mind of a child that the writer must have had a personal muse to assist him with the story. Unlike some reviewers, I would not categorize this book as a teenage novel. Life is hard enough without adding to their reality. For zealots of war, it is a good book as it demonstrates the price of bigotry and as they say \\"there but for the grace of God go I\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very slow and much too long","review":"A few friends recommended this book and I had read many good reviews so I was looking forward to it.

I had a little trouble getting into it at first. After about 85 pages I called the friend who recommended it to ask why she loved it so much. She told me to persevere and I will be greatly rewarded. So rarely do I have tears in my eyes while reading. There are many well written powerful books on the market with heart wrenching tales to tell but this book does it so well without being maudlin and manipulative.

It is not a happy story but poignant and beautifully and poetically written. After reading this book, by a relatively young author I had to read up on Markus Zusak.

The author has given the world a treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book of the year","review":"This is by far the most beautiful book I have ever read. I am amazed it is Young Adult and think it should absolutely be in the Adult section as well. I began reading this book on an airplane and finished in the privacy of my own home, thank goodness; the tears flowed rapidly toward the end of the book. It takes place during the holocaust, it is impossible to not be a sad book. However, at the same time it is educating and incredibly heart-warming.

I'll recommend it over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"A brilliant novel about a young German girl's personal journey during WWII in Nazi Germany. Foster child, illiterate, best friend, rebel: Liesel Meminger is all these things and more -- and the path leading to her future is paved with words. This is a stunning novel, told, quite unusually, in the first \\"person\\" by Death. Zusak's prose is poetic and filled with imagery. A thoroughly absorbing read.- C.A. Wulff, author of Born Without a Tail"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and memorable book...","review":"I bought the Audio version of this book after reading quite a few recommendations.It starts off a little dark and bizarre. As the story slowly evolved I found myself drawn in by this wonderful tale. The author has managed to combine the horror of the second World War with the day to day reality of life, of a German family. The author gives us glimpses into the happenings beyond the town in which the story takes place via the character of Death.I loved the way the narrator Allan Corduner made the story come alive and his perfect pronunciation of the German words made it even more of a joy to listen to.My daughter and I listened to it together and the occasional, actually quite a few, Saukerl and Saumensch, would make her giggle. That element of laughter despite the terrible story within the folds of this book, is what will make me remember this story for a very long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Excellent book to humanize ordinary citizens and children in Germany during this black mark in mankind's history. Prior to purchasing, the discription was helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful and touching. A Must Read!","review":"I loved this book. The narrator is Death and he tells a compelling story of a young German girl, during the years leading up to and during World War II. We all know the horrors that occurred in Germany during this time period, but this book offers a touching perspective that really makes you think. It is well written and imaginative. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super book","review":"Love the construction of the sentences. One of my favorite books around.. Will read it again for the enjoyment. Have recommended the book to everyone I know."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book Thief","review":"I loved this book. Being British and born just as world war 2 was ending I heard a lot about the devastation of the London blitz. This book is about ordinary people trying to live their lives in Germany during the war. Although it is set during a brutal time and is about the plight of the jews, it is also a book about love. I really wanted Liesel and Max to be together at the end but this was not made clear. A wonderful book that stays with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-hyped, in-your-face","review":"This book did not live up to the hype. The story was full of cliches and stereotypes, and the narration by Death was so overwrought -- an annoying gimmick that was kept up and stretched out throughout the book. And for a book that is against Nazism, it's surprisingly racist, with a use of blackface that's actually praised as an act of courage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written","review":"The Book Thief is an easy read that I was unable to put down. The characters are well developed and the book paints such a vivid picture, you feel as if you are there, on Himmel street, with Leisel, Rudy and their families. I feel this book deserved more hype than it got, but then again--I think 2007 was around the time the Twilight books gained popularity for Young Adult readers--'nuf said.

Yes, the main character (Liesel) steals books, but only ones that have been left for the taking. Once the characters of the small town are set in place, the author brings in Max, the Jewish boy who hides in the basement of Liesel's house. Max brings new purpose to the family who hides him. And although the reader never gets to fully know Max, his presence allows the other characters to grow exponentially. Beautiful relationships are formed within the Nazi horrors of the small town. The author does a tremendous job in showing the power words have in both destroying and building relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique treatment - great read","review":"This book is very unique in style and narrative form -- also would be a very good read for a younger adult/teenager who is getting into the more adult novel format.

My initial reaction was shock that this somewhat \\"brutal\\" book was a Young Adult book -- I think it might be too harsh for many teens. This is why I held back one star.That said, it was interesting. The narrative is done in a way that might take some getting used to -- at first it annoyed me, but, shortly, I got into the swing of things. There are a lot of Holocaust stories out there, starting with the Diary of Ann Frank, but this takes a different tack, a different point of view.In the end, I was glad to have read it, to have stuck with it to the end. I would recommend it to people who are interested in this kind of reading. As a matter of fact, if it is just the title that attracts you, then you will probably enjoy it. When all is said and done, though, I don't think I will read anything more by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"If a book is great you do not want to put it down .

The way the author presents the story is captivating, surprising and filled with phrases that cause the reader to pause a moment to enjoy the use of words. The story gets close to the heart and causes joy and sadness intertwined.The Book Thief brings to life a young girl's story in the heart of Nazi Germany. The thoughts of the Narrator give the reader a totally new angle of thought. I loved it. This is a book I will want to keep."},{"rating":"2","title":"For middle school through middle age and then some","review":"Although I originally purchased this book to challenge some of my middle school students, it took me three months to get a copy into my classroom. After I read it twice, I passed it to a friend. It was taking too long to make the circuit, so I bought another to take to class, but offered it to a fellow teacher on the way in to the building. You can see where this is going, right? After purchasing three copies, I finally landed one in the classroom- for one class period. Then it was gone, making the circuit of the kids. As far as I have been able to determine, the 26 or 27 people I've loaned it to have all read it completely, most have read it completely twice, and all have found it well worth their time. The audience has ranged from 13 year old football stars to retirees, with clergy, and a few teachers, and a lawyer in between. This is for anyone who reads books, deeply or superficially. Get one, or, better yet, two."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was a chore...","review":"I think there is a reason why this book is in the Young Adult section. Because it received great reviews, I thought that it would be one of those best sellers would be worth reading. It wasn't. Let's just say that not because something is easy to read, it means that it's necessarily good. Nothing impacted me, the language did not impress me and neither did the story. Nothing really happens in the book, I mean, I think there were like 3 main events and the rest is just kids being kids. And the whole, \\"I'm a little girl thirsty for more books\\" is just something I didn't buy. I shy away from best sellers because they usually lack quality, although there are exceptions like \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\" and \\"The DaVinci Code\\". By the time I got halfway through, all I wanted was to finish it and end my suffering. Oh, and by the way, I'm a 29 yr. old woman using my boyfriend's account to write this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate it...","review":"I'm trying to work my way through to finish this book, but it is doubtful. I hate the disjointed writing style. Author takes forever to get to the point. I wouldn't have picked up on the point that it is being told from the point of view of the \\"grim reaper\\" if I hadn't read the reviews, the author doesn't just spell it out. All the vague, poetic inserts are just annoying. I can't see any \\"young adult\\" wanting to be bothered with this...but I honestly feel there is a good story underlying the poor writing method and that's what will make me finish it on principal I suppose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously?","review":"I can't help but shake my head at some of the previous reviews of what is ultimately an okay-but-not-great book. My family recently finished Pullman's The Golden Compass and Lewis's Narnia. Now these are great books worthy of claims of 10-star ratings. This one? Not really. My kids and I struggled to get through this and it seemed more like work than fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a fantastic read for adults and teens","review":"I heard about this book on Public Radio and I read it, even though it is written for teens. It kept me glued to the pages with a perspective not often seen. It is written about a young German girl during the war and the narrator is Death. The character Death is as amazing as the young girl Leisel and those around her. His care of the souls he collects and the colors he sees in everything thoughtful and caring.

Thank you Mr. Zusak, I will forever have Liesel and the other characters in my heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but not great","review":"Zusak is an amazing writer; flowery, poetic, original. However -- this book could have easily been trimmed by 200 pages. It took forever to get to plot points and the pacing is, well, painfully slow. I couldn't wait to finish it.

The one with the je ne sais quoi, intangible quality, that makes you feel that you've lived it, right along with the characters.Well, believe me, this one is it. It is not a young adult book. It's an everyone-should-read-it book. I put it down and, surprisingly, cried for a couple of minutes.

It's narrated by Death, which is an interesting twist to the story. The youthfulness of The Book Thief also contributes to the wider innocence of it. It's set in Germany during World War II, adn focuses on a little girl named Liesel Meminger. She steals books to read after she is robbed of her brother, who dies at the very beginning. She finds a sort of peace in her books. Her mother also left, so she had to enter foster care. A bunch has been taken from her. Zusak is great at metaphors and the writing itself. His writing is mesmerizing. It's wondrous. You can practically feel th emotion dripping from these pages. The sarcasm was also a nice touch. It's very possible to be impressed and overwhelmed by moments in The Book Thief. This book is beautifully written. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes to read-- or even people who don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read","review":"It was hard for me to believe that this is a Young Adult novel.

I rarely come across a book where I get so attached to a character and absolutely, positively must find out what happens to him/her. The Book Thief is such a book. It gives gripping insight into what it must have been like to live in Germany under Hitler's rule, and the risks people took to protect the innocent Jews from his madness. I give it five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite gifts","review":"Markus Zusak was on the Diane Rehm's show a number of years ago, and I listen to him read most of the first chapter. I was completely pulled in. I went in search of the book. A check a number of book stores, no one had it. I finally broke down and asked a clerk at a store, who finally found that it was a young adult book.....I was sure it was adult fiction. If I had not heard that first bit of the book I might not have bought it. Best decision I made. This book is always the top of my list of favorite all time books. I recommend it to everyone, and I think I have given to almost everyone I know. As I think about it......I'm not sure I have given it to anyone under age 25.

While I can easily understand that the style may not be to everyone's taste (and may even be grating to some), I'm almost offended that people could say the writing is \\"bad.\\" The writing is spectacular. This is the English language as it was meant to be treated. It's purely artistic.As for the story itself, I found it thoroughly engaging: the terrors of the Holocaust lurk behind the snapshot of a seemingly tranquil German town. The atrocities of the Holocaust are not news to me, and still I cried several times while reading.

I have read a number of books about the Holocust but this one was the most unusual in its contents. The book, narrated by Death, was a combination of character building, historical settings and content and included books within the book. The books were written by characters, a Jew in hiding, and the main character, Liesel. Through her eyes and memories we are shown a period of time in Germany that must be remembered. She is an observer but also a participant. She never realizes what she is providing for all those who come in contact with her. In some ways, I think of her as an Anne Frank. Anne shares her days in her diary with the reader-Liesel also shares her days leading up to the end of her life in Germany. It is a story that will remain in my memory for a long time. P.

I thought it was a bit slow at the beginning, but by the middle of the book, I was hooked. The main character is very likable, and, by the end of the book, I even ended up liking her foster mother who is thoroughly unpleasant in the beginning. There is a bit of bad language (espcially from the foster mother), but it is mild. The story of the main character's journey more than makes up for that. I wouldn't really call this a children's book (although I know it received children's awards) just because of the contenet (war, death, etc) and the complex emotional issues.

I borrowed the cd set at the library and it is wonderful!! The narration is fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for teens and adults","review":"In a story told by death, Zusak gives us the tale of a foster child living in Nazi Germany. Liesel finds many ways to subvert the fatherland, including stealing a book from a burning, leaving food for prisoners, and, with her family, hiding a Jewish man in the basement. Because the story is told by death, the reader is given a glimpse into Liesel's life, but also shown the wider view of an exhausted Death during World War II.Quote: \\"He chose his words gradually. \`Don't get caught.' This from a man who'd stolen a Jew.\\"I really liked this book. The idea of Death being an observer of life- given a task to do regardless of personal feelings- is very interesting. A unique tale. Additionally, there is a cast of primary and secondary characters introduced, which adds a great dimension to the story since they are all fascinating individuals. Although it is classified as \\"youth fiction,\\" it is quite sizable (over 500 pages), and would be good reading for most adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"The book starts out with the main character Leisel Meminger who lives in Munich, Gemany, and tells about her family when she was little.

I find it so creative, so wistful and beautiful. I love the way Death is characterized in this book with his haunted, mixed feelings for humans. I found all the characters to be well developed and so very human. I think a lot of people these days have a problem with sublety and if a book is not in-your-face they cannot comprehend its value.

Being a long book, it would appear daunting but once you start reading, you find the pages dissolve beneath your fingers. This book is moving, powerful, symbolic and above all, beautiful. The characters are excellent, well moulded and loveable. The setting is tragic but very real, as it is obviously based on war-time Germany. I would reccommend this book to anyone. Although the target audience is named as young adults, I believe this may be because Zusak has also written other books aimed at this market. This is one of the best books I have ever read and I would recommend it it anyone and everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Worthy Story, Drowned in Bad Writing","review":"\\"The Book Thief\\" offers a worthy story drowned in bad writing.

How sad that books are now being dumbed down in this way! As an adult, I found the book extremely difficult to get through and the story very contrived. I never identified with or cared for any of the characters and thus felt the book was a huge waste of time.

Now I can see that a large number of people really liked this book, and I had hoped for the same results, but for me it didn't work.I felt the need to write a review (as have some others) so that the 5 stars don't totally overwhelm.The end of the book is better than the beginning and middle, if you can get that far.I wish you luck.MR"},{"rating":"1","title":"It read like a book about racist of Jews","review":"Poorly written book this was racist against Jews. There was question about whether the author/writer leans toward the nazi irrational line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Condition","review":"I purchased this book and the condition was misrepresnted. The seller claimed the condition was good, but instead of the book being listed as good, it should have been listed as heavily used., slightly damaged. When I recieved the book, I was horrified to discover that the first four pages were missing, the cover was falling off, there were various stains on the outside of the book and some pages,and there crusted food stains on various pages. The seller of this book ought to be consulted and reprimanded."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite read of 2007","review":"I found this in the young adult section of Borders. I browsed through the book and put it back on the shelf. I returned to my office and kept thinking about the book. I decided to order it. Thank the reader's God! It was beautiful. I became part of the story. This is not just for young adults. I think everyone should take a day off and dive into this magic novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book Thief","review":"This is being read but all the Junior High classes at my daughters school so I decided to read it. It was excellent. It is a very compelling story taking place during Nazi Germany. It invoked many good discussions. I felt it talked about a horrific period of history in a way which was digestible by young teens and showed the compassion of many of the Germans."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best novel I've ever read.","review":"\\"***HERE IS A SMALL FACT***You are going to die...I'm nothing if not fair,\\" starts Death himself's narration of this perfectly written novel about Liesel, an illiterate, German orphan girl, who struggles with the death of her younger brother as she tries to assimilate into her new life on, ironically, Himmel (Heaven) Street. With her father, who is shunned by the Nazi party for his sympathetic actions toward Jews, she learns to read the books she steals, while befriending some unlikely characters. Death - witty, prophetic and ever-present, takes the reader on an amazing journey through her life during the time of the Holocaust."},{"rating":"1","title":"No climax...","review":"This book wasn't for me. I had to read it for school and I found a major problem about it. It had no BIG climax. Let't take New Moon for example(I know, I don't like Twilight much either). It's climax was when Bella had to save Edward. In this book there was nothing big or obvious about that. That was the major turnoff for me. Another problem I found out about this book was that it was REALLY confusing. Usually when I'm confused it's only for the first few pages in the beginning of the book because no one knows much about the book. Well, in this book my confusion lasted for a few CHAPTERS. I was disappointed in this book because I saw all the great reviews, but after I read it I wanted by money back. If you're looking for a deep and thoughtful book, then this wasn't as bad as my review made it. Hopefully this helped you and didn't confuse you guys much.~L.M."},{"rating":"1","title":"From my POV","review":"I was hesitant about the price of $9.99, but got it anyways. I opened to the first chapter and it was very confusing. I figured I would push through it and maybe the next chapter would be better. For me,it was very hard to understand. Especially when the boy died, that made no sense whatsoever. His lips were in need of repainting? Why did he put his hand over his mouth? Why did he die? Never told us. I read through part one and didn't finish it. Worst waste of 10 bucks ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"I cannot finish this book","review":"I just do not get this book, and have not been able to finish it. The characters are boring, I just do not get where they come from or what is their point in the book. It seems... weird. Something is happening and I am really not into what is happening and I do not get why it is happening. It feels pointless to me.Death is funny though. I enojoy reading his/hers comments. What seems to be a great idea for me it is really not delivered.Many people like this book, so there must be some merit to it. To each his own I guess, this one is definitely not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"I don't often review Amazon books, particularly those that already have more than 800...but I was so touched by this book I felt I needed to. I picked this up on a Thursday and had it finished by Saturday afternoon because I couldn't put it down. I got sucked immediately into the world and the characters, and I wept at the ending. This is a tour de force."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read-sad but great","review":"I looked at the book and thought, wow. .a big one. I read it super fast and couldn't put it down. It is about a girl who gets separated from her mother and brother and her new family hides a jewish man in their basement. Death tells the story and is a very interesting twist on a narrator. It is a great story and although very sad it really will make you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning and heartwrenching.","review":"One of the best books I have probably ever read in my life.There really are no words to describe the simple power, poetry, and beauty of this book.

I loved it. It's been a few weeks since I finished it and I still think about the characters and the story. It took me a while to figure out the relationship between the main characters and the narrator, but it all makes sense and is a genius way to tell the knife's edge story of life and death, joy and sadness, hope and despair.

I love the characters in his stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for any book lover","review":"If I were to describe this book in the manor of the book itself I would think that its color would be blue. Not just any blue mind you but the pure blue of the sky after a rainstorm. The blue that is so beautiful it makes you happy and sad at the same time. This book chronicles the life of a child in Nazi Germany during WWII. It is Schindler's List and the Diary of Ann Frank rolled into one. This story is narrated by the soul collector and this unusual view point gives this book a unique twist on reality that is both creepy and compelling at the same time. I laughed and cried until my sides hurt. I think that this book is wonderful and a must read. For anyone who likes drama, or historical fiction or an all around good book. It is going on my to read again list!"},{"rating":"2","title":"bold, smart","review":"For the first few pages I was unsure about this book--the tone and writing felt arrogant, but then again, the narrator is Death (who better to be arrogant?). I kept going and was glad I did. This is a very skillfully written story populated with engaging characters. Generally I shy away from children as protagonists, but a child's eye view of the holocaust from a small village is new (to me, at least) and I very much enjoyed this book. I was surprised that the author was a young Australian. He did well by his subject matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"People love it","review":"People love this, but I can't say that I do. It was eh.

I don't appreciate reviews that recap the story, because that's the point of reading the book in the first place. What's key to note is that The Book Thief is beautifully written and cleverly crafted and if you don't read it, you're missing out on something very special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved All Except the Ending","review":"The author can turn a phrase. His story telling and wit throughout the book made for a compelling and emotional page turner that I enjoyed right up to the ending. The ending left me wanting; I would not say more but wanting something. I was so engrossed in the book I was shocked it was over. It felt like a great romance that turned into a one night stand.I do not want to give away the ending nor do I want to pull this book down as I did enjoy the time I spent with \\"The Book Thief\\" and look forward to more stories from this surprising writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reader Limitations Ignored","review":"Sorry, but wasn't what I had hoped for.

Ken is a great instructor and there are plenty of close-ups and little details and tips that most instructional programs forget to mention. This a great program for the beginner and for anyone who has danced before. Ken and his beautiful assistant do a great job at demonstrating the steps.I read a few reviews left by others and of course this program is to get you started. It is volume 1, and it should be expected to be followed by volume 2 and so on... Too much information or too many moves on a single DVD or program can be overwhelming, so my wife and I were very happy with what was offered in this volume. To learn is best to take it slow; practice and practice - learn the moves until they become second nature. Of course we want more - so we'll be waiting for Ken's second DVD and more if he plans to release other volumes. Excellent work Ken!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Little Content.","review":"Although this DVD was useful for it's sidenotes, such as foot positioning, posture, etc. It did not contain much in terms of actual steps.

I'm not even a serious DVD collector, but the book gives great trivia about all my favorite shows (when they aired, what the names of the original stars were, which episodes went down in TV history). This book is really a history of TV in America, and it covers so many different categories that it really does solve the gift problem for just about everyone on my Christmas list. They won't be able to read just one or two of the listings; once they start in, the trivia will have them hooked.

Good to take to the store or keep next to the TV. And if you read the fine print, you'll see that this book was made with the help of data from TVshowsonDVD.com, which is the best place I've seen online for that sort of info. Cool 'dat, and maybe for the next edition of the book TV Guide will work more with that website's staff to talk more about what's new, what's not out (any hints as to why), and what's expected to come soon.

I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I purchased Dr. Frank's Joint & Muscle Paint Relief Oral Spray from their own web site. Not only does the product not work, but they have a \\"gimmick\\" of charging you monthly. EVEN when you indicate on your order that you don't want it to be shipped automatically each month. I returned the product each month, and they kept saying they never received them. They evidently are lost in the mail. Every month? It's a huge scam.

What you are buying here is very expensive water. Homeopathy is the idiotic belief that to cure a disease you should take something that causes the disease's symptoms (but hey, it sounds better when you dress it up in Latin: similia similibus curantur. Oooh...). But wait! It's OK, because it's diluted so much that there's nothing left of the thing that causes the symptoms. Those who push homeopathy claim that the water remembers having had the stuff in it... but then tap water has had everything in it, so if homeopathy is true, tap water should be a homeopathic cure for everything, and you can save your money.Seriously, don't waste your time or money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"quackery","review":"It is well known among scientists that homeopathic \\"remedies\\" have no beneficial effect other than a placebo effect. They can't. They are essentially pure water with a \\"memory\\" of a substance that has long disappeared through extensive dilution. The \\"law of similars\\", etc., is centuries-old superstition. It is amazing to me that the stuff is still sold. I suppose that if people want to spend their cash on a placebo it is their business. It may be a psychological benefit even if it has no curative value. It makes me angry, though, when this quack starts advertising his snake oil as a remedy for arthritis in dogs (as seen on TV). Just spray a little bit in their water every day. Sure. The problem I have with this is that the subject dogs have no knowledge of this. They have no hope for a cure, so they cannot benefit from a placebo effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use Caution!","review":"First, the product did nothing for me. Of course that doesn't mean that it won't work for you. My complaint however, involves their very deceptive marketing practices.

Y'see, Alan Moore created T. Strong and wrote the stories up until issue #22. The Moore-fanatics among us (including me) would have preferred that he'd penciled each and every tale. Alas, he turned his character and his fictional world over to others. But this enjoyable series and it's \\"science hero\\" continues to entertain and amuse. See if you don't particularly enjoy issues #29 & #30, where Tom is trapped in a frankly miserable universe and discovers some terrible things about his own past. It is somehow quite funny at the end and HIGHLY recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap junk","review":"I bought this to fill my air tank so I did not have to hold the chuck.

It will not go on enough on shorter stem to lock on, I am constantly forced to hold it on tightly which negates the function of a lock on. When doing trailer tires and questionable car tires having you head next to them is not my idea of fun. This was supposed to be a solution and allow me to fill the tire from 6 or so feet away.

We got to know more about the characters and began to identify with them and then...it was canceled. Since they didn't know it was going to be canceled there was no real \\"finale\\" to the show. We were left with big cliffhangers and no answers. It's really unfortunate that it wasn't renewed...it was a lighthearted sitcom that had so much potential.

I mounted one of these units under a shelf in the stereo cabinet and then plugged all stereo items into the strip. The power strip has an illuminated power switch, so I can tell from across the room if it's on or not; when I'm done listening to music, I turn off the power strip and I know every one of my stereo components is now off. Plus, all the components' power cords are now fairly organized rather than being a rat's nest behind the cabinet.Seems to be very well made, definitely a step up from consumer grade power strips."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful (and hard to find) Herbal Tea!","review":"Celestial Seasonings' Honey Peach Ginger is hands-down my favorite herbal tea - which has been a dilemma, since it is hard to find in a store in my area.

When stevia leaf is used sparingly it is fine but when there is alot used, it will have bitter taste to it. If you are looking for a tea that helps with digestion, I highly recommend trying Celestial Seasonings Tummy Mint tea. I rated this 1 star because I love Celestial Seasonings and if you are someone that doesn't mind alternative sweeteners - you may like this tea.

The first 10 tracks are an incredible pop/punk explosion that I was hoping would follow Cellscape. This is Melt Banana that anyone can like, yet it is just tweaked out enough to not bore those bored by pop. Cracked Plaster Cast may just be my favorite MB song ever, but then Crow's Paint Brush might also be. These song have melodies the make me want to move.After that it turns into a whole new album and goes back to old school MB. Total noise that comes as a total contrast to earlier songs. They didn't forget where they came from. They only improved the recording quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best MxBx yet!!!!","review":"Anyone whose listened to Melt Banana before would know that they never dissapoint. Every one of their albums has been absolutley incredible, and every song is killer. This album is no exception. And in my opinion, the best one yet. Bambi's Dilemma has more of a rock and roll feel this time around, while still retaining those noise rock/grindcore tendencies. Yako's vocals are absolutely incredible, and Aagata(guitar) seems to be playing more actual riffs this time. All in all, if you like Melt Banana, you know what your getting. If this is your first Melt Banana cd, this is where you should start.

Here is a guy who throws away his marriage because they fight a little and she, oh my goodness isn't perfect because she doesnt want her son to have a poster of an admitted devil worshipper and who admits to having aborted babies in jars, on her kids wall! It just seems so contrived and cowardly. Being married to a fireman sucks because they r not around to help with the kids, although it is easier than being married to a serviceman. The kids come off as selfish jerks who use their mother as an excuse to get daddy's attention; a common enemy, however it makes no sense, bonds them.

But I really like what is there, and would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This One's Going Back","review":"I'm not entirely certain what type of person the intended target for this DVD was, but it certainly is not me. It doesn't really cut it as a cardio work out, as most of the segments are too slow with too much down time in between each series of combinations while the instructor demonstrates what you will be doing. It doesn't really cut it as a toning workout, either, as there really is not much in the way of resistance. It won't work as a beginner's workout, because many of the moves/combinations are too difficult (and possibly dangerous) to be done by someone who has never worked out before. The only segment that I found enjoyable and worthwhile as a cardio workout only lasted ten minutes before she started cooling down."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not waste your time on this work out","review":"This really should get zero stars. I find it disturbing this work out dvd has as many good rating as it does. I have been doing kick boxing on and off for about five or six years now, the last several months being on. I purchased this dvd recently to mix it up. The choregraphy in this work out is horrible and it goes at a ridiculously slow pace in some spots, not to mention the same movements are done over and over and over and over and over again, so its not much of a workout. The set is hard to watch, and the dvd does not time the workouts. This is absolutely ridiculous, and its a horribly designed workout. There is no point in doing this tape, you are better off doing a workout where you actually burn some calories and don't waste time slowly repeating the same movements over and over again. This is not a pilates dvd after all. It deserves zero stars and is not a good or even decent kickboxing or cardio workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it.","review":"Overall I enjoy this workout and I always feel great afterwards. The instructor is upbeat and explains each move well. I think she does a great job of letting you know which muscles the move is intended to focus on, and continually reminds you to relax your neck and tighten your abs which I appreciate. Just a few negatives for me:-The music is a bit odd. It is some type of tribal/dance blend which doesn't always keep a constant beat. That makes it difficult to count on your own but instead forces you to look at the screen when you otherwise might not.-I would not consider this DVD to contain \\"(4) separate 20 minute workouts\\" or whatever the description claims. The menu options on the DVD really just allow you to skip to different places in 1 full workout. So the first and last 20 minute segments contain warmup and cool down, as well as less strenuous exercises while your body warms up. I usually just do all 4 segments straight through so that I capture the warm up and cool down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt get much of a workout","review":"this dvd was differnt when i went into a work out the lady was just talking it wasnt even a workout.

The most irratating part, is that you don't have to listen to her telling you to give a 100% once, but over and over again throughout the DVD. And then each time you watch it too. She just seemed way to full of herself. I mean the workout gets you sweaty, but it's not that hard. I have an extensive fitness and dance background, so being talked to like I don't know how to punch eight times in a row is unsettling.I love doing workout DVD's.

There is some closure to this story, but I am still left wanted to read more about Ari and Kiran and their lovely, fabulous dragons!!!I felt the ending was a little rushed.... Not sure what could make it better, but maybe it just comes from me wanting more story. Will eagerly grab up any other books that are written for this series! THANK YOU MERCEDES LACKEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"I couldn't wait until this book came out! i really liked Joust and i have read a lot of Lackey's books including the valdemar series which i really recomend. Anyway, Alta is a wonderful and exciting book that lives up to its predecessor Joust and i can't wait for the third one! The story is told well with twists and turns that i loved. The other characters are also very lovable and believable. Kiron, formerly Vetch, has found his place among the Altans and being only the second man to raise a dragon from birth he tries to teach the other Altan jousters what he knows and form and new type of jousters, those that raise their dragons from birth. As he does this he learns that there are always two stories to a war and that evil exists on both sides. i Highly recomend this book to anyone who has read Joust they will really enjoy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is new?","review":"Book that I purchased as NEW, damage to spine and cover, yet sold as new?

Picking up right where \\"Joust\\" left off, Lackey takes us into yet another country with a boat load of baggage. Her adept skill at character development within a plot is richly evident in the collection of friends Vech makes in his new home. Taking control of his life yet again, this cleaver young man leads a crew that will surely bring about big changes in their world.Abandon yourself in the story and you'll have a very good time. This is part of a great series that I often recommend to patrons who are looking for \\"dragon books\\", \\"something like Harry Potter/ Lord of the Rings/ Eragon/Thief Lord, ect .\\" or the mothers of reluctant readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"i liked it","review":"This was a good book but for some reason in the beginning I had a hard time getting into it.

The very simple but affecting story of Jessie, a tomboy looking for female role models and the meaning of true love. It's not just the plot, but the setting of the story, the late 50's/early 60's in rural Virginia that contributes to the tone and the feeling of the joy that Jessie has in just being alive. Many memorable scenes, like when she is riding topless on her bike on a sunny day and smelling the honeysuckle. Wonderful, wonderful book. Why is this out of print? I treasure my tattered paperback. Also check out her book \\"Fair Day and Another Step Begun\\" about a pregant young woman and her quest for the father of her baby.

I'm sad, though, that it was too thick to fit on my current vehicle, a 2008 VW Rabbit. The top of the frame is too wide/tall and hit the underside of the top of my rear bumper, so the holes would not line up properly. I gave this to a friend to put on her Jeep Rubicon. It looks great on her vehicle and adds a little subtle bling to the beef of her ride. I wish it would have worked out for my Rabbit. Oh well.

I was especially impressed with the extensive use of period newspapers. Besides being a narrative of the battle and campaign, it conatins a wealth of information on the individual units that fought on that day, with an emphasis on their community ties. It is well illustrated with good maps also. An extended bibliographic essay would have been helpful, but the preafce and the estensive list of sources would serve as an excellent starting point for anyone wanting to learn more about this important battle."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"I can honestly say that i was suprised at the quality of this book.

Additionally, there are well thought out cooked diets for cats and dogs enabling the breeder or pet owner to easily cook for their own dog(s) or cat(s).

While I bought this book for ideas for my dog, I also own cats and found quite a lot of information for them (more than in most popular pet diet books).

I can't believe it cost almost $40 for this paperback! I had to slog through pages and pages of information to find the recipes - and the amounts to make were in a different place in the book. The cat recipes are buried at the back of those for dogs, too - why couldn't he have separated out the info. for cats into a separate chapter!? The recipes are hard to follow (e.g., how much is 10 grains of bone meal? the only bone meal I could find was in a health food store and it's powdered - I have no idea how much to put in each batch). My cats won't touch most of the stuff I've concocted using this book and they still throw up the stuff they will eat (chicken and rice). I can't believe I'm stuck with this book now.

This is an epic release from a band who could have gone so much farther, if only they'd had a decent label to back them.

At one point the main character is asking this man how 3-D television works (it takes place in the future, a future that is long past now)... the man says, \\"OK, I only have fifteen minutes to talk, but let's see...\\" and the ensuing conversation lasts roughly sixty pages.If you can handle that kind of thing, well, you must know you can if you have read Keeler before.If you have not read any Keelers, start with Sing Sing Nights or Green Jade Hand.This one is my favorite.

It's comparable to a boss acoustimass system except the bass is worse(flabby and muffled, ie. you can't tell the difference between notes and you can't feel slam from drum beats).All in all not worth the price. My suggestion is spend about $150 for a stereo reciever or something with a built in radio and maybe a remote control, and get some cheap speakers to connect to it.

These speakers were a vast improvement, but they lack clarity, especially in the sub. The sub-wolfer is overpowered and does not put out a good bass sound, so you have to turn the bass way down for decent quality, but then there is a lack of bass. These speakers are also cheaply made, and the cords going into the sub feel loose, as if the connectors inside are falling off.

However, if you are looking to relax and listen to some soft grooves (music while you work), these speakers will not disappoint you."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best in the series!","review":"This is one of my favorites in the series,(it loses by the slightest margin to Lightsabers and Jedi Under Siege) because I love all the warrior women in it. Tenal Ka is definitly my favorite character in the series and the sequences from her point of veiw are my favorites. Another thing I liked about this book and the whole series actualy, was that the adults have a real part in story, instead of just being there for effect. I thought the writing was exelant, and the characters extremly well developed, and I would recamend this series to anyone, though kids ten to fifteen would probobly enjoy it best."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't want to put it down!","review":"This was, in my opinion, the best book I've read recently. The age of the characters makes it easy to relate to them, for a young teenager. I like the fact that they could be any of my friends, since they seem so normal.

Sure, everyone has to eat and foxes eat geese. We all die yet I am not ready to show my 3 year old pictures of dead people. Sorry to be a party pooper.

While the artwork is interesting, I would not call it beautiful or captivating. The moral of the story is that the moon must answer prayer, since the fox gets a goose and a duck, escapes the pursuing farmer, and enjoys the fowl meal with his canine companions in their underground home that is furnished with tables, chairs, a fireplace, etc.When looking for a children's book, I prefer something more wholesome with cheerful, uplifting and warm art and message.

I have seen them twice, both times in large venues, and they put on a show that must be seen and heard to be believed. Alvin Lee, Leo Lyons and company simply exuded so much energy. Those guys in concert were on a musical level that few others seem to attain; some rock performers half their age (or less) would do well to learn from the true masters of their craft. Professional musicianship, fantastic guitar riffs, LOUD and rocking all the way! However, my copy of this CD seems to be lacking in sound quality (even when I crank up the volume). To be sure, all the right songs are there, and the band is playing true to form (i.e. excellent), but the sound is just \\"thin.\\" Maybe I just got stuck with a poor copy. Alvin Lee and TYA deserve 5 stars, but in all honesty I must rate this CD down a notch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alvin Lee sounding great","review":"You really here how amazing Alvin is as a musician as he carries this group with obviously less talant on his shoulders with his incredable energy, creativity and soul from his guitar.He's the best, the mst underappreciated guitar player of his generation. I recommend that fans check out Alvin's \\"best\\" work which has been his solo work. If you haven't heard Zoom, which has the Bluest Blues cut with George Harrison and Jon Lord, it is WOW, and Let it Rock from 1994 and the Alvin Lee Anthology, your missing another side os Alvin Lee, playing with better bands and showing the variety of his amazing work."},{"rating":"2","title":"alvin lee's best live album","review":"An exceptional set of Ten Years After on tour in Europe in the early '70s. I CAN'T KEEP...EXTENSION ON CHORD ONE is worth the price of this CD alone but it also includes definitive versions of I'M GOING HOME; GOOD MORNING, LITTLE SCHOOLGIRL & CHOO CHOO MAMA. Lee and Chick Churchill on organ bring a few of these hard rockers to fantastic finishes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for your TYA collection","review":"I saw Ten Years After early in their careers at the Fillmore in New York. Then I saw them at Woodstock and then at The Arc in Boston. They are one of the greatest rock acts ever, live or in the studio. The unfortunate thing about this album (and this is only my selfish opinion) is that the engineering (overall sound) quality lacks here. For the most part Alvin Lee fulfills his role as one of rock's greatest guitarists. \\"Choo-choo Mama\\", \\"Good Morning Little Schoolgirl\\" and \\"I Can't Keep From Crying\\" knock me out. \\"Help Me\\" was the first TYA production I ever heard. It's up to par here. I have to say that their signature song, \\"I'm Going Home\\" is not the best on this album. The Woodstock version remains the best rendition I've ever heard. That's not becuse I was there but it is just so complete in terms of defining the group's rock and roll abilities. As I said, if you like TYA, buy this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"the oficial bootleg TYA","review":"This is the TYA official unedited bootleg provide by the band as a quality recording providing an alternative to the appalling quality boots around at the time.Leo Lyons on bass shows that that particular instrument in his hands is a formidable tool in keeping a steady and totally creative sound allowing for Chicks multi layered organ to float within the music thus allowing Alvin Lee to sing his heart out and enjoy himself playing his guitar and you can hear that he is enjoying every note played. Ric plays the drums like a man possessed just listen to the Hobbit.That this recording is this good shows that the Rolling stones rolling studio was a fine facility allowing us to have and cherish some of the classic live performances from the era. TYA Recorded live is one of them,This CD version is a very good beautifully remastered package well worth having. I just hope that the good folks at BGO records can persuade Alvin Lee to release some more material from those recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used this book for my thesis","review":"The book had a very solid, thorough introduction to the two lectures.

I've got about 20 pages to go and I can already tell this is going to be one of those books that I'll remember for a long time to come. It's one of those books where the characters become your friends; their enemies become your enemies.

But since then, I'm determined to read everything this wonderful author has written! When Christ And His Saints Slept transforms the reader back in time to 12th Century England. The three main characters that SKP focuses on are Maude (Henry I's daughter), Ranulf (a fictional but well-thought out character), and the future Henry II. We also meet a young Eleanor of Aquitane, who really makes a grand entrance into the story towards the end. My only criticism is that sometimes the Welsh names and places are hard to read and remember. The medieval language coupled with a modern sense of humor makes this novel an exciting read. It's hard to put it down once you get into it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked!","review":"Fantastic book. As her previous works, it takes a while to get into the characters and story backdrop...but once you get hooked and understand who is who, is almost impossible to put down. If you like history and a flair of romance, this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Start of a Great Love Story","review":"I love historical fiction, and especially so when I am descended from the main characters, Henry II and Eleanor, as I am. That part of the book was great, as was Geoffrey of Anjou's encounter at the French Court with Louis VI? The battles in England between Maude's forces and Stephen's was repetitious and boring, but probably historical. I am so glad Penman included a note at the end where she delineated what was fiction and what was history. That helped a lot. Dialogue will always be fiction, but you can't write a book without it. Fun to guess what folks would have said and thought in situations. One thing that irritated me is that I have a photo in a history book of Stephen of Blois, King of England, last of the Normans, and he is cross eyed. WHAT? Not really the handsome, winesome man Penman described. Kind, and incompetent, yes. Handsome, no."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really enjoyed this book","review":"This is the first book that I have read of Sharon Kay Penman. At first I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy her way of outlining the book. Between chapters, a month can go by or a year or more can go by. Therefore, the story itself is not in typical flowing novel format. But after having read it, I didn't find it too disturbing.I agree with a previous reviewer that too many unimportant details has been provided. For me, there is not enough dialoge. There is, however, untold wisdom in the details she provides and I am sure her attention to historical happenings has been accurately mentioned.I found the story line to be enjoyable and I will certainly look to read another of this author's novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic!","review":"The best story I have encountered in my 15 years, Penman succesfully mixes history with fiction into a book that is both captivating and interesting. I fell in love with the characters, and I couldn't put it down for a week!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll admit it....","review":"I'm an Anglophile. I have a passion for British History. I picked this book up 6 months ago because it looked interesting and it is about a period of history that I am fascinated with. However, it sat on my shelf until last week, when I finally read it. I was immediately intrigued. The characters were well fleshed out and even the observers became important to me (at times I cared a little bit more about what happened to Ranulf than I did about what happened to Henry). There are attitudes and beliefs that are integral to the time period that she brings out in the story to make it even more realistic. I do agree with another reviewer though...it is hard to keep track of who is earl of what and whose side he is on. But overall, she makes the main characters so real that you are affected by what happens to them. Her writing also makes me actually able to visualize the setting. I think the book is extremely well written, and I can't wait until the next one in the series comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unforgettable Queen","review":"The Plantagenet dynasty boasts some of the more remarkable and able monarchs in human history. Among these there should be a special place for empress Maude, mother of Henry II and grandmother of Richard the Lionheart. A daughter of Henry I who marries for the second time into one of the many factions fighting for dominion of england and parts of france, Maude's husband dies leaving her with infant Henry and only partial support for her regency. When her skills at statecraft fail to unite her court, she is taken prisoner and forced to escape and rejoin her supporters in what Penman describes as an act more daring than she could possibly have dreamed up.As mistress of historical fiction, Penman lands her reader in the midst of this period, recreating it with attention to detail that causes the reader to feel as familiar with the life and times of the 1100's as with our own. This book is the first in a wonderful trilogy. Not to be missed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bummed","review":"I too was excited to dive into this book. Unfortunately, I didn't even make it past the first 300 pages. There were some great moments, but overall I started to get bored when I was reading about lets say, the brother of the uncles earl who had no relevant point to the story. I could see it being necessary to possibly build-up the main characters, but they did not in this book. I am not going to give up on SKP, but I have to take a break from her as this book put a bad taste in my mouth.I started reading Pillars of the Earth by Ken Follet and am having a hard time putting it down. You learn extensively about characters which ARE tied to other characters in the book who DO have relevance to the story as a whole."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Tried","review":"I really, really tried to love this book. It hadn't hooked me by page 200 or so, so I don't think it ever would. I echo the sentiment of a previous reviewer that it is sad that Maude had her crown stolen by Stephen, and now her story as well. As far as I could tell, the story was more about Stephen, Geoffrey, and Maude's multitude of brothers. The subplots galore and the cast of thousands (with similar names) made the storyline very hard to follow, to say the least. When I caught myself grimacing at the thought of slogging through to the end, I gave it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only Americans understood","review":"Quite a few of the reviewers are woefully ignorant of the actual history and the events leading up to the period of time portrayed in this book and others by Sharon Penman, and while they may be somewhat sensationalized, and fictional, they are still extremely accurate.

Lenny Henry the star of this dumb film plays an aspiring actor who witnesss a mafia hit and changes his identity of a black man to a white man who poses as a hitman himself and the film follows in disaray after that. Henry's work on Brittish Television is nothing that hillarous either. The idea is weak and the story is bland, the only real quality in this picture is Frank Langella his performace as the demeaning mafia don is played very well, but he was in his prime when he was \\"DRACULA\\" This film is pretty much \\"DUMB & BORING\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"back to cyber-surreal","review":"I really thought Tetsuo: Iron Man was a great film. Minimal dialogue, insane premise, apocalyptic desolation, bio-mechanical infections... It had a slew of things that had only been seen in cartoons, but in live action. Then, I saw Tetsuo II: Body Hammer, and promptly lost interest in the franchise with its overtly cartoonish scenes without attention to physics. This film, however, revived my interest in a cinematic move truer to the original film. Well played, Tsukamoto, well played. (DISCLAIMER: The physics and biology indicated in all of these films is questionable, its just that the second was over the top with it in my opinion.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crash Tag Team Racing is a good game!","review":"It's a fun game if you like racing and adventure games.

Unlike the other games you have to unlock every world before you can race in a non championship mode. In other words if I just want to race quickly without having to play an actual story mode game I can't. That really sucks, it is also difficult to find all the worlds and tasks that you are given to unlock other characters. I also do not like the tracks so far. Way too complicated, I thought the team racing thing would be cool but it is more of a distraction and makes it difficult to know where you are going. I found the other tracks from part 1 and 2 much more user friendly and fun.

He reinvented an art form, exhausted its possibilities, and just left it.\\"After all the pious testimony about Cook's genius, I was hoping this book would convince me of it. It didn't.

A very bad attempt to exploit Mr. Jackson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch it the tv guide channel.","review":"This movie was like watching train reck that I could not look away from. There was so many things wrong with the story and timeline. The people who made this had Michael Jackson looking like a man with out a back bone. The events were out of place, the plastic surgeries scenes weird and most disturbing to me his skin color not right at all. They were not consistant on that deail at all. The way they had it was that he still had dark skin when he met Lisa Marie in 1992 and he did not. She was still married when the first started talking and he did want to have sex with her before they got married. They had a far better wedding in this movie then they did in real life and they skip over the BAD album all together. Which is a pretty good album if people would just listen to it, I love all his albums from Motown Jackson 5 to Invincible. My point is if you want to see this this movie watch it on tv and save your money. Or better yet don't watch it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't believe it!","review":"\\"So bad it's good\\" This is pure comedy gold!10 reasons to own or see this movie.1.

This Michael Jackson cannot dance!6. The dialogue is \\"Bad\\"7. The music is uber corny (No MJ songs were used)8. The '90s Janet is in the '80s! (Totally ripped off \\"Back To The Future\\")9.

This man should deserve what he gets. Yes I was a lil' impressed about this flick I seen from VH1 of last year and tryin' to figure out what's going on behind Michael and why he was messed up inside fooling 'round w/ children (white boys I mean). I can't say enuff 'bout this. But ppl should just give this 1 'mo shot and believe the currently or ex- King of Pop is no wrong for this. Pretty decent acting to the role but it's all good. I may not buy it if I don't have too. But just keep in mind that Michael Jackson the King of Pop is the star of our time and our world.

I absolutely love Michael Jackson and I felt that this movie did him no justice whatsoever. The acting was terrible and i felt that it was a mockery rather than a adequate portrayal of MJ. The movie left out so many details of his life. In the movie as they showed Michael's skin lighten, the makeup that was used on Flex (the actor playing MJ) was just outrageous, It just looked plain ridiculous. Flex looked like a clown and a mime at some points in the film. The movie contained no Mj music, (No \\"Billie Jean\\", \\"Beat It\\", Jackson 5 hits, \\"Man in the Mirror\\") Nothing! I wouldn't recommend this movie to a can of worms. If you want a better essence of Michael Jackson buy \\"The Jackson 5: An American Dream\\" although this movie follows the development of the Jackson 5 as a group it gave a better representation of Michael."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another tabloid tale","review":"I am interested in historical facts and anything that is Michael Jackson or the Jackson family right now.

I watched out of sheer curiosity because I am a huge MJ fan. On the defensive side, it does portray MJ as excentric rather than a child molester which I feel is justified because he is excentric, but not nessacarily in a bad way.

I wouldn't say anything about the actors who were in the show itself, i just believe it is bad judgment towards Michael. Whoever wants to buy the DVD should think twice about the movie itself.

Please DO NOT be fooled by the rest of the reviews that give praise to this crappy depiction about Michael Jackson. This movie didn't reflect who Michael Jackson is. Flex made Michael look goofy and idiotic. Put aside his personal struggles, we all know Michael is known for his singing and his dancing and this guy, couldn't even bust out and do the moonwalk or even one of Michael's tornado spins!(I know no one compares to Michael, but he could have made his role of the king of pop a little more believable).

In terms of the WEP passcode issue, that would be a concern if putting in senstive areas or use in high traffic area. Does have a very simple solution - a button on the front you can press not only turns off the camera, but it rolls the lense up and physically parks it inside so no image can be sent out.

The image quality is excellent and the entire set-up is far better than my previous set-up of trying to use a cheap webcam and yahoo messenger. A couple tips. Panasonic no longer makes this camera although it remains widely available. They have come out with a new version, the BLC-131 wireless. Tech support told me that it is the \\"same camera with more features.\\" I have actually purchased a second camera since this one worked so well.

One portion of the book is a standard overview of slavery in Virginia, drawn from secondary or much-used primary sources. The second portion discusses alleged \\"black Confederates\\" in the South, and uncritically accepts every rumor, alleged sighting, and unsupported account of mostly mythical \\"black Confederates.\\" Never once does the author engage any critical faculties in looking at such accounts, nor does he explain how it is that none of these \\"black Confederates\\" show up in the records of the Confederacy, as opposed to ostensible sightings recorded by Union war correspondents, etc.An old saying fits the book well: \\"What is good in it is not original, and what is original in it is not good.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Rumors, fallacies and false conclusions","review":"It is exceedingly sad, at this late date to see such a collection of rumor and false conclusions promoted as truth. Yes, indeed, slaves went to war with the Confederate army-but as cooks, teamsters, laborers and personal servants. That did not make them SOLDIERS. Where are the rosters and muster rolls? Anyone who has done even minimal research into the Civil War and Confederate use of Blacks knows that it was illegal to enlist them in the military until just weeks before Appomatox, when desperation made Davis yield to pressure from his generals and cabinet. NO REGIMENT OF BLACK CONFEDERATES was ever fielded!There is so much half-truth and misinformation in this book, it should be pulled from every shelf in every home, library and bookstore.

However, it's just not funny -- just nasty ranting about: strippers, rap music, his new baby daughter (who better not become a pole dancer), men think with their dicks, the obligatory GWBush rants, \\"I Love America\\" but it's a racist hell, etc. Chris has done much better, but appears to have jumped the shark."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Woody Allen Syndrome\\" renders Chris very unfunny","review":"The Woody Allen Syndrome hits, as Rock decides he must be \\"serious\\" and \\"meaningful.\\" He uses his angry-young-man persona to educate us about affirmative action, George W.

I used to like Chris Rock. He was one of the funniest comedians on the planet. After watching this noise I no longer think so. It's 90 minutes of angry yelling. Parts of it degraded from stand-up to what seemed like a anti-white politcal rally. I mean at some points he wasn't even making jokes or trying to be funny, instead just shouting insults. Now, if all comedians had the same freedom of speech Chris Rock does here, then I wouldn't complain.In all, it was interesting and even worth watching, just not funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"This sucked!","review":"Chris Rock used to be really funny. He hit his prime years ago with \\"Bring the Pain\\" and has slowly gone downhill since then. His movies are lame (or okay at best as long as he is a bit player) and his standup has never come close to \\"Bring the Pain\\" type funny. This standup had a couple of laughs but I didn't really care for the whole Al-Cracker thing at all (and I am not a thin-skinned individual or PC person). I think he just felt he was getting into \\"sell-out\\" status with his financial success and wanted to try and \\"keep it real\\". Sorry Chris, being offensive just to be offensive is not funny. And while Richard Pryor may be your idol...you can only dream of being 1/100th as funny as he was. Pryor said some offensive things but always had a point and was always FUNNY!!

He continually disrespects his wife, marriage, and women in general. He trashes married life, equates women to basically sexual objects for men, and his jokes are thick with teenage mentality.

The thing is when a guy makes a bunch of good things and gets people to love him, some people say that everything he does is just great even if it stinks.Second a black guy ranting about blacks is funny (Rock in Bring the Pain\\") just like a white guy ranting about whites is (Carlin in \\"Ur all diseased\\") but any guy ranting about other races the way Rock did is not funny but racist.No white guy could've had Rock's \\"blacks v niggas\\" routine otherwise he would have been a (...) racist to all of you, think about it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CHRIS HAS FALLEN OFF HIS ROCK","review":"FIRST OF ALL, I HAVE BEEN A CR FAN SINCE THE BEGINNING AND HAVE IMMENSELY ENJOYED ALL OF HIS MATERIAL UNTIL NOW.

My impression of him has grown considerably and I was very much surprised how insighful and witty he really is. I found his material, though dated, ( O.J. for example ) to be very true and sadly profound. He takes old material and somehow manages to formulate it to make it contemporary and relevant and this is a very difficult and arduous task, especially when most people already heard O.J. jokes before. But that is his brilliance and no other does it quite as well. I honestly think this is one of the most insighful comedic dialogues regarding social contradiction, relationships, wealthyy vs. rich and politics. I think his strongest material is when he discusses slavery and affirmative action. He ties those two concepts together so well. His comedic timing is near flawless as well. Overall this is well worth a viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"painful truth is funny and chris rock is the true heir to lenny bruce","review":"truly a tour de force performance. chris rock is the only comedian today who tells the truth. between laughs he gives you stinging insight into all the hypocrisy of our institutions -- love, racism, government, money. an amazing performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece Given an Incredible Performance","review":"I can only echo what's posted above.

To correct the top reviewer - Betsy Russell does not ride a horse bare back; the horse had a saddle (and who would care anyway). Betsy Russell rides the horse TOPLESS. And as well endowed as she is, there is definitely a lot of bouncing. There is also a shower scene later in the movie that provides a whole group of young babes the opportunity to show how beautiful they are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Betsy Russell, Super hot !","review":"Sure, Phoebe Cates got top billing but this movie belongs to Betsy Russell as she shines in every single scene (and I think Phoebe used body double in her naked shot from behind scene). Betsy's topless scenes are still consider legendary today, too bad her acting career is too short.The picture transfer is good, clean and sharp while the 2 channel mono is OK, I would have given it a full 5 stars but this DVD has nothing else to offer. Not even theatrical trailer and even worse not even chapter selection just an English subtitle. A commentary by the stars would have put this dvd on a different level.

But I think the material is better. Right in the middle of it all, the music stops and Ian tells you the story of the Hare Who Lost his Spectacles!

That pretty much ended with my purchase of this record, a theatrical concept album with recurring lyrical and musical themes, all of which I've long since forgotten. It's packaged beautifully, with an authentic looking playbill tucked into the center, which is actually pretty cool -- that way you have something to look at while the music plays. Because, let's face it, while fans may rave about the depth and creativity of this album, it's BORING. Whoa, boy, is it boring. And silly. Of course, it takes a monumentally dorky album to make its predecessor, Thick as a Brick, seem hard-hitting, but, on that level, Passion Play is a rousing success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ian Anderson - Musical Genius","review":"Passion Play is an exquisite piece of musical genius, fresh from the mind of the multi-talented Ian Anderson.

The words I have never worried about as a whole, content to take in certain segments, which are given a lot of character in performance.

Powerfull, clear, with only a few flaws, but SUCH a joy to experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"recommended","review":"I saw Jethro Tull tour this record (so to speak) in 1973. The concert is a bit of a blur to me--due no doubt to the passage of time and to other factors I am not at liberty to disclose (think of certain problems besetting baby-boomer politicians). I do remember I liked the \\"Thick as a Brick\\" concert much better, and I do remember that the \\"A Passion Play\\" tour was not favorably regarded by professional critics. I think this accounts to a large extent for how under-rated the record \\"A Passion Play\\"--every bit as good as, or better than, \\"Aqualung\\"--still is. You might be put off at the prospect of listening repeatedly to the spoken \\"The Hare Who Lost His Spectacles\\" story; you'll get over that.Also recommended: THICK AS A BRICK, and (for one-legged flautists too) PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."},{"rating":"2","title":"acrobatic lyrical liquid gold","review":"When I first heard Sgt.

It The one thing that always gets me about this album is the sense of thrill in the music. This is an album for musicians, and for those who like jazz in long forms. Mingus and Miles Davis come to mind. But you get an English bent to it all here.

They use terms for no reason (Aqualung is an old man?) and vie with the likes of Dante (Passion Play, yeah right!). They should have stuck to Martin Barre's blues ditties.By the way, I saw this tour, way back. It was loud and dull to the max."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tulls finest moment","review":"This recording is all sides of Tull. Despite the lingering criticism of this work, even Ian says that this is probably one of Tull's best works. I love the fact that this work takes you on a journey from start to finish (something few musical artists of the today can even fathom). From renaissance (neo-classical) stuff to out and out rock (and Ian's admirable go at the sax!), A Passion Play is simply one of Tull's best. Once you can get over the 'Hare and spectacles' thing they decided to put in (probably after a long nite at the pub), this is one solid recording that is easily better crafted than it's predecessor 'concept' album (Thick as a Brick)."},{"rating":"1","title":"the most important one is missing...","review":"this book is really well done, apart from the fact that there are a lot of covers shown from saul steinberg, but his MOST IMPORTANT one, the view from 9th ave westwards, is missing. this is a clear draw back of this book, and hence, since it's title is \\"cutting-edge covers\\", i think it only deseverves two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"Stone Age seems to have added techno-sound too much, which makes the whole tune less Celtic.The first album, 'Stone Age' is one of my favourite albums.

With her voice at its peak, Barbra Streisand interprets this grab-bag of songs with great verve and tenderness, mixing feeling with meaning. Whether Fanny Brice is onstage doing her Yiddish shtick in \\"Blind Date\\" or contemplating her emotional relationship with Billy Rose (James Caan) in \\"Isn't This Better?\\", the songs hit the right note. What's entertaining about this album is the vividness of the performances not only by Streisand, but also by James Caan and Ben Vereen; the listener can enjoy the songs without having seen the film. If you like melodies, bravura dramatic singing and comedy numbers, this is the album for you! Close your eyes and you'll be back in the good old days when the songs were part of the film's story, not just an excuse for a soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Catchiest Of The Kinks","review":"Who can argue? The Kinks were a great band. They mixed elements of rockabilly, early punk, and poprock to form one of the best sounds from the \\"British Invasion\\" era. Ray Davies was an excellent songwriter and the band always played to their fullest. For sure an underrated hit that lives on today and will probably continue to grace our speakers for years to come. They're truly a musical treat, and that's especially apparent with this early compilation album of some of their best work. While some stand out more than others, these are all keepers. It's one of those CDs that you pop in and don't bother to fool with. You just let it play and have a good time. That's what The Kinks are all about. Raw and energetic fun with plenty of catchy melodic appeal fit for any fan of 60's rock and roll. For anybody interested in this band, \\"Well Respected Kinks\\" is a must-own."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Little Bit O' Fun","review":"Its not all the songs you know. Its not nearly the best of the Kinks songs because its just a few songs compared to all the amazing stuff we're all so hooked on. But its a really nice way to start a Kinks collection or just a nice basic set of songs for a really good price. Its well worth the few bucks you may pay for it. Its certainly NOT a cheap, bad-sounding compilation. Ive had this one for years and Ive gotten a lot of fun out of it. Most people want ALL the well known Kinks songs but if you or someone you know is just starting to get into the Kinks- or- if you just want to have a real little piece of Kinks history-- this is a great CD to have.

I could not wait for this film to finish.It is about a young woman kidnapped by two aimless young men driving around and around and around and around Chicago with no fixed destination.

Reportedly, this film's claim to fame is that it is \\"told in real-time, Helix is America's first action crime drama ever to [have been shot] in one continuous take without any edits.\\"One plot summary claimed that the film is \\"thought-provoking.\\" That much is true.

Slavitt writes, in the middle of Book Seven, that \\"any sensible poet would lay (the background story) out somehow\\", and that Ovid has written \\"footnotes without a text, a quiz, or a gazetteer of distractions, its only sense in what it refuses to say.\\" Useful, interesting opinions, of the sort typically encountered while reading an author's note. But these comments (and others like them) are inserted directly into the text. So yes, I could see how purists would not like that. Although, I have to admit that I loved it. The tone was very conversational, making the translation easy to understand. And now I feel like I have a good grasp of many of the Greek/Roman myths. In my opinion, this is a very approachable translation of one of those books you've always meant to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst English Translator of the Twentieth Century","review":"Whenever you see David Slavitt's name on a translation, look elsewhere. He's a third-rate poet who has made a career of destroying the great works of other poets. This translation is a good example of that. At various points he goes off on tangents, commenting--shallowly, I might add--on the contents of the poem he is supposed to be translating. You read things such as \\"What is Ovid doing here with this boring passage?\\" But it won't be a footnote, it will be inserted into the body of the poem. For this one, read Mandelbaum's translation.

Then he gets the news that he's going to get a little brother/sister and although his mommy wouldn't stay home just for him, she'll stay home if there's another kid coming?

Then of course there is 'Wow', one of my favourite Kate songs, and somewhat of a classic! 'Dont push your foot on the heartbrake' is an upbeat rocky number, one of the albums standouts! And then 'Oh England my lionheart' which is one of my fave song on the album, the music is almost medeival sounding! Then are the slower numbers 'Fullhouse' and the sexy 'Warm room'.

I discovered this book today and was delighted because the story is funny and exciting (what young child wouldn't love a story about a mad scientist?), there are wonderful illustrations on every page and the book is long enough to read several chapters and get into the story and still have plenty to read the next time. I can't wait to read it to him. Once he gets hooked on these types of chapter books, we can make the transition to chapter books with little or no illustrations.

Anyway, the book did wonders for my attitude and outlook that Piper, my Bernese Mtn.Dog, is going to be romping pain-free and fear-free in an eternal state, praising God.The book isn't a quick read with the many Bible verses referenced, but is comforting. The author's compassion is felt throughout. I enjoyed her little stories of animals that have passed on. It could use more stories like those. Growing up I was told animals have no souls.

Literally makes the need for replacing your LP's with new CD's unecessary unless heavy wear present.Very pleased and the 1210's available in black, 1200's in silver will match most home set-up schemes.Definetly to be considered a high-end unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Craftsmanship, Stability, Accuracy","review":"TECHNICS have overturned the status quo in the turntable market. The craftsmanship of the MK5's are unmatched. I tested both the Numark TTX1's and Technics 1210 MK5's.The Numarks are great, I really cannot put them down. In fact I may get one of them for my son. However, not just relying on the Technics history or popularity, but on actual hands on testing and comparing to other decks, the Technics just feel so much better.The stability and strength of these decks when mixing, scratching, blending and beat juggling is simply superior.

The book focuses on fifty of the most important psychedelic groups, has some colour reprints of some classic albums and includes a list of the best psychedelic albums and singles. However, it is written in a very poor way, its overall presentation is shoddy and, very often, merely states the obvious without adding anything new. The writer's tendency to refer to his own record collection is, to say the least, annoying. For a really in depth analysis of psychedelia, I would recommend THE ACID TRIP (V.Joynson), FUZZ ACID & FLOWERS (V.Joynson) or even UNKNOWN LEGENDS OF ROCK AND ROLL (R.Unterberger)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Book","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It brought back a lot of memories about songs I had forgotten about and some I never even knew about. It makes me want to go out and find as much of this music as I can.

I know I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informative","review":"This is an informative and fun read for any fan of the music from the Psychedelic Sixties. The book opens with a history of psychedelics and the roots of the music and what it was like to be alive in the late Sixties. Belmo then gives a history of the top 50 groups of the era and includes lots of little known facts and a helpful discography for each group. Very cool. There are 12 pages of color photos of the psychedelic album art work. At the end of the book are lists for the top 100 albums, top 200 songs and the most collectable psychedelic albums. Thanks to this book I have now begun my search in earnest for some of the far out albums Belmo writes about. A must have book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great scent, very odd flavor","review":"And I don't mean odd in a good way. The scent of this tea is heavenly, and you can detect the vanilla and maple. But the tea tastes sickingly sweet without being sweet. The first time I put a little honey in the tea, and it tasted like I soaked it in honey. The next time, I left it as is, and it still tasted like it was soaked in syrup without all the sugar. Of course, I don't want to say you won't like it, but just saying it's not everyone's thing. My fiance doesn't care for it much either, but he tolerates it better than I do.I think the best way to have this tea is as a diluted iced tea, if you do end up purchasing it and not liking it. The flavor isn't so strong, and the coldness doesn't bring out the taste of the tea so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most flavorful decaf tea","review":"This tea definately stands by its name.

Garcia's acoustic guitar and Dave Grisman's mandolin bob and swerve, twirl and dance and Garcia gets out his banjo for a couple of tunes as well. Some of the vocal tunes are sung by other artists such as Ewan McColl, but most are sung by Jerry with some occasional help from Dave. Recorded live and in the studio, and from various times from their collaborations including Old And In The Way, this is a nice compilation but it largely ignores their more jazzy material and sticks to their folk, country and bluegrass recordings. I would have liked some more of the jazz(y) material, Arabia being the one exception, can't please everybody. However, both musicians make a fine accounting of themselves in every setting despite Jerry's somewhat creaky voice on some of the live material from the early 90s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grateful Dawg","review":"If you likes The Grateful Dead and if you like bluegrass, then this is something you have to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money!!!","review":"save your money a buy a good speaker. this one worked for less than 900 miles in my car. i don't listen to rap or techno, so theres no excuse for this to happen. i had all of my equipment professionally installed too so i know its not from something i did. it's just a piece and if youre going to spend the money, save a litle more and buy a speaker that will last. the speaker people i talked to said a good speaker should cost at least 90-120 US dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is Olivia Being True To Herself?","review":"Olivia has always had strong ethics and values but when Morgan decides that they are best friends,she is not always true to herself.Rachel Vail has created another masterpeice in addition to the well read \\"If You Only Knew\\",\\"Please,Please,Please\\" and \\"Not That I Care\\".This book will keep you in suspense as you anxiously await to hear how she works things out with Morgan,CJ,Zoe,Lou and many other people."},{"rating":"2","title":"I live this series","review":"Everyone goes on and about how the books are all the same plot from different perspectives but I like that.

Ms. Novik wonderfully portrays a believable alternate history with dragons; unfortunately she forgets to create any real sense of drama in her world. She spends most of the book describing the world and showing how England is preparing the dragons to defend against the big evasion by Napoleon. When the battle does come it is more of an afterthought. I would categorize this story more in the line of a romance novel (a love affair between a man and his dragon), than an adventure novel. I know there are 2 other novels in the series, but I don't know if I will read them. I like a little more meat and substance to my novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bodice-ripping Dragon Bro-mance","review":"Reading more like a \\"historical romance\\" than anything else, _His Majesty's Dragon_ misses the mark on several levels.

Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shes no McCafferty","review":"Its been a while since I've read fantasy (used to 24/7 it seemed) but someone who knew my interest in alternative histories thought I might like this. Well, at first I did, even tho the main character was arrogant and boring. But then it became a long drawn out description of the trainings, and of the relationship between the captain and his dragon. The fact that he called him 'my dear' and gave him trinkets and jewels to please him, and coddled him like a pet gave me a very uncomfortable feeling. Theres even one scene where the dragon is discovering puberty, a scene I really didn't need to visualize. This isn't like any dragon I ever read about. Its not until the final third that anything actually happens, and then its just more of the same. Nothing really happens in this book, there are no interesting premises of how dragons would have changed the battle. Just wooden characters, and spoiled simpering dragons. Think I'll go reread my old McCafferty paperbacks as a remedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puts Most Other Fantasy Books to Shame","review":"I'm not the biggest fan of dragon books, so I approached this one with more than a bit of trepidation. Well, I was very pleasantly surprised. This book is the best fantasy I've read in some time.Novik has crafted a very well-balanced story, combining detailed alternate history, fairly swift plotting and really terrific lead characters. The support cast ranges from adequate to good. My only real regret was that the book was not first published in hard cover--it deserves to be. The setting and details are great, and the reader really feels the bond between officer and dragon. Do yourself a favor: read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"This review is going to be so easy.....everything previously written is true!

Decent book, I was pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"An otherwise light and entertaining novel greatly enriched by nobility of character","review":"Light reading, entertaining and pleasant. What makes this novel stand out amongst others of its kind is the nobility of the two main characters, Captain Laurence and the dragon, Temeraire. Not nobility of position or birth, but a nobleness and strength of inner character: honor, temperance, responsibility, dignity and respect.I also enjoyed the faintly scholarly feel of the narrative and the delightful addition of two (original) suffixes: \\"From the Sketchbook of Sir Edward Howe\\" and \\"Selected extracts from Observations on the Order Draconia in Europe\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining","review":"I really enjoyed this book, concept was quite unique and I was caught up immediately in the story.

I like the fact that, though Laurence and Temeraire are obviously the main characters, there are many others that the author develops and gives attention to. You learn that in the book's world, there are many different breeds of dragon, and you learn about their relationships to their \\"Captains.\\" The first book is mainly about Laurence trying to get used to the life of an aviator, having not been raised in that life. He has a lot to learn, and a very short time in which to learn it. It's a very good book, and most of the time is very hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enjoyable Historical Novel of War and Dragons","review":"The author takes advantage of the creative freedom allowed when incorporating talking dragons into an historical novel. She develops an intelligent, loyal dragon as one of the main characters along with his captain. These two become the center of the story that portrays the Napoleonic Wars from the British perspective.I enjoyed the tone and pace of the book and especially the writing about the dragons. The story is less than gripping or compelling but is certainly enjoyable.This isn't a genre that I would have picked up on my own. I read it since it was a free kindle download. I think it was well worth the effort. If I continue reading the series, I will do so because of the excellent character development of the dragon Temeraire and his relationship to the captain. I would hope for more intriguing action in future books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprisingly Awesome","review":"I ordered this when I ordered my Kindle 2. I wanted something to test out the Kindle, to see if I like it or not. The book was in science fiction and has dragons in it. The book download was free. I really could not get screwed in the deal. I was not expecting much because I believe in the \\"You get what you pay for\\" theory. The other theory was, read the first book for free to hook you in for the rest. It worked. I am over half way though, and I have all intentions of ordering the next book. This book is really good and very interesting. With a majority of the reviews at 5 stars, it must be a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please keep writing quickly, Naomi Novik!","review":"I got hooked on this series so fast that my elbows got sore from holding the books open. I actually longed for the next book and am deeply thankful that the publishers released these 3 books in papaerback within a short period of time (they all have 2006 copywrite dates). These books have an entirely original premise, that of inserting intelligent, articulate dragons into known history in a plausible way. But what really makes them excellent is Ms. Novik's ability to create characters to whom one can instantly become attached and intigued by and her mastery of period, historical details with no jarring modern expressions that break the immersion in the Napoleanic era. Be still my heart, I'm on book 3 with no new one in sight! Sigh. At least I know that I am not likely to ever lose interest in this series, if she continues it. Thank you Naomi Novik for a marvelous, unique contribution to the fantasy genre!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sci fi mixed with history!","review":"I enjoyed this book.

If you like dragons and you like history, this is for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggles disguised as a dragon pilot.","review":"If the subject happened to be an airplane instead of a dragon the worthlessnes of this story would become immediately clear. Dull poor writing. No plot whatsoever. No real characters. Childish dialogue. All those enthusiastic reviews look a little fishy to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"painfully poorly written","review":"I really was not impressed with this story. It tends to jump around, the conversations are not realistic. I sometimes have to wonder if the characters ever took a breath do to the lack of breaks or description during conversations. The basic concept of the story makes a vague attempt at being unique in the Dragon Riders of Pern have crash landed on Britain sense. Over all I found it to be cliche and was so glad I did not actually spend money on it. Perhaps if you liked a series like the Dragons of Pern this might appeal to you. If you want a well thought out plot with smooth story telling and characters that actually have some depth to them, this book is probably not for you. How it got a high rating I have not a clue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak on facts","review":"The concept was good. I looked forward to the book. I am an avid reader of O'Brien, Forester, Pope, Kent and the others who wrote authoritatively about the sea war in the period 1776-1820. These were novels, but carefully researched and accurate. Also, I have built a 15\\" long fully rigged wooden model of a sister of the Surprise. The author made several mistakes in ship architecture, handling, and in the tables of organization. To me, not even a solid amateur in this area (I had to stop and research), this detracted from the neat personalities of the dragons and their riders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow","review":"I found myself keep skipping pages while reading this book. The pace is way too slow. I couldn't finish it because too little happens to drive me on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragons are Pussycats","review":"This book was billed as a Patrick O'Brian sea faring adventure, but with a dragon. Cool concept. It should have been billed Patrick O'Brian with a dragon meets chick lit. Who knew dragons had all the fierce mannerisms of a housecat. They like bathing and being groomed, being read to, expensive gifts, and wearing bright sparkling jewelry. They're very nurturing, too, loving their master/handler and moping around when not treated well. And that's the male dragons. Who knew they made such great companions, speaking the king's english right out of the egg, so that they can have great conversations about all their feelings. Sure they fly and some spit fire or acid, but there is an awful lot of nothing going on here except a love story between a man and his dragon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth the US$0.00 I paid for it","review":"I read this story as a trial for my new Kindle 2, and I must say, I'm glad it was free of charge, because there is no way I would've paid for this!The plot was too slow, and most of it amounted to absolutely nothing. You'd want to skip to the action, but there isn't any. There's no twist... nothing! And the characters were so dull and lifeless. The only reason I continued reading till the end, is because I didn't think it would be the end! How can it be? Around the middle it felt like the story was just beginning!What annoyed me the most was the writer's portrayal of the handler-dragon relationship - so gay."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD","review":"According to the review, all this book is is a copy of Eragon with a little British theme thrown in. Even the staling of the egg mirrors Eragon. I would never buy this book, ever. Anybody who is reading this, definitly spend the extra $10.00 for Eragon. It is way better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly Enjoyable","review":"I found this book was free for the Kindle so I decided to give it a chance. I am very glad I did. I had never heard of this series before and I thought the book was quite entertaining. I started reading it to my 7 year old daughter and she loved it to. It is a great combination to have a book that is compelling to an adult and engages children too. I love reading stuff like this to my kids.I bought the first three books as a set after reading the first one."},{"rating":"2","title":"His Majesty's dragon review","review":"I enjoyed this book exremely, to the point where I recommended it to everyone I knew. Novik is a very talented writer with a very fertile mind for action and a tendancy to ensnare readers on the very first page. Her book, His Majesty's dragon, was creative and fun with excellently crafted and witty scenes. As for Temeraire, he is perfectly kind and has one of the best-constructed personalities that an author could hope for."},{"rating":"2","title":"I fell in love with dragons all over again","review":"Although I am a devoted reader of both fantasy and science fiction, it's been years since I've been interested in dragon stories. It seemed that dragon stories were either too fairy-tale or D&D; pastiches. Naomi Novik's thrilling tale brings me back to my early days, when I fell in love with the dragons of Pern.The author's straight-forward narrative makes the concept of dragons fighting in the Napoleonic wars wholly believable. Well researched, but not overweighted by historical fact - the relationship between the dragon and his rider, as well as the other dragons, riders and support personnel is what makes this book (and hopefully the two others soon to be published) so delightful.As enjoyable a book as any other I've read in the last year. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic concept","review":"Novik deserves a lot of credit for coming up with a fairly novel concept to write about. The idea that dragons could exist as a natural creature is good, but the way that she explains it is logical. I like the fact that she has given the history of the species enough thought to figure out how they would become a part of the society.Her characters are good, but a little flat. By that I mean that they seem to go through the motions of being who they are without understanding them really. The main character should be a poster boy for the duty-bound soldier of the day.The story is fun and I am really looking forward to the next book to see how she keeps things going. Hopefully the Main character will be something more human and less of a cardboard character."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING! I'd give it 10 stars if I could.","review":"This is an astounding book. Full of action with well developed characters and an amazingly new approach to dragons. Totally unlike any book with dragons I have ever read and it makes so much sense you wonder why it's never occurred to anyone before. Truly wonderful!!!Temeraire is a wonderful character who grows from an egg to a young adult dragon with some nice twists and turns. And the people around him are equally engaging.On top of that Ms. Novik's portrayal of the Napoleonic Wars is very imaginative! I love alternate history books and Ms. Novik creates a world where dragons and Napoleon co-exist very nicely. And she gets the real portions of the history right which gives voracity to to the story.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and recommend it to anyone who likes dragons, alternate realities or fantasy SF - actually I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good, well written story. And then buy the next two and wait, like I am, for the fourth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Fantasy Books I've Ever Read","review":"This book is wonderful! I was a little hesitant at first to pick it up because I'm not usually in to the alternate history books, but was pleasantly surprised at the novel as a whole. The characters are well-developed and are enjoyable to read about. There is a lot of humor interlaced with some battle scenes that may be a little gory for those who aren't used to reading books with content like Lord of the Rings. This book will,however, keep a reluctant reader wanting to read more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captain Hornblower With a Dragon","review":"I have very high hopes for this series.

And the relationship between the main character and the dragon is weird. Is it brotherly love, a father-son relationship? It reads more like a romantic relationship. The author doesn't do a good job of creating a world that makes sense. Really -- talking dragons? And we just use them like airplanes? We cant think of any other use for them? Come on. Boring...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here be Dragons!","review":"I have just finished this excellent first novel in the course of about 24 hours. I enjoyed every minute of it and am frantically awaiting my next Amazon shipment which includes books two and three.Being a huge fan of Regency era England, I heard a lot of buzz about this alternative history offering from Naomi Novik. Similar to Susannah Clarke, Novik focuses on the Napoleonic wars, but instead of adding magic as a twist, Novik adds dragons. And it works so well!I am not a reader who enjoys reading battle scenes, but the ones included in this book were so interesting, if only because Novik put so much THOUGHT into how battle tactics would be affected by introducing dragons into the mix. These scenes are exciting reading, as are pretty much all the other scenes in the novel.If you are a fantasy lover, or a history lover, or just someone who enjoys a new take on an old topic (whether that old topic is war or dragons), then I would heartily recommend His Majesty's Dragon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased with Amazon's recommendations","review":"I bought this actually by mistake - it was on my \\"recommended\\" list, and I'm not yet used to shopping on the Kindle, instead of on the web page.Amazon gave me a choice to cancel the purchase, but I said \\"what the heck\\" and decided to try it.Well, I can say their recommendations work. I enjoyed the book, and promptly bought the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Quick Read","review":"I enjoyed this book because it was so easy to get into... the action started right away. The characters were fairly well-developed, but I didn't have to concentrate to keep up.

Wonderful (quick) read."},{"rating":"2","title":"more fun for less money!","review":"I am not a military fan but this book is easily enjoyed due to the characters and especially the dragons. I tried it because it was highly rated and free and I was pleasantly surprised. It may not be contempory fiction (I still don't know what that means and I avoid it) but it is great storytelling. I had to buy the second in the series immediately!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising take on dragons","review":"I downloaded this novel on a whim and was pleasantly surprised. The story is about a British officer who finds himself bonded to a dragon. Once one is bonded to a dragon, the dragon becomes almost spouse-like in that the dragon is put first in the person's life.The dragon itself has a strong personality. Reading about the training facility and the way the dragons interact not only with their human bondsman, but also with each other is interesting. The author does an excellent job building the personalities of the dragons without making them seem as if they are humans that are called dragons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love me some dragons!","review":"I zipped through this one on my flight back from Reykjavik. The premise (dragons in the Napoleonic Wars) is interesting and the story is immediately engaging. Both the human and dragon characters are endearing and well-developed. The battle scenes are detailed, but not tediously so. In short, really solid work by Naomi Novik. Definitely checking out the rest of this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising","review":"I didn't think I was going to like this book when I first picked it up, due to the historical element of it, but the book definitely surprised me and Temeraires personality won me over. One of the best dragon books not set in a medival timeframe I've read to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pitch-Perfect Debut!","review":"Lately in my book club we've been reading a lot of \\"first novels\\", and making a lot of excuses for them. One book had ENORMOUS plot holes, another had characters so stupid they deserved to die (but sadly didn't). But HIS MAJESTY'S DRAGON was perfect! Perfect! Wonderful characters, brilliant plot, flawless historical detail. It was a sheer delight to read a book that felt and sounded like the best of historical fiction (I believe someone has already mentioned Patrick O'Brien), and yet seamlessly wove elements of fantasy into real history. And I just giggled with glee at the personalities of the dragons. Temeraire and the others were fabulous characters, funny, clever, and at times even heart-breaking, and their human companions were the same. Novik has created a great thing here, and I hope that she keeps going. I can't wait to read the other books. Hurray for a debut novel that needs no excuses!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great concept, a tad slow, but a solid book!","review":"Just finished His Majesty's Dragon -- the genre: historical fantasy. It's a \\"what if\\" story which follows real history, but a history in which dragons actually exist. Great concept and a good solid book. I thought it was a tad slow in places, but I think that's because I'm not a huge fan of the historical period in which the story takes place. With that said, the characterization is strong. And the relationship between Lawrence and Temeraire saves whatever slow parts of the story there are. Again, my critiques is based more on my personal tastes in historical periods than the writing or the story. Never the less, I give it a solid four stars will continue the series. Novik is a great writer, and her knowledge of the period shines. Definitely read this book, even if you aren't a fantasy or dragon book fan. It has something for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"This could be one of the most brilliantly written fantasy series I've ever had the pleasure of picking up. I usually avoid revisionist history like the plague, but these are so beautiful! The relationship between the innocent, brilliant, naieve dragon and the somewhat more worldly ship's captain trying to adjust to a sudden change in job is amazing. The books capture the flavor of the times brilliantly; they don't biew the world of the 17th century England with rose glasses, but with critical intelligence and deep affection. The author knows her stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"This book has been described as \\"Horatio Hornblower with Dragons.\\" Since I am a huge fan of both the Horatio Hornblower novels and dragons this book seemed to be made just for me - so it was to my great surprise and disappointment that I realized I didn't like the book at all. With the exception of one side character (side dragon?), the characters just did not interest me - nor did the story. This book is the first of a series - perhaps the books improved. I do not know - after reading this first book I have never picked up the second."},{"rating":"2","title":"breaks new ground in dragon fiction","review":"[***** = breathtaking, **** = excellent, *** = good, ** = flawed, * = bad]In an alternate-history England, Captain Laurence captures a French ship during the Napoleonic War and ends up with a dragon egg that hatches on board. Temeraire, an especially impressive species of dragon, bonds with him, which necessitates a career-switch for Laurence to the anything-goes Aerial Corps of British dragons and their riders who fight their French counterparts. Unputdownable! Longer review at ImpatientReader-dot-com."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome new Series!","review":"This was my first encounter with Dragons. I intended to begin with the Pern series, but a friend of mine talked me into this one. I'm glad she did as I fell in love with Temeraire--his inquisitive and intelligent mind. I can foresee his coming philosophical ideals and challanges. I fell in love with Laurence's constant struggle between what is good, proper and expected and what is wholly life. Temeraire opens Laurence's heart and mind, with his \\"innocence of a child\\" questions and comments. All the dragons are so loveable. Historic events are included in this story that are accurate and make the story that much more real. Reading this book, we could all wish for dragons! There are characters you could love to hate, and character you would hate to love. There is potential for the rest of the series. I am looking forward to more. I must continue..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"Generally I don't like books that fantasize historical events. I'm not one for revisionist histories. What I like are stories with dragons. I also appreciate something clever and new. I found that I really got into this book which adds dragons to the Napoleonic wars with Brittan. I liked the Captain and his dragon, Temeraire. I thought the story was clever and fresh.Another reviewer criticized the characterization as naive and one-dimensional. I can't deny that this was somewhat true, but I found myself charmed by the story and the characters. I liked the writer's style. It felt like I was reading a period fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragons like you havent seen before","review":"A friend turned me onto this book a few days ago and i wasnt able to put it down. If you like dragons and warfare you will love this book. The main characters will amazingly easy to like while still learning about who they are. Its a great ride from start to finish, if you like dragons pick this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speaker","review":"First you should buy replace both sides. I only replaced one side.

Yes, the actual view is dim in the mirror as the other reviewer stated, but, even worse, the lights around the mirror will blind you. They shine right in your eyes and are really annoying. The actual mirror is pretty small, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"This mirror looks stylish and is a good size (not too big, not too small).

Adequate light is key in a makeup mirror and it is missing in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mom's Bathtub Reader - Didn't like it","review":"This Reader is not like the others I have. The others are short snippets of information. This one is longer stories of women in various times of their life and with varying accomplishments. Too long to sit and read for short periods of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Characters and Great Scenes","review":"I love a book that develops its characters, and Pale Truth delivers. Mary Ellen, the woman who passes herself as white, Thomas Brand, the Scottish investor, and that dark, mysterious New Yorker Colbraith O'Brien, are just some of the amazing men and women who inhabit Pale Truth. The amount of research required to write a novel like this is almost incomprehensible. Everything that happened in the 1800s is so real. In his afterword the author, Daniel Alef, says that when he wrote the book it was as if he were transported back in time. Well, the same goes for me. Fast-paced and fascinating events. This will surely end up as a movie or mini-series before his sequels come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fabulously entertaining historical novel of intrigue","review":"Set against the San Francisco gold rush fever of 1849, Daniel Alef's Pale Truth finds Mary Ellen, whose cultured demeanor masks a deeply held personal secret. Neither the \\"Vigilante Committee\\", the U.S. government, nor a group of San Francisco thugs called the \\"Hounds\\", can stop Her growing political and financial empire, nor her dedicated determination to end slavery in American and transform the city by the bay into the Pearl of the Pacific. But every aspiration and dream has a price -- one that even Mary Ellen must pay. Pale Truth is a fabulously entertaining historical novel of intrigue, clashing interests, and the indomitable human spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old-fashioned epic","review":"I met the author at a booksigning in Memphis, bought the book and finished it in less than a week, not unremarkable for a 600 page tome. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's not literary fiction, but it is a great tale. Not unlike Clavell or Michener's earlier works. The history is fascinating. Alef explained that his trilogy is one story, and the characters evolve through the three books. So I'll buy the next one, too. I want to know more about the characters and the times. This is a unique work, with a bibliography no less. If I have a gripe, it's based on what I found incomplete -- I want to know more about what was real and what was fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lively Novel","review":"I bought Pale Truth because of Dr. Fracchia's review in the Nob Hill Gazette. I'm glad I did. Pale Truth is a memorable and joyful story of early California and San Francisco. The characters are wonderful and, I understand, based on real people. Now, as I drive through San Francisco the streets names come alive. I may be prejudiced -- I love San Francisco -- but I've got to say that I challenge anyone to come up with a more fascinating history for a city. This novel is great, an easy read, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys the kind of book that occupies all your attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"The San Francisco of my dreams!","review":"I got this book for Christmas (a hint to read more often from my boyfriend) and I was done with it by New Year's day. I'm not a big reader so that's an accomplishment for me. I had this dream about San Francisco a few weeks ago where there was all this excitement and chaos and people doing crazy things in the streets, but after I read this book I learned that San Francisco in the 1800s was really like my dream! It was like being in a time machine both times and the book was just as vivid as my dream and I loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting plot, wildly subpar writing","review":"I find it very difficult to believe that this is a FINAL PRODUCT that has in fact been edited and published. This reads like the work of someone with a great head for facts and little to no talent with prose. I read the entire book, since I am reluctant to put down a book once I've started it, but I almost stopped reading this one very early on. Mr. Alef has shown no talent for creating an engaging story, and in fact, rendered an interesting premise almost unreadable. I can't help but think that Mr. Alef would have done better to 1) write this book with the help of a professional writer or 2) give all of his research over to a professional writer and remove himself completely from the crafting of this book. While I read this book, I could not help but think of how much better the material could have been in the hands of a more skilled author."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALL CHILDREN SHOULD HAVE THIS!","review":"This book not only teaches children about the LORD it also shows them how we should live,my 6 year old daughter loves it and when are reading it we just can't stop at one story."},{"rating":"1","title":"not useful for us...","review":"I did not like this book because of its huge emphasis on catechism. We believe that it's more important for children to \\"hide God's word in their heart\\" than it is to put questions & answers into a brainwashed program for kids. God's word is a \\"double edged sword\\" and if we can get it into our kids, God will do the job. Obviously, it's important to explain what the bible verses mean so that they can understand God's word that they are memorizing. Catechism is superfluous and this book overemphasizes it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised","review":"Because of several uses of the word \\"catechism\\" I made the mistake of thinking that this would be appropriate for a Catholic family. It is not. The catechism referred to is that of the Presbyterian church. That said, I will pass it on to a Protestant family with young children because it does look like a very helpful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource for biblical training of young children","review":"I purchased this book as part of my home curriculum of bible study and truly love this resource. We have read 26 stories so far and I am so pleased with the stories and the exposure to the biblical values I hope to pass on to my children. Through the catechism, the kids learn our core beliefs of the Christian faith but it's through the relatable stories that the kids can grasp what our walk with God should look like. We have six children ranging in age from 1-9 and we all enjoy our family worship time. They won't let us go a day without doing \\"catechism kids\\". On a date night, they even had the babysitter read from this book! Love this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maria Ozawa -- always a buty!","review":"Maid's Secret starring Maria Ozawa is a Japanese film about a vampire/human who works at a restaurant where the waitresses dress as maids. She has a companion, another pretty young Japanese girl, though not quite as voluptuous as Maria. Apparently, every time she gets horny, her vampire teeth start to appear and ruins any kind of relationship she might cultivate. Orgasms are worse, she turns to dust. The plot is a little thin and Japanese corny, but several of the scenes depicting our young maid are quite erotic. She is quite stacked -- probably a 34C! This is a teaser -- some boobies, Maria's and her co-companion maid's, but nothing below the equator or unions of men/women. If you are into understanding the world of Japanese -- it's culture, nuances, etc., this is a good DVD for you. If you are a Maria Ozawa fan, this is more of a tittilation and not the like the X-rated, \\"uncensored\\" movies you can obtain starring Maria from other sources."},{"rating":"1","title":"The secret is it's a bad low budget movie with a 5 star review","review":"No story, Poorly shot, poorly written - just an excuse for the movie maker to shoot soft pornand poorly done at that.I think it was made by a bunch of kids who got hold of a camera.5 start review must have been written by the movie maker as no onewould give this anything but the lowest rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"keep looking","review":"So, you have downloaded and/or streamed Maria Ozawa scenes and you think this looks like a cool little movie?Close this and go back to other venues, because this aint what you think it is.

This ensamble exists as a two piece (guitar & drums), they execute songs that average 1 to 2 minutes in lenght. Their arrangments consist of tightly organized playing that can only be described as amazing. Crom-tech proves that sensory overload is a good thing. The fact that this cd is still available on this forum is a stupendous achievment, for this type of music. I could only hope that Mobo & FLoater are still putting out more amazing tracks of madness.

I only learned of Lang recently, so I am only familiar with his new work. It is outstanding.

Lang has come back with a more Gospel oriented album than previous records, but this one stands out with great hooks, style and some powerful lyrics. It's a great journey from the first to the last track, an album you can listen to all the way through. It's a highly needed boost of hope in these times we're livin' in. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodbye Jonny Lang!","review":"How sad that Jonny Lang has started singing about Jesus. It was a total turnoff when he became a jesus freak but I have to admit his last album... the one with \\"Red Light\\" was pretty good. Now he's lost his trademark style and actually sings about Jesus. Yuck! Jonny, you've lost all your cool fans and now you're probably only surrounded by freaky Evangelicals who close their eyes and waive their hands in the air, listening to your awful, religious music. How sad. Goodbye Jonny. I'll miss you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Gospel Album","review":"I heard \\"Anything's Possible\\" before this album came out and I thought: \\"Wow, J.L. is returning to his roots\\".

He is a Blues Giant, but I must say that this new album is just terrible. One song sounds like Stevie Wonder, the rest of the songs are just god awful. Depressing, slow, no JL tremendous guitar. I can honestly say that if he continues to change his style, and keep drifting away from his abilities, I will no longer be a fan. How sad. What the heck happened Jonny???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading and Wrong Title","review":"Problem with Jonny is that he believes he is a good singer. He is NOT. His terrible voice was suited and actuallly complimented his Blues/jazz rock stlye. This album is not only bad but it is excruciatingly painful to listen.Question he must ask himself. Would he be this well know if his 3rd and 4th albums were actually his 1st and 2nd ?Turn around ,,, I think NOT. Don't waste you money, this album will not get much airplay if any. Infact He himself says that in 3rd track of this looser.Pick up the guitar and melt some faces dude. thats what you do best. leave this mainstream stuff to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you paying penance? If so, for What?","review":"What is the deal with this music? Is Jonny repenting for something unknown to his fans? Is his penance never to play guitar again like before? Surely, the devil is not in the guitar!Is this funeral music because his career just died? I hope not.Jonny has great talent and it was meant to be used...not ignored.Someone has obviously steered Jonny the wrong way. Jonny can be \\"saved\\" and still play the music that we all love.

Amazing talent!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Jonny Lang I know and love. Huge disappointment","review":"Is it the artist? Is it the producer? Is it the label? Why does one of the most gifted young blues artists to hit the scene in decades suddenly veer off into trite pop music? Jonny Lang is both a gifted guitar player and singer with a blusey growl of a voice that belies his youth. Why then does this album showcase neither of these attributes choosing instead to focus on poorly written and badly charted pop ballads? Hopefully this is just one of those artistic misteps that will be rectified with the next album when Jonny returns to the gutsy blues singing and trancendent guitar solos of his earlier work. Please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed, want my money back.","review":"I was so excited to see a new Jonny Lang CD in the bookstore where I was shopping yesterday. However, I was very disappointed to discover that it is a religious/gospel album. There is nothing on the cover or in the titles of the songs that would clue the buyer in as to the nature of this album. I love Jonny Lang, but I would never have bought this CD if I had known. Also - his singing is screechy at times and he sings way too much falsetto on this CD that I will never listen to again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rick Blues Fan","review":"This newest CD by Jonny Lang is VERY different than any other by him. On one hand it is slickly produced and has a sweet R&B sound. On the other it is NOT the blues. The guitar work by Jonny is negligible. There is none of the original blues sound of his other CD's. If you want R&B get this. If you want similar R&B get Al Green. If you want The Blues look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's Done It Again","review":"Jonny Lang has delivered another masterpiece. Look forward to seeing another live performance. Amazing talent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Seasoned Music from a Seasoned Musician","review":"Jonny Lang... He came to us busting out the blues as a 15 year old - punching us right in the face with \\"Lie to Me\\". Now we are listening to \\"Turn Around\\" when he has more than doubled his own years. And it shows that he has learned something in that time. This man puts out music with a message and from the heart. You can hear it in his lyrics. It may not always be the grungy blues from when he was a teen-ager, but what he puts out is good music. Good to listen to in the background as well as to sit and mull the lyrics over in your head.And if you ever doubt for a moment if he has forgotten his roots, hunt down a rare live show from this man. He masters the stage and puts on a show that will have amaze you... Keep it up Jonny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"This is a sample of a great blues artist trying to go main stream to sell and get played on the radio but failed horribly. Johnny needs to stick to his roots and play nothing but the blues period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jonny's best and most inspired album","review":"This is a gospel album, and a great one at that. Spirituality permeates the album and saturates the soul of anyone listening.\\"Kid\\" Jonny Lang originally made his name on SRV-inspired blues guitar playing and his deeply soulful singing voice. This album is a very mature and inspired departure: His singing is much more nuanced, and the songs are more soulful. His use of a homemade gospel choir adds texture and depth.This is an adult album by an artist who has now completely evolved beyond his \\"Kid\\" Jonny Lang origins. Jonny has now established himself as a serious musical presence with the potential for greatness."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected nor wanted","review":"Jonny's conversion is fine and I hope he is happy, but this album was not good if you are expecting the blues guitar work of his early albums.

Saw him in the Blues Brothers movie and bought my first CD then. His music was amazing, voice unbelieveable from such a young man. With faith in hand I purchased this one. I listened once. Forced myself to listen again and gave up and gave it away. Terrible. I don't know what he did, or where he went with this music, but I can't go there. His 2 previous ones are well worth buying however. Don't let this one stop you from enjoying a really terrific performer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music by Johnny Lang called \\"Turn a round\\"","review":"Johnny Lang has a very talented voice but is recording the wrong type of music or he needs support in how to use his voice with the music lyrics that capture his beautiful voice.

It leaves me wanting more."},{"rating":"1","title":"The slide downhill continues","review":"I have had high expectations for each of Jonny's albums as they have been released. The early ones are great. This is yet another step downward with one or two songs worth a few listens. However, one spin will do for most of the record. Nothing is particularly new or catchy. It's one to skip or to buy used on deep discount."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jonny shines","review":"My husband and I are longtime fans of Jonny Lang and were not disappointed by this release. His voice shines in these arrangements, many of which feature gospel-type back-up singers. It's a little break from his rougher bluesy stuff, but will not disappoint fans of that material. I can truly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jonny Lang is great","review":"I have followed his career since he started as an early teen.

He continues to get better with age."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are a guitar fan, stay away from this one","review":"This CD lacks direction musically. The music attempts to sound like Stevie Wonder or soul but lacks genius. The guitar takes a backseat, and too many songs are in a similar key or phrasing. The vocals are forced and overstated.I tried hard to listen to this, but kept skipping tracks during multiple attempts. One minute you feel like you really want to like this, and it just doesn't have anything to grab on to. If you are looking for a blues rock album, check out the new Joe Bonamassa CD \\"You and ME\\". If you want a gospel album, go find a Mavis Staples disc or even Robert Randolph as they don't compromise musicianship. Johnny Lang should find his heartbeat again. I have seen him play, and he has the stuff. This is about as sacchrine and boring a disc I have ever listened. Bring on the Kids Bop version. Arghh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Come Back Jonny, Please!","review":"Someone ought to pull Jonny aside and play his earlier music for him. I don't mind a particular song on a CD departing from which got you there but your last two CD's have done that completely.

I saw Jonny do this CD live, and ones who say he isnt the guitar kid anymore is right, he is a matured guitar man, who has more matured chops on guitar that builds the song to a screaming peak, then hits you with a voice that is truly blessed by God. I have seen many artists live including Stevie Ray Vaughn, and Jimi Hendrix and not only does Jonny do good in the studio, he can move you live, he is one amazing artist who can deliver the goods live as well as the studio. If you ever get a chance to see a live show by Jonny and his great band, do so, you then can see, that Jonny Lang is not a one shot wonderkid, he is one of the most amazing artist around today. When an artist is better live than on CD, then you know Jonny Lang will only get better, cause he is just starting. Way to go Jonny, keep moving on and growing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turn Around - Jonny Lang's newest CD","review":"This is not up to par with his prior releases. I did not care for his genre with this album. I prefer his more bluesy music. He has a greatvoice and is a fabulous musician, but this CD does not bring out either abilities. It is a very average CD. In fact, I cannot remember a single tune from it 20 minutes after listening to it.I would like to see Jonny go back to the music that made him popular. I don't believe that it would go against his new-found faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it !","review":"I've been a Jonny Lang fan for years. When I saw him perform live, he knocked me off my feet. His guitar playing is his forte'.

I'll send it to you for free, I don't keep crap like this in my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't believe","review":"Jonny Lang is one of my favorite artists ever, but this album is not good. I don't even know where it is right now. I didn't put it in my Ipod and I'm not going to. This album reminds me of the scene in Walk The Line where the producer tells Johnny Cash \\"Son I just don't believe you when you sing gospel\\". That's how I feel about this album, I just don't believe. Sure Elvis can put out a gospel album. Heck Elvis could put out any kind of album he wants, not all artists have the gift to make you believe in everything they sing. I totally respect an artist's right to write and record what they want, but I also don't have to listen to it. I love all his other albums and continue to listen to them regularly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Stop...Anything's Possible","review":"Very good album. Unlike the music or musicians currently out there, Jonny is creative. Mixing and matching different genres of music and writing lyrics that are far cry from the words being sung from top 40s stations or by other \\"blues\\" musicians.Personally, I love the organ, so that addition to this album was a big plus for me. (so was the choir)His voice is... Full of soul. Full of passion. Full of life.His attitude is humble. It's extremely hard to find this in general...but in the world of music it can be even harder. His talents don't ruin him. It seems to me that he appreciates his ability to reach people and touch them with the gift and power of music, Jonny Lang music.This album is full of HOPE (the reason for the five star rating)Just read the titles of the songs on this album"},{"rating":"2","title":"turn around...again!","review":"after a bryan adams oriented album(long time coming)jonny came back with one of his best work ever great vocals and guitar of course tooblues gospel rock and a lot of feeling this album capture de best of jonny highly recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"Soulful music without a soul...","review":"I am (was) a great fan of Jonny Lang. I have seen him a few times in concert and loved that a young kid could play the guitar like he did.Sure this album changes from darker themes to a more christian theme but that is not my beef with the album. The problem is that he apparently has gradually given up on playing the guitar in his songs. He was an excellent soloist and if he wants to find religion, fine, just keep playing the instrument that got you there. He is dangerously close to becoming a christian-backstreet boy.Jonny, you dont have to do drugs or sing about sin to make great music. This is not, musically speaking, great music.Maybe next album..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Lang of old.","review":"This is an easy one for me to write. If you are expecting the gut wrenching blues of Lie to me or Wander this World, dont waste your money on this.If you want his new style, this is ok. I am not saying it is bad, it just isnt what you got on his early albums.Personally, I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Beautiful","review":"I am not a religious person. I don't go to church or spend lots of time in prayer to God. I want say that this CD is simply beautiful. One can appreciate where Jonny is at in his life and feel it come through in his music. The music and vocals on Turn Around is a little different than what we are listening to from Jonny Lang, but it is just as special. I love all of the songs. The only one I could not fully appreciate is the title, Turn Around. Only a man, My Love Remains, Anything's Possible, Don't Stop and Bump in the Road, are some of his best work ever. My all time favorite has still not changed, (Breakin me)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you wanna DANCE!","review":"I love this CD. Johnny Lang is by far one of the best voices in Blues/Jazz today, with some amazing range. He goes from heavy raspy belted out notes, to the soft falsetto voice...There were times I couldn't believe it was the same person. There are so many heavy-rocking songs on this CD, it's just great. Probably the best part is that his heart comes out in the music. He does a great job conveying positive messages in this entire CD, which I really appreciate. This guy is top notch, and I think this disc is his best so far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Turn Around","review":"I have been a Jonny Lang fan for several years and have enjoyed his funky style and nitty gritty voice. I was impressed with his versatility on this album. He ventures outside his usual genre with gospel-like content on this collection. I personally enjoyed listening to his interpretation of his faith. It was heartfelt, and I heard range and variations in his voice that I'd never heard before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing, Tiresome CD","review":"Memo to Jonny L: what the heck happened to you? Are you spending too much time listening to what those record execs are telling you to play? You're a terrific guitarist and blues musician. So, what's with this lousy Gospel-style \\"pop\\" album? You're not Prince. You're not Mariah Carey. You're not even Justin Tiomberlake. You're not all that great a vocalist, and the material on this CD is weak, at best. But, you ARE one heck of a GUITARIST! So, next time, stick to what you do best. Forget trying to be a \\"pop\\" star and just be yourself. For those fans who fell in love with your passionate renditions of great blues tunes like Ike Turner's \\"Matchbox\\" on your first CD, this album is a waste. This CD, sadly, can't even compare to the genious you showed in LIE TO ME or WANDER THIS WORLD. Time to do a real \\"turn around\\" and return to your roots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the gut renching blues?","review":"The long awaited album has finally come! I was so very disapointed! I was expecting his infamous gut renching blues and instead experienced this funky R&B stuff! Where's the blues? How can Jonny sing lie to me and Wander this world and then sing R&B? I don't get it! If you like r&b or gospel music this cd is for you! IF your a die hard blues fan do not buy this! I'm crossing my fingers for his next album! Until then I continue to be a fan of the old Jonny Lang!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jonny Lang is unique","review":"The new Jonny Lang CD includes several Christian songs, and while I was skeptical at first, I really like the material. The songs are powerful and provide a good message. Lang's sound is unlike any other singer. I enjoy this CD very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blues to R&B to Gospel Transition","review":"Jonny left edgy guitar slinging blues-rock quite a while back if you did not realize. His current amalgamation is more of a hodgepodge than concert of styles for my taste. I would have preferred a harder core gospel as Dylan did with 'Saved'. Two stars only because as Gospel there is much better to be found. If it was under the Contemporary Christian category I would go three stars. (He is still touring bars/clubs and not the church circuit yet though.) Probably no stars anymore for blues or rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"Before I say anything else, I am a huge fan of Jonny Lang, going way back and have seen him nearly a dozen time in concert. That being said, What happened?I have listened twice now to \\"Turn Around\\" all the way through and I'm done... I looked forward to the new album coming out and I just can't believe what it sounds like. The songs are boring (Gospel? Please! Leave it to the gospel singers), the production is beyond bad, and they lyrics are complete drivel.Jonny - here's some free advice - less Weak falsetto, more Strong guitar."},{"rating":"2","title":"same old thing - great","review":"Once again Jonny Lang show us how the young blues players are going to carry on the traditions. 'Turn Around' is the same thing but with an older view of the world. If you have been listening to all his CD's you have seen him grow up. This Cd is so much better than 'Long Time Coming' (imo he lost his way a bit) but my favorite is still 'Lie to Me'. Jonny is coming to Seattle and I can't wait to hear him live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unremarkable","review":"I heard Red Light and Lie To Me, and it's in a different league than Turn Around. Sure I like Bump In the Road and My Love Remains, (That was a little too hight pitched for me, but still)but everything else is strange. Who is this? Not Jonny Lang! It's not his roots. He needs the Lie To Me and Red Light again. Even thought Red Light is old, I can't stop listening it. Maybe his next album with impress me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the reviews first!","review":"Four years ago I bought \\"Lie To Me\\" on a whim, never having heard or heard of Jonny Lang before. What a gem! So this week, when I spotted a new Jonny Lange disc at a very reasonable price, I was hoping lightning would strike twice. Unfortunately, that was not to be. This is painfull to listen to, even disregarding the \\"gospel\\" content (there's nothing musically \\"gospel\\" about it, BTW, just lyrically). Try as I might, I couldn't even manage to get more than about 2/3 of the way through it before I had to just turn it off. Guess I'll have to list it with Amazon in case those who enjoy it need a second copy. No more impulse buys for me. Read the Amazon reviews first!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this the same Jonny?","review":"This album does not sound anything like \\"Smokin\\" or \\"Lie to Me\\". The only way I know its Jonny Lang is the cd cover. The goosebump-inducing guitar and aching voice are long gone. Jonny, you can be pious and play blues. There isn't a commandment against it. I guess marriage has made him too mellow. Check out his old stuff; its great. This album is rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Apparently, Jonny's religious/spiritual pusuits are in conflict with The Blues, and what is left of a stellar and influential young blues talent, is merely another couple non-descript albums in a morass of pop/schlock works by faceless artists. Obviously he wants to carry a different message at this point in his life. I miss Jonny, but I've moved on to other blues artists. I'll never forget his live peformance at Sturgis Bikeweek in 2002. It was smokin'!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I give it a 4 1/2","review":"This was not the best ppv of 1999, but it ranks higher than the majority of them. The good matches on the card was the triple threat match for the European title between The Bulldog, Val Venis, and D'Lo Brown, The Tag Team Title match between the New Age Outlaws and Mankind and Rock, A rematch from the Survivor Series for the IC title between Chyna and Y2J and the main event between HHH and The Rock. The lowpoints to the show was the Heavyweight Title match between the Big Show and The Big Boss Man, which is not surprising since The Big Boss Man's matches are always bad in this day and age. The Cage Match between Kane and X-Pac was alright but could have been a whole lot better. The Battle Royal for the #1 contenders for the tag team titles was fair as well as Blackman vs Angle. Overall, this ppv has more strengths than weaknesses."},{"rating":"2","title":"WWF Armageddon was a shocker","review":"The best match of this PPV is hands down the No Holds Barred match between Triple H and Vince McMahon. It was really exciting and had that great surprise twist at the end. The 16 man tag-team elimination match was also cool. A great WWF moment was after the Four Corners Evening Match between Ms. Kitty, Jacqueline, Ivory, and B.B. for the WWF Women's Championship. The WWF Title Match was a joke. Boss Man didn't last three minutes in the ring with the Big Show, and neither did Prince Albert. The Superheavyweight Match between Rikishi & Viscera and the Hollys was kinda boring. The IC Title Match was really good. Val Venis, D'Lo Brown, and the British Bulldog did great in the Triple-Threat European Title Match. The Steel Cage match with kane and X-Pac was a little too predictable. The Rock 'n' Sock Connection was so close to winning the Tag Team Belts. Buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The WWF delivers again!","review":"I ordered this one live. Another great PPV from the WWF to close out the millennium. I give it 4 stars because the title match was Big Show (champ) vs. Big Boss Man. The main event was Vince McMahon vs. Triple H in a no-holds barred showdown! Good undercard which included: Steel Cage Match: X-Pac vs. Kane, Jericho vs. Chyna for the Intercontinental Title, Bulldog defending the European title in a Triple-threat match against Val Venis and D'lo Brown, a tag-team battle royal, and my personal favorite, the 4-Woman Evening Gown in the Pool match where Ivory defended against Miss Kitty, Jacqueline, and BB. Miss Kitty has some nice...anyway, a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Tape played fine with the exception of one part where exposed breasts are involved lol rewind much?

The only real match that changed any big plots was the Mcmahon v HHH match. This match set up the whole mcmhon-helsley era, which is the current main plot.Anyhow, if you are going to spend 40 or 30 bucks on a ppv, dont buy this one. here are some good ones...*No Mercy 99~ Two words Ladder Match. plus austin v HHH was a good fight.*Wrestlemania 15~ Maybe the best wrestlemania, Austin v Rock one of the best matches ever.*Wrestlemania 10~ For you old schoolers.

THE UNDERTAKER?Another very bad match was the one with Triple H and Vince simply idiot as the bookers of the time..And let's not forget the triple threat match between val venis ,d'lo and I don't remember the last one...Only confused and slow moves in this event; a good point for the rock n sock connection who made this disaster a PPV..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Sounds","review":"Compare with other sound effects recordings.

I've never forgiven him for becoming the Wimpy Beatle and for turning out such lightweight fluff ever since he crossed that street in front of Abbey Road studios. So I've been trying to figure out why I like this (and its partner compilation) so much. Maybe it's because these bands get away with playing Paul's poppiness to their advantage without the burden of having a first career to which everything would have to suffer by comparison.The truth is these artists take some not-so-sad songs and make them better. I still don't like Wings but I have found a new appreciation for the popcraft behind the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Songs that stand the test of time...","review":"Although its taken this long to come out with a solid tribute to one of the best lyricists of our time-I think everyone would agree-its been well worth the wait. While no one can do a McCartney hit like McCartney, to hear modern artists do \\"Junk\\" (Barenaked Ladies) and \\"Every Night\\" (Matthew Sweet), to name a couple from the record, proves that these hits stand the test of time very well--what better compliment to their creator."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old school Ska Music.

You will dig this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Chairman rocks!","review":"In my opinion, Sinatra has no bad songs ... just some that are better than others. This compilation has some totally excellent tunes on it -- although I find the title somewhat ironic, because many of these songs deal with unrequited longing and with the always-predictable romantic angst and ambivalence. But, I also find those are some of my favorites: \\"Let's Fall in Love,\\" \\"You'd be So Easy to Love\\" come to mind. Toward the end of this CD there are songs that are slow/boring, but overall it's a great collection for lovers of Ol' Blue Eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have in any collection","review":"What can you say?

This is the kind of CD that you can listen to over and over again and still get the same romantic feelings from the songs. This is a great CD to listen to with the one you love.

If it is your cup of tea you will want to investigate three other blue-eyed Toussaint productions from the same period: two albums whose titles are the names of the artists, \\"Browning Bryant\\" and \\"Jess Roden,\\" and Frankie Miller's \\"High Life.\\" Of course, Robert Palmer's first album, \\"Sneaking Sally Through the Alley,\\" was recorded at Toussaint's studio with the Meters backing, and though not as fully Toussaintized, it is a fine album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent alternative","review":"An excellent alternative to the standard Canon battery. much more capacity, and adds some heft to the camera, which I like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"After purchasing this product, testing this product and trying to return this product, I have discovered it was a waste of my time and money.

First off I have the rear bumper and tire carrier from Smitty I bought both at the same time. All products barley fit. The powder coating is so cheep if you look at it it scratches. One side of the front bumper sits closer to the fender by almost an inch. This can not be fixed without modifying the lower and upper bolt holes.

Raw, demo quality recordings here-but the performances and the songs themselves make up for any shortcomings. The 1987 Demo has some interesting material on it, but I liked the Critical Madness demo best. On CM you get a pretty bitchin' take of \\"Ridden with Disease\\" that personally I like better than the recording on \\"Severed Survival\\". \\"Charred Remains\\" and \\"Critical Madness\\" both appeared on \\"Severed Survival,\\" but it is awesome to here them in the infant stages of development. The 1987 demo has \\"Human Genocide,\\" a really good song that I don't think made the cut for any of their albums, which is a shame because it warrants a good studio treatment, though the demo level production here just adds ambiance to the proceedings. The live recordings have decent sound, and they add a nice finish to the album.

The film makes two points: one is that the CIA and the USA are ruthless, evil and criminal; and the other that the British Prime Minister is a CIA plant since his early twenties. Were it not for the PM doing the CIA's bidding, Britain would not have been America's ally in foreign policy matters, including the Missile Defense Initiative.Although the premise that a top government official is a plant and working against his own country is interesting, the persistent CIA/USA bashing gets tiresome. The acting is OK, there is some suspense, but it is not a clever story. The CIA is clever enough to control a country's leader and thus, policy, yet their agents can be found on Google. There are other very dumb things. There is no escaping the feeling that Polanski, who co-wrote the screenplay with Harris, hates America and will use his position to brainwash people."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a crock!!","review":"Roman Polanski has produced a number of first rate films, but this movie is so mediocre.

By the way, if you like Pierce Brosnon and expect great things from him in this movie, you'll be sorely disappointed. Ewan, much like in Cassandra's Dream (another dud by another famous director), basically repeats that role. This movie MAY have been an ok made-for-TV movie but to actually have to pay and sit through this mess, jeezz... It's unfortunate that Polanski have to live up to the high standard set with the \\"Pianist\\" so maybe I'm being overly harsh.

It's a good suspense film that never goes over the top, and that's a good thing. There's no gory violence to speak of, and mercifully, no car chase to attempt to liven things us. Instead, we get a sort of intellectual thriller in which a writer finds clues to lead hm to think something is rotten in Denmark with the former British prime minister whose boring memoir he has been hired to spice up. There are no real jolts in the twists, and the ending is poetic, not false, as some have charged.

If this film had been made by anyone else, they would have said it was a bomb. I was so disappointed by the lack of tension and the preponderance of cliches in this film. Pierce Brosnan was good as a Tony Blair-like Prime Minister, but Ewan McGregor gets my vote as one of the most bland and colorless movie stars out there. Kim Cattrell's character didn't make much sense. I didn't care for any of the characters and the denouement was interesting but the ending just fell flat to me (like McGregor's body). Some parts of the film dragged on to the point where I was falling asleep (Ewan talks. Brosnan talks. They talk some more. Then more talk.) Was Polanski too worried about his upcoming trial in the U.S. to make a good, suspenseful thriller? I felt he was uncommonly restrained in what should have been a nail-biting thriller. Oh well...I guess even great directors have bad days."},{"rating":"2","title":"How leaders are made","review":"This is a well made film by Roman Polanski which seems to be cross between an old Alfred Hitchock movie and an Oliver Stone political thriller (JFK).

There's a ghost writer for memoirs who goes to a beautiful house on the beach where his subject lives. The writer isn't the first in this job and his predecessor died, probably was murdered. By whom, and why? There's a mystery around that and the tension lies in the writer, who isn't an investigative reporter, acting like he is one except that he seems to have not an ounce of common sense considering the situation. I didn't really care about any of the characters as I didn't really learn much about any of them. Kim Cattrell seemed to do a good job in a fairly minor role that was reminiscent of Kim Novak in a Hitchcock movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plenty of mystery and suspence","review":"This movie was supringsly well. Only thing is the ending. It's bad. The story keeps you puzzled throughout and the end gives everything away and it's just bad and makes you wish that there's gonna be another Ghost writer. But anyways, it's basically about this guy who writes an autobiography of this politician about why he got into politics, etc. There's lots of cheating with spouses, etc going on and everything. Overall it was a good movie. I watched it at 2am-4am and it kept me up so it was pretty good that I didn't want to stop watching it. The ending just really disappointed me. I would rent it and see if you like it before you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsense","review":"I just don't understand how the director of \\"The Pianist\\" could possibly have directed this. First, it's pure nonsense to have James Bond in an intellectual dual with Obi-Wan Kenobi.There are other bits of nonsense in this book. Americans don't care about Brits, and certainly don't care about the Hague -- so the idea of an ex British PM indicted for war crimes and that causing a media firestorm within America is absolutely ridiculous. Also, America doesn't need to insert a CIA spy within the British administration to tell the Brits what to do -- the Brits are more than happy to follow the Americans anyway. Then there's the ghost writer -- ghost writers are so because they have no thoughts of their own -- otherwise they would just be writers!Roman -- seriously? I know you don't like the Americans, but this movie is just drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic thriller for adults","review":"The slow-boil thriller is a genre that I immediately respond to and Roman Polanski is certainly the master. With \\"The Ghost Writer\\" he crafts, what I believe, to be his best film next to \\"Chinatown\\". With crackling suspense, spot on acting, and a plot that is always compelling, relevant, and well told, you get one of 2010's finest films. The picture is so well made (expert cinematography, a memorable score, snappy editing) that it's almost unbelievable. Roman Polanski is back and in top form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, Boring, and Highly Improbable -","review":"The plot in this movie centers around a former U.K. Prime Minister who's being accused of war crimes for supporting U.S. renditions and torture activities.

An accidental find of old photos, a bit of probing here and there, and eventually we learn that the P.M. had been recruited by the CIA and was in fact a U.S. puppet. In between we encounter a few chase scenes and a tryst between the P.M.'s estranged wife and the writer.Extremely improbable, from the very beginning until the ending.

This was hailed as a return to the '70's and promised to be an excellent album. It is rubbish. It sounds just like the \\"Peach Tree\\" album, which is one of my least favorites. I have been a long time fan and am continually disappointed by Elton's efforts. The last listenable album in my mind is \\"Songs From the West Coast\\". This sequel to Captain Fantastic is like most sequels to movies....crap. Elton has \\"lost it all...and it's getting dark in here.\\" A very disappointing effort, and I am amazed that people are leaving good reviews for this pathetic album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly awful","review":"Hells bells Elton, 'The Captain and the Kid' is truly awful and particularly so when you recall the grandeur of its spiritual predecessor 'Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy'! The lyrics are banal, the arrangements are clunky and the voice is terrifying! And isn't the grim reality of all this brought home when you consider the disparity in the two albums' first week US sales figures (CF&TBDC: 1,400,000; versus TC&TK: 40,000 which is about 3% of the former)! Poor old Elton! Perhaps stick to belting out those familiar old chestnuts (Crocodile Rock, Candle in the Breeze) on The Strip, alongside Celine and the infinitely more talented Barry! Or else, pack up shop in the US, and head back to Windsor with your wigs and bitterness!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE FOR ALL ELTON JOHN FANS","review":"If you have been an Elton John fan from the start as I have been, you are gonna love this cd and even if you have not been your gonna love this cd. Listen and learn. Welcome back Elton and Bernie. You prove the ageless sound of the John/Taupin team will never go out of style.

Judging from the other reviews, it seems I must have gotten a totally different disc than everyone else! I much prefer Elton's older stuff, but this CD is just not good. If you're a fan, buy used or borrow if you can. If you enjoy Elton's newer stuff (past say Rock of the Westies) you will NOT like this CD. And, just as a side note, I checked reviews of this before buying - seeing how 'wonderful' it is and it being the 'best EJ has ever done'. Well, sorry, in my opinion this is VERY far from the best. Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy is the best, followed closely by Madman Across the Water, and Honky Chateau. As we all know, 'sequels' rarely live up to the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Captain & the Kid","review":"This is a very poorly written recording. Not anything near the quality of his previous work including Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy.

They are at their best, no doubt about it.So let the bad Outlaws be afraid, the good ones wil be drinking whiskey and talking about the good times at the Pub-Salloon, in the middle of the beggining of the story of the greatest pair of songwriter-lyriscist of all times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elton returns to his roots","review":"A nice departure from the \\"modern\\" Elton John.

From the first track, you can enjoy flashes of Elton's genius again in his happy, honky-tonk piano playing. He again turns water into wine with Taupins often clunky lyrics... Like a stopped watch though, each of the 10 songs on this album contain two interesting ideas, which is enough, I guess, for Elton to fashion a melody around. For me the highlights are those songs that SOUND like they could have been recorded during Elton's glory days (1972 to 1978), which are \\"Post Cards from Richard Nixon\\", \\"I Wouldn't Have You Any Other Way (NYC)\\", \\"Tinderbox\\", \\"The House Fell Down,\\" and \\"The Captain and the Kid\\". The quiet songs on the albums are lifeless, and again call more attention to Taupins often silly-sounding lyrics. Five entertaining songs on One album, is worth it, to me. I've had the album playing in my car for 5 weeks and counting. But I'm a big Elton John fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Captain and the Kid Fall","review":"Like most Elton John fans, I have waited and waited for the Captain and the Kid to make a comeback. It's finally happened, and this CD is a big disappointment. There's nothing exciting happenening here and my 2 closest friends who have also been waiting, are also disappointed. I played the CD twice--the second time was to see if I was just missing something. I wasn't. I won't be playing it again. John & Taupin, thanks for years of waiting---for nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old sounds new....","review":"I\\"ve been an EJ fan since the mid-seventies and I can tell you this is his (their) best since Catain Fantastic.They tried to go back in time and thats just what they did.And it works.A rare feat when bands attempt this.Every track is good,no throw aways.Thats because they always worked together so well.Most of his post Captain music lacked any direction and was mostley filler tracks with few good songs.This is all good.Go buy it now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"I'm 58 & I don't care...\\"...well THAT shows!","review":"After reading just a handful of the over 100 reviews, I find myself in the minority...I really, really, don't like this album, except for \\"Just Like Noah's Ark\\". I was disappointed, for after \\"Songs from the West Coast\\" and \\"Peachtree Road\\" I thought he was returning to his old sound. Up to this point, I felt his worst efforts were \\"Victim of Love\\" and \\"Empty Sky\\" (except for 'Skyline Pigeon'). I feel, while this may not be his worst, it's definitely loitering just above the bottom of the barrel. While he is my all-time favorite artist (I have all of his albums except for 'Aida'), I'm not sure he'll ever hit the top again. His voice is much deeper, I'll never get used to his hair weave, and lately he seems to be known more for negative publicity than for his music. At the same time, I don't want him to retire. I bought this just after its release, but I guess I'll just have to listen to it many more times in hopes of finding a bright spot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing In Common With the Original","review":"As with all things \\"art\\" this is a personal opinion so please don't take offence. If you were anticipating something approaching the fire and originality of Elton John's earlier works you will likely be disappointed. This material is weak and watered down to the point of being contrived. Anything resembling rock and roll has been efficiently neutered out including Davey Johnston's guitar that was so relevant in the original Captain Fantastic. If you were hoping for more \\"Songs from the West Coast\\" this disc might appeal. Otherwise, the reference to the original classic is unfounded if not outright deceitful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cable is cool.

The concept of this coming-of-age drama is fine but the acting - so,so - the script - unsatisfying - and the ending - weak. I know how it was 'meant' to end but it didn't deliver the impact I would have expected. So, as mentioned, great story but poorly delivered. I was looking forward to this one sooo much, oh well.

Unfortunately the poems within do not match the fine tuned quality of the physical book. Both in Hebrew and English, Yonatan's poems are sentimental and lack any bite. Technically they may be fine poems; the Hebrew is accomplished in a formal way. But overall his poems fail to present human emotion in any novel way. There is nothing new here. This collection fails to provide the reader with any visceral sense of what poetry is about: The primal hunch of something moving which we sense but can not fully understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Sound Quality","review":"Although \\"Clemenza\\" is a great opera, the sound quality of this CD is poor. It's been recorded live in London, but with old tech, which means you can hear voices and coughs from the audience.I have looked for a Clemenza CD, but only found this one.

His reflections on his career are moving and perceptive, totally lacking in self-aggrandisement. His thoughts on the whole \\"Star Wars\\" phenomenon are particularly witty but smack of the desperation of being hounded by that film's fans. It's tragic that this great man may only be remembered by modern generations for his appearance in that opus instead of for his work in the Ealing comedies, \\"The Bridge on the River Kwai\\", his lengthy stage career and his magnificent turn on TV as George Smiley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another lovely book from a wonderful writer.","review":"Just as he did in MY NAME ESCAPES ME, Sir Alec Guinness pens another lovely book of memories, reflections, anecdotes, musings, and observations drawn from his journal. He is not just an extraordinary actor, but a superb writer with a clean, exact, elegant style, a shrewd eye, a wise mind and soul, a warm heart, and a sharp tongue.Reading his prose is an unalloyed pleasure, and the only regrets this book inspires are that he has decided (for good and valid reasons) to retire from acting, and that this might indeed be his final appearance. I hope that he will write again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The swansong of a quiet giant","review":"As previously said, this is a very well and beautifully writen errr... memoir. The cover tells you the whole story of what to expect inside. At first glance Alec dancing appears as a comical figure almost, but as you look closer you can see he is in some sort of agony. And as the book moves on, it is hard for him to not show his melancholy.Despite being a bit of a emotional downer, this is still a very worthwhile read for any of his fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Free & Clear Laundry I could find","review":"Ive been using this product for a year now.

This stuff pours out great & I love the small bottle. It's such a space saver. Im doing laundry for 7 people in our house and It's worked great on our 5 kids. My daughter has eczema which is why I need to have a free & clear product.

I'm an Amazon fiend, and for the most part Amazon does a fantastic job with packaging. This was definitely not the case here. Not only did one bottle have a crack in that made a huge mess in the box, only 8 bottles were shipped vice the 9 as described!

It works okay for cleaning, and none of us break out from it or choke on a fragrance.If you sign up for the automatic shipping (Super Savers, I think it's called) program, you get free shipping and a discount, so the price works out to around $4.75 per bottle. In the area where I live, that's only a few cents higher than I would pay at the store, and I get the added bonus of never running out. We live out in the country, and the local stores don't carry this often, so it's worth the extra few cents to me to keep my unscented detergent on hand.

There were 7 other kids anxiously awaiting their turn to hit it, so we used some duct tape to put it back together and carried on. After 3-4 more duct tape surgeries, we were able to allow all the kids to hit it. Was it fun? Absolutely! But, it really needs a better design. The helmet separates from the rest of the head incredibly easily. Another friend of mine had one and it separated when they hung it up (before anyone even hit it).

I have been lecturing an introductory computational physics course for two years, and, by far, the most adequate books I found (and use) were Giordano & Nakanishi and Landau & Páez ones. Dr. Thijssen's book is highly concentrated on condensed matter physics, and it has *too few* graphics, figures, or illustrations. In my sincere opinion, is by far the worst book on C.P. I have bought, and I do not recommend it, at least for those who want to learn C.P. \\"from scratch\\". Ok, ok, it can be considered a \\"high level\\" book (maybe adequate for graduate courses), but I think that it lacks the main points on \\"pure\\" C.P.

Most books on this subject expect the reader to become an expert after reading them, which is impossible! The authors themselves spent years to achieve their levels so they should have a practical expectation for the readers, especially undergraduates.I am not saying Thijssen's book is easy. It's far from the truth. I am only saying that Thijssen knows about the reader's difficulty when reading this book and doing its exercises! He not only explains the physics problem but also illustrates the technique to do the computation.Even though, this book is not for beginners, it's ideal for graduate students on experimental physics (students on theoretical physics need to know beyond this book). Also, it will save the read tons of time if he use Mathematica instead of C or Fortran for programming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great overall dvd","review":"I really liked this dvd for the work out segements.

In addition to this DVD we also own the Total Body Toning on the Balance Ball and they are the core (excuse the pun) of our weekly workouts.The music in both DVDs is very nice to listen to, not just drum machine beats and synthesizers. The outdoor settings are gorgeous.Tanja is very fun and personable while she explains each move and encourages you throughout the workout. And they truly are FULL BODY workouts that tone you and give you full cardio burn as well.And the wide variety of exercises on both DVDs means you work a wide variety of muscles and won't get bored out doing one set of exercises over and over. We will definitely be purchasing her third and any future DVD.Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"9/11?","review":"Anyone notice this album was released on September 11th, 2001?

Of course, the picture shows 8 ounce. Hoping that the written description was accurate, I went ahead with the order for a non-painting project because I didn't have time to order elsewhere, and 6 ounce canvas is not easy to find.Upshot, of course, is that I received 8 oz. canvas and had to use it even though it wasn't the ideal weight.My real beef is with the quality of the hem stitching, which was very poor. I had to have the hems re-sewn. I don't care to leave negative reviews, but this product earns it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good book","review":"My book is called Fox Outfoxed.

Told quickly about the central event, each successive pass brings you closer, allows you to feel the depth and inevitability and to experience both its attraction and revulsion until you arrive at the brilliant depiction of the tunnel vision of coping and performing ordinary tasks under extreme stress. I found this book hard to read precisely because it is well written, the characters vividly drawn and the events all too plausible. And in the end you understand; all of the pieces fall into place, but to what purpose? Is the cost of your enrichment really worth it, or is your attempt to derive meaning from pain convincing in the end?This book is in the same class as \\"The Bonesetter's Daughter\\" in terms of a fine portrayal of individuals and cultures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, just plain awful","review":"This might be one of the worst books I have ever read.

Or better yet, just get completely bored with the whole thing and hang up as quickly as possible? That's what I felt like while reading this novel. The composition of this novel was, at best, junior high level. And, to top it off, I live in the San Francisco Bay Area and was unable to conjure up any interest in her ongoing blah blah blah about what street she was walking or driving through. I think I'm going to take BART to the city and abandon the book somewhere in Chinatown."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it zero if I could","review":"I'm required to read this book for my English class nd if I had a choice I'd have thrown it away. The characters are painfully dimensional. There is hardly plot to speak of and what plot there is, is told out of order. First Leila is eloping with Mason and telling Mah about it. Then Mah is askibg her when she's getting married. Then Leila is with her sister in New Yorl. Then she's back in San Francisco. To make it even worse, Ng never gives us a clue where or when the character is. this might be forgivible if the story was interesting and provided a reason. As it is, I'm glad I on;y paid 66 cents for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic...","review":"Being an immigrant myself, the struggles and dreams of the narrator and her sister are realistic. Many Asian-Americans struggle with identity crisis. The word \\"acceptance\\" plays a major role in this novel.The author successfully wrote \\"Bone\\" with a unique approach. The environment, the surroundings, the people and the culture was discussed with clarity. The novel left me with a question: How involve am I to myself? to my family? How do I know when to cross the border?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't feel anything for this book.","review":"This book featured no character development, no sense of urgency with the characters. It was primarily a memory of past events by the narrator (a young Chinese-American woman) who is about to leave Chinatown; this memory told to the reader by way of inner monologue, and the recollections are as follows: One of her sisters has committed suicide, her step-dad runs up against bad luck trying to attain the American Dream, her living sister has \\"escaped\\" Chinatown to live in New York to work in the travel business; and, her mother has eyes for another man since she is left alone when the step-dad goes overseas occasionally on jobs as a seaman.

Mason and the narrator especially, have no depth or complexity. Potentially riveting issues are merely touched on, then forgotten, and bad lines such as \\"Have yours first; I'll put Mason's in a jar for you to take,\\" and \\"Ona loved the love stories about the butterfly lovers,\\" make me wonder how much time was actually spent revising and nurturing the author's \\"poetic gift for metaphor.\\" I wanted to love this book, but I could barely bring myself to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read, deep and not gloomy","review":"A professor in my college recommended this book, when I picked it up and saw a topic - a suicide of one of the sisters - I was taken aback, I am not into depressing, gloomy books.But I am glad I read it - it's one of the best books, after reading it the order of the chapters does not confuse you any more. I thought it was a bit made up how the author tried to mention 'bones' in several contexts just to tide it to the name of the book, and it was still puzzling why the sister did it - drugs, pressure? but the rest of it is great, simple, funny, and not pretentious.Grade : A"},{"rating":"2","title":"Owls","review":"As a collector, very happy with this purchase and the seller.

I can ignore the noise of the computer fans, but I cannot tune the hum out for some reason--perhaps subconsciously I just don't expect them from speakers, plus the noise is pretty harsh.The noise also submerges some of the finer details when playing music, especially at low volumes. It doesn't matter too much, since the detail level isn't high at all.I agree that these speakers are good for people who don't care much about music quality.

This was a book I didn't want to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and meaningful story","review":"What makes this book so interesting to me is the way that it not only chronicles the actions of the snake handlers, but the affect the situation has on the author, as well. I always appreciate books about religious subjects by authors who are not skeptical or hostile to religious matters. Covington's experiences on a spiritual level are just as compelling as his experiences with the members of the church. This is a very good book, one worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Suspenseful and Personal Spiritual Journey","review":"I first became aware of this book when I saw author Dennis Covington interviewed on TV when the book was first released. Having a long-time interest in the culture of the South, I was irresistably drawn to this fascinating story. Highly recommended, especially for those interested in comparative religions. A great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascinating Subject, Terribly Written","review":"This is one of those books where interest in the subject drives you through it despite the poor presentation. The writing is juvenile and indulgent, and serves as caution to steer clear of the author's novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"An effortlessly interesting subject matter","review":"If the image of hollering, God-fearing folk handlng snakes in dingy,isolated church buildings, all against a backdrop of twangy sounds and summer heat attracts you, then this book should be read.For mine, the latter parts of the book, which focus on squabbles amongst the faithful, and the author's own excursion into his personal experiences, move away from what brought me to it in the first place - an examination of the character and life of a unique religious form.(Compare the very short section of snake handling in the novel Fried Green Tomatoes, or even the feeling captured in some of the decades old, origninal, recordings on the CD 'Mountian Music of Kentucky'). However, the book is well written in a 'New Yorker' kind of way, has a good pace and makes a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Salvation on Sand Mountain: Snake Handling and Redemption in Southern Appalachia","review":"Fascinating book.

He writes of his experience without belittling a little known section of our Southern religious heritage. Worth a read if you are interested in this cultural phenomenon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good!","review":"Let me say this right off the bat: I do not endorse snake handling and I believe that they have completely misinterpretated the verse in Mark 16 that they hold as the reason for their less than normal practice. I believe their theology is completely heterodox and they are very dangerous.All that said, this was an amazing read. The author takes you with him on a wild adventure into the culture of snake handling and backwoods Christianity. I found the \\"surprise\\" ending to the be, well, surprising.The book is well written and a very smooth and easy read. You'll find the beginning a little slow but as you continue reading you'll find yourself losing track of time. Yes, it is that good.My one issue with the book is that it wasn't longer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very alive","review":"I found this book to be a powerful exploration of what is at once both a very simple and very complex faith. The trust that Covington describes is incomprehensible and wonderful; the absolute, unswerving faith in the midst of what is a very real, very evil world is amazing. Covington does an excellent job of presenting a portrait of something that has survived against the odds; what he describes is a world that some may have difficulty believing exists. The book is gripping and moving. It may be a challenge for a \\"modern\\" reader to fully understand this faith, but this novel is certainly an example of how anyone, even a seasoned reporter, can be moved by an old gas station, some rousing music, and a box of snakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"So/so","review":"I purchsed this solely based upon the fanfare that others had given it. This thickly written book, has too much loftiness and not enough real world practicality to be a quotable resource. Having working in the tailoring trade, as well as an intense student of 19th century tailoring, I disagree with the conclusions that author made about an international subconsious sensitivity within the trade, any more than there would be an invisibile spiritual connection among brick layers today. The author's perspective is that of a tradesman, but an academic, which has the danger of being myopic. I attended the Fashion Institute of Technology, and was told by several tailors, that there are things you learn in school, things you learn from books, and things you learn on the job.Unfortunately, being completely disconnected from the trade, there isn't much to learn from THIS book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mix!

Try NOLO Press or search the internet for anything but this piece of garbage. Rarely do I feel ripped off from a book that doesn't deliver, but this one qualifies. There are 240+ pages, the Appendix (starting on page 111) is full of examples from different states ads on Notice to Creditors and a few charts of how much attorneys can charge in each state. Of the 8 chapters covering 110 pages, only 4 really deal with buying probate properties. The first 2 chapters tell you why you should invest in real estate.

Only in special cases will it approach the suggested speed of 20 ppm. Also, the software needed on the PC to configure and support the scan functionality is clunky and unreliable. Further, I bought it believing that it had scan to email functionality, as suggested by the literature.

The cartridges claim to have 5,000 page life - I have never gotten more than 500 pages from the color cartridges - considering they cost in excess of $100 per cartridge, that makes your cost per page around $3 for a color print - absurd.

I can understand that difficulties come up trying to create driver software that's compatible with someone else's operating system, but it appears they are choosing to ignore this problem and hope it passes with time.

At the same time, the book used classical literature in a way that made it fun.

A great lesson in race relations, an admission of being wrong, making amends and building an enduring friendship. It also teaches that friendship is more important than winning. The two girls are compared to chocolate milk, one black, one white that blend together to make a special flavor of friendship.Adrian writes from the experiences of her neighborhood and the children that populate it. Every adult should read it too. In fact, I recommend it to adults,you will understand your child better. It's a five star rating with five more as bonuses. Once you read Crossing Jordan, you'll be hooked. Adrian Fogelin has a special talent that everyone should experience.Ronald G.

A child could have written something with more soul. Only a few of the the characters held my interest through the whole book. It was obvious that the writer has not known any Greek peasants. Both of my parents are from a small village in Greece and I have been there many times. And, I've been in an outhouse, it is not, as the writer thinks, a place a person sits in a long time gazing at the sky. This book has nothing original in it and is full of cliches. I'm surprised no one yelled \\"Opa\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book Club Opinion","review":"Our book club chose Corelli's Mandolin because of the many good reviews we saw. We didn't feel the book lived up to the good reviews. Our conclusion tonight was that the book must have been written by two different authors. The first part of the book was lyric, beautifully crafted, emotionally involving, and a joy to read. The second part seemed as if it was written by someone who didn't care whether the characters seemed plausible, and had little interest in pace or character development. It was flat, unconvincing, and amazingly, irritatingly leaden. I told our group that de Bernieres needed an editor, and that I would step in to fill this role for him. I told the group how the book should have ended, which was roughly 100 pages sooner, and with the two main characters acting in character. This would have avoided the nutburger kind of unsatisfying conclusion that you can read in the book as written, before I stepped in to fix things!

This book totally disappointed me. And even if you like the first 400 pages, skip the last hundred, because they're worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"From all the positive reviews I thought it would be good....","review":"I'm always looking for good books and picked this up after seeing all the good reviews and recalling a friend's recommendation from years ago. Now de Bernieres is not a bad writer per se, and the book does keep you somewhat interested. However to me, overall, it turned out to be rather trite with a ridiculous ending.Now I don't read many romance novels, so this may color my view on the thing. I suggest that if you aren't typically into romance novels definitely skip this one. If you are, you might like it although the ending will leave you empty....then again some people may be looking for that. Personally, I wish I hadn't read it.For an excellent review read Katie Surrence's review of August 1, 2002. It does however contain spoiler's that will ruin the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"fine historical fiction with mildly disappointing ending","review":"By and large, this is an engrossing and challenging read that manages to evoke Dr. Zhivago in its \\"lovers writ large on the pages of history\\" themes and the Poisonwood Bible in its attempt to use a fictional story to teach the history of a region. The author is particularly skillful in being able to convey different narrative voices for the different characters. My only disappointment came with the end of the novel, which struck me as both overly happy and contradictory to the earlier text. Overall, fine historical fiction. I shudder to think what the movies will do to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"This book starts off a bit slow, and it was hard to stay interested for the first 100 pages or so. It was totally worth sticking it out, however, because the last 300 were absolutely amazing. You always hear reviewers say, \\"You'll laugh, you'll cry,\\" but in this case, it's absolutely true. I've never cried over a book before or become truly attached to the characters, but I was totally enamoured with Pelagia, Corelli, even more minor characters like Carlo, whose valor raises the whole \\"is he or isn't he?\\" debate over Corelli's fate.

Set on the Greek island of Cephallonia, the reader is thrust into the 'literally' lush, emotionally rich, sharply humorous, painfully tragic story of the beautiful Pelagia. This spirited young woman lives with her father, the village physician and self-appointed historian. This is the tale of the small town on Cephallonia, Pelagia's life, her two great loves (one a beautiful young Greek fisherman whom the war ravages, and the other a somewhat shy, sweet Italian army captain who plays Antonia, his mandolin), and the Second World War in the Balkans (which include Greece). I loved this book and will blatantly quote the Washington Post, \\"(It) brims with all the grand topics of literature - love and death, heroism and skullduggery, humor and pathos, not to mention art and religion. A good old-fashioned novel.\\" This is a wonderful curl-up-in-bed-for-a-few-hours-and-be-transported novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Correlli's Mandolin","review":"An enjoyable tale about the poor state of the Italian army in WW2 and the poor Greeks who had to in some cases look after them in their, the Greeks homes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor characterisation and thin main plot.","review":"An over long book with much unnecessary and irrelevant detail. The characterisation is poor - we learn little of the people's past lives or of their opinions and the character of Corelli is one-dimensional at best. While intelligently written, the main plot is thin and has to be padded out to the point of absurdity. Maybe I am missing the point here with all the rave reviews, but I found this book to be boring and tedious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written but totally inaccurate historically","review":"The fiction part of this novel is well written and entertaining. The history part of it is inaccurate and fully distorted by the personal views of the writer. He is assuming right and wrong based on his political philosophy. The explanation he gives on the author's note shows how partial he is. His historical knowledge is as accurate as saying that Britain is still an empire. He should stick to purely fictional novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"By far the best book of fiction I have read in the past three years. I simply could not put it down. Acquired while waiting to transfer aircraft, without any knowledge of the book or later film, this piece touched every emotion without being maudlin, preachy, or cute. Perspective on man's humanity and inhumanity, told from multiple viewpoints and in multiple voices. Especially meaningful as we try to understand events in Iraq and Afghanistan. Each phrase must be slowly savored for its complexity and beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most wonderful book I have ever read","review":"This book, is, without doubt, one of the best books I have ever had the fortune to read. It is vivid, imaginative, humorous, scary, emotional and descriptive. This has already been said, of course, with the most common complaint being the ending. Louis de Bernieres agrees with you, and has published, in the Times newspaper, another ending. I have heard that it is worth looking at, and if you haven't read the book yet, get to it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the book, but the ending was not what I had in mind!","review":"Travel to Greece has never been at the top of my list, but I've changed my mind.

I know things are always rosy, but still! Even so, I'll recommend it to friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"AARGH!","review":"I finished this book last night, screaming, absolutely shocked at DeBernieres's ending. Up until the last 50 pages or so I thought it was the greatest book ever written. I almost wish I hadn't read it, because I'm filled with such rage at what could have been. Maybe that's the point? Now I know what it's like to be Pelagia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book to read.","review":"I read de Berniers' Captain Corelli's Mandolin over the weekend and felt the same way I feel when I read books by Marquez. As with Marquez it takes awhile before the distractions in my head recede to the point where I can appreciate the complex and intricate rhythm of the words and then I am hooked. The text is extraordinarily dense and rich with meaning about life and love and packed with historical information.The ending was a disappointment, or more precisely, the approach to the ending was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total waste of time","review":"Much recommended by people whose tastes I tend to share.

Talk about a long and drawn-out beginning! I certainly was not convinced of Pelagia's love for Mandras...thought it to be more of a crush. I loved the imagery of the small Greek town, but was exasperated by the author's detailed descriptions of initial characters who later become irrelevant. I also felt that the author just skimmed past the latter half of the main characters' lives, and jumped to the ending...which I found incredulous. This book should be retitled \\"Pelagia's Wasted Youth.\\" The only character who really touched me was Carlo Guercio, and the two stars are for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I had high expectations, but 200 pages into the book I was still wondering when it was going to start.

The movie had a happier ending, but the book was funnier in the end. I saw the movie before I finished the book, so I suppose I was corrupted by the actors, who were charming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant Love Story","review":"The love story between Captain Corelli and Pelagia, during WWII was poignant and heartbreaking. The captain is a member of the Italian Army who is being billeted with a family on the Island of Cephallonia, during the occupation. I loved the characters, the setting, and the romance. I did not like the protracted chapters about the history of the island of Cephallonia, or the involved stories of Il Duce. Overall those were minor complaints. I would recommend this story to anyone who enjoys a timeless love story set in the midst of history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost truly Great","review":"Except for when the author \\"goes over the top\\" as he does with the Mussolini brochure and when he starts one of the truly horrendus discriptions on some grisly detail (that you know is on its way and is going to go on too long), this is a magnificent novel, informative, moving and wise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical enlightenment","review":"This is a story of historical fiction which is difficult to follow at times, but well worth a read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the book, DON'T see the movie!","review":"I was completely immersed in the stories of the diverse characters of this book.

And, if the only video your rental place has left is this one, go home and watch Leave It to Beaver reruns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stellar achievement by a new author!","review":"In Corelli's Mandolin, Louis De Bernieres has created characters so vital and compelling, that his book becomes a journey through the gamut of human experience and emotion, rather than mere words on paper. De Bernieres's first novel transports us through time to a wacky village on a Greek Island during war time, and through war ravaged Europe. We feel our feet grow cold and rotten in the trenches, we feel giddy with joy and longing during spring festivals, and we grieve over our lost love as we grow old with resignation. A young and brilliant master, Louis De Bernieres's vivid imagery should be watched with heart-pounding anticipation and a twinkle in the eyes"},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLE!!!","review":"What a lovely week it has been -- curling up every night with \\"Corelli's Mandolin\\". I'm sorry the book had to end, because I was thoroughly enjoying my evenings in Cephallonia.

Corelli out of my life....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Implausible Ending","review":"I had not heard of this book but became wrapped up in the beautifully written humor and tragedy of the love and war stories. However, I found the ending to be needlessly and pointlessly frustrating and tragic. Corelli did not act according to character in failing to rejoin Pelagia. This inconceivable ending basically ruined and brought into doubt the rest of the book and made me angry. What was the purpose of the author's manipulation of the plot in this way? I think it was irresponsible. I don't understand the overriding number of \\"rave\\" reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Louis de Bernieres is the finest author I have ever read.","review":"This book is a masterpiece. I could smell the thyme. I choked on the dust. The characters remain with me and disturb my sleep. My own Grandfather's mandolin has been gathering dust in my closet. Perhaps I'll learn to play it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life as it is from every angle of emotions","review":"The love story of Pellagia and Antonio, is only the frame work in which the delicacy and madness of the human adventure through life, is exposed in such a fantastic fashion, that if an being from another planet ever reads this novel, he will wonder through space in order to feel what it is to be in this planet for a while. Mr. De Berniers makes of the reading experience such a pleasure, that you wonder which estrange being decided to invent the television.The tempo of this book is intense from the second paragraph (if not the first) onwards and the humor and wit are elements which do not leave the scene in one single page, event through it most dramatic moments. Maybe it Was Milan Kundera who wrote that the tragic is always absurd and the absurd is usually laughable. I believe that Mr. De Benieres adhere to this point of view and put is right into the readers mind and heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"well written, informative novel in historical terms of the f","review":"The novel is a deep assessment of life in a specific area of the world during WWII. The land, the people, the conflicts, the pain and suffering, the elan vital are brought to life for the reader. This book is not for the faint of heart, nor for the searchers of perpetual pleasure. It is well written and deeply engrossing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical and suprising...","review":"A very moving and often funny story. This is for the student who can appreciate a large vocabulary and some new words to boot. A suprise to the \\"typical\\" WWII drama. An interesting and enthralling read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely book with a disappointing ending","review":"Though the story starts off slowly, I soon found myself engrossed with the lives of all its characters and enjoyed reading most particularly, about the relationship between Pelagia and her father. There were so many delightful and touching scenes in the book as well as more sombre, sad moments. It was then, such a rude shock to have arrived at the clumsy, last quarter of the book made worse by the undignified, hollywood-style ending. This lovely book surely did not deserve such mishandling."},{"rating":"2","title":"My head hurts from crying!!","review":"I read this book after a couple of friends raved about it. It took me a few pages then I was trapped in the intricate interwoven story. I read the last part of the book one Saturday morning lying in bed. I cried and cried and cried. It was just so sad. My head pounded and I felt that a great tragedy had touched my life. I now want to vist Cephalonia and smell the Rosemary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tragedy, comedy and wisdom, all rolled into one","review":"I didn't know de Bernieres, but I found this book amazing. It took me awhile to discern where he was going at the beginning, but about 3 chapters in, I was enthralled at the eclectic mix of comedy, tragedy, wisdom and love story all rolled into one. It's also excellent that this book has some basis in historical fact. All in all, a story that left me with long moments of belly-churning laughter and a lot to think about. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Succulent","review":"I chose this book for embarrassing romantic reasons, and was trapped in it like a fly stuck in honey. Its rich language attracted and captivated me, and I wished that it was about two hundred pages longer. The end seemed a bit rushed, but that could have been my own perception, given my desire for it to stretch on. The very end didn't seem to give me the \\"happily ever after\\" wrap-up that I've become used to, but that was part of its charm, and part of the reason I feel confident that this will be considered a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lyrical & graphic, touching the extremes of the human heart","review":"This is a book that I wanted never to end. De Bernieres is a master of story-telling who takes the reader to places in the heart which are alternatively a joy and a horror to behold. The love among the Greeks for each other and their tolerance for their inept and totally charming Italian \\"occupation force\\" is in stark contrast to the atrocities of the Germans. I really cared for the characters de Bernieres created and mourned for them: I left a flower in the book at the page where Psipsina died. The prose is totally engaging, at turns witty, ironic, and mercilessly graphic: the war scenes are among the most dismaying I have ever read. The joy of Corelli and Pelagia in their courtship and finally in each other's arms will bring a smile to any lover. I heartily recommend this book - and the author's South American Trilogy (\\"The War of Don Emmanuel's Nether Parts\\", et seq.) as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great epic novel but beware of biased history","review":"If taken at face value, an epic love story, Corelli's Mandolin is by far one of the best. The reason I gave it 5 stars is just that. The writing is wonderful and as a Greek, he seemed to capture a lot of our quirky traits. I would like to make it clear that the author does have a strong anti-communist agenda and portrays the Greek communists in a very biased sense. At the same time he makes his countrymen (the British) out to be saviors which really contradicts the history of that period. This fact has made the script writers for the movie change the script so as to be more true to history than the author. If you are looking for a good read (not very difficult as some reviewers have suggested) this book does the job beautifully. His characters are very robust and the author does a wonderful job in his descriptions not only of the character's but of the island itself. A great novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunning book","review":"It reminded me of \\"100 years of Solitude\\" by Marquez, masterful story telling with some truly wonderful passages of sublime prose. It had the feeling of truth, of a story that was real in a very human sense. It's been about a week since I read it yet it still says with me, the characters, the situations and the vivid rendering of the Greek island.A fantastic novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth sticking at it","review":"I read this book a year ago and it still haunts me. - probably the best book I've ever read.It starts with about five different stories at once, which makes it really hard to get into. BUT, its worth sticking with, and somewhere around page 60 you start to piece it all together.Somewhere in the middle you find yourself switching between laughter and tears, sometimes both on the same page, yet all the time a conviction grows that something truly dreadful lies ahead . . .I fully admit to finding a park bench and arriving at work late because I couldn't put the book down sometimes.- and I'm supposed to be a senior manager!Anyone who has been involved in Greek island communities will recognise the characters as true to life, and even today the older generation find it difficult to discuss how the horrors of War entered their quiet and peaceful lives.I thoroughly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Childish","review":"I want to write something constructive to explain why this book was such a waste of money and time, but find myself sitting dumbfounded that I listened to someone who told me it was good. Watch a cartoon if you want characterizations and plot befitting a 10-year-old--it's shorter and cheaper. Factual errors are the least of many troubles. It distresses me that people are taking this as a well researched book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.","review":"The only reason I finished this book was because it was reading for a book group. It is very slow reading till about pg 200. The ending stinks. Made me want to throw it against the wall!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a load of garbage !!!!","review":"What a load of garbage !!!! This book depicts the British as the saviours of Greece and the Greek communists as savages. Though there was some excesses by the Greek communists, it pales in comarison to the deceit of the British metered out during and after the war. Also as always, western authors and (movie makers) depict the islands and Greece in an image they want to see. Never the image Greeks see of themselves. Non-Greeks would be surprised how different these two viewpoints can sometimes be. If people can stop romanticising about the characters and the love triangle, maybe they can buy a history book which tells them what actually did happen in that period."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the book and the people, WWII's end is a bad thing","review":"The introductory chapters are overwhemingly poetic. And the bulk of the novel, until the Italian surrender, is wonderful--working at all the levels needed to tell the story of the lovers, the friends, the country, and the war. Unfortunately, when the Italians are about to be given up to the Germans, Des Bernieres makes a radical shift in storytelling style whose austerity fails to accomplish what De Bernieres might have intended. The writing (and perhaps also, this reader) are not up to the challenge.And sadly, the concluding ~80 pages take yet another wrong turn. While they may have been an acceptable construction if presented by themselves, the painful lack of consonance with the first three-quarters of the book make them a dissatisfying read.The book is nonetheless a gorgeous and recommended read, but the glory is in the beginning and the middle, not the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Review of Corelli's Mandolin","review":"This is a great book. I highly recommend it. It's a well written love story, similar to Love in the Time of Cholera."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't get it out of my head!!","review":"Having just finished the book and then read the 95 previous reviewers' comments, I have to agree that it ranks among the best that this English teacher has ever read. Yes, the ending was a disappointment, but I find myself mourning for Psipsina's death, for Pelagia's wasted virgin life, and for the fact that the book is, indeed, over. De Bernieres is a brilliant author. I have recommended the book to everyone, and will now reread it, with dictionary in hand. I also need to order his other books, pronto. Read it and enjoy a tru tour de force."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read It Now!","review":"This novel has so many twists and turns you would think that you were being throttled by a snake. The time span of the novel is also amazing, being spread over a time span from pre war to almost present day. Comical yet in many parts disturbing, this is a must read book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a good read","review":"This was a very impressive book. I'm not sure about the historical accuracy of it, but I do intend to check. de Bernieres creates memorable characters in this novel about the Italian occupation of a small Greek island during WWII. If you have been reading mediocre pop fiction lately and want something that's a little more rich, but not impossibly difficult, this is probably your top pick. I read it while travelling through Italy, and it was neat to compare some of the cultural and historical stuff in the novel to the things I was experiencing. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"consider your audience","review":"The book was very disjointed and repetitive. I guess that each chapter was written as a separate journal article. It was a lot of facts and statistics, but there was one statement in the book that ruined it for me...\\"the availablity of ultrasoud makes the perfect outcome possible.\\" ..referring to the use of ultrasound for sex selection. I don't agree with the gov't regulations of reproduction in China, but I also don't agree with any endorsement of sex-selctive abortions. Anybody who buys this book is likely in the adoption process of one of these prescious little girls and has possibly gone through numerous infertility treatments. Probably not the best audience for pro-choice undertones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Criticism misplaced","review":"There is no question that this book is academic in tone. It was written by an academic, Dr. Kay Johnson. It contains extremely important information and analysis, and the criticism that it is \\"academic\\" is not fair. I'd urge all with an interest in the topic to read Kay Johnson's book, along with the Karin Evans book. Incidentally, Kay Johnson is doing very important and useful work on the ground in China, to try to bring better lives to AIDS orphans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent compilation","review":"This is certainly one of the finest compilations of African music I've heard. From Afrocuban to reggae to the soothing sounds of Cape Verde and beyond, the variety is good. There's not a dud performance and the quality is excellent throughout. The more well-known names like Oliver Mtukudzi and Habib Koite lie alongside some pretty obscure ones that are right up there. For example there's an early Adama Yolamba track that's really funky and makes you want to hear more of his. However his early albums are hard to get (and his recent effort Kassa is a little disappointing), so this track is a rare gem to be treasured. But then each track is distinctive and offers its own particular pleasure. Captivating and toe-tapping all the way, but like many Putumayo compilations a little short at 48 minutes (lose one star for that)."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite CD","review":"I'm kinda cheating by reviewing the African Odyssey CD. Truth is, I already had a copy of it from when I taught World History and played it for my students--maybe 15 years ago. I bought it at the Museum Store (now defunct) at a mall in Dallas.It became my favorite CD, which I often listened to in my car. But on my last road trip, I discovered that it was skipping. OH NO!Usually I'd putz around, thinking about buying another one and not getting around to it. But this was an emergency. So I checked on amazon.com and found it. Whew!As usual with Amazon, I got it promptly. And coincidentally, it came the day before my English class was reading a Maya Angelou nonfiction piece about visiting in Africa. So, just in time, a new set of my students got to hear some of my favorite musical selections.And, BTW, I've also bought since that original time a couple other CDs from Putumayo World Music.

Except, the film is not really about the construction as much as it's about the process of getting the building built (e.g. culture differences between the architects and the locals). There are also a few side stories which go nowhere.Biggest problem with the movie is that it's very tough to read the subtitles sometimes. 1/2 the documentary has English subtitles which are in white and have no dark border.

Lower fat and calories than chips and you don't eat as many of them at once...because they are more satisfying than crackers or chips. I gave a few boxes away so I am already ordering my second case. I will be more of a miser this time. I tried to not order this case but I was missing them as a snack alternative.

I would purchase them again. To the Celiac Community-although they say they are made in a facility that also processes wheat; they are endorsed by CSA and are tested for ppm of gluten and pass the current standards for gluten free foods.

He also proves to be a good blues singer and songwriter. (Robben Ford fans will love the playing and perhaps, as I did, find Verheyen quite a bit more soulful as a singer.) Styles range from Muddy Waters to Cream to funky rock/blues. Then, at the end of the album, in a great change of pace, Verheyen delivers a sensational (almost Jackson Browne-like) acoustic folk tune called Silence is Golden--which he finishes with some uptempo country electric guitar playing that is truly beautiful. This album is a genuine pleaser. Highly recommended. (PS on stars--I use four stars for very good albums like this one; I save 5 for the proven classics--\\"Graceland\\" and the like.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Effort!","review":"Verheyen is a true guitar virtuoso. His past experience includes performing with many jazz musicians such as Dave Grusin, Richard Elliott, Dan Siegel, Stanley Clarke and Max Roach. He has also played with the likes of Robben Ford and was the lead guitarist for Supertramp replacing guitarist Roger Hodgson in 1985.Slang Justice is Verheyen's exploration into the Blues. On the CD, Verheyen mixes a variety of styles ranging from blazing electric blues to acoustic country blues and he handles each style with surprising mastery and with great tonality.If there is any knock on Verheyen, it certainly cannot be his guitar playing. However, Verheyen's voice is not the smokey type which one traditionaly associates with a blues musician. Rather, it is more reminiscent of a Robben Ford or a Eric Johnson. As such, the CD may take a couple of listens to get use to the voice. Overall, however, a decent effort an is worth a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"It may have been alright, the second CD doesn't play in any of my players or computers.","review":"I trusted the reviews on this page without hearing the work.

These mixes don't pay homage to the classics they claim to \\"tranzform\\", they bastardize them- I don't know whether to label them as offensive to the originals or just plain laughable. On some of these the synth melodies aren't even in the same key as the vocals, and don't get me started on the lame vocalists. If I ever walked into a club or even a house party & heard any of these songs playing I would have to giggle & then leave immediately. Hey, don't take my word for it- listen to the samples & decide for yourself, but if you find yourself enjoying what you hear it might be time to admit (to yourself) that you have no taste in music.

However, When I envision Webster Hall in NYC (I was a med. student in NYC and did go to the Hall) I do think of more darker forms of music and atleast if it's going to be a clubby CD, then make the mixes good!! I did not like this CD at all. First the music was very boring and the mixing was suboptimal. I even gave the CD to a friend of mine who loves clubby music and even she said she did not like it. Trust me- you'll be waisting your money if you purchase this. If you want to hear a good Webster Hall CD- try the one mixed by Mike Rizzo (I'm not sure of the volume #)- I would give this 4.5 stars easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"The promoters of this publication participate in illegal unsolicited email practices (ie.

He says this is a horrible form of trickery, but then writes a whole book with the opposite premise to trick Christians into believing that Jesus was just some ordinary messiah and that Christianity is a false religion.

The work is not dogmatic or preachy. He even raises the question if a Jewish theology is necessary. In a religion that has been dominated by halakah, do modern Jews really need a concept of God in the first place? In many ways, organized conceptions of God are alien to the Jewish tradition.

This is an aweful book for students, even those who are math majors.It would be a useful book for instructors of topology to find problems in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Math Undergrad","review":"As nice as the graphs and figures in the book are, the explanations are chopped; they do not make you think through the concepts from beginning to end. When I read the explanations I feel like I am given the punch-line immediately with no build-up and hence I am usually lost and trying to figure out what is \\"between the lines\\". It feels too concise and not well-elaborated; like the concepts were taken from a professor's notes and thrown into the book with an assumption that the reader will quickly put things together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some recipes questionable...","review":"Some of the recipes presented here are quite tasty...but I found that many of them were thoroughly unworkable, as if they'd been translated into \\"vegetarian\\" without much thought. Matzoh balls are fussy enough with eggs -- with nothing to hold them together but potatoes, they're nearly impossible! Other recipes lacked flavor. In short, simply removing meat, dairy, and eggs does not necessarily make a good vegetarian recipe; something else needs to be provided to supply flavor and structure."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting simple recipes","review":"I like a lot of the recipes here, I would just spice them up a little as they are basic and simple but I like that. So to me this is a good cookbook, modest but quite a treasure chest that takes up very little space. If you prefer elaborate lengthy descriptions with beautiful photographs look elsewhere but this is a handy lowfat book with vegetarian recipes from various different countries. It may look unassuming but you can work with these recipes without too much effort or time. I suggest that you fine tune some of the dishes to your personal liking but you have a rough draft already given of many dishes that you may know from somewhere..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Personalized Preschool","review":"WARNING!!!!!!

Not one of the 4 programs I purchased will even install. \\"Not compatible with this version of Windows.

Only 2nd grade had a patch and that was for the calendar.I even tried to install it in compatability mode to Win XP with the same result. Will not install.We loved the Reader Rabbit programs for our older children, and it's a shame that Riverdeep took it over from Learning Company and then allowed it to die.

There is also a detailed section on Magnetic Force Microscopy(MFM). There are shorther sections on the less well known techniques, i.e. friction force microsocpy, SNOM, etc. The books covers the theory well, and is reasonably up to date as I write in 2007. The figures are clear, and the few microgrpahs presented in clear greyscale. There are relatively few applications, but these are easy to find elsewhere. Overall, a great book for the theory of SPM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Watch","review":"I live overseas and ordered this watch as I couldn't find something here that I liked.

I have loved Marvel comics for years and have a passing interest in Manga, so I was warily curious about how this would turn out. It's awful. The character designs are terrible, the plot is weak and unispired, and the dialogue sounds like it was written by an eight year old.

I like to see the history and progress of medicine. I thought I was really going to enjoy this book, but I didn't.I wish it would have been written more in easier language and not as technical as it was, or even liked it if the technical things were explained better. It makes for such a great story, should have been written better for general public to read. There were bits and pieces I found interesting, but the only part that really kept my attention was the ending Epilogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and disappointing","review":"This book was difficult to get through because it was so dull. It doesn't get remotely interesting until part 2 and it takes forever to get to part 2. Unfortunately, after one of the character's female understudy leaves, even part 2 becomes boring. The best part of the book is the epilogue - and it's about 20 pages long. There are so many better-written, more interesting books available about psychiatry's historical forays that I would not recommend wasting your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly disappointing","review":"As a psychiatric resident, I thought I might find something of educational value in this book. Instead I found a full-scale assault on psychiatry and psychiatrists. Although the book appears well researched, I found the author to have surprisingly little understanding or appreciation of modern psychiatric treatment. This, combined with his crusade against psychiatry, leads to spurious conclusions, broad generalizations and inferences that are misleading and untrue. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor excuse for a comedy","review":"Sex and the Teenage Mind is the epitome of everything bad in a teenage sex comedy.

So bad in fact that it's embarassing to watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come on People","review":"Really, everyone is rating this movie against fantastic ones with morals such as walk the line or something to that effect. In reality, it isnt a great movie, but when you are a teenage girl watching a movie at a sleepover with your friends it is hilarious. The main character, virgil, is the most awkward boy ever and his lusting after the class beauty, kelly, seems impossible. The quality of the movie sucks, it is true. But think about this movie for what it is for a change: pure and stupid enjoyment with no moral, purpose, or anything. It is just for fun... so lighten up everybody!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgic embroidery","review":"Nostalgia! Oh my! The embroidery contained in OLD-TIMEY EMBROIDERIES brings back memories of when I learned to embroider. Bears, Sock Monkeys, wagons, and samplers are included in the patterns.There are 16 designs according to the book but I don't find 16 corresponding photographs. In fact, the very first transfer is one I don't find a finished photo for. There are others throughout the book as well. I do like to have a photo of the project as an idea platform to work from even if I choose to use other colors or to finish it differently. By my count, there are 22 transfers to use.The instructions for finishing the projects shown are on the inside cover --- front and back --- and are well written and clear. Every transfer is iron-on ready and there are smaller test transfers to practice with.If you love to embroider and enjoy the whimsy of old-time things, then grab a copy and start stitiching!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't really like it","review":"I hoped for the best on this one and am pretty disappointed. Firstly, unlike CTR you CANNOT race 2-players at the same time WITH CPU opponents--so all you can do is a head-to-head race, not that fun and quickly tiring unless you are 10 years old. Second, the game saves progress unnecessarily often, and gives you a \\"loading\\" screen way too often, it's just annoying and takes about five minutes to set up a simple race. Third, when you enter the 1-player tournaments, if you do not place 1st, 2nd or 3rd at ANY point during the tournament, it is game over and start from the beginning. That sucks, at least let me finish the darn thing and try for a comeback! Fourth and least importantly, the sound effects stink, IMHO. The graphics are less than impressive too.

While the Lego brand screams out for childhood fun, the controls quickly become awkward and frustrating. Also, the computer controlled racers are not only ruthless but after the first circuit or two the computer has the miraculous ability to not only attain higher speeds than any car you build or drive, but also to accelerate faster than what they should be able to. All in all, it proves frustrating, annoying, and rather disquieting that the designers would put such an adult game under a childhood icon such as Lego. If you want your child to feel inadequate for an hour a day, go ahead and buy this. If not, then \\"steer\\" clear of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh My God","review":"I liked all the other LEGO brand games (mostly on computer), but this one was the most dissapointing. the game has horrible gameplay and it is way to hard for me. i don't see how any little 5 year old kid could ever enjoy this when I can't even win the first race because of how fast the other racers were going."},{"rating":"1","title":"works but should come with adapter","review":"This charger works with my Rino 530HCx.

The buttons on the remote are all pretty much the same size and shape so sometimes it's hard to use it and drive at the same time. The main thing, though, is that the swivel base in the car kit is way too loose. I have to leave it leaned all the way back so the radio doesn't lean forward and fall in my lap.

If you're OK buying this kind of product (for 33 dollars) then that's your decision. But when I bought this book from Amazon.com there was no indication from the product description of this. In my opinion this is a misrepresentation. If I had known, I would not have purchased it. I could merely have downloaded the PDF from Google books--which, by the way, was a better reproduction. The print in this edition is muddy, and page 8 is illegible. This is the second time this has happened to me buying books from Amazon.com. Be careful!

But, for those who have actually studied Stoic philosophy, there is a problem. That problem is that the book does not do a very good job of presenting the teaching of Stoicism, and it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the author does not much like Stoicism.A major problem is that the author, Nancy Sherman, is an Aristotelian, and clearly has little sympathy for, or understanding of, Stoic philosophy. For instance, she many times criticizes Stoic teaching on emotions, such as anger, as impossible to apply to the problems of military personal. But she neglects to mention that the Stoics never claimed that Stoic philosophy was a simple pill that could quickly solve problems without the time necessary for real change, and a re-evaluation of values.It seems, in fact, that Ms Sherman may not have taken enough time to understand Stoic philosophy in depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"One piece ruines the entire sprayer","review":"I loved this sprayer for the first year.

I couldn' t stop laughing (especially during the excellent scene of the \\"ognions kiss\\"). It is far better than most of the 30's screwball comedies (but of course, it is not as genial as Lubitsch's masterpieces like \\"To be or not to be\\" or \\"Trouble in paradise\\"). Critics are always difficult with a genius like Lubitsch. Watch it, you will spend a good time ! 4 1/2 stars !"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Near Miss","review":"BLUEBEARD'S EIGHTH WIFE is a near-miss screwball farce. Claudette Colbert's undoing of her playboy husband Gary Cooper has some wonderfully humorous moments. But the parts are greater than the whole. However, if you watch this as a forerunner to the Cooper/Wilder masterpiece, LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON, made 20 years later, it is an extremely fascinating film. Wilder made LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON as a tribute to his idol, Ernst Lubitsch, who directed this. Cooper's jaded, aging roue works far better in AFTERNOON than here in BLUEBEARD, perhaps because screwball farce wasn't the right style for the plotline. That said, it is very much worth watching. It just isn't top-drawer, that's all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked on Ghost Whisperer","review":"I bought this dvd to go along with my collection.

The music is so different from the originals versions on Flow. Thirlwell must love how different the music is. Flow is very emotional, big sounds, & this weird music is sort of dance & sort of ambient & totally different. Mr Thirlwell just wanted a wide wide variance in musical styles between Flow & Blow. I can't give it more than 4 stars because the music hasn't really spoken to me enough, some of the remixes other people do really feel uninspired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Flow instead","review":"This is a CD with remixes from the songs found on the Flow album. The Flow album was an excellent adventurous album, whereas this one is boring from beginning until the end. All the songs found on the album Flow have been rearranged, their raw inspiration has been stripped away, and an insepid beat kills the music off. I think it was a big mistake for Jim to have his music being sliced by others devoid of any imagination. This CD is just a dance club version of Flow, very, very disappointing.Hence the title of my review, let this cup pass you by, get Flow instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"looking for dtraight lines where there are only spheres","review":"if you haven't read my first review of Blow, then read it now, before you contiue with this one.Anyway...it's not nearly dance music or ambience...but it's...well, it's Foetus, & it's not for the light of heart!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing journey into the past","review":"Such a literate, well-written photography book I have not seen before.

It is a modest, rootsy country album with plaintive, emotional vocals. On the other hand, the playing is a bit rudimentary and the production by Chris Stamey is not up there with his best work. This young band has potential to be better than this. They also need to cheer up a little."},{"rating":"2","title":"When a unique sound is pulled off","review":"Just like the other reviewers, I was turned off when I listend to Rocket. Obviously because I was expecting a \\"Standing Outside...\\" sound to the album. However, I don't know how much time had passed, but after a very long while of not listening to that album, I picked it up again. I never realized I had a daimond in the rough the whole time.But on to this album, \\"White Hot Peach\\", it was a different case. Yes it is fairly different than Rocket. But in no way should that be taken as a negative fact. Chris O'Connor has a voice that hums with a unique smoothness in the more mellow of the songs (Ghost of a Chance), and he keeps a very non-monotone feel to the album while he's at it. The biggest difference between this album and Rocket is that it didn't take me a long time to realize that this is a daimond that holds more beauty than roughness."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE LIVING DEAD","review":"George Zucoo stars as a mad scientist that wants to create a living zombie.David Bruce stars as the victaim of this insane scientist.Evelyn Ankers plays a great part,She even sings in this movie.Its always a real treat to see her scream.If youre a fan of her scream,trust me this film is for you.Not to mention the eerie graveyard scenes make this film a classic. GET IT.ITS WORTH EVERY DOLLAR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stylish penny-dreadful,more polished than most.","review":"From its title you might think that this horror flick emanated from PRC or Monogram. It benefits however from good performances by David Bruce and George Zucco. Zucco who was very suave and authorative but given now and then to over the top haminess delivers a performance of admirable restraint and perception. Turhan Bey (before his romps with Maria Montez) has a minor role but plays it in his best continental style. The plot itself has many gory details but fortunately nearly all of them are off camera. What a bloodbath would ensue if the film were being made today. 21/2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nearly all advertising","review":"This video contains very little practical information.

Not a waste, but not a real winner, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Classic despite the book source","review":"Well, it's better than the original 1972 film starring Parker Stevenson. The photography is clean and crisp and most of the actors seem age-appropriate for their roles (witness all the \\"teenagers\\" on TV played by actors who are clearly pushing 30). But Knowles over-rated book does not make a good movie and the acting is stilted and hammy. If you can get this for five bucks, including shipping, it might be worth it.

The first indication of this is when the actor playing the narrator \\"Gene\\" goes through about five different accents in the first ten minutes. Unnecessary changes to the book have been made and I really don't think the filmmakers even understood the novel's major themes. I haven't seen the version that was made in the 70's but understand it is a better film and frankly it has to be better than this attempt.

You can't label this album with a genre, cuz it's in a class of it's own.Dudley sings way off key but has an amazing flow that's never been heard before. Listen twice and you'll be captivated.

It's really not very good. I'm comparing this to Janet Evanovich and Joanne Fluke who do this genre SO much better than this writer. I laughed once at the humor; the other attempts at humor were pretty \\"lame\\" as is the writing. It got old really fast that the lead character would seem to be saying something, only to have the quote followed up with how that's what she was thinking, she really said... And what she actually said was something spineless. Jaine Austen (what a dreadful name; is it supposed to be clever?) is not a character to particularly admire.2.

Jaine Austen, the heroine, is great company -- and she takes you to all the places you've always wanted to go. A lot of the action is behind the scenes on a TV series, and you feel like you're part of the action. The mystery is full of twists and surprises, but the best thing is the laughs you get.

It may be useful for general interested people as well as specialists, since it was written with little mathematics but deep concepts and explanations. In the first chapters the author explains the basic of the physics of music, and then he focus on the biological aspect of hearing and perception of sounds and musical sensations. The book has also three appendices for more advanced people with harder math. Very good figures and an easy-to-read prose complete the landscape of this outstanding book by this argentinian well-known physicist working in the US now."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only map you'll need for Vienna","review":"This map has the mosted visited sections of Vienna clearly printed -on one side (bonus!), along with a pretty comprehensive street index on the back. Additionally, like all \\"Streetwise\\" maps, points of interest, landmarks for tourist navigation and major hotels/restaurants are also clearly marked. Great whether it's your first trip there, or have some experience in the city. Certainly the best part about this map, heck the whole series, is the maps are laminated. This makes 'em easy to fold, and is particularly useful in the rain; no small advantage over a paper map in Europe. I suggest using them with an alcohol pen to trace routes and ID spots you want to visit that aren't already printed. When Streetwise starts producing maps with Lat/Longs on them (for GPS), these maps will definitely get 5-stars from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the product it claims to be","review":"I was impressed by the song list, therefore I purchased it.

I will read others by Dorsey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't pay full price for this paperback","review":"This is not Dorsey's best work. He's introduced too many characters and we only know a few facts about each. The story darts around like the ball in a pinball machine.

Otherwise, go pay full price for a Carl Hiassen novel in the bookstore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reserve A Room","review":"I am not sure I can even convey the comic genius of Tim Dorseys books. he has the most happily insane people I have ever read about. From our favorite spree killer, Serge, to the druggie Coleman,to the forever virgin,the con man who runs Hammerhead, the cops who bust each other busting each other,and other assorted characters we get the ride only they can provide. Dorsey is not Hiassen, he is not Barry-and we should be thankful.For the best cast of characters you have ever met do yourself a favor and read Hammerhead Ranch Motel.Warning-drinking during reading of this book is likely to cause nasal discharge of said liquid.star"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay airplane reading, could use a decent editor","review":"Hammerhead Ranch Motel is a raucous story filled with colorful characters and locales. Unfortunately, it often has too much color and Dorsey really seems to be trying too hard to impress us with his knowledge of Florida lore and history, and his ability to deliver eccentric situations and characters. The ending ties things together messily, but at least has more coherence than the beginning. The exerpt of his forthcoming books suggests that his capacity for good writing may yet overcome his talent for showing off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a moth tied to a bottle rocket.","review":"You have to hand it to Tim Dorsey, he's funny and creative. That, and the nervous, almost amphetamine quickness of the plot, are the only things I enjoyed about this novel.In it, we meet two stoned nymphomaniacs; a DJ with the personality of Jabba the Hutt; inept law enforcement officers from a bridge patrolman to undercover FBI; a dog passing for a meteorologist; and a thoroughly insane traveler who has recently stopped keeping track of his meds.It reads that way, too, like a neon-colored collage of misfits crossing paths nearly at random like mosquitoes splatting on windshields. I could see how someone would enjoy this type of read, perhaps if stoned, but it wasn't for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good follow-up to Florida Roadkill","review":"I enjoyed this book almost as much as Florida Roadkill. About the only difference was that with Florida Roadkill, I was pleasantly surprised that I liked it som much. Serge is back, chasing the money that was the focus of the first book, but again gets sidetracked in many other funny situations. The characters are well done, the plot is a little hard to follow at times, but always tied together very nicely. I would recommend this for anyone who enjoyed Florida Roadkill. If you haven't read Florida Roadkill, I would recommend it as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Florida Fun!","review":"This book arrived very quickly, within 5 days of ordering, and was a can't put down, hilarious read!

Gaudy, sick and fantastically creative homicidal hillarity. Well Serge is back and no one is safe. Nothing standard here. It's the out of control rollercoaster ride from \\"Roadkill\\" continued. You thought you could catch your breathe but hang on, you crested the second hill and its headed for the gutter at 200mph! A must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"It doesn't get any wilder than this!","review":"Whatever Carl Hiaasen is drinking, Tim Dorey has stolen the receipe and improved it. Perhaps he let's the cat out of the bag before the story even starts as to his motivation by using a quote from Mark Twain: \\"Let us consider that we are all partialy insane. It will explain us to each other.\\" It certainly explains the wild and crazy characters in this book. They have been more than adequately detailed in the other reviews here, but suffice it to say you are not likely to run into them in your local Grand Union or Safeway store. However, if you are looking for a chance to give your brain a rest and your funny bone a work out, the trip through this book is well worth taking. I love these nutty books that are about Florida. It's probably why we have a winter home in Arizona."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh. Life is too short to read this book.","review":"I was hoping it would be something like a poor man's Carl Haissen, or just a poor man's humorous book... but, this book was truly bad. It tries so hard to be... funny? Outrageous? Shocking? Something... who knows? 60 pages in, there was only an inkling of a plot and nothing to keep me interested.Dorsey uses 1000 words when 50 would do and most of it doesn't move the story... this was a bad book. Considering how short life is, no one should waste valuable time reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very funny... weird!","review":"From all the reviews I read, I thought this would be a laugh out loud book, but it wasn't. I think I got a giggle twice. It was full of weird characters, with weird situations but not much of a plot... I was very dissappointed. I only read it to the end to see if the ending would be better and would tie everything together... some loose ends were tied up in the end... but with no great shakes for an ending. very weird!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexpensive Used Books","review":"I was looking for a good price on a particular title and ended up buying it from Goodwill of Western Ct. through Amazon. The book arrived as advertised, in good condition and well-packaged. I was a little surprised to see an item being sold from a thrift store through Amazon, but in retrospect it makes quite a bit of sense. I'm happy. They're happy. It's a win-win situation for all.Oh yes, the book. Tim Dorsey is a maniac, or at least his characters are maniacal. His off-kilter take on the state of Florida makes me appreciate a place that I had written off as the last refuge of retirees and whiny families on their way to visit some giant rats. Serge is as bizarre a person as you could ever imagine. A true sociopath, but in a kindly sort of way. If you can get past the misogyny, rampant drug use, and gratuitous violence you might really enjoy the series. I wonder who will direct the movie versions of these books?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get ready to laugh","review":"I won't give a step by step plot review of the book, suffice it to say it's just crazy and that you should read Florida Roadkill (Mr. Dorsey's first novel) first so that you can put some of the recurring characters in context.

There were canonical prefences-steaks, bourbon, eating beans directly from the can. There were also aversions: fuss, vegetables,anything called a sauce. All these pretenses were the real barriers to actually enjoying food and so of course there were men who defied them, but didn't really want to lose their masculinity merit badge in the process.Welsch's good old boy cred is entirely intact-he even has a picture of a grill and an outhouse on the cover of his book, but he's showing the beginnings of a real interest in the way things taste. I cannot imagine a better gourmet book club choice for a men's club-we can laugh or for a woman's- they can gather ammunition.The Foreword is by Jim Harrison whose ownThe Raw and the Cooked: Adventures of a Roving Gourmandis still one of the best books about men and food.Lynn Hoffman, author of bang BANG"},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible book on lions.","review":"If you want a terrific book on mountain lions, then please read Soul Among Lions by Harley Shaw. I have read every book on lions and his is the only one worth reading. Most of the authors in Shadow Cat are easterners who have moved to Montana or California, displacing numerous wildlife species with their cabin in the wilderness and who have never even seen a lion, let alone have any kind of authority to provide insight into any aspect of lion ecology. The book is biased toward anti-hunting and environmentalism and doesn't portray an accurate picture. If you are a granola who likes to blame loggers and hunters for your own ineptness then you may like this book. They let Wayne Pacelle have the parting shot in this book, and well if that doesn't throw up a big red flag then you're probably dumb enough to want to read Shadow Cat."},{"rating":"1","title":"too subtle","review":"Every February, I go and get the latest BAE. After the diversity of the series, i.e. het/gay, male/female, various races, various behaviors, I was really disappointed with the selection in this edition.There's not nearly enough explict scenes for me. Rather, the focus of these stories, with a few exceptions, seems to be beating around the bush (no pun intended).

Myers has crafted an overwhelmingly persuasive book about the second murder few Americans know about - the murder of Dallas police officer J.D. Tippit. Myers' twenty-plus year investigation includes hundreds of never-before-known facts that prove beyond any doubt that Lee Harvey Oswald gunned down Tippit within an hour of the assassination of President Kennedy. Myers doesn't spend time focusing on the President's death, butthe implications are clear. The buffs are squirming over this meticulous study - as evidenced by the pseudo-reviews posted here by Mike Griffith and Bill Kelly. They don't want you to read and weigh the evidence for yourself. But anyone that has read this book knows how flawed their objections are. If this subject has haunted you, I highly recommend you make Myers' \\"With Malice\\" a priority on your must-read list. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overwhelmingly persuasive & thorough!!!!","review":"Until Myers' book, JFK was killed in Dallas - end of story. Myers details the timeline & events that occurred in Officer Tippit's murder & why it is so important in the never-ending investigations of President Kennedy's assassination. The physical evidence against Oswald is impressive and Myers' walks the reader through step-by-step. The inclusive correspondence & photographs are convincing and most never before seen.

He looked like a killer in those pictures.That is why I thought he was guilty for some 25 years. And I came to the conclusion that if he killed Tippet he had to have killed Kennedy.Now, since I am 100% convinced that he did not kill Kennedy (he couldn't have shot Kennedy in the neck and temple from behind him) , it works the other way.Therefore, if he didn't kill Kennedy, he had no reason to kill Tippet. And it is an obvious part of the framing process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong item","review":"When I bought this item, which was clearly labeled a PS2 controller, I received a PS3 controller instead.

I haven't seen many but most of them appeared to be long on chop socky and short on anything intelligent. You can see Luc Bessons hands all over this movie and because of this the movie has depth. It has its violence and incredible fight sequences but it also has emotion and tender moments. A friend of mine who couldn't wait to see it because he is a big Jet Li fan said, \\" I thought I was going to see a Jet Li movie and I ended up watching a chick flick\\". I liked the blending of the two. Also Bob Hoskins as the evil villian is GREAT."},{"rating":"1","title":"quality of video was absolutely awful","review":"The quality of the video was awful.

(Also have Netflix streaming which never has a problem.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jet Li in one of his best performances","review":"I'm a Jet Li fan & this movie allows him to not only perform martial art, but to portray a beast & a human. One could possibly say that he shows the two sides of humanity. In any account, the 5 stars less one, is due to some \\"over-the-top\\" violence in a few segments of the film.His martial art performance, like always, is phenomenal. And unlike a lot of his other movies, you actual see him be an actor. It's a great combination.Recommend for adults only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jet li movie","review":"This movie is action pack with lots of fighting and kick ass scenes and the best thing is the fun never stops"},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Jet Li but I hate this movie","review":"This is one of those movies where you know 2-5 minutes into it, it's going to be a stupid flick. And you know what- it delivers on that on sooo many levels. I think what bothered me about it is the movie tried to have heart. It's almost like a plot was trying to form about halfway through the movie.Bob Hoskins and Morgan Freeman were too great for this film- very weird to see them stoop down to such a dumb, violent film.Jet Li can be seen in better fight scenes from Once Upon A Time In China, Forbidden Kingdom, Fearless, Hero and even Romeo Must Die."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly great...","review":"I am a martial arts fan so tend to rent these flicks whether they are good or bad. I was very surprised in the following:1) Very good acting2) A very good, although predictable, plot--it actually has drama, which is odd for this type of film3) Fight scenes were superb (I played the unrated version)Overall, I recommend this movie from both a martial arts perspective and from a action movie perspective. It actually combines elements of a drama, but it is still classified as an action movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Met Meager Expectations","review":"I marginally recommend the movie.The movie's premise is far fetched, but writers and actors do what they can with it. A gangster keeps a man captive like a vicious attack dog. Li's character, Danny, is leashed during the day and caged at night. When the leash comes off, he is preconditioned to attack anything Hoskins tells him to. The driving force in this movie is how Jet Li's character becomes human again. Jet Li is starting to show some emotional range. His humility, which allows him to play dumb and silly, serves him well here. His charisma really shines through. The fights scenes are very good. The ferocious intensity he displays during the fight scenes early in the movie is incredible. The skill he shows in the last fight scenes is impressive.Freeman and Hoskins are very good. The dialog is okay. The sets and backgrounds are good. The movie met my meager expectations and I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not sure why but would not play, computer cannot read disc","review":"I was hoping to get this and did even though by the time it got here it dropped almost another dollar in price, but computer, blue ray or dvd player all 2010 models fairly new, none of them would or could play this disc computer could not read it at all also new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very underrated!","review":"I'm not a big fan of Jet Li but I actually enjoyed this film alot! The fight scenes are very brutal and aren't like most other martial arts movie. Li actually acts in this flick and is supported by a strong cast, Morgan Freeman and Bob Hoskins. Luc Besson was clearly behind this project and it shows through the story telling. Also very stylistic effects. The movie isn't perfect but it's worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A joy to watch.","review":"I'm not a huge Jet Li fan - yeah, he's talented, but some of his films aren't so hot. This one is. The first fight is cracking! Okay, it was carefully choreographed, but it looked so realistically brutal. Incredible.Then there's the added joy of watching superb actors at work. No, not Mr. Li! Messers Morgan and Hoskins. Both brought an extra dynamic to a genre which usually overlooks the fact it is there to entertain with quality acting and not just wow with staggering action. Okay, I don't think Morgan or Hoskins will be sticking it at the top of their CV, but it was a welcome joy to see actors of such stature performing in such a film.The story? Ok. A little more depth than Li usually goes for, but I doubt it'll be studied in Film Schools across the world very often.A good film, with some excellent action. Li fans will not be disappointed. A film most people will enjoy, not just martial arts enthusiasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unleashed","review":"On and beneath the meanest streets of Glasgow, fiery gangster Bart is merciless with debtors, would-be rivals, and anyone else to whom he takes even a passing dislike.

I did watch and enjoy this film. Morgan Freeman lends a helping acting hand as a blind piano tuner who befriends the animal like Li.

Check this one out! ;-b"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new genre: emotionally moving martial arts films!","review":"I like action films. I like films that move me emotionally...never thought I'd find both in one film, but UNLEASHED does it! Jet Li actually acts -- to good effect--as his Danny comes alive under the tutelage of Morgan Freeman, one of the brilliant actors of our time.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Martial Arts Film!","review":"I almost gave this movie 5 stars, but I caught myself after comparing Unleashed to movies such as The Boondock Saints and The Lord of the Rings trilogy.Jet Li gives his best preformance in this movie as far as acting and as far as stunts. Unlike Kiss of the Dragon (also a great movie) Unleashed delivers fast-paced fights without resorting to the use of wires and CGI too much, although there is one or to parts where the use of wires was obvious. The plot is not oscar worthy in my opinion, but it definately goes above and beyond the typical martail arts beat em' up flciks.Combining some of the most amazing fight scenes in reccent cinimatic history, and flowering it up with an effective- if overdone- story directed with dark style by Louis Leterrier, Unleashed delivers as a heart-pumping Jet Li movie easily worthy of 4 stars and maybe a bit more.(I would advise that children under my age of 16 watch this movie!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"better than expected","review":"My rating may be adjustable just because I watched this and would ahve given it a 3.

Don't buy this CD if you're expecting droning synthesizers, 4 x 4 beats, and lovey-dovey vocals. If you're looking for a good place to start your pilgrimage to some techy, hard-hitting Electronica, then DJ Icey's Essential Elements is the place to do it.

Other DJ's releasing Essential Mixes have ranged from UK's Radio 1 Pete Tong to former Culture Club front man Boy George. MTV's DJ Skribble has even gotten in on the act. Icey, arguably the U.S.'s best known breakbeat DJ, lays down 20 tracks in just over 75 minutes. This provides the listener with a wide range of music, which on the surface would appear to be a delight, but unfortunately, ends up to be the demise of the album. The mix overall had some great cuts that got my head shaking (Orbital's Funny Break, and Meat Katie's Rotten Dot Com were my favorites), but the mix seemed too hurried. Icey's first mix in the Essential series released last year was in my opinion, his finest work, but could have also led to my high expectations for this mix. Having seen Icey live many times, this album does the man and his legend no justice. Don't worry Icey, we all have our days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, but not perfect","review":"I have a house with a 20' ceiling over the living area, and wanted a timer to switch the suspended ceiling fan on and off throughout the day.This timer fits the bill fairly well. My observations -Pros* Looks good. Flush fitting design with no sticky-outy bits* EL backlit LCD display is very easy to read in the dark. Display lights up when any button is pressed.* Uses a relay rather than the clunky motor/switch mechanism used by some other similar timers.Cons* Easy for kids to mess up the programming - no programming lock and buttons are all accessible on the front panel.* No OFF/ON override. You can manually switch the timer on or off with the big button, but the timer always has precedence. When the next half hour time step rolls round, it reverts to the programming.

I hate movies like that, there aren't many David lynch's out there. Trust me, this isn't worth it after u watch this once in the garbage it goes. This isn't a deep thriller at all.

His ground rules for success make sense for the average fan, or the the passionate fan of baseball. He successfully weaves anecdotes from his days a player and as a manager for the Yankees into his advice to lend support for his views. I would have liked to have seen more examples from his previous managing stints with the Mets, Braves, and Cardinals, but his primary focus was his success as a manager with the Yankees.A thoroughly enjoyed this book for its ability to mesh stories and experiences from baseball into strategies for business and life.

It's quick to read, in journal format, but at times difficult to get through, not because of its style but because of its content. A subsidiary thread of the overall book is a look at the heavy metal/alternative music scene in the late 80's/early 90's, from the view of a (closeted gay) music journalist.

If there is a reception afterwards, you will need to hire a caterer.\\"I didn't buy this to be a wedding planner. I bought it to be inspirational. It tried to do too much and misses the mark on the subject that it's supposed to be about. If the author had posted the title above their keyboard, we might have a book worth reading now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to understand","review":"I used this book in graduate school for a statistics course. It was very hard to understand and I hope your professor uses a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suffers from Goldilocks syndrome","review":"This book has a bad habit of overly complicating relatively simple ideas (the entire chapter on estimation, for example), and under explaining some of the more difficult ideas (the section on the Gamma distribution is just horrendous). The examples in the book seem to be chosen and expressed starting with the assumption that the reader is already quite familiar with the subject. The exercises with solutions, (odds) are much too simple, while the rest are quite difficult, making self-learning very difficult. Highly frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many ,many errors to odd number problems","review":"This book has good explanations of the topics covered in each section , but the solutions to the odd numbered problems are full of errors. I can't stand this book anymore , I need to check my solutions to reinforce my knowledge and the book doesn't provide correct solutions.I would recommend to everyone to stay away from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"For an expensive books its not worth it","review":"There just arent enough examples, your basically trying to solve the problems at the end on your own, bad book."},{"rating":"1","title":"juju","review":"jyujyujuyjyu jjyujyukyuku jihn ionj o noi no no nou noui nbik bkj nkj nbo b bn lb ojn kln n n k"},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of errors","review":"This book has a lot of errors.

My friend uses this book for her stat class, and I have found it to be a terrible book.I hope that any teacher reads this, and looks at the book before assigning it to a class.There are very few examples of problems, very little discussion of theory, and it is structured in a way that does not allow you to easily reference other texts.If you want a good text for challenging problems and relevant examples, try Hogg and Tanis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very misleading","review":"I was excited about ordering this book instead of having to purchase it at the bookstore. However, when it arrived I was so disappointed! I certainly did NOT get the book I ordered. I ordered a paperback, 7th edition/2008 copyright, but what I received was a hardback, 2nd edition/copyright in the 80's. Because of this I did not have my textbook until the second week of classes.On a lighter note, though, I sent the book back with no problems, and tried once more. My account was credited for the first book, and the correct one came the following week."},{"rating":"2","title":"That book is excellent","review":"I'm a teacher of Catolic University of Guayaquil(Ecuador) P.O.Box 09-01-4671.I need Solutions Manual to Accompany Mathematical Statistics with Applications by William Mendenhall, Richard L.

The seller did NOT even ship it!!!!!Never buy things from this seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I'd hoped for","review":"I give this cd collection kudos for gathering together a pretty good selection of movie music tracks. However, most the tracks are cheaply remade, the quality of which reminds me of the sort of music you can hear in a higher-quality early Playstation game (Final Fantasy 7 is what comes to my mind). All of the orchestrated (and choral, if I remember correctly) are done electronically. The solo parts are done well enough, though, and I have to say that \\"Dueling Banjos\\" from Deliverence is fun to listen to. Ultimately, it'd be better to buy the original soundtracks and make this into a playlist yourself even if you didn't necessarily have the funds for that. In other words: don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome color charts--a valuable teaching tool!","review":"As a teacher of the Word of God, I love using charts that help the visual student see what I am talking about. And in this chart book, which is completely done in color (visually very appealing), both the Old and New Testaments are covered, including maps and reconstructions of historically significant times and places. I am planning to lead a trip to the Holy Land this summer, and I'll probably have this book with me when we tour the places reconstructed here. The wire spine is appreciated because it makes it easier to turn the pages and lay the pages flat when making overheads. All in all this book is a \\"quality\\" production, and I can only say \\"well done!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed in this for the Kindle PC","review":"I just purchased this for the Kindle PC app and am very dissappinted. I just started a MAR program and thought the charts would be helpful. Unfortunately they are so small that I can't read them. You can't print them or magnify them. You can magnify text but not the charts. I would think the charts could have easily been sized to a full page each but every one I've tried to look at so far has been about a 1/4 page at most and it's very frustrating. I think the information would be good in printer. There are a lot of detailed charts, but not good for the Kindle PC. I haven't purchased a Kindle yet so this may work better on the actual Kindle device over a PC. I wouldn't recommend this if you're trying to view it on your computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charts, Maps, Pictures - A Great Resource","review":"With many text books, you sometimes feel that you would rather sell the book when you are done with the class, due to knowing that you will never use the book outside of your schooling experience.This book is the exception. There is an immense amount of information in the pages of this text that are ideal for the student, the pastor, the Sunday school teacher, or any Christian who wants a visual way to grasp a deeper understanding of God's Word."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW...What a great book","review":"I purchased this book for my daughter to help her to better understand the things she reads in the Bible. I could not put it down once I opened it. If you study the Bible there is a good bit of information in this book that will help in your understanding of certain things that you read. The graphics are wonderful. Holman books always are a cut above."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very accurate or detailed","review":"I would not recommend this book to anyone who truly believes the Bible.It is full of errors. It embraces evolution time lines, doubts the accuracy of the bible, and truly mixes up where the true church comes from. Please check it out for yourself before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninteresting","review":"This album is mundane. After the first track, which sounds promising, it carries on with Frank Gambale and co. shredding on top of an over-produced, repetitive rhythm section. The drums have a loud, gated sound that seems over-compressed and not very live or interesting. The music seems to go nowhere and one hears a lot of unoriginal riffs and progressions in the mix that come back again and again.The whole recording has no soul. Someone tell me which is a good Gambale album because this one isn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its Magic!","review":"The whole album is fantastic. Anyone who wants to test some new speakers should que up \\"When Your Lover Has Gone\\" & crank it! It doesnt get any better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keely Smith is one of the best women singers I know!","review":"This CD fills in a great gap; all of these lps have been long out of print. Her emotions and vocal style are excellent, and she is backed up by the great Nelson Riddle and Billy May, both arrangers for Peggy Lee and Frank Sinatra. Her most popular tune was \\"I wish you love\\" but the other songs are beauifully served by her marvelous voice. -Darin Tysdal"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unauthorized DVDs - Not Originals","review":"While watching these DVDs, there were a few places that didn't play exactly right. I just figured it was my player because I've had other DVDs act similarly in my player, but played fine in other players. But when I tried to sell this set back to Amazon for a gift card, the set was rejected because the DVDs are 'unauthorized'. Apparently, they are not originals. So - buyer beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CSY NY - the ixth season","review":"i bought the season beacuse i like the show very much.some facts: the set contains 7 discs that are stored much better then the prevoius seasons, each disc had it's covering, now however they come boxed togehter, which makes it lighter and easier ot sotre.the bonus features are slightly booring and don't satisfy much for a fan. it contains 2 episodes with dr langston (lawrence fishbourne) on csi miami and csi, which really doesn't add to the storyline and on the expence of other special features.another booring feature is on de sid hammerbackthere are two audio comenteries whuch are intresting.regarding the plot line this season is very intresting and bares some dark aspects on the charechters. the season is intense and very original regarding the deaths and the back stories.one of my fav episode is death house, it's like when sherlock holmes meets angels and demonsi recomend this title very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"CSI NY Season 6","review":"totally addicted to this tv show,item was received in record speed and in EXCELLENT condition. will def. order from this seller again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show on DVD","review":"I love CSI:NY.

Quite often, actually. I did a little investigating and discovered the discs are DVD-5s instead of the standard DVD-9s. This means that they are about the same quality as DVD-Rs. They say on the pacakaging that they are dual layered discs, but clearly they are not. They are cramming the same amount of data as a normal DVD onto half as much space. A normal DVD (DVD-9) will contain about 7.5GB of information. These DVDs (DVD-5) contain about 4.5GB. Just like DVD-Rs. This means they are over compressed and a lot of data is lost. They are a rip off plain and simple. I don't know if all of these sets were produced this way or not, or if I was just one of the unlucky ones who got a bad set. I hope seasons seven and eight weren't released on similar discs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cracked case","review":"Case cracked up and completely useless.

The picture is accurate in showing the shape of the glass but not the thickness. The glass is really THICK. I guess I should consider the price when judging this product but the 12 that I ordered are sitting in the box they came in in my basement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wine Glasses","review":"I purchased these glasses because they were a good price and we needed wine glasses. They were larger than I expected but I think they will be fine. They were carefully packaged so none of the glasses were broken. I would recommend these glasses to anyone who needs wine glasses and wants a glass that really holds a lot of wine. Maybe they should have been called \\"goblets\\" instead of glasses."},{"rating":"2","title":"So sixties, man!.","review":"If you can remember the sixties, you weren't there - or you never saw The Prisoner. This, the final epsiode, provides an operatic climax to the hours of bizarre allegory that preceeds it. It is a very British take on the general paranoia of the time, and can be enjoyed almost as much for its evocation of the era as for its sheer entertainment value. And remember, the Village really does exist! Highly strange TV at its best. This is must be what Oliver Stone grew up on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard, edgy, and ethireal","review":"My friend had a copy. I asked to borow it. After listening to it, I was happy I asked him for it. The first half had an harder edge to it. I'm not a big fan of \\"Hard core\\" but this was a bit diff. There were alot of vocals on this disc, I was glad to hear. Over all I would say this is a good trance CD.
