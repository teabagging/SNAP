In this book, he skillfully deconstructs his own analytic process and creates an exceptionally useful template for others. First, he presents practical strategies for wading through the information overload we all face, regardless of the topic or topics in which we are interested. Then, he provides a methodology for turning pertinent gems of information into timely, useful analysis.Wheaton posesses an extroardinary depth and breadth of knowledge. Because of his vast interdisciplinary experience, the lessons he teaches are applicable for analysts in such diverse areas as marketing, business, military art, politics, intelligence, mathematics, science and law.Beginning and intermediate level analysts in every profession should buy this book, read it thoroughly and keep it close at hand for reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential reading for analysis and decision making","review":"\\"The Warning Solution\\" is undeniably essential reading for anyone who has competitors or who needs to distill meaning from the data at hand, define problems or opportunities, and compete in the market.

What I got was a poorly organized book that reads more like a mangled dictionary than a Thesaurus. When I search for a word, I receive results for many, many entries that use the word in a sentence, but that do not provide synonyms. An example is the word \\"tall\\". I receive a list of 34 results but only one is actually useful. Additionally, the book refers to colored words that, in theory, make the book easier to read. The iPad Kindle app shows no such color - odd for a device that displays color quite well. Perhaps this is a failing of the iPad Kindle app, but it makes the book almost completely unusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"I never did find the Stolen Jew...","review":"I was intrigued by the title of this book and the brief dustjacket blurbs, so I took it out of the library. I forced myself through about 100 pages, but finally gave up on it, which is something I rarely do. The author has a penchant for run-on sentences with nested commas, semicolons and parentheses which I don't have the patience to decode. Call me insensitive, but I found the characters far too angst ridden for me to want to spend my time with.Mind you, I'm an avid reader and have breezed through other supposedly impenetrable books that others had pronounced as unreadable.

The grammar is untasteful and rough to my ears in spots of the book. The pacing of the book seemed inconsistent - he presented a lot of details in the beginning and the middle, but the ending was so abrupt and rushed...it didn't have any substance like the rest of the book.On another note, it seems as though there are not many Vietnamese history books that goes back in the 1800s (mostly starting with the Vietnam War) - so I appreciate the author for writing this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawless after several months of playing","review":"This controller was everything I hoped.

Sprint provided a noise suppressor so that helped significantly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't recommend this product","review":"The number of positive reviews for this product surprises me.First, the pictures of the wireless jack: They don't show you that the underside is where you plug it into your wall socket. The problem is that the plug is so huge that it may cover the entire wall socket. If you have two sockets, and depending on how those sockets are arranged, you may lose access to the second one.So, \\"I'll connect it to a surge protector or socket multiplier of some kind,\\" you say. The manual tells you not to do that. I don't know why, but a surge protector probably interferes with the AC signal this device sends on your house wiring. Just a guess.Then, the manual doesn't tell you if Caller ID signals are sent from the phone company jack to the jack you extended with this device. You can find out empirically...but I never got that far. My unit failed after about an hour. I returned it and got a refund...but it was a bad omen.

The concept is great...BUT only is it works...I wouldn't buy this OR recommend anyone buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to eliminate noise problems","review":"Our Dish Network tech installed one of these when we upgraded to HD service. It was useless because the noise (on a voice line that also has DSL on it) was astounding. Putting a DSL filter on the \\"upstream\\" side of the Easy Jack had no effect. However, inserting the DSL filter on the INCOMING phone line to Easy Jack eliminated ALL the noise. It seems as though (not surprising), if the Easy Jack gets a noisy line, it simply passes the noise on. So the trick is to filter before it gets to the Easy Jack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crapped Out","review":"While I followed the instructions to the letter, the unit quit working 6 months later.

After I read through the instructions, it took about 10 minutes to set it up. There's nothing more to it than plugging the units into electrical outlets and plugging in the phone jacks on both ends. My DirecTV receiver instantly identified the new phone connection and now works perfectly for onscreen caller ID and ordering movies with the remote. The model that I installed is specifically for data, so you would hear a loud buzz if you plug your telephone into it.

However, subsequently the noise on the line prevented the fax from starting. A total failure. Reading the various indications from the manufacturer, this is almost certainly caused by surge protectors (there are two in reasonably close proximity - same room, different outlets).Alas I no longer have the packaging, so cannot return Easy Jack.Good news is that 'MagicJack' seems to work without problems, although not officially supported for fax use.

So I bought a Phonex base and two extension units so I could hook up the DVR's to the phone line. As described, the installation is quick and easy. The system works fine, even the caller ID.

Did not work for me.","review":"This device did not work for me. They use the electrical wiring in your home to send and receive the sound signal. That electrical wiring can also carry a lot of noise from electrical appliances and even from light dimmers. In an apartment the noise is increased by all the electrical devices used by the neighbours, so in my case it was very noisy making the RCA adapters a total waist of money. I found a similar device that uses 2.4GHz and it works great for me. But the device called DualJack could potentially interfere with other 2.4GHz signals like a computer wireless land or even wireless phones, so far I have not had any interference. You have to try them and see what works for you.

A lot of people on car audio forums recommend HDPE cutting boards because they are cheap, common and reasonably dense. I tried to cut them with my general purpose router bits previously and while it worked somewhat, I wasn't satisfied with the results as the plastic got too melted and the cut quality suffered and I had to make several passes. I ordered this, having heard that Whiteside is a good brand, and it's a huge improvement in cut quality. I use it in a Bosch 1617 router with a Jasper circle jig. I do recommend you go around the circle 2 or 3 times just to make sure the cut is as clean as possible if you use it this way, but the results are reasonably okay with just one pass, which is more than I could say for the general purpose bit that I used before."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOLY SMOKE - where did THIS come from?","review":"Mikey and Nicky is possibly my favorite film.

That isn't to take anything away from May who has demonstrated her genius in so many genres. this film, however, almost cost her a career. the studio was outraged at the stark realism and 'artistic nature' of the movie and blacklisted May for years afterwards and tried to bury the film.

The exposed 90-degree edges on the hold-down clamp can give you a nasty laceration in normal use. I had gotten my hand pinched by this thing and I should have been suspicious. I was using the clamp on the left side position (I'm right-handed) and when it engages, the pressure you are applying suddenly reduces as the clamp engages, this caused my hand to slip off the handle and into the path of the mechanism of the clamp. All Bosch would have to do is round the edges of the metal bar assembly or put some kind of guard around it. I'm super careful around all my power tools and especially saws, but it didn't occur to me that the hold-down clamp would be the source of a serious injury. I could still work but my finger was sore for two weeks, and a hospital bill that cost more than two saws."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Saw","review":"This is my first sliding miter saw - so I have limited experience and exposure with them.

Loved the features such as the up front controls, included clamp, and side extensions, but I always had problems getting it set to perfect square in any axis. Even when it was set as close to correct as possible, the blade would not cut strait up and down. The scale was not precise in any direction, but after practice I got it to work. It worked great during framing because it would cut through any width I was using and the laser was close enough to within about 1/8in. It got stolen at about 3/4 the way through the trim portion of the house and I replaced it with the new Milwalkee.

I love the smooth startup and the easy ajustments in front of this machine. This saw arrived in perfect condition, I checked all angles; table/fence/miter/and bevel and they were all true.

The one thing which we noticed right away (which wasn't even a consideration when we bought it) was how much quieter it is than our Dewalt 12\\" saw. This isn't really a big deal when outdoors but when you are trying to sneak some last minutes cuts in at 10 PM with neighbors in an attached house it is a big deal!The ONLY fault we have found so far is that both sets of batteries for the laser have in about 3 weeks with only minor usage daily.

It's astounding, dynamic, challenging, riveting, impeccably produced, uncompromising, but never inpenetrable. If you're into contemporary classicists like Gavin Bryars or John Tavener, you'll dig it. If you're into definitive prog, it'll blow your mind.Once again, Jasun outdoes himself with his sublime mellotron work. Think of the great mellotron moments in music (Genesis-Eleventh Earl Of Mar, Yes-And You and I, all of Tim Christensen's Honeyburst cd) and increase it exponentially. If you love Zappa, Orff, Air, Boards Of Canada, there's something there, but this work is derivitive of nothing. I mention those artists just to give a vague point of reference.

There is no moral high-ground here, no lessons to be learned to make the hours worth spending, not even the mildly endearing subplot can rescue this dismal storyline.I love period films, but I wish I hadn't bothered to pay for this one. I agree with the reviewer who suggested you rent it if you MUST watch every period film out there, but if the responses of those who have borrowed this film from me are any proof, they hated it as much as I do.

It then went down hill.The characters and background are mostly developed through the author's narrative, rather than the interactions among the characters. The author's prose is second rate. The evil prince is pure black. The hero has some depth, but not enough to generate any interest. The basic plot could be found in many much better books.I almost never stop reading a book in the middle. This will be an exception. The hero is about to enter on a quest supported by magic. He predictably will triumph over evil here and in the next two books in the series.

The \\"mystery\\" in this story is a just a soapy family secret. Descriptions of the landscape miss the drama of the Owens Valley, which sits between the Sierra and the magnificent White Mountains to the east. I liked Birch and Bobby. I understand why there had to be the car accident to get the story out, but not why the nicest character had to be killed. \\"The Saddlemaker's Wife\\" is not well written, is sappy and sanctimonious, and is riddled with typos(whatever happened to editing and proofreading?).

It is better than Earlene Fowler's earlier novels.It takes place in a small western town with small-town characters, some of them explicitly Christian. In fact the way the protagonist grapples with the ideas of an evangelical Christian that she meets is a smallish (unresolved) subplot.

Unfortunately my third child suffers from a severe GI reaction to protein and had to be put on a specialized formula. He also has severe reflux. I was desperate for anything that might help us with his feeding issues and relieve the gassiness and spitting up. I saw the Dr. Brown's bottle and bought one. My husband and I noticed a difference immediately. We tried the Natural Flow for two more days (washing out the one bottle over and over) then went back to the old system to make sure it was the Natural Flow that made the difference. After a messy and cranky feeding session with the old bottle we went out and immediately bought more Natural Flow bottles. Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Bottles live up to their claims and have been a blessing for our family."},{"rating":"2","title":"A NaNa's Delight","review":"As I prepared for the birth of my grandchild, I bought my daughter a variety of baby bottles to try. I looked at the HandiCraft bottle and thought - what the heck. When my granddaughter was born, my daughter tried all of the bottles but always went back to the HandiCraft bottle. She did not know if it was her imagination, the bottle or the baby, but everyone was happy. The baby drank her bottle, burped and went to sleep. She did not have any gas problems or colic. She seemed satisfied. I had to try another type of bottle to see the difference. There was a difference. The baby was fussy and gassy. I went back to the handicarft and am sold on them. I just became a NaNa again, twin girls, and they are using these bottles. They are happy babies and seems to be doing great.

He is not the master of his own domain. Arthur, the painter, can only get off while in close proximity to his father's argyle socks. Arthur's therapist, Dr. Brock, tries desperatly to cure Arthur of his fetish, but with no luck. Finally the desperate man takes the socks hostage, and arthur's tough fiance decides to bully Dr. Block to make him \\"surrender the footwear\\". This savy play ask us where we draw the line for what is crazy, and who decides how to \\"cure\\" us. It shows the power struggles between man and woman, man and man and woman and man. In the end, can we decide who is and isn't crazy? If so, haven't we just erased the line of convention, only to redraw it in another place. How crazy is crazy? And does a guy who makes love wearing his father's argyle socks really need to be fixed?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money for Jr. Gong","review":"Where's the substance?

The examples the author used were often contrived and reeked of needless complexity. The tutorial on C# was brief, incomplete and unnecessary (leave the task of teaching C# to a book of it's own). The code seemed to be ported from another language instead of being written with C# in mind (for example the use of a getName() method instead of using a Name property). If your looking for a tutorial on design patterns check out Robert Martin's latest book on Agile Software Development. It doesn't use C#, but it covers the classic GOF design patterns (plus a few others), explores XP programming and (in my opinion most importantly) covers principles fundamental to object oriented programming and design."},{"rating":"1","title":"It served me well when I ran out of toilet paper.","review":"Absolutely, Positively, the biggest waste I ever spent hard earned money on.I bought it because the bookstore didn't have the GoF book, and I thought \\"This will do\\".

Stay away from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"Having suffered through the book to the end, I feel compelled to say what a pathetic disappointment.From the first few chapters it was amazingly clear that the author not only didn't have a firm grasp of C# but had almost entirely misunderstood .Net as well.Intermixed amongst some pathetically poor examples was a combination of editorial errors, mistakes and outright misinformation...I seriously hope noone who has read this book has taken it as an example of how to code, let alone code one of the GoF patterns in managed code.Even the descriptions of the patterns left much to be desired with even one of the simplest patterns, the Singleton not accurately represented.There is 1 saving grace ... it has a nice title :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What planet is this UML and C# from?","review":"The UML diagrams in the book do not follow the UML specifications.

For example, no C# Properties were used anywhere in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Although many have disparaged this book (and with good reason) I thought I would add some weight. The examples have no real sense of direction, with the author adding in methods that have no clear purpose (or explanation). The patterns are not really explained in theory; I guess the reader is supposed to somehow glean what the \\"big picture\\" is. Lastly, the glaring error in the Singleton pattern (a VERY common pattern) is enough to make me shudder.

I will give one example. The example for the Singleton pattern shows no thought for the design. A Singleton has a static property named Instance. The first time you access it you get an instance of the Singleton back. The second time you get back null. A boolean is used to store if the instance has been returned. Why would anyone do that and why would you put it as an example in a book? Don't store the boolean and don't return null. Just return the instance every time. Then the example goes on to show how you can create a custom exception, throw, and catch it. This pattern example was a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"When I bought this book I wanted to apply design pattern to C#. But James Cooper failed to deliver it. This book is a clone from Java Design Pattern. The author didn't even try to use a feature of C# such as property, foreach loop, etc. eventhough he's aware about it. All coding style is Javaish, but the title of the book is \\"C# Design Patterns.\\" I understand the goal is to learn Design Patterns but at least the author must adapt the C# coding style and use more feature of C# to be consistent with the title and purpose of the book. As far as Design Pattern goes, I learned from it, but I wish the implementation would be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Examples and codes need improve","review":"As a _tutorial_ reader, I expected more easy to understand examples.

If you're already a C# master, skip the intro and go right to the patterns. But just about everyone can use a refresher on language fundamentals so even though I'm pretty familiar with C#, I still found it a valuable part of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book for c# developers","review":"Firstly, this book has a good introduction to the c# language, I am already quite comfortable with c# but I enjoyed skimming through this anyway.As well as the introduction to c# the book provides a good introduction to design patterns and has explanations + examples for 23 different design patterns.This is the first book I have read on design patterns and I am already using these patterns in my work.I do feel that the author is more comfortable with coding in java because none of the code examples seem to use properties, instead the author uses getters and setters which I think not good practice in c#.I recommend this book to any c# developers that don't know about design patterns yet. I obviously wouldn't recommend this book to java or c++ developers because the examples are in c#.The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is because the formatting of the code examples is a bit messy, and the author hasn't stuck to c# best practices (using properties)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Design Patterns Explained instead","review":"This book misses the point of patterns. It explains patterns as if they are solutions to recurring problems. Gee, I thought that's what they are? Well, they are - to some extent. They are more about a way to think. The problem with patterns as design solutions is that they don't help you until it is too late. Design Patterns Explained talks about why patterns are good solutions.

We painted the Vulgarian crest on it and it looked great for the one scene we had it in! We actually filled it with helium and pulled it across the stage and the effect was perfect - the audience was rolling in their seats with laughter. So mission accomplished.

Ballard to me, that I finally broke down and read one of his books. Perhaps unfortunately, it was this one.I hated it.Above and beyond hating specific passages that read as if written by trained chimps with ADD, I hated the characters, or rather, lack thereof. There is not enough development of these characters for you to care about them as human beings. At the same time, they are given too much quasi-personality for them to work effectively as icons. If the intention was for the characters to represent a greater idea, the attempt failed. Far and away my biggest complaint, however, is that I feel cheated of a potentially great read. This book had everything going for it out of the starting gate; an interesting premise, a likely candidate for a good anti-hero, and the ticklish promise of a universally relevant allegory. It is really too bad this novel was pieced together so ineptly."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing allegory","review":"This book, like a lot of J.G. Ballard's work, cannot be enjoyed by everyone. It lacks the shock value of \\"Crash\\" and the intrigue of \\"The Atrocity Exhibition\\". I found it, however, to be an enjoyable read in the event that I was prepared to sit down and read this deep piece of litereature. This novel is one big allegory so when you read it you have to keep in mind that it isn't a narrative novel meant for entertainment purposes; it is intended to make a statement, as with most if not all of Ballard's work. I gave it 4 stars based on its allegorical content and how well-written it is rather than how much I enjoyed the book.

I love Connie Mason, I have read almost every book she has written, and this is the worst! Sorry Connie but I aint into abuse. I know you have to come up with new material but Rape shouldnt be one of them.

Before this book, I purchased a copy of the \\"Black Knight\\"...what a remarkable book. However, I have one question concerning \\"Caress and Conquer\\", what was Connie Mason thinking! This book made me what to slap both lead characters. The one character I wanted to slap both ways and tell him to be a man was Tony. The things he did to Amanda; I for one would not want to go through the things she did with this \\"so-called\\" man. In this day and age, I do not think any other woman would stand for what he did. If he only learned to keep his pants buttoned-up. Thank you for a hellish reading. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYBODY.

I found Tony's character to be selfish and very cruel to Amanda. She even bears his child early on and he's still his cruel self to her and her baby. His mistress is even worse! She treats Amanda horribly while Tony does nothing. If you ask me Lety the mistress should not have been in this story as long as she is. She worse than Tony by orchestrating Amanda's rape. Speaking of which there are too many of those in this book. I'm surprised Amanda didn't shoot Lety AND Tony, it would have been fitting. Come on.

I appreciated the attempt to make the story different from usual romance novels which at times seem to be the same story with different names, however, the book was annoying. The main hero was a pig, the heroine was constantly in different bad situations, and the villianess wasn't just evil, but she was sick. None of the main characters are very likable. If you are looking for a romance book that is unusual and does not follow the normal path, I would recommend this book for the simple fact of reading something that has a very different plot/characters than any other romance book I have ever read. However, I would also say that the book is very long and half-way through it I couldn't wait to just be done with it. Every scene in the book has to do with the hero being naive, the heroine is in trouble, and the villianess is the cause of some sick, twisted plan."},{"rating":"1","title":"it is not romance","review":"It is rubbish from the beginning to the end.

They're not the very high-pitched, tinkly kinds of chimes, and they're a little bit minor in tone. Birds sing and caw in the background at times.

My phone fell out of the case today at lunch as I was leaving and the LCD is now broken and does not display ANYTHING. The phone does not come unclipped, the weak velcro that holds the case closed around the phone just comes undone, and the phone slides right out. But also, it does not provide ANY protection for the face, the most fragile part of this phone, and so the face is very scratched.

It looks like a very useful case, but since I don't wear a belt often and wanted to hook the clip to the top of my jeans, this case wouldn't work. I instead purchased a Motorola StarTac case. I removed the inside plastic from the top half of the case and attached Velcro to both top and bottom. I now have a case with a clip, and it closes to protect the front of the phone. It's still easy to remove the phone from the case for use. Thanks for your reviews, they helped a great deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clip Case Problems","review":"The swivel case is a nice idea, but if you happen to sit down and the phone doesn't swivel in the anticipated direction, the plastic belt clip will break and disconnect from the connector on the back of the leather case. This will allow the phone to fall, or worse, land quietly where someone else will find it. If you shop around you can find an aftermarket leather case that will fit this phone like a glove, which has a stiched on clip on the back, like a better eyeglass case. The case also has a clear plastic vinyl sheet which covers the keys and doesn't interfere with dialing at all.

The case is barely large enough to strap over the top of the phone. This, along with the limited velcro surface area, cause the strap to come loose easily.

This is as far as compliments will go however. This case was designed for looks only - no consideration was made for performance,comfort, or security. For example, the flap which closes the case is closed by a tiny velcro strip which too easily \\"catches\\" on anything it comes in contact with.This opens the case enough so that by merely kneeling down the phone falls out. Also, this phone unlike previous Nokias is NOT made using the same quality of plastics - this makes the clear lens far to susceptible to scratching. This case ideally would have covered the clear lens thus,alleviating the scratching problem. This leather case is also not very comfortable - when sitting the swivel \\"bites\\" into your sides. All in all I guess - \\"Good luck\\" is in order if you decide to buy this case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depends on the purpose of the case","review":"I bought this case with only one purpose in mind, which was to carry the phone with the belt clip (versus in my pocket). The clip swivels and took a lot of abuse when getting in/out of vehicles and banging into things on accident. If you are buying this case to protect the phone, there are much better choices. The case worked great for me the first year until the velcro wore down. After this, the top fastener on the case loosened up and the phone tended to slip out....just replace this case each year and you'll be fine. Otherwise, it worked out great for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-designed book makes you wish for more","review":"While this book is well-designed and many of the photographs are lovely and thought-provoking (Are these men friends, brothers, lovers?), you leave it realizing that this is basically one person's collection of old photographs of men together.

The inherent humor in the scenario of one man observing another is explored, not exploited, in an intelligent and witty fashion. I particularly enjoyed the fact that whole scenes would pass with no dialogue at all. Also noteworthy was the cinematography, which gave everything a handsome Nordic sheen.My second source of enjoyment were the reviews posted herein; it's rare to see so many good reviews so unanimous in their praise of a work, whether book, CD, or movie.

Patience with the deliberate pace will reward the viewer with a richness and satisfaction rarely found in films today.

At that time it was a fantastic references. It told me everything I ever wanted to know about the Ruby language.

At no point does it give a complete picture of the information it is trying to portray. For example on page 585 in the reference section, it talks about the Process.kill built-in. However, it does not list the signals that one might use use with this command and it does not specify anywhere in the book. It makes no attempt to be complete and much of the data you need to learn a feature such as the syntax for something simple like \\"if\\" is spread out in unrelated examples throughout the book. Badly written and incomplete. The only reason it got 1 star is that is the minimum possible rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book-must have","review":"Sometimes it is nice to be able to thumb through a reference book.

(Two Sides of Myself, and Looking for Things Searching For Things) However these two releases are excellent when combined. The songs are epic and beautiful examples of everything I love about the post rock genre. Tarentel is beautiful ambient rapture. Nostalgic at times, fans familiar with the genre will compare it to a kindler gentler mogwai, or a more hopeful godspeed you black emperor. Without a doubt though, everyone should here these songs at least once. I think Caine was a bit harsh, because this IS some of their best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"headspace for spaceheads","review":"If you dislike elements such as subtlety, slowness, space, repetition, reverb, and experimentation, run far far away now please.

This is what's needed in a world of overstimulation and excess multitasking. Forget the drugs, just pop this baby in and listen closely. You'll find your mind slowly, gradually giving in to the sound of Tarentel, like a fly to a spider's all enveloping, delicate and intricate web.

I use headphones every day, so I expect this end to come to all of them eventually from being pulled in my bag and generally subjected to heavy usage. But usually, a $15 pair will last at least 6 months before needing replacement. These fail even the cheap stuff durability test."},{"rating":"1","title":"They hurt my ears & their return policy stinks! Don't buy them!","review":"These didn't fit in my ears. They are very uncomfortable, and after an hour on the treadmill, they actually made my ears sore. The second time I went to put them on, I noticed the rubber cushion was missing from one ear piece. Luckily I found it in my gym bag, but that tells you they are easy to lose! And one size doesn't fit all, but they have only one size rubber cushions.So I wore them twice and got disgusted and threw them on my kitchen counter with the thought \\"I'll return them to Amazon later.\\" Well, 32 days later and I finally read their return policy to find out I'm 2 days late AND I would have gotten only 80% (at the MOST) of my purchase price AND I would have to pay the shipping for returning them.Thank goodness I'm out only $13. I ended up going to Target and paying $30 for great ones from Phillips. Because of their lousy return policy, I'll never buy from this dealer again. Beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope....","review":"Oh they look good and are comfortable.Only one problem: they don't work.The left earphone did not work right out of the box.

So I looked for over-the-ear buds and first bought the Philips SHS8000 Premium Sound , but it was horrible! It fit over my ear great, but all the bass came out of the back of the earbud, unless i shoved the whole thing in my ear (painful) so it sounded Tingy when i didnt do it. Then I came across this.. works beautiful! Stays in my ear and I don't have to shove the whole piece in my canal! And .. I HAVE BASS!! Great buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ear Clips fall apart","review":"I really liked mu iLuv ear clips when I got them but, after only a few weeks they are falling apart!

They do not hold up very well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my new earclips","review":"I have sensitive ears, and the earbud type earphones that are included with iPods, etc really hurt my ears. So, when I saw these, I was pretty excited to try them. They are great! They don't hurt my ears at all, and they stay in place well!!! The ear clips are soft, smooth, flexible plastic, so are very comfortable; and the part that goes in your ear is even softer. I'm not really sure what to compare it to. The only problem (if I had to come up with one), is that they are so flexible, I haven't quite mastered applying them quickly--it takes an extra second or two, but that is fine by me. It is well worth it for the comfort!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely comfortable","review":"These are super comfortable and easy to pack for travel. The soft rubber ear clips are excellent for extended wear. These are NOT extremely high fidelity, but they allow you to enjoy your music and still hear the world around you...sometimes a necessity. For noise canceling, you'll want to find something else, but for general use when you need to hear the kids, or traffic, or your boss, these are unbeatable for comfort.The small bud fits right into the opening of the ear, but the ear pieces keep it there. Unlike ordinary ear-buds, these don't fall out. The ear clip is very soft, flexible rubber that you can wear for hours without discomfort. I have lots of these so that I have a pair wherever and whenever I want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible for Running","review":"I wore these for a run and couldn't even believe how bad these wore.

I have normal shaped/sized ears and was greatly dissatisfied with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the item in the photo","review":"The earphones SUCK. They are NOT the iLuv headphones in the picture. The rubber piece that fits behind your ear is much thinner and too long for my ear. I have to wear sunglasses when I run and keep the headphones \\"pinned\\" to my ears or they'll fall off. I LOVED the headphones in the photo and can't find them in any stores.

I would DEFINITELY not recommend to potential buyers."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap earphones","review":"the product is crap. The first one I used broke the first day.

What I don't like is that the little rubber rings come off easily and get lost. Without these rings they are no longer comfortable to wear. The rings, make for comfort but also, I think, they help block out back ground noise.I could not find replacements for my first set of headphones' lost rubber rings. I bought another set of headphones and lost one of the rings after about 2 weeks. I tried the little foam/spongy covers but they won't fit, unless the rubber rings are on. I like the headphones because they are lightweight and not as \\"big\\" as some other headphones. I have 2 sets of headphones and one set of the rubber rings between the two. If I lose another ring then neither one of these will make me happy. It would be nice if we could buy replacement rings. I'm thinking I may have to look at other brands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best head phones","review":"These are the best headphones - they have been hard to find so I went on amazon to stock up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable but rubber slips off","review":"I hate the clip-on headphones that go into the ear like a plug, but find that most of the other variety have comfort issues or fall out too easily. These are just perfect ... until the piece of rubber slips off the plastic which is all to often with this model. After this having happened to two sets (finally lost all 4 pieces of rubber) I bought some glue that works on plastics and glued the little rubber pieces to my new set and it hasn't come off for two months running.It is unfortunate that they can't hold themselves together on their own but there isn't anything else that comes close to the comfort level of these little guys. Perhaps that's the reason they were dropped at the stores. I bought 6 from Amazon since they stopped carrying them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"I'm using it to run and it fits PERFECT! it does not annoy me or fall off - the volume control hits me while running but what do you expect - I'm really happy with this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bulky on tiny ears","review":"If you have smaller ears, these aren't for you.Admittedly, buying earbud headphones has been troublesome for me because my ears are smaller than average, so I expected to meet with problems when I ordered these.

The product mainly hangs off ones ear, and the plugs are too big to fit in a normal sized ear lobe. hence they just hang off the earlobe. sounds ok, but does nothing to block off ambient sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short lived :(","review":"When I first received these headphones I thought they were great...they fit well and are comfy for hours on end. Then I stuck them in my gym bag every day and before you know it pieces started to come out (first the rubber around the actual speaker, then one of the speakers itself) and now they don't even work after two months of use. While they were cheap and I wasn't expecting much, I am disappointed because they were comfy and the quality wasn't bad. Maybe if your going to give them a lot of TLC they are for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ok, but not for small ears","review":"The product was awesome!!

Enjoy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not my color but worth the cash","review":"I actually got it for $7 at Ross but it is good at any price. Even though the ear clip part is a bit flimsy, it doesn't pinch your ears like other earclips. I sat watching tv for about 2 hours and forgot I even had them on!!! They are great!! I tried jogging about the house in them, and the only thing moving was the cord. They are very stable in your ears and they come with two extra pair of earbuds (just in case). I would def. recommend these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, Portable, okay sound and thats it","review":"I bought this after a friend recommended it when I complained about my earbuds hurting my ears. The price was nice however I watched the entire 1st season of Gossip Girl on my Ipod and after 2 hours of wearing these my ear was in more pain than my earbuds caused me!! The do no fit well since I also wear glasses :( My ears hurt for a few days afterwards.

However, less than a month has gone by and the wires have broken right off, near the volume control. I have been careful and stowed them in a case after each use. Even $20 headphones should last more than a month. I will not buy them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!!!!","review":"BEWARE!!! The first pair I bought broke after about a week.

It is comfortable, lightweight, love the volume control on the cord, stays in place during exercise. The soft plastic cover on the ear bud fell off the 2nd week. I was able to put it back on. But it proceeded to fall off again with every use. Too bad they can't fix that problem, it would be great, but until then, wouldn't recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't stay in ears","review":"Maybe I just have weird ears, but these would not stay put, even when I was just sitting still.

First the rubber thingies fell off, then the screen for the soundpiece fell off. I can't use them at all now since I can't find replacement pieces to repair them.

Don't expect good sound either, it's just not loud enough, don't let the volume control fool you, it's worthless. If you're looking for soft, earphones to wear while you workout, these are NOT what you need. They are comfortable but the rubber or silicone coating over the earbud piece that goes inside the ear can come off and get stuck in your ear! NOT NICE at all, especially if you give a pair to your kids. The rubber part literally came off and I tilted my ear and it fell out of there.

She grinds her jokes into the ground. She makes one sketch for each character and then just writes that same sketch again with a few words changed, then she does it again, and again, and again..

Glad to keep the story alive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fans of the original - run away","review":"For fans of the original recording of the Journey to the Centre of the Earth concert (1974), this version will probably be a disappointment. While the original recording does have its flaws (most reviewers would reference the vocals here), if you're like me you've been listening to it for the better part of 30 years, and by this point the \\"flaws\\" are as ingrained in your appreciation of the recording as the keyboard artistry of Rick Wakeman. The music is mostly the same, but there are some key differences, most notably (to me) the part right after \\"...and in silence, they waited for the storm...\\". To make it even less enjoyable, the narrator sounds like Eric Idle doing a Saturday Night Live parody of the recording.In short - stick to the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was bad, it was really bad","review":"I've been a long time fan of Dungeons and Dragons, i've got shelves of books and have played in a ridiculous number of campaigns. I thought third edition was ok and have been picking up the new class books as they come out. Sword and Fist was fairly good, lots of neat feats and prestige classes. Defenders is bad. It's really bad.The new feats are far from spectacular, there's only one or two that a player would ever consider using - regardless of character concept. The specialty classes are unimaginative. The new spheres are eh. Most importantly of all, the ideas presented within are easily reached by anyone vaguely creative or who has any gaming experience.I strongly urge you to borrow a copy of the book before purchasing it. WotC doesn't care about providing you with a quality product, they're merely skirting the edge of decency to get everyone to buy it. It's not the good ole' days of TSR where they actually cared about putting out an interesting, usuable product."},{"rating":"1","title":"medocre at best","review":"The book really is not all that interesting. Yes there are more magic items, spells, prestige classes, and mounts. However none of these really stand out. Also, there is little in the way of new ideas given for either Clerics and Paladens.

Holes prevent food from sliding as toddlers bring the spoon to their mouth. The curved handle is not long enough though. It needs to be maybe 20% longer. Otherwise, a great training spoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"These didn't work for us.","review":"Being completely plastic, made it more difficult for my daughter to learn to eat on her own, than a spoon with a stainless steel handle.

We tried them maybe a couple of times, and then they stayed in the drawer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed - Nuby beats this","review":"I bought these spoons because of the good reviews, but wasn't impressed. The holes weren't a problem, but didn't seem to be a benefit either. The handles are just too short. Not only did they usually end up down in the bowl, but they weren't easy for my kids to hold. We much prefered the Nuby spoon & fork set, which we got at Walmart under their store label. They worked great from when the kids first started feeding themselves, and my 4 year old still prefers it over a metal spoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why I hated the product","review":"The book was falling apart, even though the description of it said it was in good condition.

My dad was kind enough to run to the store and pick up a bottle and some formula. He brought back a Playtex VentAire bottle and I was very impressed. The best feature is that it does not leak at all! I am annoyed by the slow drip drip drip that comes out of a bottle when you turn it upside down to begin feeding. This bottle does not do that!I liked the one bottle dad bought enough to invest in a whole bunch more and toss my Playtex Nursers. The only problem I have had is cleaning them. Maybe I was just too used to the disposable bags in the other type we had but I really have a hard time getting these bottles clean.

These bottles allowed me to feed him large amounts without having to burp him and without causing him to have gas. The only bad thing about these bottles is they get so little gas that you end up trying to burp them for a long time just waiting for a belch. Once I got used to the idea that they don't create much gas I felt better about using them and now I wouldn't be able to live without them."},{"rating":"2","title":"lots of tips","review":"The DVD was fun to watch.

I never knew that binding off the last 2 stitches together would eliminate the odd bump or tail. Previously I had always been unhappy with the last bind off stitch.

Despite what the blade looks like (a cross section would be a triangle), it is VERY sharp and cuts through tough stuff very fast and very easily. Be careful, because you can slice your hand wide open and not even feel it, don't ask me how I know.

The cover illustration perfectly captures the eerie mood of the story.As for the story, I personally find it one of the very best pieces of horror written since the days of Machen and Blackwood. Klein constructs an atmosphere of growing, cumulative dread that is physically palpable. There is virtually no grue in this short tale at all, and that Klein creates as much unease as he does is a tribute to his extraordinary talents. It's a cliche among reviewers that a good piece of supernatural fiction shouldn't be read at night but, really, for reasons that will be apparent to the reader, this one should be read with the curtains closed and the temptation to peak out into the dark resisted at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"These items are incredible.","review":"I previously owned a copy of this book and the jack o'lantern is so cute.

This MacMillan used the entry word in a sentence more often than the DK Merriam-Webster.

Some of the most inventive and poignant songs in the electronic genre are located on Banco cds. Then along came 'You Are Here'. What can I say? It's just poor. Poor, unimaginative and (in more than one place) cheesey as hell. It just never gains any steam. There are a few moments which I really liked (the beginning of track 5 is one)only to be ruined by vocals. To add to it, the vocalist on this album is just vanilla and the lyrics are ham-fisted and just plain stupid in places. The whole 'world music' edge that Banco had to it's music is all but gone completely.

This film is not yet available in Region 1 on DVD (as of May '12 anyway). It's always a dead giveaway when the item description includes no releasing studio information (or the studio name is some weird name no-one's ever heard of). I'm just saying this because it can be an iffy proposition for the image quality sometimes. Also, bootleg copies of films have practically no resale value at all (you can be banned on e bay for listing them), and if a legitimate version ever is released on DVD, your boot copy is worthless. I have this film on VHS and occasionally check on films that I still have on tape to see if there's a DVD finally out for it so I can replace my tapes, but this is not worth getting. Maybe Amazon should change it's name to AmazingCon(job)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hunchback 1997","review":"This was a wonderful movie. I am look forword to the DVD when it come out.

The only verson that has the original ending where Esmerelda dies is the 1957 version. THAT version is better than this one. This version also deletes the character of Pheobus and now Esmerelda is accused of killing the king's minister or whatever.

This time they defeated Victor Hugo and proved that the American entertainment industry is still capable of keeping the world literature at bay. The producers had no thought for themselves.

Instead of choosing the easy way of creating their own story and setting it in Columbus, OH or Dallas, TX, they joined Quasimodo in his fight for free press. Now we are finally free of prejudice to respect the author and the originality of his creation.

I figure that this sort of copy protection is even stranger considering it is an enhanced CD and has additional content. To get the disk to work in my computer I had to reload the disk several times to get it to even appear a readable disk.

Again, I would like to emphasize it isn't a bad album/CD (whatever we call them these days...), but there is no 80's flavor to it as there was on Danse Macabre. I really don't feel it is \\"pop\\" or mainstream, and maybe I should take the suggestions of previous reviewers and listen to it a few more times (Will it grow on me? Maybe...), but my initial impression is that The Faint have lateralled tha can be described as not being forward progression or regression, just different.

The digital transfer quality on Seasons 1 & 2 is good overall. However, Season 3 is another story. It stinks! Many of the episodes are bleached (color-wise) and blurred. Looks like they confiscated some used video-tapes and did a transfer using a consumer-end VCR with no digital enhancement other than adding chapters (one thing that was nicer than Seasons 1 & 2). And even the transition on some chapters is noticeablely chopped (almost like some one stopped the playback while still recording). My guess is that the studio's greed set in and they decided to accelerate the production timeline for Season 3 and get these out on the market at the sacrifice of quality so they bring in those $$$ faster. For such a wonderful series as this is, it is a crying shame to see such a low quality transfer to DVD as Season 3 is. I purchased Seasons 4 & 5 which I have not yet viewed.

Well, now that she has the 1st 3 seasons, she still watches an episode after work, but instead of the fuzzy picture on the VHS tape, she watches an episode on DVD. I must admit I end up watching some of them myself. It's unfortunate that no one makes quality shows like this anymore. A lesson to be learned in every episode.

It will still settle on the bottom, so you'll have to vacuum it up, but that will allow it to better dissolve into the water.Many people don't add stabilizer and spend to much on Chlorine and always have the chlorine then either too high or too low.

Ms. Brooks' coming of age novel thoroughly explores each character as she cleverly brings to life the wide-ranging emotions of the diverse and multi-dimensional characters in First Love.

However, I found this novel to be way too preachy to get that message through to the youth of today. The scriptures, quoted lyric to gospel songs and such were overwhelming...even for me. It was hard to complete the read because all the mini-sermons kept weighing down the message behind the love story. I never completed the entire novel because it just seemed to go on forever. The story was over well before the book ended in my opinion. The message that this author was aiming to get across was a good one and one that needs to be spread.

The parts that are suposed to be scary just have a little girl slowly walking around with cheesey camera effects and then she'll stab or strangle someone.

Except for the teachers, ages, hair color and style, clothing, ethnicity, and names are all very similar. Since it was hard to distinguish one student from the next, I developed little empathy for any of them or any understanding of their motives.

Words like \\"wonderful\\" and \\"sensitive\\" come to the top of my mind. Sumi Jo and her crystal clear voice notwithstanding, \\"Prayers\\" is mostly enjoyable because of the music selections themselves. Moving from the Old Testament \\"Kaddisch\\" into the Christian era is enough of a spiritual range; but adding the touch of spiritual in \\"Sometimes I feel like a Motherless Child\\" and a Loewe/Lerner \\"Say A Prayer For Me Tonight\\" makes for delicious toppings.

The first half is older and written by David, the second half is newer and written by Peter. I liked the sections written by David, but he was often a bit vague in explaining things. There was a lot of what and not a lot of why. Peter on the other hand goes into great lengths to explain the minutia of his naming conventions. Where David lacks, Peter is superfluous. Often the two differ in opinion as well. Neither of them really get it right and I am left with questions and wishing I had a better book on scything. Additionally the parts written by Peter are filled with disdain for anyone other than him and his elite little home schooled family. The book drips with narcissism to the point where towards the end I became disgusted with it. Two stars for being the ONLY scythe book.

I can understand people liking it but I cannot see why anyone would think it a great novel. The best thing about it is the writing. It is a well-written book. The plot is somewhat mechanistic. The characterization is also frustrating; the good people tend to be passive and the bad ones tend to be totally bad with no redeeming features to create a sense of well-roundedness. Finally the moral vision is somewhat bleak with so much sinister corruption in the town. If this is what small town Ontario is like, no wonder we have situations like the tragedy in Walkerton.This novel bears no comparison with a novel like No Great Mischief by Alstair Maclean, which is just in another league altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"early bad aboy","review":"I was surprised and delighted to find that this was an earlier edition of a book i sought"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind Provocing","review":"The book \\"the Gods were Astronauts\\" is a very interesting book to read.Quite a new way to look at things.I would however suggest reading the Book \\"Chariots of the Gods?\\" first.Cheers Derek."},{"rating":"1","title":"God weren't astronauts","review":"I read this trash-book here in Brazil.This book is so bad, that I didn't finished it.This book is absurd, ridiculous and senseless.Please, don't waste your money and time, reading this trash-book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carlucci","review":"Beware misleading listing here at Amazon as to their confusion in putting books by Richard Russo(author par excellant) and those by Richard Paul Russo ( author medicore), on the same page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tuscana dishes","review":"On Dec, 14,2006 I ordered a service for 12 of these dishes.

Of course you can play with a friend head to head but that's not much fun after a while. You'll also notice that the controls are alot and I mean ALOT stiffer than the previous wipeout games. The controls can get a little frustrating at times especially when you get to the higher levels of speed.I say give this one a rental.

This is ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderfully illustrated rundown of Nietzsche's ideas","review":"An engaging and comprehensive summary of Nietzsche's various thoughts organized primarily chronologically, but also establishing thematic links where necessary. The book effectively pairs the prose of Gane to paraphrase Nietzsche's ideas (which would likely satisfy Nietzsche himself) and quotes from Nietzsche. One of the most remarkable elements of this text are the illustrations which are spectacular and add a great deal of depth to this light analysis and re-articulation of Nietzsche's core assertions and ideals.The text also includes biographical information to add context to his writings and additionally a laundry list of philosophers, psychologists, and thinkers who were heavily influenced by Nietzsche. Nothing beats reading the real thing, but this unassuming little book will greatly enhance any study of Nietzsche's ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dove Hunting","review":"Although this book is a little old, it still contains some very basic information that can be very useful to the novice dove hunter.

Some parts are almost to funny to watch ^_^ & the cuteness rate is very high, I really recommend it for all the people who also enjoyed animes like: Ai yori aoshi or Love Hina."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet, cute, and simple anime ...","review":"Hand Maid May will offer you nothing you haven't seen before as an anime fan. Still, I give it credit for being consistently entertaining, fun, and featuring really funny characters. It's great to see a \\"harem\\" anime where the women are actually friendly and not out to kill each other. I love the energy of the quasi-villian, too.However, as cute and funny as Hand Maid May is, the show also has its fair share of touching moments, especially in the middle and the end. If it weren't for the irritating OVA, this anime would be really great, if not original. As it is, it's just good, but that still makes this show well worth your time.P.S. And no, it's not sexist."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun little anime, not to be missed!","review":"atthecon.com reviewed this anime.

So Nanbara placed a virus into Kazuya's computer. Which backfired.Seconds later May is delivered to Kazuya's apartment. A 1/6 size Cyberdoll created by Cyberdyne CO, LTD. Which only costs $1,450,000 dollars!Lots of fun scenes, silly characters, cool art and good voices. Wendee Lee is one of them, along with Lex Lang, Sandy Fox, Steve Cannon, and Rebecca Forstadt (Reba West), so you know I'm in love with it. Four episodes, with 100 minutes of anime, rated for 13 and up. Only two other DVDs to go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hand Maid May-Product Recall (Vol. 2)","review":"This is a very bright, cheerful series! It has nice, bright animation, catchy opening and closing theme music, and plenty of laughs! I'm also happy to say that unlike some anime dubs, the voice actresses/actors are great (Lia Sargent is perfect in doing the voice of May)! There are too many panty ... shots, especially when you consider the two characters who are used to provide the majority of these shots (May and Kasumi) are extremely likable characters! Nevertheless, I liked this anime a lot! In the eleven episodes we have some nice little lessons about friendship, loyalty, and effort! What more could you want! PS- When watching Episode #5, bring some Kleenex, it's very touching, really! PPS- You'll LOVE May, she's just ADORABLE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cute, butt...","review":"The story is a cute idea, and May herself is very cute, too. But...or should I say \\"butt\\"...the panty shots and boob jiggles get to be a little much even before the first episode is over. If only real life were like this...It's all silly-cute, I guess.Actually, the part I find offensive is the antagonist, Nanbara. His voice and actions are so painfully annoying, I found myself muting him whenever he made an appearance. I can't tell you how much I hate that character, and when you first pop in the DVD, it opens to \\"Nanbara's Room\\" which is just too excrutiating to describe.If you're a hard-up anime fan and the only time you ever get to see a pair of white, cotton panties is when they're drawn on short-skirted cartoons, then this title is definitely for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Cup of Tea","review":"When writing this review I had to click the \\"I am over the age of 13\\" and maybe that's the problem and why I disliked this anime. You must be 13 or under male to enjoy this series. If you like a lot of fanservice you'll love this series and I'm not saying I don't like a little fanservice but this series seems nothing but. They beat you over the head until you beg for them to stop. The start menu is confusing and I almost thought I had a defective disk until I hit every option and it took me to the real menu. The villian is extremely annoying and Sara whose main job is to repo May is incompetent. It's story after story of how they fail to repo May along with panty shot after panty shot. You'll never mistake this for any anime with a substantial plot. I understand this is harem anime but there are good series that fit under the genre. Gertrude Stein once said, \\"A rose is a rose is a rose\\" meaning things are what they are. This anime is a turd is a turd is a turd."},{"rating":"1","title":"one up for the little ecchi","review":"If you're under 13, this is not for you. If you're above 18, why would you get this one? May is a special robot, a cyberdoll with a maid program who lives with an engineering student Kazuya. A cyberdoll with feelings? Actually, those humanoid robots with feelings are nothing but old concepts already. As much as this anime tries to be a touching comedy, there are more perverted scenes than comedic lines that you will notice. No, it's not like Ranma 1/2. Ranma 1/2 can be ecchi but Rumiko Takahashi knows how to concentrate on the great script and charm slapstick.

I rented it at my local anime store a few days after pioneer released it. I loved it! Kazuya's always blushing and it reminds me SO much of Tenchi Muyo! and Love Hina.Yes there is oodles of fan service (panty shots, bouncy chests) but i would NOT go so far as to call it a hentai. There's no sex, and kazuya just blushes while the girls make comments, if you've seen some of Ryoko's antics from Tenchi Muyo! then this won't bother you a bit, especially if you saw the Tenchi Muyo! hot springs episode. I'd say, no younger than 12 years old for kids watching this. I'm a girl so i pretty much just brushed all that fan service aside in my mind. Now for males it will be different.

Compared to the Sonic GBA video it's not as good with looks and video. The video at times falls out of sync with the audio, and at other times the video will look blurry, blocky and sometimes choppy.

Rabbi Dosick touched upon several things as it relates to this informative book about parenting. Golden Rules is not a preachy, rigid stance but a personal, yet provocative approach that parents can take to show their children how they are an important part of the world society and how their contribution can provide a means to help the less fortunate.

We really like the fact that they are chlorine-free since dioxins (by-products of bleaching) are harmful to our environment. However, warning: they do resemble paper bags. :) We're not sure about if the dioxins stay on the diapers and affect our baby but we figure we could do without the chemicals. We found these diapers to be very absorbent and had very few leaks since we started using them 1.5 months ago. The only cons: they're a bit more bulky than conventional brands & a bit more expensive . But, they do go on sale occasionally, so we stock up then. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Diapers I'm happy to buy","review":"My first preference is cloth; but for daycare we must pack disposables and these are my favorites.

Half the DVD is Yuka being happy, smiling, while in a swimsuit, talking about happy memories and being bouncy.

This is NOT a photo shoot for a magazine, this is MOVING pictures. The whole thing should of been her, talking about her life, being happy, smiling and mostly half-undressed.The DVD has a photo gallery in it and a glossy fold-out came with my DVD, giving birth date, height, measurements and blood type (which was cool), but I had to take away three stars because of how 'artistic' they tried to make it(sorry Yuka).I'm going to buy the Race Queen DVDs and review them also.

The water has it's tubing in a nice flexible long covering and doesn't get hung up like the wire wrapped kind, also has 2 extra brass adapters for different applications. The oil gauge does come with the tubing and extra fittings. I didn't use the bracket that came with gauges but it also had the mounting screws and a rubber grommit.

While Kate is ferreting out the mysterious goings-on with the child's death, Charles is knee-deep in bodies and clues.

In my opinion, the short stories of The Oval Lady go about the nonsense and deep messages about society in a way that few authors can get.

The first one was used, so I figured the 2nd CD was just damaged somehow (even thought I can promise you it wasn't scratched or anything - I checked). Well, a few months later I bought a brand new Swarm of Drones. Guess what? 2nd CD does NOT work again! It just causes any CD player you stick it in to sit there and spin and spin and try to read it.Great music, however, 1 star because I got ripped off due to a production error at Sombient music (who made this).

Instead it addresses the matter of looking at children as whole individuals who should be treated respectably, as any adult would want to be.Our culture too readily encourages parents, and adults in general, to use their voice in a excessively authorative manner which only serves to bully and demean children. No one would want to be spoken to or treated in such a condensending manner.

Right then I knew she had lost her mind. (The author) once an again a good storyline had somebody with more experience had written it. I am not a hater I am an avid reader I know a good story when I read one. Looks like this one will also have a sequel I will wait until I see it a garage sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wouldna, Never, Ever","review":"Paige, Paige, Paige what can I say. I guess she was living for a dollar and a dream thinking Marlon would marry her. It took getting held down and beat up to find out she wasted her time with him because he is a momma's boy. But the things he does for his momma doesn't make sense! Why would he marry a chick that he didn't love or want just to please his momma? Why would he put his children and happiness on hold for his momma's sack. Lucille was an evil woman and wrong to tell the lies that she did. Even after finding all that out Marlon stuck with her. See that's what I mean something is wrong with that. Did she do voodoo on him or what? Paige finds some happiness in the end but of course she stepped on some squirrels during the way. Celeste is another evil being that needs to be settled. Hopefully the sequal will put her in her place but I have a feeling there will be much more drama in store for Ms. Paige before all is said and done."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 STARS... WOW!","review":"This book was a excellent. I could not put it down. I hope there will be a part 2. This was my first book by La Jill Hunt.

All in all, I would recommend every woman and man to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Time's A Charm....","review":"I picked up this book at the local Wal-Mart.

I loved every second of reading this book. so good i didnt want to put it down. im ready to read the next book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"small, but nice","review":"As mentioned in a previous review, these are 5x7 dishes. Excellent for single servings of lasagne, manicotti, etc. The sides only come up about an inch though, making a shepherd's pie or pot pie type dish a bit on the small side. The cookware is oven safe, but not broiler safe, due to the silicone handles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"I've only used these a couple of times so far. I baked eggs (Barefoot Contessa recipe) and then I baked omelets last night. Eggs and cheese did NOT stick at all. It was wonderful having 2 omelets ready at the same time instead of one getting cold while the other is cooking. However, because of the non-stick coating (which is excellent) I'm not able to serve in the pans. Too bad they haven't found a non-stick surface you can use with metal utensils."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bakeware","review":"I ordered 2 sets of these and they are perfect for us now that we are \\"empty nesters\\". Just the right size for individual servings, or a small side dish for two. Now I am back for more to give as gifts, you can't beat the price and quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Father's day present.","review":"I bought this recliner for my Father on Father's day. Seems to be a quality chair although he would prefer padding at the feet bar also. He is an older man and says his feet are tender and the bar hurts them.Shipping was fine, and arrived undamaged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Zero Gravity Recliner","review":"This Faulkner chair is extremely WELL MADE-- very sturdy/ a little heavier than some/ but worth it! Fabric is very comfortable/ not \\"scratchy\\" where you need to cover it with a light blanket or towel. Mine stays on a convered patio-- and I feel \\"like a \\"queen\\" when I set it back into the full back/rest position-- be careful-- you might fall asleep in this wonderful chair-- and you awaken feeling no back pain/ just rested and well ! Ordered it from Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great recliner, big and strong!","review":"This is a very nice high quality recliner, well built, very comfortable, easy to get in and out of, and strong. No complaints here, we have two of them and have used them extensivly over the summer. They even seem to dry fast when rained on which was a surprise since they are padded. Kits to reweb this chair are also available which is a nice feature down the road."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"We fight over who gets to sit in this comfy recliner. Having Multiple Sclerosis means I win, getting to lie back and provide great relief to painful legs and back. I was afraid I would be confined to the couch and wheel chair this summer but this recliner lets me be in the yard with friends and family. I set it up by the BBQ so I can grill and rest while keeping a watchful eye during cooking. After the meal is done, someone drags the chair over to the picnic table so I can put my legs up and still be part of the fun.This isn't the cheapest recliner but it is very well built and comfortable. The only pro is that I wished it went back another 2 inches or so to truly get my legs above my heart. This reclines more than any of the other models I have tried this year, but not as much as my prior recliner. That recliner barely lasted a year and I can foresee this recliner lasting several years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use","review":"This is a Father's Day gift and he loves it. The chair seems to be sturdy enough and the only flaw we noticed is that the connecting joints are plastic versus steel. Each time you move from an upright sitting position to the horizontal position, the chair pops twice, causing you to think you broke it. After it popped with different people, we realized it's just a fluke of the chair. The chair easily fits men who are six feet or taller. I chose this one in case one of our friends who weigh about 250 lbs. should happen to \\"try\\" it. Yes, we enjoy the chair and would buy another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"learning to love it","review":"I have been doing \\"The Booty Barre\\" workout by Tracey Mallet for a few months and I really like it, so I wanted to get another barre inspired workout for variety. I read the reviews and chose this one. After viewing this DVD for the first time I absolutely hated it. I couldn't keep up and felt rather defeated. But when I gave it another try a few days later, I changed my mind. I think I like it. It is very challenging and quite different from the other workout I mentioned. It does move rather quickly, but once you give it a go a few times, it becomes doable. My advice to those who hate it after the first try, give it and yourself another chance and work your way up to it. It's a toughie, but well worth the effort!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too fast!","review":"Not much ballet here, felt very much like an aerobics class. Nice combinations but tempo is way TOO FAST for much of it. Not that the movements are too difficult at all, but it's just crazy level fast. Hard to enjoy, felt very frantic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of your joints!","review":"I began ballet last year (being 23) and I thought this DVD might be a nice cardio-oriented workout which at the same time might allow me to use movements I know. Oh my! I don't have any knee problems and yet, after only 5 minutes, my knees were cracking loudly! Why? Because pliés or reverences are NOT supposed to be fast-paced, it doesn't allow you to concentrate on your form and while trying to keep up, you naturally shift you position and harm yourself. I will not use this DVD again. Working out is supposed to lead to good health, and while it seems very efficient for toning and shaping, I don't want to end up with joint problems I didn't have to begin with, for the sake of appearances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Notch Barre routine!","review":"This is a top notch barre routine! Andrea is a terrific instructor. She is clear, precise and non-irritating! The entire workout is great. The warm-up, upper body, barre-for legs and seat, abs and stretch are all the perfect amount of time for each area worked and the exercises she chooses hit all the muscles you want to work to full exhaustion. I absolutely loved it and this workout is one of my Best purchases in a long time! The set is beautiful and the music is good too.Thanks Andrea!Tracy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great All-Over Toner!","review":"When I first heard of these ballet workouts I shy-ed away on account of my lack of coordination. However, I decided to give this one a try after seeing a few trial clips online. I really like that it is low impact which is great for anyone with joint issues. I also like that it's right to the point: hits the thighs, hips, butt, and abs right away. It's also not time consuming if you break up the segments such as doing the total body three days a week and the arms and abs two days a week. I use this routine along with a steady jogging/walking regimen as well. You also don't have to be coordinated. It may take a few tries at first with some moves, but if a clutz like me can get it, anyone can!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dance fun","review":"This DVD provides \\"dance type\\" exercise for those who enjoy that. Good direction is given for the steps and exercises, but it gets very fast to provide cardio and I am doing it at my own pace, slower. I feel I can work up to the faster pace, but the exercises are still good done slowly. I like the format with a warm-up, a cool down and the three options of exercises for upper body, leg and hips (barre), and core. It makes it possible to do a workout that includes the whole body or to choose to do one section at a time. Having done ballet growing up, these exercises are fun for me and helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different style, but good!","review":"This one took me a few times to get used to its quick pace. Once I did the routine a few times, I could then begin to anticipate the next move. If you look at my other reviews for barre related videos, the ones with 5 stars are the ones in which are perfect (for me personally) due to both the instuctor's explanation and overall style.On a more positive note, this exercise routine does have a few new ballet/other moves that are not on other barre/ballet DVD'S, and that is a plus for me!This will be one of those exercise DVD's I will have to be in the mood for; still, it's a decent workout!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Andrea","review":"Disappointed. I dont like giving negative reviews, but this was not what it was sold to be. The music didnt match and felt very 90s aerobic video. The moves were OK but not the \\"lean and Chiseling\\" results that it claimed. I have probably done around 100 videos and DVD's over my life time, and I would list this one near the bottom. Sorry Andrea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stretch and workout time","review":"This product is well laid out and and you feel stretched and vibrant after doing the exercise dvd. You can do it in sections or all of it and still feel like you have had a good workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, not too difficult","review":"This is a great lower body workout, I felt like it started out a bit slow, but my legs were sore the next day, so it must have worked! I like that it's different, with the ballet focus, than typical work out and aerobic videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good direction","review":"The barre segment of this dvd was really hard to follow. I had to pause multiple times to figure out how she did a move before I could begin. I feel you could also injure your knees easily with this workout. She goes too fast between moves without proper direction. I really liked the arm segment and the ab portion was fun, but the poor direction kills this video for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD sound is 1 second off from video.","review":"So when she's instructing, her moving lips is 1 second ahead of hearing her instructions. Not a bad video in terms of exercise, but when you're following her direction, you can't help but notice this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Quite simply, it is boring. I also find the instructor a bit annoying, but that's my problem! I'll dust it off every now and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I haven't lost weight yet.","review":"I have been exercising to this dvd for the last month. I still have not lost weight. Very disappointed.

However, to my great dismay there are many quick and deep knee bends that left me, an active person in my thirties, in agony. I am trading this in for an Amazon $5.00 gift card tonight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts out Fast with Lots of Cardio","review":"This routine is not for me. I previously purchased (and love) Barre3 with Sadie Lincoln which is a compbination of pilates, yoga and ballet. I thought Xtend Barre: Lean & Chiseled would be a variation of this; it is not. It is very fast paced with a lot of cardio right from the very beginning of the routine. No instruction on range of motion or body positioning. If you're not up to that kind of strenuous speed, or not familiar with the correct moves, it seems to me that you could injure yourself pretty quickly. This routine would just be another dust collector for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout","review":"This was my first try at barre/ballet-inspired workouts and this DVD broke down the movements in an easy manner. The segments are quick and the workout just flies by, so you don't even feel as if you're working out. And, Andrea Rogers is a really engaging instructor. Recommend this DVD highly!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!!","review":"This is a great DVD, it is nice to switch things up from the regular gym workouts.

I used to dance ballet and really missed how my body looked while doing so.My work has prevented me from going to ballet class and this workout works my *dance muscles* exactly what I wanted to getthat long lean dancer body back!Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great workout","review":"xtend barre is a great full body workout that gets to work out all parts of my body. I feel the effects on my upper body, legs and abs. it also has a great physical component so you get a lot of cardio in. the instructor does a nice job of giving explanations of dance terminology, but works the references in slowly throughout the workout so that it isnt too hard for a someone without a dance background, like myself, to follow. she also has two others with her doing the routines in either advanced or modified versions, the instruction is clear and motivational without being annoying. i use this routine throughout the week in my rotation and definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for workout for those wanting change from pilates","review":"I really like how this dvd allows you to select just the section you want to work out such as upper body vs. core. The entire workout took about 45 min skipping the introduction and cool down. The ballet movements are great and its faster pace than boring pilates. I use this in addition to my 30 day Shed with Jillian Michaels. I think combining these two dvds along with a monday to friday calorie counting helped me drop from 120 to 107 in a matter of 2-3 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was dripping sweat....","review":"When done correctly this is a great workout. I say correctly because if I had not taken previous dance classes (just some adult ballet) and known the correct placement of knees, hips etc...I don't think it would have affected me as much. I have friends that have never danced and it did make them sore but I didn't see them dripping sweat like me..haha...My only negative is that having taken some dance some of the movements are a little fast. I prefer to take them a little slower and do them correctly than speed them up just to say I kept up with her pace. Overall I think this is a great workout even if you have never taken dance before...especially if you aren't used to all those releves and arabesques!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fun workout!","review":"This was a wonderful, satisfying workout! It may have been a little fast-paced with too little breathing time for a Pilates lover like me, but I didn't mind... I can always add the breathing and move slower. If you are stuck in one type of workout and need a change, I found this one to be challenging! But don't worry, there's one woman in the workout who does the less strenuous version, which I had to do at times! Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout","review":"Very enjoyable total body workout. The separate sections for arms, abs, and legs are very effective. It doesn't feel too hard as you are going through it but it gets my heart rate up and I'm usually a little sore the next day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Xtend Barre: Lean & Chiseled","review":"Excellent workout DVD!

Huge waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries to include everything and doesn't cut it","review":"I was looking for a ballet type workout, but the problem with this is that it tries to include a cardio section and other things.

The majority of the work is merely a brief summary of the war on the Eastern front 1941-45. Any detailed descriptions of Zhukov and his life are confined to his early years leading up the Russian Revolution of 1917. There is no insight into his methods of waging war, his mind, his strategies or what moulded his thinking on waging war. There is not even reasoned assessment of Zhukov the soldier at the end of the book. At times one wonders whether this is a biography or merely another potted history of the war on the Eastern Front. There are passing references to greater works by John Ericson and William Spahr amongst others. You will find nothing new or enlightning here. Rather read, Otto Preston Chaney or William Spahr."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a good editor","review":"Picked this book up thinking it would be a sort of refresher on the Eastern Front. Unfortunately the writing is rather poor, leaving this reviewer utterly confused as to what the late Mr. Colvin was trying to say. The maps are also terribly inadequate with many of the place names mentioned in the text no where to be seen. With all due respect to the author(who died shortly after finishing this work and which may account for its many shortcomings), if studying the Russo-German War is a pastime of yours, you would be better off looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent bargain, well worth the money!","review":"This is an excellent neck machine without the big price tag of a professional or gym machine.

With each book it seems Mosely taps into a fresh raw barrel of emotions about race, the sexes, and the violence that human beings are capable of. But beyond the mystery, which here involves Easy helping to find a missing man who has some incriminating documents, the real appeal of the books to me are his personal relationships with his children and girlfriend Bonnie.

What I perceive in this cd is techno effects for their own sake, wild, bangy drumming that seems ultimately aimless, dissonant jazz effects that worked for Coltrane but seem pretentious in this pop music context, and the kind of pretentious lyrical aggressiveness that has made alternative rock music a bore in recent years. There is some inventiveness here, and people who like their music noisy and loud will like some of this, but I found it disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"where's the voices that are prmoised??","review":"I have been listeing to MBM since i was about 15, back in 91. I am a huge fam of 99% and satyricon, I am not however into their electronic music without vocals. I pretty much gave up on them b/c they abandoned the vocals, which is what made them industrial, which is what they were considered back then. I am not sure what you would call their music now, but when i herd of this album i got really excited that jack dangers would go back to adding vocals to the music. what a dissapointment, out of 15 songs, only 3 have vocals and it is not his usual rap style vocals. so if you see the title and think 99% or satyricon, dont be fooled, you will not like this CD.

Both of us were held captivated by this unusual music.The first word that comes to mind in regards to this opera is LUSH. The orchestration is full and inventive. The vocal writing is straight out of Puccini, colored by Copland and the Latin melodies of South America.While both operas are very good, this ones clearly is a leap ahead of it's sibling \\"Rappacini's Daughter\\". The pace is more flowing, the contour more smooth, and the performing forces much more comfortable in the opera medium.You cannot go wrong with this recording, and I anxiously await Catan's next masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous Music!","review":"I saw this opera four times when it premiered in Los Angeles and loved every minute of it.

It had not been torn before.\\" Or, \\"...farther than the eye could see. They were beyond eyeshot\\".Does the author think that unless he is redundant with his descriptions, driving his meaning into the ground, that no one will get it?It was difficult to even enjoy this so-called \\"wild ride of a story\\", when one is so distracted by the lame descriptions of being naked.

It arrived and there were many splinters sticking out on the inside - fortunately I discovered them when one stuck my finger instead of my young one's finger. Also, the design is unsatisfactory - when it is turned on its side to put shapes into their slots, the top of the sorter falls off. I have called on two separate occasions and spoke to customer service people that said they would call me back with a plan of action. They never did. This has caused me to lose a lot of faith in Melissa and Doug toys. The idea of the toy is still very good - sorting the shapes is a great learning skill.

The blocks aren't very smooth and don't feel great in the hand like Plan's do. And more isn't necessarily better. There are lots of shapes here, but our child likes the box better than sorting, while she loves to sort with the Plan sorter. I'd recommend the simpler, elegant Plan sorter over this one.

First, it has very sharp corners and the wood is flimsy. I don't feel comfortable with my toddler playing with this-- too worried he will hurt himself. We have lots of wooden toys, and they all have rounded corners and a soft finish. But this shape sorter is rough and not well made. The wood is thin and cheap.

Not too much of an issue (right now anyway) because my kid is of an age where she just likes to remove the shapes from the box and not put them back. What concerns me the most though are the splinters. Mine has splinters of a good enough size that they could be a choking hazard on in addition to \\"just\\" poking into skin.

We purchased one that looks EXACTLY like the one pictured but the brand was Imaginarium. It's a great classic toy that my 19-month-old loves and can pretty much complete independently. However, the one we bought has a removable side that merely sits in place. Obviously that is a terrible design decision, because when you rotate the cube to reach the other sides, the top falls off, spilling the contents. I had to glue some magnetic strips on it to hold it in place while my daughter plays. There is an almost identical toy (often pictured interchangeably with the ones shown as Melissa & Doug) which has a slide-in-place closing side. That seems like a MUCH better idea!

The shapes are sturdy and chunky, just like they should be, but the box is not sturdy at all. The base of the box split at the seams after three days of barely playing with it. The top slides off way too easily so when my daughter turns it around/upside down to find the right side for the shape, it often slides opens and spills everything out, which is frustrating for both of us. Also, it's pretty challenging for my 22 month-old. There are absolutely no clues to help find the right hole like other shape sorters have, such as color coding or texture on the box. My daughter is basically uninterested in playing with it and I wouldn't buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly constructed","review":"I really can't imagine how this toy was tested! The lid does not secure onto the box, and falls off every time the box is turned, and if you don't turn the box then it fills up so that there is no space to insert the shapes. Additionally some holes allow other shapes to pass through them. A very poor choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed Shape Sorter","review":"We bought this for our 19 month old because we love the idea of well made wood toys, and she needed a good shape sorter.This seems to be both of those at first glance. However, when you watch how the kids use this, you realize that they are not learning much. Most of the shapes fit through the hole corresponding to another shape. For instance, the long triangle slides easily through the circle's hole.Perhaps an older child that knows that you only score points when you play by the rules would be able to use this as intended. Otherwise, my child uses the basic Fisher Price plastic shape sorter (4 shapes, each goes in only if placed in the right hole). That taught her what shape sorters are meant to, and she's very good at it!This toy ends up being quite confusing; so other than the colorful, well-made pieces being used for parent-child play and instruction (or as projectiles), the toy ends up rather neglected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tossed shortly after purchase","review":"This item was purchased for a 1 1/2 yr old.

My daughter has trouble with the sliding part and also not all the sides have shape holes either, only the top and three sides.

The top just slides open the second you rotate it, so there's no game or fun in making all the shapes go in for my kids. Poorly executed and attractive only superficially. M & D is not a very good toy brand is my conclusion although so ubiquitous still end up with their stuff. Some good puzzles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good, but poor design for actual use","review":"I commend Melissa and Doug for the nice variety of shapes this cube offers as well as its classic wooden toy appearance, but that being said, actual use of this cube is cumbersome and faulty. A bit too heavy for tiny hands to turn and look for the appropriate hole, it also becomes frustrating when the lid falls off (no latch or hinge to keep it on) or it is almost full with blocks and you are trying to push in one of the shapes in the lower portion of the cube and it won't go in because there are blocks inside sitting on the bottom. If the lid latched, you could turn the sides facing up and easily insert the shapes, but not so. I sold my daughter's on ebay and got her the classic plastic Playskool one that has a snap lid and that is lighter weight so she can turn and tumble, looking for the right hole for the shape she has."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Well Designed","review":"I bought this toy because my daughter is really into sorting shapes right now. She has several shape sorters that work really well. This one, however, is not well designed. First of all, the lid cannot be fastened to stay down. When your child needs to turn it over to put in the different shapes they all fall out. Secondly, once you have a couple of shapes in the box they block the way for the others to go in. I have always loved Melissa and Doug toys up to this point but I would love to get my money back for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not what a two year old looks for","review":"My son got this for his second birthday. He loves to sort shapes. He doesn't like this toy - because the lid falls off! He plays endlessly with the Tupperware shape sorter blue and red ball at a friend's house - he can pick it up and look all around for the right spot for his piece. You can't do that with this box, so we'll be getting him the Tupperware one for Christmas!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"I agree with the last reviewer...the lid does not lock down-I have it collecting dust on the shelf- I like the idea that it was wood and it is made to last but they should have put a locking lid to keep the shapes in all one piece and so the child can pick up the box with out having the lid fall off."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad","review":"I wish I could have given this item 0 stars...what a waste of money. The lid doesn't stay on, the pieces fit in multiple spots there are enough great shape sorters out there that you don't need to buy this one"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design for this classic toy.","review":"I really wanted to love this toy. It is wooden with so many shapes I thought it would keep my girl entertained and encourage self-confidence. The shape sorter lid has the shape cut outs and comes off completely. You can't turn the piece around to use other sides without it falling off. She takes the lid off and doesn't know to try to put shapes through it. It would have been much better to have a hole with a latch on the solid bottom to get the pieces out. I have to tape the lid on it get her to play with it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been a little better","review":"I got these for my little one for Christmas and was a little unhappy with the craftsmanship.

They are no longer interested in figuring out the shapes; they only want to lift off the lid and throw the blocks in it! The lid doesn't lock in or anything.Basically, don't waste your money on this one; there are better ones out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"not great","review":"there are blocks that are almost the same shape as others; it would be difficult for a young toddler to figure this out. heck, it takes me a minute to do it. the corners are not rounded, so there are sharp wood corners!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for older children","review":"I thought my twins would love this shape sorter because they love their plastic one. Since it has so many shapes I thought it would be a lot more useful than the plastic one that only has four. Here's a tip, make sure your chid is older than 3 before using this toy. Younger ones want to put the pieces and the lid in their mouth. My daughter got a splinter in her gums from chewing on the lid. Also, it's really hard for toddlers. The shapes are poorly cut so it's not obvious that a parallelogram hole should fit the awkward looking chunk that is supposed to be a 3D parallelogram."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design and construction","review":"This cube is badly designed - the shapes are too similar so it is very difficult for my 20 month old to find the right slot. In addition, other shape sorters use color coding on the cube to help find the right slot, this one doesn't. The lid won't stay on, it slides off when the box is turned over. As it has to slide on my toddler (who adores putting lids on and off boxes) can't put it on himself and gets very frustrated. It is made of wood, but it is cheap MDF and poorly constructed. There are much better shape sorters on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea..poorly designed","review":"When I had this on our wish list, there were no reviews written about it. When we received it as a Christmas present, we were excited to let our daughter play with it. As soon as we opened it, we couldn't figure out why the lid didn't stay on. You can't turn it without all the blocks falling out! Our daughter still likes to play with it, but it's frustrating for adults because of the terrible design. True, there also some holes that most of the blocks fit through regardless of their shape! I WOULD NOT purchase this...there are many superior products on the market!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect playmate!","review":"We purchased three of Melissa & Doug's toys for our one year old and he loves them. He pulls them out of the toy chest and plays with them all the time. We make it a family event and play with him also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed by Melissa & Doug","review":"The cube is placed in a box and wrapped with heat shrink plastic. I can see some paints were already come off from the edges from some shapes. I guess they come off because they are rolling inside the box and those edge positions unavoidably damaged during delivery. Of course there is a chance some of those paints might get into your child's mouth when they're playing with them. Why M & D covered the shapes with a layer of paint and not dye the shapes?My son put his finger into one of the shape hole, a piece of wood nearly chipped off from the edge of the hole when he pulled his finger out. It created a sharp edge right the way. Where is the quality control? How come the toy is child safe? Besides returning the cube, what else we can do? It is lucky that I was there when my son start playing with his new toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"breaks easily","review":"On christmas morning my 2yr old opened this and within one hour had completely broken the lid. Also as he attempted to get shapes into the cube pieces of wood chipped off. Which can be a choking hazard or a splinter hazard. I went with this one because i thought would would be more durable, it is not the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design","review":"The square hole and rectangle hole allows all other shapes to pass through. Young children will think that all shapes fit in squares. Both of my children are not being challenged for they can just put all of the pieces into one hole alone. What is this teaching children? The wrong lesson! Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Melissa & Doug toys, but this is a big disappointment","review":"I ditto the majority of the reviews of this toy. Although I really like most of the Melissa & Doug toys, I cannot figure out how this one is still on the market...Again, the fact that the lid will not stay on makes the toy nearly useless. The child cannot turn the cube in any direction to find the proper hole for the shape,and if she does, the top falls off or the block falls out. What is the point? It becomes just another box to keep blocks in.My 21 month old daughter simply takes the blocks and dumps them in other containers, it is completely useless as a shape sorter...I have to say it was a big waste of money, unlike the other toys by this manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing for sorting intentions","review":"This toy just sets a kid up to fail. So many great shapes, but so useless for all the reasons already stated--the top comes right off and the pieces fall out as you turn the box. My 20 month old son does enjoy stacking the shapes. I have now put the box away so he doesn't get frustrated at not succeeding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flaking Paint!","review":"I ordered this shape sorter for two reasons. There are many more shapes than in most of the others that I've looked at, and I like wooden toys. My grandson enjoyed playing with the shapes; however, after having this toy for a few months, the paint began to flake off. His parents noticed the flakes of paint on his face and threw the toy away. I am concerned about the safety of such a toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who thought of this ridiculous toy?","review":"The lid comes off immediately. We thought it was defective so we brought it back to Toys R Us and got a new one but that is the way it is designed. What kid could or would want to hold the lid the entire time they are playing with the toy to make sure it doesn't come off. Also, our son would just put the shapes in the open side once the lid fell off or he'd get upset that everything he put into the shape sorter fell out.I cannot imagine anyone tested this product. Toys R Us makes a wooden shape sorter that is much more environmentally friendly and no danger of lead. That one has a side that slides off and it's easy enough for a 2 year old to figure out but not so easy that it falls off. That one was a much better idea. What were Melissa and Doug thinking here.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"more difficult than it looks","review":"I picked up one of these shape sorters for my son, who loves puzzles, when he was two. He definitely was interested in it but more often than not \\"cheated\\" by putting a piece in the wrong hole by twisting it, or opening the top and dropping it in. His occupational therapist said this puzzle is far more difficult than it looks because of the many surfaces on each block. We put a sticker on one of the surfaces that should face out when you position the block properly and that helped my son figure out how to put the blocks in the right way. Still, I think they should have thought out the design a bit more."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Missed The Point","review":"Very Cute.Doesn't work.My son puts any shape he wants into any hole which defeats the purpose of the toy. The best shape sorter I had was a clear bucket with 4 basic shapes on the top - I gave it away but wish I could find that one again for my 2nd child. I'm giving this toy away too though I feel badly about offering a toy that does not work as it is intended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had a ER visit with this toy :(","review":"I bought this toy for my 12 month daughter. After a couple months, the star shape was broken in one of the corners and we didn't notice. We took our eyes off her for a minute, she took a bite of the broken part one unfortunate day. The wood splinters were in her mouth. We took most of them out of her mouth but a couple she has already swalloed. The wood splinters are sharp enough to hurt her throat but fortunately she was ok. When we called the pediatrician, she recommended to go to emergency. The wood peices are not visible in the x-ray. So we had to moniter her poop for any traces of blood. But she was fine. So please do not buy this for small toddlers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well this is a good makeshift shape sorter...","review":"my kid however, lost the lid to it within a couple days and then it's pretty much a glorified basket!To each their own!"},{"rating":"2","title":"starts off strong ...","review":"...and putters a bit.

Which is how this book opens.Our love affair hit a good stride towards the middle; we were looking to the future and I felt we had really bonded. But I began becoming a bit bored with our relationship, began sneaking in other books behind the Angel's back. We carried on our romance as before but we both knew something had died.

Unfortunately, I'm the type of reader who doesn't put down a book until I've read it entirely. While reading this book I found myself despising the writer for wasting my time. It happens to be the worst book I ever read. Pretty much anyone with motivation can sit down and write a book but not everyone has something worthwhile to say. This book apparently was written by a professional writer that was more interested in filling up a page and selling it than saying something worthwhile, something meaningful, something from the heart.

The episodes are of good quality and faithful to it's era. However The opening sequence is different. It appears during the remastering process they superimposed a new logo that is digitized. It is noticably different and sloppy a bit. Also the same thing was done with the ending credits. New Credits were digitized over what appears to be a copy of the animation at the end. The animation sequence at the end looks like a 3rd or 4th generation copy. My feeling is that they lost the originals for this. Also the Trans Lux original logo in the beginning is absent as well.Still at this price it is worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blast from the past","review":"OK, so the animation isn't exactly stellar and the plots are kind of silly. But I remember watching these things as a kid and they really bring back the happy memories! If you grew up on these like I did, you're in for a treat! If not, this DVD may not be for you. But you probably wouldn't be looking at this if you weren't already into Speed!As for the DVD itself, I have had some problems. I have a couple of players. My older Toshiba (which is usually picky) plays it fine, but my Apex (which normally plays ANYTHING without problem) doesn't. It's like it's in some kind of \\"single frame\\" mode, playing about one frame every couple of seconds and no sound. Haven't tried it on my PCs."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY!!

That literally blew me away.Now I agree with some reviewers that the special features are God awful. But I'm not as much a special feature person as some are. And they did stretch a little too much on one DVD. I don't know if it's just my disc but I found a point or two with some digital clicking. This is not a reason not to buy this though. The color and sharpness will amaze you. I'm not sure if this is just a trial run to put out a whole box set or what but for how much is on one disc, it's well worth it.

But it's pretty [bad] that they changed the graphics for the opening, and even [worse]that some of the episodes are recorded at the wrong speed -- they play a little fast (you can tell because the voices on those episodes are higher pitched, as is the theme song). That's bad.Also bad is the misspelling of Jack Grimes' name as one of the voices. On the videotapes, it is correctly spelled Grimes; on the DVD it is Crimes. That, along with the fast playback on some of the episodes shows that little care was used in putting this DVD together. Family Home Entertainment should be ashamed.

This DVD is a great way to re-introduce yourself or your children to this great series. I wish and hope that more episodes will become available.

The remastered prints are great. The extra content that explains how fast they had to produce the American versions is amazing. A theme song recorded in one day.

He was a faithful, inspiring, and courageous pastor. No doubt the stories he told were deeply moving to his parishioners. But IMO they are not very useful to pastors today.

To feature the names of great bands and words from their songs in such an abysmal book is sad. This was easily one of the most poorly written and poorly concieved books I have ever read.

If you're reading books looking for something to identify with then THIS is your book.This book was excellent, full of at least one or two characters that anybody could identify with. It's been a long time since I read this book, but all I know is that when I read this book, I found it to be the most vivid book I'd read in a long while... the text reads almost like you're watching a movie.But what else can I say?

From a pure storytelling point of view it lacks everything one learns about in 5th grade composition class. Content-wise, it is a joke. (Case in point: Jeff Gomez seems to be the only person in the western hemisphere who is unaware that a VW Bug's engine is in the REAR of the vehicle.) Just reading the first sentence of each chapter, anyone could guess the ultimate outcome of that particular \\"plot-lette,\\" since Mr. Gomez's cliche-meter was apparently out of order when he wrote this uninspired, insipid fleck of drivel. One wonders how he was engaged to write a sequel to this! And anyone who has to drop the names of that many indie bands in one book is obviously shooting their wad all at once. This will go down as my pick for the least-literate, worst-written piece of writing of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Similar To A Train Wreck","review":"Unfortunately the topics approached in the book are things that I have in common in my life. I have been a musician, an owner and producer of a very independent record label, employee of a record store, and a fan. The only one of those subjects Jeff Gomez seems to have in common is the fan. Every perspective of his writing is from the view of a fan who has never even remotely lived the experience, but only thinks he relates because he likes a bands songs. If he had written a book about being a a very excited fan I would have been more interested. The only characters that seem even slightly tolerable are the two guys trying to start a zine, probably because that's the only thing in the book Gomez has any experience at.The whole experience was like witnessing a train wreck, I wanted to stop but I just couldn't look away."},{"rating":"1","title":"But why did I read the whole thing?","review":"I barely made it through the first chapter of this book a year or so ago, noticing the same things everyone else has (shallowest characters ever, needless posturing). Then I forgot all about it. However, I recently picked it up again 'cause it was there. The first thing I realized is that there were way too many lame people to keep track of. If Gomez would have chosen to dedicate some character development to four or five people instead of spreading himself too thin, then maybe I would have found these people more intriguing. In his defense, I did read the whole thing. And there were the rare occasional cultural references that clicked; unfortunately, they were overshadowed by the multitude of lame ones. It's sort of sad that the only thing I come away with after reading this novel is that you don't have to be a genius writer to land a book deal. I guess that's not a terrible lesson to learn. I won't be buying the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel","review":"What a waste of a promising storyline. I, like many other twenty-somethings with dead-end jobs and too much education, can, in theory, idetify very strongly with Gomez's characters.

But about 10 minutes after my son started playing with it, he burst into tears as he had gotten a huge splinter in his finger. I took a closer look, and it is quite obvious that when the holes were drilled in the tool box, they were drilled too fast -- the inside of each hole was broken out like it had been punched through, and there were up to 1/8 inch slivers of wood that could easily break off of the product. The wooden bolts also have some drill issues -- the paint is chipped around the holes (it was clearly drilled after painting).

The screws are untouchable, and we have had to throw a lot of them away because the splinters are so bad after having been threaded a few times in the holes. Not at all impressed with this tool kit.

A true disappointment. The whole series is poorly conceived, with no thought given to compatibility between - and therefore expansion of - sets. Worse yet, quality is poor: threads on screws tend to chip or erode very easily during use, leaving saw dust all over the play area.

You must use your hands to screw the bolt onto the head of the screwdriver. This toy is more for sorting colors & shapes. I was very disappointed at this Melissa & Doug product.

As I put the second and third shelves on, the first one pops out. I am not looking forward to the dividers (I did try the dividers on the first shelf when I put it in, and did have to bend everthing to get them on -- but they promptly popped off when I tried to add the second shelf (because I was having to bend everything to get that shelf in . . . ).I also (like some others)did not realize just how HUGE this thing is. It will not fit into most people's pantries (it is too wide AND too tall for average pantry use).All in all, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.

It seemed sturdy enough when I first got it, and it came together in about a minute flat, but I've yet to fill it up entirely, and it's already starting to bend in the center of the top two racks. I'm not super excited about that development but we'll see how it holds up. Initially I was going to order a second one but now I think I'll do some more shopping around.

I had to tape the separators in place to stop them from moving. for smaller cans like tomato paste they tilt and get stuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work out","review":"Lucky to all the other reviewers who received a good product. I hoped mine would work out. The material on the rack is sound. However, the design is flawed. Upon assembly, the can dividers stayed in place on the top rack but was LOOSE on the middle and lower rack; it would not stay in place to be considered a divider for cans, which are heavy.

At first I was concerned about how sturdy it would be, but it works well. The bars that separate the rows of cans are also a nice feature.Make sure you check the size of the cabinet where you would like to place this rack. It is bigger than expected and may be hard to fit into some cabinets. I was able to place it in the bottom of my pantry and I love it there.

The wiring is quite hard to bend and it becomes an issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"I like this product. It allows me to organize cans of one product in the same place so I know when I'm running low. In the past, I thought for sure I had something but had trouble locating it only to find it at a later date when I didn't need it. This helps a lot. It does take up a lot of space and needs a firm shelf to rest on. The only way it could be more beneficial is if the racks pulled out. I use a row for various cans of fruit. It keeps the cans of fruit together but I have to take them all out to see if I have a pineapple or orange segments in the bunch. It can't be beat for multiple cans of the same product though. I would highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent pellets!","review":"I get incredible accuracy from these out of my Webley & Scott Vulcan springer.

I have not seen them yet as they have not been released.For all new items you must be over at least level 130 to get to the new island, except a few dungeons camped by people macroing.All patchs that have come out since release are aimed toward extream high levels. Or melee. Case in point GW quest last month. No low level could kill a pumpkin lord. The buffer was camped by a level 210 to get the goodies. This month content is all mage resistant if you are under level 150. The one new orb intrduced into the game is buged. The so called event you had to be over level 100 to attend.I have been waiting since release for a answer from their tech support on migrating problems with 2 of my accounts.

The idea of book characters having lives beyond the story in which they live is nicely done and I very much like that Princess Sylvie is strong and thinks outside the written confines of her part in the story. Others have noted that most of the characters are flat and not well developed. In my view, that is one of the story's themes. They are underdeveloped, because they cannot think beyond the lines written for them. Princess Sylvie can, which makes her unique. Overall, a very good book and I very much recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The great good thing\\"","review":"When i read the first paragraph of the great good thing ,i didnt quite understand,but when i really got into the book i began to understand the book .

Yet, what if the characters were alive, and carried on lives until the next reader opened their story? That's the idea of this tale of Sylvie, a princess who is starting to grow weary of her almost forgotten story. Sylvie ends up being able to escape the book and walk into the newest reader's dreams. The new reader happens to be the granddaughter of the very first reader of the book. However, I found the story to be utterly confusing, boring, and lacking details that could really make it interesting.

Sylvie's efforts take her from the pages of her book to the mind and dreams of a reader, opening up whole new vistas of plot twists and peril. The treatment of literary characters is much more sentimental than that in, for example, the Thursday Next novels, but it's undeniably sweet in its own way. The narrative is simple and told in a voice reminiscent more of fairy tales than of novels.Not compelling, but definitely a worthy-while read, especially for those--like me--who love books and have a sentimental streak the size of an interstate highway."},{"rating":"2","title":"A reminder to adults to keep family history alive","review":"Other reviews will tell you the plot, but to ME, this book addressed the genealogist in me, and is about how important it is to keep family stories alive in the telling, and in print. This book is a look at how quickly a story disappears from memory, and a physical book is needed to pass on a story accurately; in the same way, our family histories are lost to us so quickly, within just a generation or two, and we need to write them down in order to pass these stories to descendants with assurance, or we will all be forgotten. Towards the end of \\"The Great Good Thing\\", I was intrigued with the idea that the Author of our story is God, we are the Writers, and we must write our family's stories.My opinion is that this book is most interesting to older teens and adults as a super-quick-and-easy, and thought provoking read.

She just loves them. She also recieved some of the old-fashioned \\"carved\\" blocks with the letters cut into them. Unlike these, she quickly chewed the paint off of some of the old-fashoined blocks. She has chomped on these pretty hard and they seem to put up with it with little damage. She bangs them together, chews on them and occationally stacks them. Though they are recommended for older children, i think we made a nice choice as she will be able to play with these for years in many different ways as her skills develop. Also, they are bigger than the standard blocks, so i dont worry about anything and she should be able to manipulate them a little earlier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and Educational","review":"My daughter is one and a half, and she's had these blocks for about a year now, but only now is she really playing with them and identifying the little pictures. Some pictures are a little obscure, but all the basic animals and objects seem to be covered. I'm very pleased with how smooth the blocks are, and how well they are holding up. I feel they will really help my daughter to learn her letters, both in upper and lower case. My only problem is with the tray. It only holds the blocks if you keep it completely flat (as if a toddler can transport anything while keeping it level). I also don't like its sharp edges. My daughter went through a phase where she liked dumping the blocks out and then waving the tray around. Now the tray is stored out of reach and the blocks are stored in a small plastic bin."},{"rating":"2","title":"manufacture leaves something to be desired","review":"I love Melissa and Doug products with nearly religious fervor, but these blocks were a little disappointing. The pictures are lovely, the size is good, the weight is easy for kids to manipulate, and they stack and fall down again like all good blocks should. As for flaws, several blocks in my set (5 or so) came only partially finished, one with a deep gouge in one side. The corners are also brutally sharp (these are perfect cubes), not sanded down. I'm a big girl and know where to find my spray-on varnish, sandpaper, and a marker to add lines (as orientation cues) to W and M and p/d/b/q, but still... it would have been nice for these to have been ready to play from the get-go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melissa & Doug 26-piece Wooden ABC Picture Blocks in a Wooden Storage Tray","review":"I bought this toy in 2003, for my son who was 2 years old at the time. This was a toy, I felt, that could be used for a long period of time, and it sure did. At first, it was just used as a block type of toy, with most of the blocks, placed in his mouth, more than actually used as building blocks, and he enjoyed looking at the pictures, on the sides of the blocks, which as he grew up, learned that each picture in the block, started with the letter that was on the block. This is a very durable toy, as I still use it, when guests bring over their children, I can always take out these blocks. They just have to be washed with soap and water, so germs cannot be transmitted over time.

Anyone who is interested in the dark side of the ambient movement, especially fans of early Tangerine Dream and Klaus Schulze, should get this album. There is a somewhat self-indulgent but still interesting essay also included in the liner notes. Though Spooky does proclaim himself a \\"music futurist,\\" the tag line is surprisingly true.

That said, there are several stand-out tracks that have become personal faves: the smokey film-noir jazzish \\"Nihilismus Dub\\"; \\"Galactic Funk\\" which has a nasty 1970s inspired funk groove; and \\"Juba\\", an African-inspired piece sandwiched in between some organ playing that sounds fit for a baseball game; and \\"the terran invasion...\\", which has a distinctly Eno-esque quality supported by a reggae bassline. Well-worth the price of admission. Check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of preservatives!","review":"I need raspberry purée or a similar substitute for use in my salad dressing recipe, which actually uses very healthy ingredients. The Lyons dessert sauce has high fructose corn syrup as it's primary ingredient. This tastes like it has a lot of preservatives. Sometimes it's true that you get what you pay for....a bottle of junk. I am going to look for a healthier alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, one of my favorite comps.","review":"This disc works well as an introduction to all of the artists contained thereon, but it works even better as a cohesive listening experience in itself. This is more \\"sound architecture\\" than \\"music\\", the sounds are non-linear, three-dimensional, sometimes taking you on a journey to parts unknown, sometimes leaving you stationary but building a complete environment around you. Very highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Russ Whitney is an uneducated redneck from Florida where he bought some \\"fixers\\" and made some money. Then he got the bright idea that he would hype the public into buying his books and tapes from TV ads. Then, he takes his show on the road around the country selling the dream to people who not only can't afford a home but can't afford his material but buy it anyway. What a snake oil salesman. He should be in jail. I didn't buy this book but looked through it at a library. If you want to make money in real estate find the worse property in the best neighborhood, fix it up doing most of the work yourself, then sell it for a profit. There, you've saved yourself $16."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't use it.","review":"I bought this from Canada. I was naive enough to think the contents applied here. But it deals with US laws and real estate only. Therefore it should not have been made available to non US citizens, OR should have been labelled as \\"For US market only\\" or words to that effect. Very likely to be fine if you are a US citizen though. But if you're not American, beware! With transportation, that's over $40 wasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"This stuff really works!! If you do what it says.","review":"This book is excellent. Russ Whitney has PROVED himself. In this book he describes how you need to care about others, not just yourself when investing. You can sense his heart as he teaches you step by step to success. Follow in his footsteps and you WILL be wealthy. I have done it, and IT WORKS! Buy his book, read it, do what it says, and don't let the fears and negative people stop you, or you will regret it. I am also attending Russ's seminars, and the cost of the seminars are well worth it! One deal will pay for all of the seminars combined. It only takes 2 years to be wealthy if you follow his steps. I recommend this book, as well as all his previous books, I have read many. Don't listen to all the negative people, they only want to stop you to your success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop playing around... change your life now!","review":"This book is for the person willing to change their life. It is very motivational, educational and most importantly inspiring. Russ Whitney took the time to teach the importance of changing your mindset to become more open to becoming rich through his techniques in real estate investments. I have many books on becoming a millionaire and financially independent and this one is the best I've read so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is off the hook","review":"If your a bay fan or if you don't know about the bay peep this album out and it'll get you hooked.

Lots of beautiful photos put together in a lovely presentation. I was disappointed however, in the content that clearly focused on the Hollywood idea of Hawaiian hula and all the commercial aspects of the art. Not a serious study of hula, as I expected it to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Fruit Lifesavers","review":"These gummies were soft, chewy and almost bursting with flavor which reminded me very much of the original Fruit Lifesavers, but with a juicy, slightly tart tang. I'm not overly fond of Lifesavers, so these gummies aren't really to my liking, but folks who enjoy Fruit Lifesavers will LOVE these! I gave these 5 stars because I know my taste doesn't follow the main stream and I'm not going to bad mouth a good product just because it isn't to my taste.The shapes of these gummies were definitely interesting, too. One reminded me of a werewolf or sasquatch type critter, there were dinosaurs, lizards, something that looked like a pacifier, coke bottles...definitely fun shapes to put a few in a child's snack pack without going completely overboard on the sugar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stale","review":"I was so looking forward to this item as I grew up eating it when I lived in Germany.

My boyfriend got me both books in 2005 as a gift. Both of his books was autographed to me personally; however, someone sole one of them. I'm searching today to buy another copy after I've read this book;I would still enjoy reading it again. I wish he came out with another book to be a part 3...?From my memory:It was good hands down I really like readying religion-history, art-history, african american-history, and when I got this it opened my fun book back;-) Sadly, I haven't found another that can be so realistic! any recommendation....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seeing the Truth","review":"This book opened my eyes to the harsh streets of Baltimore. Living in West Baltimore myself, I was unaware of the difficult journeys of our young black men. I thank the writer for putting the truth out there to those like myself who did not know or experience the reality of Juvenile and Tavon in my own life. I pray that this can begin to open the eyes of our black men to know that there are alternatives to this lifestyle but it comes at a higher price than just accepting what our environment allows us to have. We have to take by force our inheritance that is allowed us by Him who Saved us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting","review":"I went to the author's store \\"Words by Wendell\\" on my way back to work and I spoke to the author about this book and the sequel. After our chat I purchased both and was finished in a couple of days. I could'nt put them down. Being a resident of Baltimore and never being touched directly by the accounts in the book, but Ive known enough people who have. The author had me on a rollercoaster of emotions meeting these people and experiencing their thirst for \\"fast money\\" and how it all came to similar ends; incarceration or death. These things are a fact of life for so many people in this city and other cities. I applaud the author for his gritty realism and how Tavon, Juvenile, Fast Money and even Precious are people you could have been related to, dated, cried and even prayed for."},{"rating":"2","title":"First and Best!","review":"I got this just yeaterday and it rocks! There are times in fast movement[remember, this is sonic we're talking about] where there is pixelation, but the quality is overall good. This works really well with the GBA SP. Before using this, some advice. Get headphones. The speakers on the GBA don't really work that well for this good of cartoon. With headphones, it sounds almost like the original. Get this one now! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sonic X Rocks!","review":"One day my friend came over and he had a Gamboy Advance Video. I found it rather interesting so I decided I would by one with my own money. When I got to the store, I went to the section where the had Gameboy Advance Video. The second I saw Sonic X I knew i would get it. Over a weak I watched it loads of times. When you put in the cartridge it comes up to a menu where you which episode you want to watch. It has really good sound and it looks almost exactly as it does on tv (exept it is in wide screen of course). I give Sonic X volume 1 5 out of 5 stars. Too bad I can't give it 10. Gameboy Advance Video goes great with GBA headphones too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moms b-day party","review":"I got this CD for a 85th birthday party for my mom.

Great CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"dark, weird, amazing and completely bonkers!!!","review":"the book can not be summed up in a review it is so amazing that it is beyond words.

It started at first glance; the title. A Shogun is Japanese, whereas a Ninja is Chinese. A Shogun would never associate with a ninja, as ninja are without honor. A Shogun would only associate with Samurai.Now we can get past this glaring error to the cheesy schlock that was the rest of this movie. From the soundtrack reminiscent of lower quality 70's porno flicks, to the unentertaining, poorly choreographed battles, poor acting, etc... do not waste precious minutes of your life watching this movie. After watching this movie I am honor-bound to commit Seppuku. Goodbye, cruel world."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Excuse For A DVD","review":"Don't get me wrong. I LOVE the story. I've seen it in the cinema in the 80's and I still love it. But the issue why I gave low ratings is because of the DVD. This is the first time I've seen a DVD where the makers of it, puts watermark images of the company in various scene in the movie. Talk about advertising!Second, on the cover, it was written that the movie has undergone digital transfer. The only thing that I think, where the movie got it \\"digital transfer\\" is from a poor quality VHS tape to DVD. This is absurd! Even the soundtracks bear the quality of a bad tape recording.I've watch other Sonny Chiba's movies from the 80's in DVD format like Ninja Wars and GI Samurai aka Time Slip and both quality is what a DVD should be. This one is clearly an attempt to make a quick money at the fans of the man.The first 2 reviews, refers to other movies and not the one in question. To Amazon, please remove this item from your listing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A couple of fun movies","review":"I first heard of Sonny Chiba while watching the movie, True Romance, w/Christian Slater. I then saw Streetfighter on some cable channel, but it was a poor version. I took a chance on this DVD, and I was really suprised to find a very good version for such a low price. The stories can get confusing, but essentially, it's a tale of revenge. Sonny Chiba takes down all those who done him wrong, quite brutally. Great martial arts action. And besides, who watches martial arts movies for the stories? And two movies for ten bucks? Not a bad deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this product","review":"I've used this cover-up since I was a teenager--more years than I want to say!

Richmond, though a meticulous historian, seemed to me to be trying his best to drain every drop of life out of this account of Roman Britain and he fairly much succeeded. I am used to reading historical narratives or at the least, reading historical accounts, where at least events are put into chronological order. Instead, the author, reels out lines of fact with very little linear connections at all. However, I will say that unknowingly to myself, I did find I had a wealth of facts about Roman Britain floating around in my head, but with no connections to anything. Possibly the most frustrating thing of all, is that Richmond never gives a reason for Roman's leaving Britain, or even a definitive period of time, when the Empire's grasp receeded, simply talking about Roman influence up to the 5th A.D. and then giving no reason, no explanation nor any following life after Roman recession."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't think this would happen...","review":"Overall the knife works very well. It is not that sharp when I received mine though, it definitely needs some sharpening. I have used it to hack through wood and other things and have tested it thoroughly. I will say it holds up pretty well to anything I cut with it. The thing that really bothered me is the grip fading away. When i cleaned my blade with water, to get some tree sap and other stuff off of it, when it dried, I realized that the grip portion has begun to fade away. Now I love the way the black and orangey wood colors go together, but I HATE how it looks now... I guess this is more of just a display knife if you want the grip to remain the same. I haven't bought the all black one so I can't speak for that KA-BAR but as for this one, I am unsatisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Knife!!","review":"I bought this for my boyfriend for christmas, and when i got it the outside of the box that it came in looked like it had minimal damage life scuffs on it, but the inside was perfection.

We didn't have tickets, but Tony Andros (Krypton's drummer) got us in for free. I was really impressed with their sound. They sound a lot like the Smashing Pumpkins, but their songs are longer and more complex. They all have a lot of talent and could go far. If you like alternative and are missing the Pumpkins, buy this cd. Be looking for Krypton in the future.

The four Goodie Mob-sters, Outkast, Witchdoctor and of course, Cool Breeze all deliver brief, but great performances on \\"Watch For The Hook\\". Dre of Outkast begins things with a tight intro, with Witchdoctor, Big Gipp, T-Mo, Big Boi, and Cool Breeze all deliver short but sweet verses (I use the term \\"verses\\" loosely). Cee-Lo and Khujo sort of deliver bridges in between everyone elses verses, and while solid, they both, Cee-Lo especially, rap WAY too fast for their own good to the point where they mumble a jumble of incomprehensable lyrics. Still, this is one great track with a hard beat that uses sparse sampling to spice things up.

My old bones expect more comfort than I guess is standard these days.The seat is a gel core wrapped in a leather-like shell on a hard plastic base. The metal mounting bracket underneath the seat is molded into the plastic shell, but it does have an adjustable bracket.

This is an extremely loud toy when it beeps. Also, it's easy for a kid to leave either a car or remote control on and drain the batteries completely (my husband even did it once) because there's no automatic shut-off. After that happened a couple of times, we just shelved it for a while. (Each remote takes 2 AAA batteries and the cars each take 3 AAA batteries, so yeah, 10 AAA batteries!) Lastly, if you own a pet, the wheels are small and can get seriously tangled up if you haven't just swept your floors; you have to take the whole thing apart to clean them out. On the upside, the kids do love it, a definite attention grabber."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never worked!","review":"My parents got this for our preschool/young elementary boys for Christmas. They actually got 2 sets since they would be opening them at the same time as their cousins. However, we didn't have 20 extra batteries on hand (10 needed per set!) so the kids were disappointed not to be able to use them right away.Later when we did try them, it was almost impossible to even get the battery compartments open. The screws stripped just trying to open and close the battery doors. Then the cars themselves were barely responsive. They only worked for a few minutes, were very loud, and would only move a few inches at at time, even with brand new fully charged batteries.

Make sure you know these objectives before taking the test! I failed the test by less than 50 pts, I am pretty sure had I known these items I would have passed easily. Search on Cisco's site for the documentation on these topics and make sure you know how to configure them and what tabs do what. I have over a year configuring dozens of Pix's for customers and have to say I was pretty dissapointed that I failed not from the cabability of installing and configuring Pix's, but because I didn't know what the support tab in the Pix MC did etc. Hope you have better luck than me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Errors","review":"I would have expected more coming from Cisco Press. This book is riddled with errors. What's worse yet is that the Boson practice test uses this book for reference; thereby making the Boson error prone as well. The practice software is bad too.

Unfortunatly, this book has neither. I would like to think this is because the book was supposed to address the beta exam and the new Pix exam. Overall, this guide did not adequately address some of the objectives for the test. In addition, some of the test questions on the CD-ROM had incorrect answers. The book also had syntax errors in their examples. My suggestion would be to read the command reference, configuration guide and do some hands-on work or labs and save your money on this one.

If it came free with the box, I'd be perfectly happy that Cisco included it. Beyond that, it's not of much use.

There are much better books out there, I don't know why anyone would want to get this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK- for your average Joe","review":"This works good for someone who just wants an easy thing you can plug in and go, but for me it wasn't a good solution. First, not only did I not want to use my cigarette lighter (I need it for a radar detecter) but I didn't want the speaker hanging off my my dashboard. Second, in my car (Audi A4) the cigarette lighter is in an awkward location near the gear shift. I have to place the speaker upside down to work, so the cables flop down the side. Third, the phone doesn't click in like a normal hands-free kit does, you have to stick two cables in the little holes each time you place it in the cradle. And fourth, you need to replace the battery cover with one that has a clip attached in order to attach to the cradle. This adds a little bulkiness to the phone for people who carry it in their pocket like I do.I don't know why Nokia can't make a real hard-wired hands-free kit for the 82xx phones like they did for the 61xx phones. The phones are becoming real popular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs a little work.","review":"Out of the box, this kit is a bit of a joke. The 61xx has a nice easy to use kit, and this on is a bit bulky and required plugging and unplugging every time you are in or out of the car. To make life a bit easier I took mine to a top-notch customizer who installed my kit permanently, thus eliminating the need to use the cigarette lighter. However, there is no getting around the plugging the cables into the phone. Also, because this is a light version of a hands free kit, there is no way to get auto-mute on the stereo. All in all, hands free kits are a nice accessory and keep the road safer. Your best bet is to get this one until Nokia gets it together with a real kit for the 82xx. Just spend a few extra bucks and have someone install it permanently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alternative to Nokia kit","review":"I bought the Sharper Image hands free for the 82xx - the one with the hear it again. Bit clunky but works well - clear to hear, mic works. Extended use drains battery (used to pwer speaker while recharging so net zero or loss).

Imagine a world where everyone is sorted by which medieval \\"humour\\" they fit into -- all the choleric people are together, separate from all the melancholics, etc. I thought it an interesting premise that gave structure to the author's exploration of identify, value, etc. My only qualm comes from the fact that I'm not an intellectual and usually like my books to end in a happy summation wherein all mysteries are solved. But, as in real life, it doesn't happen here. I happened upon this book by accident -- I was locked out of my house and forced to spend the evening at the local library, with the reward of discovering a new author whose books I look forward to reading.

I'm controlling myself not to ruin his Christmas gift because I wanted to give it to him as soon as it arrived. It's nice to have a \\"noisy\\" toy that isn't noisy from batteries.

So the only thing that is quite nice about this set is the triangle and the red noise maker.If you wand some good quality instruments for your child, go to west music store here on amazon and find all the instruments separately, the price you spend will be equal to this set and you will be much happier with the products {I got lolipop drum, egg shakers, triangle, cymbals with knobs and tambourine and it is uncomperable quality!!!!}"},{"rating":"1","title":"Already Broken After One Week","review":"My children are not the type to break their toys because they are too rough with them.

After around 2 uses the tambourine developed a hole on its skin and the maracas got a crack.

Our little boy is 3 years old and he LOVES experimenting with these toys - learning how each of them makes noise, and listening for the differences in the noises they make.Music has always been important in our family, and this little set allows our son to participate in the music making! There are so many little sets out there, but this one really is a perfect introductory set; it is durable, inexpensive, there are a variety of little music makers, there is a storage box for all of the instruments (with room to grow your collection!).Some folks have commented that these toys aren't durable...it really depends on the usage...if you're letting your toddler have free-play with them & they throw them around the house, then yes...they'll probably break. But if you have designated music time where you are sitting with your child & showing them how to properly handle the instruments, they will last forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome toy, poor quality UPDATED","review":"My kids love this toy; it quickly became a favorite.

It seemed really neat, but it's really quite poor quality; I would not recommend this product to anyone. As another reviewer mentioned, the tambourine is SUPER low quality, covered with thin paper, which tore after one day of limited use. The cymbals are also horrid -- they don't sound like cymbals at all, more like clanging two large pennies together. As a side note, the paint on the clapper is pretty poor on one side (not the side shown \\"up\\" in the box), but that's really minor compared to these other quality issues. Wish we had this one to do over. If you want instruments, buy them individually and pay more, but get quality you can test prior to purchasing, not something wrapped up in a box. Basically, a waste of money for the few ok instruments inside this box. INCREDIBLY disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I expected for the cost!","review":"Completely satisfied with this purchase. For $18 I think the durability is right on par.

Every instrument is so well made, and smooth, and they make pleasing sounds. However we're a little puzzled at why the maracas have a muffled sound to them. When you shake them, You can tell there are beads inside the maracas, but it sounds as though they're filled with cotton and beads. One maraca is more muffled then the other. It was a little dissapointing and frustrating to not hear the beautiful pebble sounds that maracas usually make. We've owned cheaper made maracas that sound a lot better, that's why we can only give it 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly good","review":"These \\"instruments\\" are great for my grandchildren, one aged three years and one who's 20 months.

The tambourine, cymbals, etc. all made clear sounds. The maracas--not so much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Can't say I'm disappointed -- angry is more appropriate. Looks good but is terrible. The quality of this product is so poor, I am quite certain that the folks at Melissa and Doug never held these things in their hands, but only saw photos when deciding to package and market them. The \\"skin\\" on the tambourine lasted 30 seconds. The maracas seem durable, but make nearly no sound at all. The triangle is flat-out dangerous. The mini-hand cymbal things make a horrible thwunk sound when clapped together... I could go on an on but will just say that everything except for the wooden tray(which we will use in the kitchen) and the torn tambourine went straight to the trash.Save your money and time and buy something else.

They make all kinds of \\"music\\" and march around and play. I would highly recommend this product for anyone with kids. The only problem we've had with it is the tambourine was used as a drum with the stick from the gyro by our daughter and broke within 15 minutes. I'm sure it wasn't intended to be used that way, but I thought, being made for little kids, it would be more durable than that. I will tape it and it'll work just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap quality","review":"I was VERY disappointed that the tamborine in this set broke the very day that my son opened it up.

They do not clang like symbals should. And the handles came off after one week. Also, the maracas are sub-par and the sound they make is so soft that one can barely hear it. The triangle is very large and slightly unwieldy. Definitely not worth the money I spent on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed with this product. The shakers did not shake (i.e. they were so filled with sand or whatever else is inside them that they did not make much noise) and the symbols make very little noise at all other than a boring \\"clank\\".

The tambourine broke in one day. The symbols are very small they do not make any noise. The maracas wood is so thick you cannot hear them shake and very heavy. The triangle string broke after a week and could injure the child. The other two instruments are ok but the clapper is too loud my daughter holds her ears when she hears them and I am afraid it will wake the neighbors. My child does not play with it. My husband refuses to return it because he said they would not believe how the tambourine broke so quickly. So they sit in the corner, where she plays with everything else except these instruments don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falling apart in less than a month","review":"The maracas cracked and split open and had to be thrown away. After minimal use, the chrome plating on the outside of the triangle is peeling off--a danger to households with a baby. The cymbals were tarnished when we received the set. The box is worthless. With no lid on the box, you can't store the items in it. When we made the purchase we were concerned that the price was too good to be true. It was. These are not quality products, and don't live up to occasional use by a 3-and-a-half year old.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good deal","review":"Triangle & cymbals are the big hit with my 12 month old, but the other instruments are great too. The only thing I'm not impressed with is the tamborine since the \\"skin\\" part is not made with leather but with a synthetic material that I don't think will be long-lasting. Still, a great price for a good variety of instruments."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Shameful Waste of Money","review":"I am a retired grandmother on a fixed income and am 100% disappointed with this product.

She will now be 4 in a couple months, and she still gets the music set out every couple days and plays with it, usually declaring loudly that it's \\"music time\\". My only complaint is with the moroccas - they are not exactly kid proof for preschoolers to work with. My daughter banged them together a few times, which resulted in the one breaking altogether. The other one, although still usable, has a small crack in it. I think hard plastic moroccas would be better - or thicker wooden ones as used in public school music classes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tambourine ripped immediately.","review":"The tambourine ripped immediately. I called the company and they are sending a replacment. I'm not sure what good that will do unless the replacment is not covered with paper. So I'll do what the other reviewers here have done, and cover it with packing tape.The other thing is that the cymbals were scratched as if were secondhand, and that was right when I took them out of the box.I have tons of other Melissa and Doug products and this one doesn't seem to be as high quality as the others. The Band in a Box seems durable but we'll see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality","review":"I was excited to get this set for my 1 1/2 yr. old daughter. It was such a great idea! What a disappointment! The maracas make no sound, as if they are filled too full, the tamborine skin broke after only one week and even the wooden rhythm instrument and cymbals produce such a weak sound, they hardly sound like percussion instruments. It is all made in China. I think I'm better off getting \\"real\\" instruments that produce quality musical sounds to inspire my daughter. I do not recommend this set to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made","review":"I purchased this for my son, because the price was good for what I thought I'd get. However, upon opening the shipment, I could clearly see how damaged and used the items looked. I returned it for an exchange. The 2nd time I received the order, the items looked even worse! I didn't even have to open it. I returned for another exchange and Amazon never sent me anything. Nor, did they refund my money,even though an email from them indicated that another was on the way. I had to call and discover that they had made a mistake and had not intended to send me another and , oh yeah, because I'm calling, I can have my money back and start over again? What???????? The man on the phone could not have been nicer. However, what if I hadn't called about it? I had so many orders, I could have easily lost track and just gone by their confirmation email that all was fine. A little disappointing and now I'm looking for a better band set for my 16 month old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Pretty durable, good educational toy but that's about all I can say thats positive about it! I would definitely not recommend this! I was debating about the more expensive brand even though Melissa &Doug are usually pretty good quality, but now that I have purchased this and have seen the quality of the other brand! I would have definitely paid the extra to get the other! Oh well! The symbols dont even make a symbol sound! Prettty lame if you ask me! Comes in a super cheap cheesy container with fake grass in it! weird?!!! I thought so too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music set - could use better storage box","review":"We gave this to my DD for her 3rd bday. We graduated from the baby instruments that were a hand-me-down from her older brother. The kids love playing w/ this kit (my 6 1/2 yo old son too). The instruments seem very durable. They come w/ a wooden crate box which has no lid. If it had a lid, I would give this toy 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shake, rattle and roll","review":"Hours of fun. Don't give all the toys at once. Space them out so they don't get bored. Very cute one man band. I hate that it is made in China. I never buy toys made in China but I made an exception for this one b/c the others were much too expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap materials...VERY poorly constructed","review":"my 1year old daughter has already put a hole through the tamborine after dropping it and it landed on a pebble *while playing with it at her birthday party and just received it moments before..i might add*, the clacker thing is held together with a cheap piece of elastic rope...which she has already undone and lost the 1 piece..the maracas are bad...they're not loud or any thing..it sounds like there are 4 or 5 grain of rice inside..and the wooden instrument...she has no interest in it musically...but she likes chewing on them....the symbols, and triangle are ok ...simply due to they make sharp loud noise...which is what she likes...i'm not happy with this purchase AT ALL..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Choice","review":"I ordered this for a 4 year old who is showing interest in music and instruments, it was an absoulte excellent choice, it reminded me of my youth in pre-school. Highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so durable","review":"I gave this to my son for his 3rd birthday as he is interested in music and says he wants to play in a band, so I thought he'd enjoy this. He did enjoy it, but broke the tamberine within an hour. The material in the middle was so flimsy - almost like thick paper. It says on the box that this is appropriate for ages 3+. I admit my son can be rough on toys, but I know other three year-olds that are even rougher. This is a cute little set, but not sturdy enough for a three year-old. I think they should reword the recommended age on their package."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money and toybox space","review":"The maracas cant be heard from more than 5 inches away, the cymbals are tiny and sound like soup-can tops, the wooden rhythm instrument is nearly as silent as the maracas. The only thing that works correctly is the tamborine, but the cheapness of the construction materials rings loud and clear. Will not recommend this to anyone in the future. We plan on going to Toys R Us and getting their set, which we have played with and sounds more like actual musical instruments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous if poorly made toy breaks","review":"My son enjoyed making music with these toys, until the cover of the tambourine broke with light tapping of the triangle stick. The trouble was, the tears were very jagged and the material is very sharp when ripped. I pulled the rest of it off but it didn't completely come off and is too sharp and jagged to play with. I emailed Melissa and Doug twice and they did not respond. I will probably not purchase another toy from them after this poor customer service experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"The band in the box is great!","review":"This toy really brings our family together. We can each grab an instrument and start playing a song, and no matter how random each of our notes are, we're all working together and having fun. The pieces are durable and well-constructed and I'm sure we'll have them around for years to come. This would make a perfect gift for any preschooler!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great toy, but careful with the maracas","review":"My eighteen-month old daughter received this set this past Christmas. Although below the recommended age, she loves the instruments and has a great time playing with them. We did put away the triangle until later since it is made of a heavier metal--a head injury in the making. They seem well-made, however, while playing with the maraca, she was able to unscrew the handle and the beans spilled out. A major choking hazard. It was easily fixed with a little super glue, but be watchful with little ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice!","review":"I bought this gift for my granddaughter who loves music in any form and I want to tell you this is a very nice product. The instruments are made extremely well and they appear to be very durable and colorful. The sounds that they make are not cheap or tiney but realistic, and having a box to put them neatly away in is a big plus. My granddaughter really loved the pair of colorful maracus. I found the price to be extremely reasonable as well, as in the past I have spent twice the cost of this entire set for one pair of maracus. All in all a very nice product that your children will enjoy hours upon hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Band in a box","review":"I bought this item for my two daughters, ages 3 and 21 months. They just love it! They have a great time marching around the house playing music for me. Even my 10 year old son has picked up an instrument now and again. I think it was well worth the money spent and it gives my children a nice way to be creative and express themselves. The favorite instruments are the triangle and the cymbals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-made toy for all ages!","review":"My son got this for Christmas when he was 3- it was a huge hit! Now, at 5 and a half, he still plays with this regularly, and has recruited his 1-yr old sister to \\"play band\\" with him. I agree with the other reviewer who mentioned the triangle stick could be dangerous for the younger set, but my one-yr old prefers the cymbals anyway. Yes its loud, but great fun and great for teaching rhythms and developing musical interest. The clacker instrument did break from being smacked against the concrete outside, but everything else has held up for 2 years now. As usual I'm very impressed with Melissa & Doug's products!"},{"rating":"2","title":"3/4nylox end brush","review":"I use Nyalox brushes for cleaning bark off material used for log furniture.

It is wonderful for beginning students as well as intermediate. Selections are great for barre work, centre as well as short combinations. A must have for the ballet teacher!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky Lid","review":"After reading such great reviews, I was suprised to see it leak so much when shaking. The manufacturer went cheap on the threads and lack of gasket. The leaks are fairly well contained, so it's not so bad if you're shaking it over the kitchen sink. Of course I had to try it in the middle of the kitchen! I actually bought two, assuming my first one was defective. The second was just as bad.If it didn't make such a big mess, this would be a great product. The graduation is just for looks. Use a measuring cup or add additional marks as needed. (It isn't a cylinder, you'll be off a bit if you try to eyeball it.)On the positive note:It did a great job of removing all the lumps.It did not leak during normal use. (Other than the initial shaking.)It was a very handy pitcher.Summary:It's handy, but I'll buy a better one when I find one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting perspective","review":"I always thought of Mary as being very different from a regular person. This musical shows a side of her that I've never thought about, but could be true. She must have had the same feelings and issues as any unmarried girl from a very religious family would have today. No one talks about Mary's mother either, but she had one! Interesting thoughts about what her mother's reaction would have been to her pregnancy. While some of the dialogue was a bit \\"corny\\", it did make me think and challenge my preconceived ideas. The music was very moving. I especially liked how the author brought it all together in the finale."},{"rating":"1","title":"anti-Semitic drivel","review":"This CD is an offense to anyone with religious sensibilities. The mother of the Virgin Mary is portrayed as a nagging, stereotypical Jewish harpie, complete with a hokey (and historically incorrect) Yiddish accent.

I cringed at the wave of embarrasement that crept over me while listening to this middle schoolish production. It is my prayer that the producers of this \\"musical\\" aren't adolescents as I would feel bad for denigrating their first attempt at theater. Hopefully whoever produced this inferior production has learned from the school of hard knocks and has found another full-time job! - Just don't include this work on your resume!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stereotypical disgrace","review":"This \\"musical\\" is an amateurish attempt to portray a real story. But the characters are so poorly fleshed out and the music is so amateurish, it falls flat.More troubling is the fake Yiddish accent put on by the characters that give it an historical distortion, but also seems almost anit-semetic in its portrayal of whiny, negative women who are based on every stereotype available.The writers obviously have no sense of Jewish history and no fear of appearing foolish in their attempt to identify real events.Oy--this is a stereotypical disgrace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible After a Few Episodes","review":"This show was interesting for the first few episodes then it became repetitive and absolutely boring. I watched up to episode 20 hoping that it would get better, but then gave up. What a stinker it became."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who writes this stuff, and why is it so popular?","review":"What I learned from this episode:1. If you're having premarital sex, you're not a christian2. If you're a christian, you're ashamed of your natural sexual urges3. If you're a *good* christian, you don't have any sexual urges.4. No one masturbates. Ever.5. Abortions are unspeakable.6. Guidance counselors can refuse to give condoms to students (wtf??!)I sincerely hope there's more to this show than some messed up contradictory right wing religious propaganda. It's just the first episode... but I've seen a couple others and I think it's from the creators of 7th Heaven, so... Yeah.7th Heaven was the first show of my childhood that I recognized as bad writing. I even tried to like it because my friends did, but it was always just awkward and unrealistic dialog.

The acting is dreadful, the plot is laughable and there is not 30 seconds that goes by without the mention of \\"sex\\". Of course all the guys in this are cast as sex hungry jerks and the girls as naive. I will not spoil the predictable plot, but of course every situation involves sex and how it is bad. The worst plotline is the one where the chick had protected sex and liked it, and her dad died rushing to stop her. How dumb. They should have paid infomerical rates for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible show","review":"I could write an essay on how embarrassingly bad this show truly is, but I won't.

Its not even stated, but its the first HALF of season 1. The second half of season 1 is titled \\"season two\\". Its so stupid! One would think if I buy a DVD that says \\"season 1\\" I'd be buying the full season. And one would think that if a DVD says \\"season 2\\" it would be the second season, but no, its the second half of the first season. DUMBEST. SYSTEM. EVER. They finally start calling them volumes at volume 3, which is the first half of season two. I'm so aggravated. I almost want to sue ABC for false advertisement. Seriously!!!

Very happy with this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unintentionally Funny","review":"Secret Life: it's the prego-craze (eg. Juno, Knocked Up, Waitress) turned into a TV show, with a heavy dose of 7th Heaven, a pinch of ensemble-cast drama, and the acting giant that is Molly Ringwald. Sounds like an instant success, right?Wrong.Thanks to atrocious writing and mediocre acting, situations that should be dramatic become unintentionally funny. Few of the actors manage to make their lines believable, a task which is near-impossible because of the unnatural dialogue that has been written for them. Incidences that should be dramatic--a girl telling her mother that she's pregnant, a Christian girl's Down syndrome brother discovering that her boyfriend is cheating--become downright hilarious. Ultimately, the characters become caricatures of themselves, and it's impossible for a viewer to take them seriously.I watched this show because I found it good in a really BAD sort of way. If you're expecting this show to be good in a serious way, you're in for a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Bad its almost Good","review":"Nearly every character is a one dimensional blatant and tired stereotype, and the dialog is excruciatingly painful for anyone with a modest adult intellectual capacity to listen to as it is insanely repetitive. A humorous example of repetition is how many times sex is said per episode, and a quick search on youtube reveals some comical counters.If you are merely interested in viewing some teenage girls with persistent prom-like perfect hair bore you with relentless yapping about sex and pregnancy ad naseum for hours on end for an entire season, or you want to start a drinking game where you take a small beer shot every time the word sex is said, then have at it.Otherwise though, this is a plotless miserable excuse for television and deserving of a quick mercy-killing."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally unrealistic.","review":"This is the most unrealistic show I have ever seen. I can't think of anything good to say about it. The acting is horrible, and the writing is even worse. All the kids are supposed about to be about 15ish, yet they all seem to have the most mature conversations, the kind of conversations you would expect from say, a Lifetime movie of the most boring kind. The kids always have some sound advice for each other, which always ends up being school counselorish, and has the other one saying something like \\" Thanks for being there for me, it's nice to know I have a friend like you.\\" Who talks like that, at 15? No gossip, no backstabbing, everyone supports everyone else. Please. This show has no realism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secretly Addictive...","review":"I missed the very first episode (could have kicked myself!) but luckily have been watching on cable from episode two onwards. It is from the same creator as 7th Heaven (my favourite show) but The Secret Life of the American Teenager is much spicier than its predecessors. Following Amy through the ordeal of falling pregnant at 15 after only having sex once, the show covers closely how Amy deals with such a 'dirty secret' whilst finding out who her true friends are and learning that family always come first. A very colourful show with a good-looking cast (never hurts!). Worth the watch!9/10."},{"rating":"1","title":":P Not Good","review":"I am a fan of molly ringwald movies but this had to be one of the most dissapointing feature she has done, and the acting is horrible, 'I can not take it, I just can not', it was one the worst acting ever.1 star for Molly Ringwald, if wasn't in it, Zero."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series and great DVD set","review":"A another great series from the creator of 7th Heaven.

They rarely leak - and then they do, it's because I didn't put them on right for the overnight soakings that were to come. Most of the time though - they're great.

I would rather listen to Load than this. If you want some good side projects to listen to check out Phil Anselmo's new Down Album \\"II\\" or Zakk Wylde's Black Label Society's \\"1919 Eternal\\". Real rock on these two."},{"rating":"1","title":"potential, but not much to inspire me for now","review":"I was a bit shocked when I heard this album. I knew I wasn't going to get a new Metallica, but where this came from I don't know. I think the music has the potential to grow into something more solid and higher quality. I can't explain what is missing other than to say it didn't FEEL all that great to me. For the most part I heard too stripped down, underplayed music. The vocals are descent, but a little coaching and I think they'll be good quality. Good luck Jason & guys.

All the songs featured are genuine hits, but notwithstanding their chart success, this is a pretty average collection of 80s 'safe' hard-pop/soft rock. Only a few of the tracks grabbed my attention: \\"Rock This Town\\" by the Stray Cats (the first 45rpm I ever bought!), \\"Keep On Lovin' You\\" (REO Speedwagon) and Crowded House's, \\"Don't Dream It's Over\\" (which was a bigger hit when re-released in the 90s).

The handle is wonderful and the blade is great. I like the way part of the top of the blade is sharp as well as the bottom. It adds to it's image as a fighting knife. I love that it was used by the Marines in WWII --that adds a lot for me. On the other side of the coin, this is a big knife and as I have not had a chance to use it for any self defense purposes, I now think it is a little large for most of my uses. The sheath is so-so. When I hold it and look it over I am not wowed by quality, it is a simple way to carry the knife. After a little bit of use, the black on the back side of the hand guard rubs off. I would buy it again, but it won't see as much use as other knifes as it is a bit too large for most of my uses and too big for everyday carry unless you live in a remote area."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just As Good As The Last One!","review":"Several years ago my Kabar was stolen.

As I expected, it was every bit as awesome as my 1st one, and the stacked leather handle, to me anyway, is more aesthetically pleasing.The blade came arm-hair shaving sharp. There are only a few companies out there that you can count on having a blade like that out of the box, and Kabar is one of them.ALSO, shipping was excellent!

I liked how their relationship developed, and I liked that Amelia wasn't a weak woman, like most in the romance genre. However, the ending was a little disappointing. Without spoiling it too much, I didn't like the reasoning behind Houston's low self confidence and self hatred. She was setting it up to be something big involving the horrible father but then . . . it really wasn't. I thought that Dallas and Houston had more of a reason to be so distant but then . . . they didn't. It was like she was leading up to the big reveal but then couldn't figure out what she wanted the big reveal to be so she just put something in there.

Thanks to the glorious photographs and comprehensive interpretation in this book, I realize how much more I have missed visually and spiritually. \\"Michelangelo:The Last Judgement-A Glorious Restoration\\" does this Masterpiece justice and reminds us of the God driven powers of Michelangelo. The pictures before and after the restoration are truly revealing and touching. They tell us of the tremendous effort Colalucci, Mancinelli and their team made to return this Masterpiece to mankind.

It highlights her difficult upbringing and early sister act, her marriage to José Ferrer, her drug addiction and nervous breakdown, and her successful comeback. Star Sondra Locke lip-syncs many lovely songs but unfortunately she's all wrong for the part. She's too thin, her eyes are too prominent, and she's shrill and hysterical and over-the-top most of the time. A young and unrecognizable Tony Orlando is a little better as the worldly womanizer Ferrer but he never quite captures the man's arrogance or charisma. Katherine Helmond is good as Rosemary's enigmatic mother and Kevin McCarthy plays the psychiatrist who treats Rosemary after her breakdown.The movie isn't great and looks cheap and rushed, but it is a good companion piece to Rosemary's autobiographies if you're a fan. She led a remarkably dramatic life, full of emotional highs and lows, and lived to find happiness again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep Rich Ambience","review":"Atom heart and Tetsu Inoue meet as Datacide.

I'm not sure what is worse, the incredibly annoying and disruptive advertisement for the video producers between EVERY song or the bad reverb on each singer making them sound painfully flat and unpracticed.The only things I can say to its credit is that the locations used were very interesting and the lyrics of the songs sung were the most traditional I've found to date.If this was originally made for the children involved in the production as maybe a school project to have as a keepsakeand not intended for wide-release, I could excuse the basement production value.

However, whether this disc is for you or not will be determined by your reaction to the first movement. First of all, the exposition repeat is omitted, which is a big deal to some. Second, Levi's tempo in the opening march is faster than any that I know of (other sections are played at more normal speeds, so the overall time of this movement doesn't reflect the march pace, which is quicker than even Bernstein/Sony and Kubelik)...it is definitely outside of the bounds of the composers instructions.Me? I like it, I find that the opening movement can work well with a quick march, and it does here. The remaining movements are done fairly conventionally, but given that they are performed quite well. The sound is very good.

First off, it looks like a photo album, and has pictures and newspaper clippings of all her stuff, and every couple of pages their is some of her writing, but not much. It's more about a book of pictures with summaries. No thanks, I have my own photo albums to look thru."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book","review":"This book is awesome! I enjoyed it so much more than I expected. The creative non-traditional format, the images, colors, etc - it was hard to put down.

The Art is awesome. Had no idea that the book would be such a visual masterpiece. Aside from the incredible artwork, the writing is quite good and it really provides an honest look in to Heidi's world of parties, celebrities, fame, and fortune. The thing I like the best is that Heidi doesn't make any excuses, place blame, or force pity. Write or wrong, she was an enterpreneur with a mastermind for controling an enterprise. This book is a -- A keeper! Perhaps even a coffee table centerpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"All over the Place","review":"This is not a book to me, its a scrapbook.

These books complement the scholarly tomes--important as those are--with honest appraisals of the humanity of our 40th president. Along the way, they also confirm what recent scholarship has discovered--that despite unfair portrayals by his enemies and the media, Reagan worked hard, hardly ever napped, was widely read, and was brilliant at processing and distilling information. Kuhn's book adds necessary color about the personalities in the Reagan White House, for which historians will be grateful.

Maybe it was testament to McIntosh's storyline that I finished the book (as well as book 1--although I won't be continuing on to book 3). The premise (a murder victim cursed to possess the body of his killer) is interesting. Ultimately, the trite (I'll use it again) writing style completely hampers any development of this idea whatsoever. I could say that this should be filed under Young Adult, but young adults are going to English class every day and would also be writing in red ink in the margins. It was a sad (but easy) decision to abandon the characters in this series and forego reading the third book.

The authors are pioneers of The Sedona Method for releasing feelings as a means of attaining peace. This book contains 7 chapters that are designed to be read on a weekly basis, with blank pages for notes and observations between each chapter. There is some good advice in this book, that should fit pretty well into many belief systems. Although much of the book can be described as monotheistic, the philosophy is fairly inclusive. Some of the terminology is a bit dated, since the book is based on workshops that Lester Levinson conducted around 30 years ago. If you want a more comprehensive approach to this topic, you might explore the book, The Sedona Method, by the same authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hale Dowoskin adds little value to the work of Levenson","review":"This book gives the impression that it is co-authored or at least collaborated by both Hale Dwoskin and the late Lester Levenson.In fact, the book consists mainly of the ideas and work of Lester Levenson and with maybe a section added by Hale Dwoskin.While it is worthwhile to publicize the work of Levenson, it is bothersome to me that an early disciple has given the false impression of being a co-author or co-collaborator. Other than my criticism of the entrepreneurial intent of Dowskin, the book will give the reader a good overview of the ideas of Levenson that developed into what is now called the Sedona Method.For me it did not earn the oft-used cliche of \\"Change Your Live\\", but it is a good introduction."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Bill Gaither & Friends DVD!!","review":"This Is One Of My Best DVD's To Watch And I Highly Recommend Everyone Who Likes To Watch Bill Gaither And Friends To Buy This Dvd!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"History rewritten","review":"This book is another liberal's attempt to rewrite history. This book is totally the author's attempt to push her own liberal views. She states that the poem just came into KB's head but then tears the song down and interrupts each line to fit her own views. She tries to prove that Katherine Bates was a godless disgusting individual.

What was the cameraman thinking? I expected to see Hendrix playing his guitar, seeing the man in action. Instead this is a lame collection of Jimi butt shots and facial expressions. This camera crew obviously had no interest in guitar playing. It's almost as if they were trying to hide the actual playing. Whenever I go to a concert, I'm fixated on the lead guitar. If that sounds like you, you'll hate this DVD. I give it one star, not for Jimi, but for the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be Perfect...Defective Remaster","review":"This DVD could be perfect if it weren't for the damn technical flaws. At several points on the disc, including concert portions and some of the opening documentary, the sound is completely not in synch with the footage, which is VERY VERY annoying. With all the expense and quality control that is usually involved in such a huge archival project, could they not have made sure that a mistake like this did not occur? It really ruins certain parts viewing the DVD when you see Hendrix singing a line before you hear it.Furthermore, I find Eddie Kramer's sound mix a little too gimmicky and echo-drenched. The guitar and bass sound very good, but the drums are a little mushy. Oh well.At least it's the most complete document of the concert, but I'll be keeping my old version just so I can watch certain tracks in sync with the sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Performance","review":"I would have preferred better mixing, and its not Jimi's best performance.

This film presents an intimate record of the largest concert hendrix ever played. remember most of the woodstock crowd had left by the time he got to the stage. what we have here is jimi with arguably his finest band ever with billy cox and mitch mitchell playing a set that covers the span of his recording career with an emphasis on material that would not be released in studio form until after his death. one can only speculate as to the precise chemical combination that evoked his state of mind for the show, but he does entertain and at times the band really catches fire. a must have for hendrix fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the editor thinking?","review":"What a waste! Great show and great sound, but unfortunately, 95% of the visual is of the back of Jimi's head. If you are seeking a film of Jimi actually playing a guitar, don't by this frustrating montage. Seriously, entire songs pass by without the viewer able to see one glimpse of Jimi's left hand. I haven't the vocabulary to explain how painful it is to watch this film. If you are some sort of fan of Mitch Mitchell, fire in on this one. There's plenty of footage of him. But the editing, for some reason, prefers Jimi's head and back before his hands. Horrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Re-release of 2002 DVD but with \\"Hey Joe\\" added in","review":"This is the most polished and well produced film of Jimi Hendrix performing live (as well as the professionally filmed Woodstock performance). I personally like the show Jimi gave, although He's burned out tired, as the set started at 1 am on a hot August night, still, it brings on more of a personal performance as Jimi works well with Billy Cox and Mitch Mitchell. it's a long set with his classic hits (Purple haze, Voodoo chile, Foxy lady, red House, ect) but also Jimi introduces new material for the what was going to be his next album but he died before it was completed (later released as \\"First rays of the new rising sun). New songs played are: Dolly Dagger, Freedom, Ezy Rider among others. A must own for any Jimi fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"GET IT YOU FOOL!!","review":"Excellent footage and quality for this period!

I am a guitarist, bassist, drummer, singer, and song-writer, and as an experienced musician I was terribly disapointed in the bands performance. Mitch Mitchel(drums) made a mockery of himself as he played like a five-year-old holding his first pair of drumsticks. And jimi's guitar playing was nowhere near the quality of his album work. The only song worth seeing on this whole DVD is red house. If you are a skilled musician who likes watching skilled players, don't buy this DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hendrix near the end!","review":"This Isle of Wight concert was shot over 30 years ago and a couple months before Hendrix's untimely death. I thought the sound and picture quality were good. The film documents the uninterrupted concert which previous films did not. It's interesting to compare Hendrix's tour de force in Monterey Pop with this one. In the Isle of Wight performance, Hendrix shows signs of fatigue and frustration. As mentioned in other reviews, there is a thin blue line which runs through a small portion of the film, but it doesn't distract from the enjoyment this historical piece. This DVD is a must have for any true Hendrix fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"problems with dvd software that comes with film","review":"this is the only dvd i have in my entire collection that forces the viewer to download software.if you dont have an internet connection, you cant watch it. if you do have a connection, well...the add on software never worked. it makes you register and go to a web site, which then just says error.needless to say, ive never been able to watch this dvd. nowhere on the packaging does it say that the dvd cannot be watched on a computer without the crappy software.in my opinion this is a major mistake on the part of the distributor.im assuming if you watch it on a tv with a dvd player it will prob. work, but if u only have a computer you may have problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jimi Hendrix - Blue Wild Angel (Live at the Isle of Wight)","review":"It is loud and it is noisy if we compare it with today's live concerts.

The collar with the remote will NOT work with the fence. You need the 5225 collar to work with both.Nowhere on the Innotek site is this laid out. Obviously there is very little difference between the three collars, this is just designed so you have to buy more collars.I have been very pleased with the performance of the collar I had, but I am very dissapointed with Innotek on this matter.I will be returning this item, as far as I can tell, I might as well buy a fence system from any company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, basic, easy to prepare recipes","review":"This is a good cookbook for people with limited time.

Their strength lies in the fact that they have definite skratch skills but never let displays of virtuousity bog down the groove. This has definitely been getting lots of play ever since I got it.The only dissapointment was that I had gotten Rob Swift's new album, The Ablist, first and so his newer mix of \\"Musica Negra\\" feels a lot smoother than the one on this album.

This set was one of many improperly sealed PDO (Philips DuPont Optical) pressings.

The rules are simple enough for a newbie role player to jump in and have a good time, but flexible enough for a good GM to write a very interesting adventure. This is a good 'beer and pretzles' type game that lends itself well to a casual style of play as well as a more involved campaign."},{"rating":"1","title":"Et in Arcadia ergo....","review":"...but only if you watch the TV version. This is a pathetic remake. The acting is lousy, the script a 'Reader's Digest' version of the epic novel, and the cinematography abominable. The sets are nice...except they, too are borrowed from the Granada version. It's the same house, same everything. Waugh's book deserves a long, detailed version, and 1981 masterpiece was as nearly perfect as one can possibly expect. So the question is begged, as other reviewers have posed: Why? What was the point of remaking a classic? I don't get it. Somethings are best just left alone. We are not amused."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressive and ugly tone","review":"It is probably about 15 years since I read the book so I can't really say with any degree of accuracy whether this adaption is faithful to the book but I think I would have remembered some elements which take the epicentre of this adaption. I don't at all recall homosexuality being such a grand theme in the piece - am I misremembering? Further, Catholicism is depicted as the religion for those who suffer from a massive and morbid guilt complex - surely this was not the main theme of the book? In all, whilst some of the scences are beautifully done cinematatographically speaking, I would say the undercurrent if not overcurrent is one of supreme ugliness and depression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remakes are seldom better than the original ...","review":"This version of Brideshead Revisited is a pale shadow of the original, which was aired on the BBC in the early 1980's. The original was longer, allowing more depth to the story. It also starred top talent actors, such as Jeremy Irons, Anthony Andrews, Sir John Gielgud and Sir Laurence Olivier. It is hard to compete with this group. By comparison, the leads in this new version deliver wooden and shallow performances. If you want to try an interesting comparison, view a scene featuring Sebastian from the original, and view the same scene in the new version. Anthony Andrew's facial expressions, voice and demeanor are levels above what Ben Whishaw is able to portray. If you are interested in period English pieces, watch the best and buy the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD Review - Brideshead Revisited","review":"Brideshead Revisited is an intoxicating story about forbidden love. It has many powerful story elements including the love \\"triangle\\", a common man trying to fit into noble society, a controlling mother's effect on her children, and more. Emma Thompson is excellent, Hayley Atwell is solid, and Ben Whishaw brings raw feeling and emotion to the vulnerable Sebastian. However, it is Matthew Goode who is truly impressive in the movie. He brings a quiet confidence and strength to his character, Charles. Brideshead Revisited is a nice film based on a popular book.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"should we start rounding up Catholics?","review":"I understand that once an author completes a work, it's not his anymore: we can bring whatever we want to it, and take whatever we want from it. Having said that, I still think this movie is a travesty--an anti-Catholic diatribe that even a lapsed Catholic like me found disturbing. It almost made me want to start attending mass again. Almost. Believe me, when Charles Ryder's widowed father becomes the only breath of fresh air, you know the movie has problems. Yes, I was spoiled by the serialized version of the eighties, but I was also spoiled by reading the book--something that the creators of this film apparently chose not to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Middlebrow Telanovela","review":"Evelyn Waugh's \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" is one of the great English novels of the Twentieth Century. The novel follows the fortunes of an aristocratic family in the years between the two world wars. Brideshead Revisited has powerful things to say about the intersection of love and religious faith. The first film adaption of the novel aired on PBS' Masterpiece Theater in the early 1980's. Many long time fans of Masterpiece Theater consider the eleven hour series to be the finest one that has ever aired on the program.The screenwriter of this current version faced a very difficult task in reducing a complex novel of ideas into a two hour film. Unfortunately, the screenwriter was not up to the task. At its core, Brideshead Revisited is about religious faith. This current version reduces the story to a middlebrow telanovela. Waugh's Brideshead Revisited is a great story and I would recommend investing the time to read the novel or watch the Masterpiece Theater adaption."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess. Sorry Evelyn; they missed the point.","review":"If you have not recently read the book or seen the 1981 TV production, do not watch this movie. I had just listened to an audio version of the book before watching this, and it was difficult to watch this.This adaptation is an atrocity. Evelyn Waugh's great masterpiece of coming of age and discovery of faith, a poetic and religious book, is transformed into a anti-religious/homosexual tract. It is made to be contrary to the theme of the book.The actors are professional and credible, but I thought they were miscast with the exception of Julia. (She was cute in her bobbed hair and a unattractive when appropriate.) Even Emma Thompson is inappropriate in her role.The visuals are good, and some individual scenes are admirable. However, the liberties that are taken with the plot details and language are offensive to the senses and dishonor a beautiful book. Dreadful production, it was a overlong propaganda piece for 21st Century Political Correctness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Underrated, Admirably, Artfully Concise, Truthful","review":"This film is very underrated. The BBC series is of course a benchmark yet here the filmmakers manage to compress all of Waugh's ideas and plot without sacrificing emotional power into a two hour movie, no small accomplishment. It's very easy to be \\"seduced\\" by the star power of the BBC classic -- Irons, Andrews, Booth, Olivier, Gielgud -- who wouldn't be? However, the present cast does, with less glamor, a terrific job. Nothing is jettisoned, the religious issues are cogent and superbly presented. Less is more. I think this film will grow in stature. It's no small feat to go up against an earlier version that so shaped many viewers' sensibilities in 1981, moi included, and come up roses. Try it some time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this version, go for the original!","review":"The original story, and the very long BBC adaptation, are worth your time and effort. While this version of the story makes use of a stunning estate, has a gorgeous scene of the entry into Venice, and incorporates more of the \\"catholic\\" trappings (the singing in the chapel) - overall - the book falls flat. The strongest character is Lady Marchmain - Emma Thompson alone makes this worth watching. All the other characters get short-changed - Sebastian doesn't come across as a \\"man boy\\" - just a whiny, petulant boy. We don't really see the magnetism between Charles & Julia - and certainly, the fabulous Antony Blanche gets very little time at all - in the other version, we get to see much more of his character who plays a role weaving in and out over time. I was also disappointed in the Morocco scene & Sebastian's demise - what a let down! Skip this and go right to the BBC version. Jeremy Irons is really a much better actor than Matthew Goode, hands down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cringe-inducing Melodrama","review":"IMHO, Howard Holley's review \\"Brideshead Disfigured\\" is the best of the many very fine reviews accurately rating the 2008 remake as abysmal. With great terseness and clarity he lists most of the faults that turn the remake into a cringe-inducing melodrama. The only further criticism of the 2008 film I would add is the brainless, ham-fisted elimination and/or mangling of Waugh's dialog and narration. I waited in vain for even one of Waugh's inimitable lines. All gone. Want an excellent read? Read the book. Want an excellent film? Watch the 1981 mini-series."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a travesty!","review":"Yes, I am a huge fan of Evelyn Waugh's novel and the 11-hour mini-series. But knowing the marvelous cast (well, at least the older ones -- Gambon, Thompson) -- OK, I'll watch it. What a waste of time! Why did they bother using the book? Names and places are about the only similarities. With apologies to, I believe Dorothy Parker, Matthew Goode as Charles Ryder runs the gamut of emotions from A to B. And the actors playing Sebastian and Julia are -- well, let's hope they do better next time. Truly appalling if you love the book and/or the ORIGINAL. And in truth, even if you just take it as a film on its own, not based on some \\"original story,\\" it's still pretty much a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"beautifully done! the inevitable comparisons with the book and the miniseries may prevent you from experiencing this film on its own terms. i loved the miniseries, but i think that's irrelevant. also, screen adaptations are almost always different from the books they're based on, because of the dramatic requirements of the medium. nevertheless, i think this film retains the essential spirit of the book. the \\"Catholic thing\\", entwined with Lady Marchmain's misguided severity, doesn't seem to recommend itself very well; but the film's ending provides a twist (which you may perceive differently if you're not inside the \\"thing\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loathsome.

No, LM was NOT snobbish about Charle's class and home. No, Charles did not live near the train tracks. Don't get me started. just don't see this movie if you want an entree to Brideshead and Waugh.

This film has a not-so-hidden agenda that is anti-Catholic. In both the book and the miniseries Charles becomes a Catholic and understands. It was not that he wanted too much. He was in love with Sebastian. Sebastian drank, not because Charles loved Julia, but because he was lost as many were in his generation which was just coming out of the Victorian era. Emma Thompson plays Lady Marchmain as a gorgon. In both the other versions, Lady Marchmain is a suffering saint.The rest of the film's cast, except for Michael Gambon and Greta Schachi, are terribly miscast. The Julia looks like a drag-queen.

To say which ones, would be impossible, since the whole score is amazing, but I know I got my money's worth. The sound is very good -very low hiss - , and the orchestra, chorus, and singers do a superb job. I had given up on finding a complete recording of this play - not the usual scraps - , but now that I did I feel like one of the privileged few.

I didn't want this book to end, and I'm about to order any book of hers that I can get my hands on. Ms. Cooper is a good writer, with an obvious love and respect for her craft.

My wife and I are very satisfied with the performance of these skillets. Cooks Illustrated is right, being non-stick, they naturally wear over time, so why purchase expensive brands that will be replaced. These skillets are very well made (riveted handles, long-lasting non-stick surface, multiple layer aluminum, nicely tapered sides) and they heat up quickly and cook evenly. The rubber handles are removable in case the skillet needs to go into the oven. Don't be put off by the phrase \\"Restaurant grade.\\" These are excellant skillets in the home environment.

It cleans up easily. I've used it twice so far and have been extremely pleased. It cooks evenly and is easy to handle. Since no nonstick skillet is made to last forever (the coating usually comes off eventually), this is very good value and performance is comparable to the heaviest of pans."},{"rating":"2","title":"good quality","review":"This pan replaced the Nordicware superior steel pan, and is a welcome replacement.

Turns out I got lucky - this skillet has been amazing! No frills, not fancy, but it just works like a skillet should work. Heats up evenly, great grip and easy to clean!!

This is the case for Wet Willie most of their best songs come from this album. Wet Willie were a Southern Rock band but not in The Allman Brothers or Lynyrd Skynyrd vein Wet Willie had their own sound. Jimmy Hall the vocalist had more of a fuller soulful smoother tone. The music wasnt heavy on the guitar nor did it rock hard. The beauty of all the early Southern Rock bands was that they had their own distinct sound. The Marshall Tucker band had Toy Caldwell on guitar and used the flute very often. The best tunes on Wet Willie's first album are 1. Pieces 2. Dirty Leg 3.

That being said, every song is of the same excellent quality in terms of composition and arrangement as the best of 10cc. Like Dave said in his review, the U.S. version of Power Of Love, (my favorite song on the album), is missing from this collection. It's also very strange to hear the songs played in the order, (apparently the UK version's), that they are.

This is the film soundtrack as it ws originally released on LP. I had been looking for the soundtrack on cd for a long time and was delighted to find this. Surely this is one of Bernard Herrmann's most accessible scores, lots of taut strings and that beautiful waltz. The other pieces on the disc are fine too, but the real reason to consider buying this disc is the \\"Obsession\\" score.It's a shame that we don't have the great cover art of the original LP pressing.I still have my old LP and even a cassette of this score, but this is the one I play for it's crisp sound quality.

In fact EMU stopped bundling this software with the EMU 0202 6 months ago. When you do buy it now, you just get one programme - MS mixcraft (LE). EMU know this is happening and when I told them didn't seem bothered but just blamed the 3rd party website (even though the manual that ships with the EMU 0202 says this software is included). If this happens to you you can get your money back and try the Alesi i02 - which is newer, cheaper and has more functionality (eg recording 2 channels at once).

E-MU (a subsidiary of Creative) hasn't bothered to update the drivers for the 0202 USB in nearly three years. Needless to say, the drivers haven't been updated for Windows 7, and are around 60mb. They take forever to download because the E-MU website crawls. On my laptop (a Sony Vaio), I experienced the DPC latency issue others have described below: no matter how much I twiddled with the configuration, I kept getting pops and crackles.

Anyone who has ever had a family member get sick will find nothing new in here that he/she has not experienced in their own life. There are no insights here to make it all worthwhile as Rabbit and his family are not especially thoughtful people, so we learn nothing new about mortality and sickness.

It lacked momentum like its first season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ended too soon!","review":"This was an excellent show with a lot of heart. It carried some great messages and hit on the fact that \\"humans\\" are capable of some wonderful things. It had just enough of a sci-fi element to it, with equal parts drama. I feel it makes great viewing material for the young & adult alike. It's too bad the network couldn't have allowed them to finish it with a 4th season, but the network heads are generally very short sighted idiots that concern themselves with ratings & money and not content. Matt Dallas has moved on to the new series Eastwick & is doing a great job there! So if you were a fan of Kyle XY, check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kyle XY","review":"This T.V. series is great.

I finished it the first day! Talk about a book you can't put down. I had to find out what would happen to these two sisters and their father. The book has many great characters you can really sympathize with. The story is unusual and yet totally believable. I wish I had a song reader to help with all the music rattling around in my head!I'm very eager to read Lisa Tucker's next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A young woman's voice, and lots of 80's music","review":"Lisa Tucker has a gift - the narrator of her first book, Leeann Norris, has as distinctive and resonant a voice as Huck Finn, and as much of a journey of discovery ahead of her. My only quibble, and the reason I give 4 stars, is that occasionally Leeann is allowed to get ahead of her story, saying something like \\"I assumed X, but I was so wrong...\\" Better to let us discover that on our own as we read.Leeann's sister, Mary Beth, is also beautifully written. She is the quintessential older sister, protector, and empathetic giver who is unable to receive let alone take, and who nearly destroys herself in the process.The idea of songreading is both clever and plausible, especially when placed in the hands of a gifted, if untrained, therapist like Mary Beth. And Leeann's using popular music to indicate the passage of time (\\"Endless Love\\" had given way to \\"Tainted Love\\")keeps music constantly in the reader's head."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a 5-star book by any means!!!!!","review":"i ordered this book based on its 5star rating...it most certainly is NOT a 5-star book. the plot, if that's what it could be called, is silly, contrived and pointless. i expected much more focus on the actual songs and their lyrics; instead, we get a rambling, whining diatribe on depression. if the townsfolk loved mary beth so much, why would they be so quick to turn on her? and if everyone knows holly's dad is a total creep, why would everyone be so quick to jump on his side. this novel, while readable, is total mush best suited for a day on the beach. it has zero literary merit and will get under your skin solely because it is annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Who wrote all the reviews posted here -- the author's family and friends? If this book was specifically for young readers, I would have given it three stars, but as a book for adults it deserves only one. It was simplistic, overly dramatic, and the characters weren't believable. Even though I grew up in the 80s, and loved many of the songs mentioned, I did not connect with this book at all. There are so many other good reads out there (The Time Travelers' Wife, Life of Pi, Three Junes, The Kite Runner, etc.) -- don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Moving and Inspiring Novel","review":"This is such a touching book. It shows the true depth of the human heart, and how delicate we are. Lisa Tucker intricately weaves a story that leaves the reader with a true compassion, true love for her characters. This is one of the best books that I have ever read, and I strongly recommend it to anyone with a song in their soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Song Reader Skips a Groove","review":"The premise of the book is engaging, and the inner emotional frustration of the songreader's sister/main character Leeann is nicely drawn. But in the middle of the book, the author chooses an unbelievable, cliched crisis which makes the reader lose affinity for the songreader herself. In turn, the storyline bogs down, supporting characters become uninteresting and one-dimensional, and the reader continues the story in hopes that the writer will regain the reader's initial interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"350 lb rated?

And that weakness somehow turns her into a different person--or, maybe, it turns her back into the person she once was.You'll feel the aloneness, and you'll discover what that weakness is (something we all have) that brings her happiness and even excitement.Picture Book: Realistic FictionThe Creative Teacher: Activities for Language Arts (Grades 4 through 8 and Up)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and touching for both children and adults","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite children's books by a wonderfully-talented author.

Then follows an explanation of what IQ is, and what it means. Finally, it discusses giftedness, aptitude, and intelligence.The book is easy to read, informative, and contemporary. However, the test is perhaps too easy for adult readers, as scores are only adjusted for ages up to 16. Therefore, if you are older than 16, perhaps the test will not be particularily challenging. So if you want to boost your ego, then buy this book. But I suggest that if you want to challenge your intellect, then save your money for another book of puzzles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good IQ starter","review":"This book is a quick read and gets right down to the test.

When they did not show up I checked my account and it said all items have been delivered. I contacted the seller and they said it was an issue on Amazon's end. So I contact Amazon and was told it was an issue on the sellers end. I will be returning the items due to this discrepancy because $85 dollars for only 2 cans is WAY too much.

Seemingly unresolved compatibility issue with the HDMI cable. I couldn't get a Toshiba DVD to operate on this TV through the HDMI cable, even though it worked on the 61 inch JVC and on other brand television sets such as Sony and Toshiba. The problem was replicated on other 52 inch JVC sets. However an LG DVD with HDMI worked fine on the JVC 52 inch.This is a great performer. Worked very nicely on DVDs and surprisingly well on standard Dish Sattelite channels -- which is important because there are very few HD channels. I ended up returnming my set and getting a Sony 55 inch (the KDF-55WF655). After viewing the Sony for a couple of days, I think the Sony is a better performer. Sony has more clarity, and less digital artifacts.

I read some of the reviewers said this product helped their tummy to go back to their pre-pregnancy state....But that wasn't the case with me.Because this product comes with only one size if your tummy does shrink, you have to purchase a smaller size. And if your size is in between the size, this product do not shape your tummy. I am in between large and medium and when I wear the medium, this thing rides up and scrunches all my tummy fats to the front as it pinches my side, then it folds in between my upper and lower tummy to make me look fat.

It holds tight to the top and bottom, but that mid (most important) section, bulges right thru. And to add a reason that makes most shapewear suck, is the fact that I am STUCK with it. You cannot (and should not) return under garments. So, for anyone who is undecided, I realize the 5-Star ratings seem promising, but I strongly suggest you try something else.

His lights, while not as robust as others and so not so well suited to rental houses, are a great tool for the beginning owner-operator. I began with his Lowel Lights and moved up to his D-heads. I remember them all fondly, even though I no longer use them.After many years as a director of photography, I've begun to teach lighting and have been looking at book options for my students. So far the best book I've found on this topic is Blain Brown's \\"Motion Picture and Video Lighting\\". While the layout of Lowell's book is stunning, as are many of the images, Lowell approaches each section with long lists which to my mind do nothing to inspire the thinking eye. With great respect for Lowell, I regretfully report that for me his book is for the encyclopediast, not for the emerging eye."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Survey & Starting Point","review":"This is a great starter book to get if you have never done any lighting before - whether for video, cinema, or still photography. Lots of great tips and tricks that typically are missing from other lighting books. Lowell takes the concepts and precepts of lighting and presents them in abstract form so that you can adapt them to whatever lighting situation you may have. This book may not work for you if you are the kind of person who needs step by step how-to in order to get things done - in fact it is debatable that ANY book could do so effectively because every shoot is unique. But if you are good at thinking intuitively and abstractly then his presentation of the material is great because it teaches principals (with some examples) and not technique.My one complaint is the typsetting of the book. The use of a modern typeface makes reading difficult (looks like a bodoni variant). The publishers should really re-publish the book to make it more legible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightenment about Lighting","review":"I've read a lot of books about lighting.

Lowell's book goes beyond being a cookbook for lighting solutions, and is the first book that gives a comprehensive overview of lighting relative to all media and resources. Film teachers would find it an effective text, over and above its value as manual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Illuminating (okay, okay, that's pretty bad, but the book isn't)","review":"For those of us who seem mystified by why their videos look so...well, bad, Matters of Light and Depth offers valuable insights into the subtle and not so subtle qualities of light. Some of the material presented looks at still photography, and some takes advantage of classic artists whose tools were oil paint and canvas. All in all, while Matters of Light and Depth does not offer a \\"by the numbers\\" approach to lighting scenes, it does provide strong aesthetic considerations, as well as pithy quotations from people who \\"do lighting.\\" It's worth looking at. And the glossary is entertaining, as well. Basically, you just can't beat something from Ross Lowell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master book from the Master","review":"The author, Ross Lowell, it the creator of Lowell lights. These lights are an industry standard and are well trusted. Not only is does he make great lights but also has produced some amazing work as well. In this book he covers all the basics of lighting and covers many advanced techniques to help out every level of videographer."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book!!","review":"very good content to learn the basics of lighting for film!at this time havent finished the book but everything seems to be very instructional.!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reference on the art and craft of lighting","review":"At first glance, this book is as much a textbook as a coffeetable type book. The layout and illustrations are beautifully done and there is generous use of color photos in addition to the line art and black and white photos. But once you get down to reading instead of admiring, you realize this is an incredibly practical book by an author who knows what he's talking about and then some. I'm amazed by how much is covered in detail in a relatively slim book. Lowell knows what's essential and what's fluff and he's left the fluff out. This book covers every imaginable lighting situation from studio to field, night and day, single and multi-light set-ups, etc. I especially liked the glossary, with its inclusion of both technical terms (Lighting Ratio, Separation of Planes) and industry slang (Chicken Coop, Terminal Trauma) and the practice lighting exercises in the back of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from Instructional","review":"If you're looking for an instruction book on LF Photography, then this is NOT the book.Jack Dykinga's highly acclaimed talent as a photographer does not translate into this book. As other reviewers have commented, the book falls far short on technical merit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of fluff, little good stuff.","review":"Having read a few books on LF photog, I was expecting more of the same in quality of instruction and information, and was sorely disappointed. I don't understand why some photographers writing LF books feel they need to discuss very basic photo framing techniques and beginner concepts, other than to fill enough pages to make a book. Way too much unnecessary info (like botanical names of every plant, or the fully qualified name of every lens and every piece of gear for every photo for every demo in the book) made for painful reading. And where more info was needed, none was there. Statements like \\"I used back tilt\\", without any indication of which direction, or approximations as to the degree of tilt provides little usable data. If you want to wade through all this useless data, and lots of personal comments on the beauty of his subjects to glean a few morsels of actual operational instruction, then this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely NOT Floored!","review":"As a connoisseur of lesbian love stories, please do not waste your time with Floored by Love. I only leave reviews of movies that are so painfully awful to sit through --I feel compelled to do my fellow sisters the service of sharing with them how incredibly bad this movie was. Storyline was cliche'. Acting was horrible! No LOVE connection happening at all between the central characters. For it to be only 45 minutes in length --I wasn't sure if I was going to get through it. It was one of those movies that hits you over the head at the end and begs why did you even bother? I don't know how they ever found a distributor. If you want moving, quality lesbian love stories try: When Night Is Falling, Fire, High Art, Desert Hearts, Loving Annabelle, Aimee & Jaguar, A Girl Thing, or Tipping the Velvet to name a few. Floored by Love will leave you wanting to throw the DVD out of your car window and reverse over it a few times!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Great Film","review":"'Floored By Love' is a really great film. I totally loved the multi cultural presence of the hugely diverse cast. The story line and acting were well done as well. Kudos!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lesbian story hijacked by added Gay plot","review":"If you think marriage is the end-all-be-all, this brief adventure in amateur filmmaking does not provide enough reasons to explain its obsession with it. Being together as a couple for a long time and formally proving one's commitment to the other is the only argument given for wanting a contractual legal bonding. Any other pros, and absolutely no cons, of matrimony are considered. The story of a lesbian relationship, however, is soon hijacked by the coming-out saga of a teenage male and his relationship with his stepfather and visiting Gay biological father. For whatever reason, making a 50 minute movie about two Asian lesbians, their families and mixed cultures (one is Chinese, the other Japanese) was not good enough for the filmmaker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise, logical, but expensive","review":"This short text summarizes the key elements of nonlinear regression analysis including discussions not found in Seber & Wild or Bates & Watts. The notation is a bit nonstandard, but workable. All in all I find it useful for gaining a good conceptual understanding, and as a supplement to Seber & Wild."},{"rating":"1","title":"BECAUSE I COULDN'T GIVE ZERO STARS","review":"This is just a feel good book for the people who do not pursue any worthwhile intellectual pursuits. Arguments are weak, and to even suggest that reality shows show a rise in culture is ludicrous, in my opinion. Those who watch reality shows basically are sitting around, watching strangers on television, and in the process not doing anything with their own lives.My theory and my opinion is that this author may know his arguments are invalid, but he knows that so many people want justification for their inactive lifestyles that they will buy this book.Save your money on this one and read any fine piece of literature..or if not that, then go outside and do something...do not let your life be controlled by screens (tv, computer, cell phone, etc...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Rant","review":"Stephen Johnson is a master of language, no doubt about that. But the book is monotonous, it blatantly rejects all of the well established norms and practices. It becomes almost impossible to read towards the end, when even Johnson says he is arguing for the sake of arguing. Yes, Johnson expresses his unique point of view and has mastered the art of arguing and rhetoric, he simply does not say anything useful or important."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick read; good for outside point of view","review":"This book was an interesting read. The author didn't go into extreme mode about quantifying everything; he simply brought up global points about how trends might be helping overall. His point: the lowest common denominator has, over time, raised to a higher level, and redeeming qualities are being built in to those lower levels. The overall effect is that people seem to have more interest in those things, and the higher-level thinking that an event introduces, the better the result will be."},{"rating":"1","title":"EBIGFY review","review":"he did a good job explaining the complexity of popular culture but did not provide enough evidence to why it is making us smarter"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but choppy","review":"Interesting, food for thought, hard to get into and not so convincing after all. Could be a much shorter book."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY Redundant","review":"While the book is full of solid arguments on why \\"the bad\\" is really good for you, it gets very redundant at times. It almost seems as if the author is trying to spread his argument over as many pages as possible in order to meet a quota."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't back ideas up with evidence","review":"You may agree or disagree with the argument presented by the author, it doesn't matter. I for one disagreed.The main reason I disliked this book is not his thesis, it's the fact that he does not back up his points. For example, a quarter of the book is about why TV is actually good for you, but when he moves onto his discussion of the internet, his first arguments are that at least it's \\"better to have minds actively composing the soap opera of their own lives than zoning out in front of someone else's.\\" (comparing blogging to tv) He contradicts his own argument at multiple points.The problem is that the author seems to have started with a controversial idea, then grabbed for examples to back it up, rather than coming to a conclusion based upon the evidence. As other reviews stated, the examples are carefully chosen...Not to mention the fact that he has no real scientific evidence presented in the book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Define \\"good\\"","review":"The author made a pretty good case that some pop culture is not bad, but he does not make a strong argument it is good. I didn't read the notes section but I felt that there was a lack of supporting data in the main text for many of his statements and arguments (though he mentions a few times that \\"studies should be done\\"). He dismisses counter arguments with a few sentences: Yes, test scores in academic subjects are down, but problem solving ability is up! Yes, the content may be violent, but problem solving ability is up! I wonder just how this problem solving ability is being applied to non-entertainment situations, if at all. Does it translate into anything that leads to \\"good\\"? The book is really about video games - the other topics, TV, movies, etc. seem like padding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun thought provoking read: many brilliant ideas","review":"I think it is a very unique compilation of ideas that are fun to think about. I liked the part about video games and litaracy/reading early on in the book - as well as many other novel thoughts. The book does a good job in considering how \\"video games\\" and moder TV actually are more intellectually challenging than in the past, hence; perhaps not a waste of time but cognitivly beneficial activities.Today's video games and TV shows, the plots of, are much richer and more involved than say \\"pac man\\" or \\"Three's Company\\" of decades ago.This is a very basic snapshot of what you will find within - and a scratch of the surface. If you enjoy Gladwell's books (i.e.The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference) you will probably enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Heavier than Expected","review":"This is a really cute wearable blanket, but it is made of a much heavier, thicker fleece-type material than I was expecting.

Austin band lights a fire under your pants","review":"I have seen this band out when I am visiting in Austin, along with all of their other bands, the Scabs, and Lonelyland where they play at the local Saxon Club every monday night. These guys are tight, and the vocal ability that Bob Schneider brings to all his work with his talented posse is amazing.

Check out Lonelyland as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funky Crimes!","review":"Thank God someone picked up where the first Red Hot Chilli Peppers album left off. The Uglies, however, have taken this type of music several steps further with their inventive use of an all-too-American James Brown / Booty Collins / Austin Slacker / Hippie swank. I've seen these guys several times in concert, and their albums thankfully carry the same in-your-face punch as the live shows. I highly recommend this and the other two albums ... I also would highly recommend seeing these boys when ever possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different but Still Good","review":"First track is rich in texture -- great horns; really good beat (title track).I really dig \\"Wrong Direction\\" and \\"Orlando\\".

While not every line has a 4 letter word in it, the Ugly Americans (aka Scabs) make up for it by degrading women, talking about rape (how it is okay) and the like.

The music is very diverse in melody, tune origin and influences in national identity, you get the individual character of the various groups and their approach to gypsy music. Endlessly fascinating, with tons of hooks and sonic wonderments.

It is perhaps even more remarkable that Tom of Finland was not a traditional fine artist his work was most commonly regarded as gay pornography, and rightly so. Yet it is art that not only had a tremendous impact upon the emerging gay culture worldwide but whose erotic and emotional power remains unabated to this day.

She did sing in a number of other languages, and this album is a collection of beautiful songs sung in Russian. Sarah Gorby was from Kishinev, in today's Moldova, and Russian was one of her native languages. Her contralto voice is perfect for rendering the deep emotions of these songs. Some are very light-hearted, others tragic, but all of them are profoundly touching. I have played this album for people whose heritage is not Eastern European, and everyone has liked it. I have heard old Russian and Gypsy recordings from the 1940's, and I find that this album continuous authentic tradition.

These songs were not done by the original artist. Instead this rogue group known as The Countdown Singers are responsible for the performances on this disc.

Then I reexamined my order and saw I could only blame myself.This should be more clear about who is singing. The Countdown Singers are a group. I would have neve suspected it wasn't the original artist. There was a 80's collection called Awsome 80's. I had remembered it from the 90's. The Countdown Singers have just got their last bit of money from me. You can bet I will avoid their work from now on. If you think I'm being too harsh, just listen to them.

Even after double sealing both ends you will find that the air has leaked in and you food is freezer burned. Plus the bags and jars are EXPENSIVE! My Mom used to stick a straw into a ziplock bag and suck out the air. That works MUCH better than these pieces of junk do. Their vacuum jars are the same way. They cannot be relied on- so DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON FOODSAVER PRODUCTS! Think about it. $28.00 bucks for 18 ft, That's like 18 bags at best but you will find that when you figure in the extra needed for the seal its about a dozen bags! FOR 28 BUCKS?!

The cost is getting to be just about the same for each 15\\" bag as for a new glass canning jar, which can be used forever, and it's a one-time cost for the jar. Each 15\\" bag I make from the 11\\" X 18' X 3-roll package costs is 0.81 cents. I may get a couple of uses out of it if I'm careful, but then it's another 80 cents for a new bag, forever.That said, it's also true that vac-sealing is a lot easier than canning, faster, and vac'd food tastes better than canned, so I don't intend to give it up unless I have to. I keep track of the price per bag by checking out a couple of the different 'Mall'-Marts and their cost per 15\\" bag. So far FoodSaver has the best quality bags, but the price may have to come down in order for folks to afford to keep using them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Python Oriented Primer for Novice to Intermediate Data Parsing","review":"This book is full of great ideas and very helpful code.It's also nice to see the Java equivalent app/code for the python solution.Note: This book is not for advanced programmers, but is a very nice primer for many subjects, including a brief intro to some shell util's, building parsers for complex, multi-line records/data, a nice SQL tutorial with joins, aggregates and views etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"War Comes to Willy Freeman","review":"If your into adventure then I highly recommend War Comes to Willy Freeman.

You could not see any detail whatsoever. Each page had a 3 to 4 inch white border with these small b&w photos in the center. This book was certainly not worth the $23.00 (including postage) that I paid. The Photo on the front cover of the man and woman kissing is the size or smaller of the photos inside. Such a waste.

This works great on induction. I made a chili last night. Wonderful. But, best of all, when we do mashed potatoes and boil the potatoes or squash or anything you boild first...eggs, etc, you just dump the water into the sink and then mash the potatoes right in the pot. Also, draining pasta is great. I don't have to go rummaging through the pot and pan cabinet for the collinder or have to wash one. It's a great piece to have. Strong thick stainless, Sturdy top, twist to lock on, twist to lock off. Just take your time the first time you tip out the water into the sink so you learn how it comes out from either side and where the water goes when you are in the sink. First time, the water went onto the counter as I was too close to the edge of the sink when I tipped the water out. Just pay attention that's all. All in all, I would buy it again.

He was appropriately delighted when he opened it but spent all day (in Los Angeles!) hoping it would find satellites to no avail. Technical support was not helpful. The killing blow was finding out that it does not support an exact street address--it only finds streets. That, and the fact that he would need to download maps before he got in the car each time generated a return slip. Either spend more to get a robust, stand-alone GPS or wait a year or so for the price/performance to improve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works relatively well","review":"I like this product. It was simple to use and the software works relatively well. As someone once stated, this isn't extremely accurate at high speeds. This is due to the fact that the Palm Vx doesn't have a high speed processor and lots of RAM like laptop mobile GPS systems. (which I also have) It may not be highly accurate but works well enough for driving. The plus with the software was that it was relatively small, but so are the maps. The biggest drawback is that the maps don't cover all of the state or area you are in. It has sectional maps and doesn't change from one to the other automatically. If you are going to use this for off road endeavors I would consider getting some additional software. I am going hiking and am looking into some software at GPSpilot.com. The \\"tracker\\" software looks promosing as of right now, but it will cost you.

Often times, the Magellan could not find enough satellites to lock on where the Etrex would be fine. I live in a hilly area, so this really puts the receiver to the test. It seemed to take forever to acquire the satellites.The magellan website said that 20-30 minutes was not uncommon the first time out of the box (since the unit was tested in China). But it never came up very quickly (> 10 minutes), even in subsequent uses.I ended up taking the Magellan back.

I was able to get it up and running in under 10 minutes. My first fix came in about 30 sec. The software is another story. The two programs are terribly designed. It you wish to use this GPS for its mapping capabilities, you will need other software. I wanted to use it in may car for navigation. Although it can always tell me what my lat/long are, it is not very helpful in placing it on a map. The documentation is non existant. It is hard to believe that there is no ability to enter an address and have it give you directions like MapQuest does. You also have to sync every individual map you will want from the CD-ROM. The problem is that they are all organized by COUNTY! (Each county map is about 100k.)

She patterns the songs like a chain letter or writing in a diary. She chews up the men on a few songs. She might have been inspired by Alanis Morissette a little bit with I Want You Dead. Girlfight shows her more defensive side. But I like the many street driven songs in the album's middle. On some songs she sounds a little bit like Beyonce, but that ends after three songs and it's more of Brooke herself. For a singer that went through 200 songs (sorry, too pop, sorry, too bland, okay I'll take song #54, that one has hot beats, that one has a good live band, that one is nice, and so forth) just to choose the 15 tracks for this album, these songs fit her style very well. I wish her the best in her music career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay!!!","review":"I'm listening to this album as well speak and I don't like it at all only one song that is Cover Girl other then that I will bot be Buying this...that song blah,blah, blah makes the whole album look bad...It's not a good listen..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather listen to Ciara","review":"This album is ok that's it nothing spectacular about it.

Cause it doesn't require very much explanation. Brooke Valentine is your typical R&B; cookie cutter, manufactured \\"talent\\". A dolled up little girl with a decent voice, and loosely penned mediocre material. This girls not a talent that'll be around for ages, she'll be here today and gone tomorrow. Just like me, you may be tempted by the fact that it's under $10 bucks, but I can name about 10 albums off the top of my head that you'd be better of getting. For instance, this years most slepped on diamond in the ruff...Concrete Rose by Ashanti. Fantasia Borrino, or Mariah's latest release.\\"Girlfight\\" is totally a guilty pleasure, and laughable. Yet if the entire album would've followed this formula, It would've been half decent. I find it hilarious people are selling off 'I Want You Dead' as this years 'I Hate You So Much Right Now'. That's laughable, this song is corny and not ballsy in the least. Skip this stale effort at all cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not As Bad As Some Made It Out To Be","review":"This is a really good effort from this artist. Remember many first albums are not that good because they are usually trying to find their right sound and how much the public reacts off certain songs from the album. Her second will be mediocre and her third will be hott!!! That's how most artists go unless they are only looking for a one hit wonder in which case we might not hear anything else from this artist so to rate this item is a waste of time! For a good example of this listen to Nivea:Nivea, Nivea:Complicated, and Nivea: Animalistic. Completely different sounds especially Animalistic. Very cunk album and I love it!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money!","review":"When Girlfight came out, it was the bomb. The first single just misleads you into buying this CD though. I only like Girlfight and Ghetto Superstarz and at the end of that it has an annoying interlude you wish you could just cut off the song. And I Wish You Were Dead. Who wrote that s**t? It is stupid as h**l. Brooke here's some advice. Before wishing someone was dead listen to your voice. It sounds dead on this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Album SUCKS!","review":"I don't have much to say about the album except that it SUCKS! It's not what I expected.

We let him take one to bed and every night he says, \\"Hmmm...what cars you want today?\\" They are so sturdy and I feel comfortable with these cars because the only small parts are the wheels which are pretty hard to pull off (I tried). The only bad thing I would have to say is that the paint comes off - not easily, but easier than the Matchbox cars, probably because there is more detail. Nonetheless, I would definitely recommend these hands down.

His promised love has married another and there are a lot of changes that he doesn't understand.In addition some people don't think 5 years was long enough for him to be in prison, and try to kill him.He sets out to Austin to find who the real killer is but along the way he finds a kindred spirit and the closest friend he has ever had.I admit that I saw the ending coming long before the ending but how it was dealt with was wonderful and helped to lead to the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good book that became obsolete since November CTP","review":"I'm reading this book in my workplace.The book is giving a good coverage of the framework and the ways one can use it.The problem is the book relies heavily on examples and the code for these examples is obsolete.It seems Microsoft has drawn back some of the generic classes that appear in this book.I'm currently using the Microsoft examples supplied with the SDK documentation. But theses examples relies on onfiguration files which is quite different than the DIY approach the book has taken.

For those who like to work on their homes during the holidays or any other time, this is a good book to consult. The tools needed, how to select paint, prepare the surfaces exterior and interior, diagnose paint problems, the intricacies of how to get to the hard-to-get high places and corners, how to paint evenly, are all described well. The wallpapering section has many helpful hints. While anyone can somewhat match patterns straight and down, the authors have quite a lot of experience with problem solving, and have suggestions for the novice and the somewhat experienced. A handy book for looking up as questions arise, because the basics in this book are as good today as it was 40+ years ago.

Steven shows us that the world of fingerstyle guitar has not lost it's edge, passion, sensitivity, or sense of humor. Whistle While You Walk, Flyin' Low, and Playing On Dad's New Grass remind us of some of the fun in life, and would make almost any technique fanatic content. Songs like Rusty's Spirit, If Only, and Roses delicately weave a tapestry of sentiment, caring, and dedication that will fill one's heart with emotion. An amazing fact and credit to Steven's awe-inspiring capability is that there are no overdubs or punch-ins in his recordings. The songs you hear are recorded live - each in it's own single take. If you are a fingerstyle connoisseur or just someone who loves music from the heart, I would definitely recommend that you add this one to your collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"FUBAR","review":"wrong gauge, wrong words and or wrong photo?the photo shows white face.looking on equus site the photo here is correct and the words are wrong.way to go amozoned."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"very elegant at partys and so easy to use. makes a wedding table look very elegant, if you or someone you know is planning a wedding or bridal shower this is a must buy....."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"I was very upset when I received this product.

Much as in real life we often have a devil and angel talking to use when making tough decisions.

I only made it halfway through before realizing I was avoiding picking up where I left off in this book. While the author did create some interesting characters, oftentimes their actions or thoughts or dialogue were implausible and hard to swallow that someone would actually do or think or say such a thing. Also, there were many times I had to re-read a paragraph again to to glean \\"WHO said this?\\" or \\"WHAT is s/he talking about?\\" From an English perspective, misplaced modifiers and shifting POV made for choppy reading experience. Glimpses of a good author here, though sometimes waaay off the mark. The characters themselves, the story (what there is of it), and the writing were all too off-putting for me to finish this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Southern Novel Award","review":"Since this was McCorkle's fifth (long-awaited) novel, I was anticipating it greatly. But I found the plot too much like Lee Smith's FAMILY LINEN. Surely after five or six novels an author gets better, right? There's more to fiction than characters talking non-stop. There's got to be more than slapstick comedy. Like many North Carolina authors, Jill is the darling. Can't do any wrong. But readers will be the final judge.And she is NOT the \\"new\\" Eudora Welty. If anyone in the south deserves that title, it's Lee Smith, the grand dame of literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"I love Myrtle Beach and all of the South and was very excited to read a Southern author.

The distance between the unit and the headrest leaves a gap and my dog can get through it (60 pound lab). The screw that is used to tighten the unit when expanded is worthless, when lightly tightened - it stripped out. Also when tightened between the floor and the roof, my dog can lightly tap it and move it out of the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"This is a compact and effective way to control my dog in the back of my SUV.

So far it has kept the dogs in the back, as intended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"I found this book to be very short on any kind of meat or details. I'm very tempted to ask for my money back. There is no insight here - the book could have been compiled from a series of press releases. I think the standard of the book is typified by the 'bibliography' which seems to list every single article the author has ever written, including in magazines like Computer Shopper a decade ago. How that is supposed to be any help to anybody I cannot see. Do yourself a favor and skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Current, and To the Point","review":"I really enjoyed this book; it seemed to answer all of the questions I had about application integration.

However, we immediately noticed that there was some difficulty with the handle, specifically that it was difficult to make it go all the way back down, requiring seveal attempts each time with a force that could damage it. The second problem is that on the first trip, essentially the first time it was used, we noticed a tear in the material along the bottom of the pack.

When I received it I thought it was sturdy enough for a fifth grader to take her books with her from class to class and out to the car after school. It was not dragged down sidewalks, or on a bus, just the above mentioned places. It has been less than one month and it is coming apart at the front corners on both sides. It is not wearing any better than the one I bought my granddaughter at Walmart this fall for a lot less money. Now I have to not only replace this one but hopefully the company will honor their return policy. But nevertheless I am disgusted and won't buy a Jansport again."},{"rating":"1","title":"JanSport shows their inexperience in adding a rolling apparatus to their packs","review":"Having been a fan of conventional backpacks made by JanSport, our family decided to give them a try on a rolling model. Big mistake. The telescoping tubes that make up the pull handle are rickety, and one of them almost immediately started to get stuck 95% of the time when trying to put it back in. So we're standing in the parking lot with the car's trunk lid open, not able to fit the thing in because the handle won't go back in.Shoulda known better! Now we'll only go with a company that has been making the *rolling* models for a long time. E.g. a Dakine model we bought has fared *much* better. The Zuca is also rock solid (albeit a very different style of product of course) and even a Nike model (that replaced the frustrating JanSport one for my son) has been fine thus far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase!","review":"Excellent quality, very spacious and colourful design!

She has since flown with it twice and loves the way it handles. It has enough room to store all of the items she finds necessary to carry on and doesn't have to worry about lifting it into the overhead bin.The only minor complaint I have is when storing the handle, the second stage requires extra pressure to collapse it."},{"rating":"2","title":"School Backpack","review":"My 10 year old daughter is using this as a backpack for 5th grade because her books are quite heavy. It works quite well and she is very happy with it.

As he had had it for some time, I agreed to purchase this one for him. He loves it. It carries all of his 6th grade books, papers, and school necessities as he changes classrooms. Some of his books are rather heavy. It has been just what he needed. It also addresses the medical concerns regarding the back problems now being encountered by young children who carry too much weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really like this backpack!","review":"I've been looking for a smaller travel bag that would fit more easily in overhead compartments on airplanes.

I have recommended them to all my friends and I will continue to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"crazy stuff","review":"As the only recording of Eight Songs for a Mad King available at the moment, this is essential listening for lovers of contemporary music and wacky musical theater. Peter Maxwell Davies plays here with the potential of the human voice, forcing the \\"Mad King\\" George, played by a fine Julius Eastman, to push himself to the limit, making use of a full 5 octaves. The Fires of London was never a particularly strong group, especially in comparison with modern ensembles of the same instrumentation such as Eighth Blackbird. But despite a dry, studio sound and some technical flubs from the players, they do well enough to not damage the overall recording. There are sections that have made me shiver consistently, through dozens of listenings, in particular Eastman's howling at the end.Miss Donnithorne's Maggot is an easily forgettable work in comparison to Eight Songs, but its an understandable coupling on this disc, and it doesn't detract from the value."},{"rating":"1","title":"great piece, but hard to tell from this recording","review":"Eight Songs for a Mad King is a fantastic piece of music theater, but it's not the sort of classical music most people would put on for recreational listening. The piece is probably best appreciated in a live performance.The performance on this recording is spirited, but unfortunately Eastman sings a great many incorrect pitches, rhythms, dynamics, often gets out of sync with the ensemble, and adds lots of silly character voices and random effects where none are called for in the score. A pity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Assaultive.","review":"Assaultively assaultive. With much assaultiveness.This album is almost completely unlistenable. Eight Songs For a Mad King is one of the most excruciating pieces written for male voice I have ever heard.I have seen this album, employed on a college campus, as follows:when the party was over, and it was time for people to go home, you put this album on. Within 20 minutes- no matter how diehard the guests, no matter how much booze- everyone was gone.I cannot recommend this album for any purpose other than audial torture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action Packed!!!!!!","review":"I completely enjoyed this book!!!!!! The story grabs you in the first chapter and holds you captive until the last page. Without giving up the plot...this story teaches lessons from the street through the eyes of several very interesting and well-developed characters. This is not your typical drug dealer meets HO novel:^)....Dennis Wise definitely has a valuable and well-articulated message in this book. If you read between the lines, the lessons learned and taught by these Hustlers can be applied to anyone in the GAME or NOT.

The constellations are universally (though other cultures had different interpretations of them) known by their Greek and Roman identities. To use anything else is just confusing and serves no purpose.This isn't even a new idea. Attempts have been made in the past, hundreds of years ago, to redefine the constellations to show Christian figures. It's as senseless now as it was then.BTW, not all Christians believe the world is only 6,000 years old.

The constellations are part of the natural world, the way it was laid down the ancients long before these silly tribe of jesus people started staking their claims and mucking it up. The stars are the only thing can help guide us in keeping harmony with all on the planet, the moon and the sun and the natural cycles and all the people to make peace with one another rather than fighting that goes on and on because of greed and these silly ideas. To have these people try to scratch their stupid notions across the sacred skies is about all i can stomach.

I had seen the Mike Hammer TV series, but had never read any of Spillane's books. I decided to dive in by reading the three novels in this collection. I was glad I did. Although the writing is hardly great literature, and Hammer is more a juvenile comic book fantasy than a well-developed sympathetic character, I could barely put the book down until I had finished all three of the novels. Quite simply, Spillane is a hell of a story teller. If you are also unacquainted with Mickey Spillane, reading this book will be well worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative book!","review":"After searching the net and bookstores alike for accounts of what others go thru while on anti-depressant medication, this book has been a Godsend. With personal accounts of how others encounter and perceive depression, and it's alleviation through Prozac and other SSRI's, the book seems to illustrate that the various maladies of the disease are uniform.

It's approximately like trying to give a day-long boating safety class in one hour. Most of information needs to be left out and only a few highlights can be presented. The highlights may almost be enough to get by, but they're definitely very far from a complete education.I find the Coast Guard Auxillary'sBoating Skills and Seamanship, 13th Editionbook to be vastly superior, and at a significantly lower cost.On the other hand, simple advice which is mentioned in the video such as not anchoring at the transom could have saved the lives of those football players in Florida, so even the basic information in this video could be useful if widely disseminated and heeded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too big to put in a purse","review":"It is a nice looking leather wallet but too big to hold it in a small purse that I usually carry.Since I can put my passport in it, this wallet will be used when I travel overseas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Bitter Pill To Swallow Toward Healing Us!","review":"Brother Akil posits what those who have some semblance of a clue in the BLAK nation know, as to who is responsible for the BLAK nation's condition.

To those persons who attempt to discredit this work as racists, blaming white peole for the BLAK nation's condition, and or trying to belittle Akil's work, I ask you the question; Is what Akil says true or not? If it isn't true, then disprove what he says scientifically or be quiet in your rage and hypocrisy; it's gotten very old.

True enough the graphics are poor but the strategies used for each concept are wonderful. The concepts were explained with the novice learner in mind.

Following each introduction are a set of problems aimed at three progressively difficult skill levels. There is an answer sheet at the back of the book.Unfortunately, what's missing from this book is the essence of any math course: showing your work. Consequently, you will find no guidance or strategy(ies) for solving the problems. Moreover, if you have the wherewithall to solve the more difficult problems, you probably aren't going to find very useful the abecedarian introductions the author provides.These points, taken in conjuction with the amateurish, mouse-drawn computer graphics, make this one disappointing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Challenge math?","review":"I don't think it should be called challenge math.

I expected something simple on the first level of cards, but also got the same simple kissing and massaging on the last level of cards too! I expected the game to get us in the mood.

In the CD liner notes it lists: Music composed by Stewart Copeland. Music performed by Stewart Copeland, Judd Miller, Ron Aston and Jonathon Sheffer. Unfortunately, this is definately not Stewart's best work- far from it. The album is filled with native instruments and vocals galore. Sounds exciting, but detached from the film, the music is noisy and boring. Stewart can and has done much better. Check out \\"The Leapord Son\\" for Stewart at his best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Stewart Copeland?","review":"Stewart Copeland was listed as being associated with this CD. From what I can tell by listening, the only association is what Amazon.com has listed. There is no reference made on the information provided and no influence in the music. The music is a repetative theme of Island songs, and I mean repetative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captures the moments","review":"I was at the Cat's Cradle show in Carrboro, NC on November 11th when Mark Selinger shot the footage for this video. It was an amazing concert. David and Gillian had been there in September, less than two months before. We were advised when we bought tickets that the show was going to be recorded and that we would allow any footage to be relased. I don't think Mark ever turned the camera on the crowd from the front. There was a camera in the center asile, but it was also pointed right at the stage.Besides the fact that I personally would have loved to have had a show I attended documented in its entirety, I love this video. The first three tracks showing the actual recording of the tracks from \\"Time, the Revelator\\" are awesome. I think the video really captures the FEEL of the live show, at least the part from the Cat's Cradle.If you like David and Gillian, buy it and enjoy. And if it's too short for ya... well, it's one that I tend to start over when it's done anyway!Mona"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gillian Welch Fan","review":"If you are a fan of Gillian Welch,you will enjoy this dvd,it is folk music at its best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not buy again.","review":"This video is bla.

His voice is a cross between Sting & Bruce Springsteen. His new CD The Futurist is well put together and enjoyable to listen to. The songs all written by him (except for 2) and performed by him and a back-up of wonderful musicians and singers are creative and all tell a story. The album is jazzy & bluesy and I recommend it all who want to listen to a talented man who has come along way, especially with his courage to fight the addiction he had and finding someone who supports him in this fight.

It was over-orchestrated, cliche, and overdrawn.So I put it away and then came upon it a few months later.This time, I listened to the fullest extent and I LOVED it. I started to understand the lyrics and the piano is gorgeous. It is still over-orchestrated and I was hoping to hear a bit more of his voice rather than violins, but it was gorgeous. My top tracks - Man Like Me, Your Move, and Little Clowns.

Now, my hubby consideres me a terrible rock \\"snob\\", with most songs, I HATE when people do covers because 99.9% of the time they are not nearly as good as the origional, but Robert's cover of one of my favorite songs of all time is awsome!

Maybe another half-star would be in order because of its laugh-inducing, anti-depressant effect. Robert's \\"singing\\" is so self-conscious, mannered, and just plain awful, it's hard to believe the whole project isn't a joke. What was Sony Classical thinking? Did they just sign Robert Downey Jr. based on his notoriety? What did the people in the studio think when they witnessed this recording in-process? What does Robert's wife and friends tell him about his \\"music\\"???There is a heartfelt, poetic core to Robert's lyrics.

Somehow, MDC was under \\"mind control\\" when he shot the ex-Beatle.The author starts off by telling us he \\"has no personal axe to grind\\"; yet, throughout the book he criticizes Reagan and Nixon every chance he gets while making it sound as if everyone in the U.S. carries a gun. No axe to grind indeed.The anti-American attitude gets a bit tiring after a while. For example: \\"Lennon's body, wrapped incongruously in a black bag on a stretcher like a dead US Vietnam soldier...\\". What are we to infer from that analogy? What purpose does it serve?As for the story itself, the book presents some interesting points but nothing concrete that can prove Lennon was murdered by the CIA or some other arm of the government.

The author did the research on Belle-Epoque Paris and the Impressionists. The characters came to life for me. I learned some things about the artists, particularly Manet and Morisot, and the history of the period that I didn't know. But Harper-Collins--you should be mortified to send copy to print like this!

She remains romantically detached, however, until she meets the dashing General Rollen (Jean Marais). The problem is Rollen's longtime friend Henri (Mel Ferrer)also loves the princess; thus ensues a romantic triangle.The movie has the airiness of a well-choreographed light operetta and is greatly abetted by Claude Renoir's superb color photography.

It tells kids that they can not be themselves in Christ, the have to be what Mr. Luce wants them to be. Kids need to be individual and love Christ in their own way, not in the way that this devotional tells them to. This book tells kids that they need to trash all the music they like, and give up almost all the secular events that they like. I do not agree withthis because I think one of the most important things about being a Christian is finding God in every situation no matter how secular. God is everywhere, not just where Mr. Luce tells kids where He is, but everywhere.

Contrary to the title, the book deals almost exclusively with the Serbs, defending their cause as civil war spread in Former Yugoslavia in the early 90s. When the author mentions the Croats, it is only to undermine their historical role in the region, further emphasizing Serbian \\"supreme\\" status. This book is not recommended to anyone seeking for a broad, overall, unbiased interpretation of Yugoslavian history and how this relates to the recent civil war. It is excellent, though, as an example of the kind of pathological, chauvinistic nationalism that ignited the wars. Sadly, even in its propaganda role this book is mediocre at its best. I gave one star to this book, wondering if it was too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased and incomplete.","review":"As a relatively young American, with little knowledge of the conflict in the Balkans, I decided to pick up a book that would give me an unbiased opinion on the conflict, so that I could form my own opinion. I thought that a book with the title, \\"Serbs and Croats: The Struggle in Yugoslavia\\" would be such a book. I was wrong. While informative, the information does have a very strong slant. This is probably due to the heavy influence the Serbs have on the media. It is the same influence that led to our nation's ignorance of the Concentration camps set up in Serbia and Croatia during the war. So, if you are looking for an interesting and quick read on the topic, this is a book to read, however, if you want an unbiased book, this is NOT the book to read. I have also picked up Croatia: A History, which is surprisingly much less biased, and much more thorough. I would recommend that book over Serbs and Croats, if you want something more substantial, and less biased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greater Serbian Garbage!","review":"Plain & simple, this book is garbage! However, this is a great example of how Serbs try to manipulate historical facts for their own good. Mr. Dragnich is also a good example of the type of hatred and show of disrespect Serbian extremists have for their fellow neighbours, whether it be Croats, Bosnians, Albanians, Macedonians, etc. It is hard to believe that this man actually taught at Vanderbilt University. To think his students learned nothing! What a waste of tuition! Save yourself some money and get this one at the library like I did if you are interested in how Serbian extremists think. One star is two stars too much for this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragnich the dribbler strikes again","review":"One star is too much for this pathetic dribble from a \\"scholar\\" who has dedicated his life to proving that the good guys (ie the Serbs) are always good and the bad guys (ie non Serbs) are always bad.Forget about the dribbler and his bib - read a real history book written by a real historian:The National Question in Yugoslavia: Origins, History, Politics"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Serbs gave so much...","review":"...and were stabbed in the back.\\"Much of what? I hope the author of this statement doesn't try to imply that the Serbs brought a higher level of education, culture and improvement of living standards with them when the Yugoslav state was formed?Stabbed by whom? The Serbs shot themselves in the foot tenfold when treating the 'newly acquired areas' as Serbian Lebensraum, the last phase of which unfolded right in front of international cameras in the 1990's.Serbian propaganda has vehemently been trying to cast especially Croats as being genocidal by nature and responsible for the breakup of Yugoslavia, and at the same time casting the Serbs in the role of benefactor and perpetual victim. This book fits nicely together with other publications from pathological Serb propagandists - scholars or non-scholars. It should not be used as a reference to neither Yugoslav history nor as a guide to understand the reason behind the breakup of Yugoslavia."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a Serb view of Yugoslav history.","review":"This book purports to be objective, but is instead a Serb view of Yugoslav history. For a more detailed and scholarly assessment of this work than I can give, please look at the review of this book in the \\"Book World\\" section of the Washington Post for November 1, 1992. Written by Anna Husarska, the review is right on the money. Although Dragnich's book deserves a \\"1\\" for objectivity, as a propaganda piece it rates a \\"10.&quot"},{"rating":"2","title":"very descriptive of the necessity to reach out to friends","review":"Great book. This quote is just one that summarizes the insights gained by the author in her journeys into the meaning of friendship:\\"When you take a stand on friendship, when in rage, you make it clear--This friendship is over, get out--you are defining the rest of your life. I didn't know then what I was doing.\\"......\\"You walk around with a void inside that you can never adequately explain.\\"This book is very well written"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that Good. Sorry","review":"First, let me get on my soapbox once more to decry the 'star inflation' that is found on this website. I mean, get real, are all the books out there really deserving of 5 stars! This book is a case in point. Don't get me wrong, memoirs are my favorite genre. But this book is tedious. Beth is a very likable person, only it seemed like she couldn't make up her mind. Did she want to write a memoir, or a book of essays on friendship? Instead of choosing one, she decided to do both; without pulling it off. I also did not find her prose to be luminous or poetic, but overwraught. Sorry. Finally, at several points in the book I got the feeling that Beth was searching out friendship opportunities with an eye that they could be included in the book she was working on. Beth, if you ever read this, please don't be discouraged by this review. You do have talent. Just don't try so hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to La Rissa?!","review":"This is a terrible follow-up to \\"Jay & Jane\\"! Please, do not waste your money. If you do not have the \\"Jay & Jane\\" single or a CD with this song on it, get your hands on it! The mixes on \\"Someone to Love Me\\" (Except the S. Christina remix) are the worst remixes that I have ever heard. Hopefully, La Rissa is not on the downward spiral... even though it seems like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Will Love Her Now?","review":"First of all I would like to say if this is what she has to offer than I don't think she will ever live up to her hot single \\"I Do Both Jay & Jane\\". Really the beats to these remixes are enoying and you can't even make out the song (If There is one)because every time you put a different remix on it is so mixed up that you don't even know what going on. What up with the Spanish Version? (Just Horrible) The only reason I'm giving her a 2 is because after the first 5 remixes I gave up meaning that there might be some actually good scrubble on here. It's sad to see such talent go to waste like this. She leaves us with this song and I leave you with this question, Who Will Love Her Now?"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all in the delivery.","review":"I enjoyed all three books, i.e. Da Vinci, Angels..., and Deception Point. I read the unabridged Da Vinci, and enjoyed it more than the abridged \\"audio\\" Da Vinci. The man who read Da Vinci, was very monotone, and detracted from the plot. However, the persons who did Angels and Deception Point were excellent, and definitely added to the final product. I highly recommend all three. Dan Brown is extremely talented, and knows how to grab the reader and immerse them into the plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift for that special reader in your life","review":"Dan Brown writes with a sense of a virtual time machine.

As a massive chinese product you can cut your fingers with its bad finishes. Lock door doesn't close. I had to use a rubber ring to keep the phone inside the case.It looks nice... but only for the picture. Look for a leather case; It will be better and non frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design is Sure to Disappoint","review":"I am deeply disappointed with this \\"Hard Case\\". First, the belt clip had no locking mechanism so everytime I sat down the case would disconnect from the belt clip and fall to the floor. I went to Radio Shack the day after I received this item in the mail and bought a locking type belt clip. That wouldn't have been so bad if that was the only problem. The second problem I encountered was the case clasp. This poorly designed clasp failed to keep the lid of the case closed. Consequently, my phone fell out of the case to the floor. I am only fortunate that it fell on carpeting rather than some hard concrete floor or sidewalk. I strongly recommend that you do not buy this item. You will be disappointed and you could end up having to spend a great deal more money fixing or replacing your phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good Case for Your Phone","review":"I purchased this case to protect my Cingular 8925. Seemed like a good case at first, but two days into it the belt clip fell apart. I put another clip on it, and while taking my kids out of the car the door to the case opened up and my phone fell out (it needs a lock). Finally, a small piece of sharp metal on the case came off and punctured my finger.On a positive note, the company I purchased it from was responsive and offered a replacement or different item. Unfortunately my phone was damaged and I had to replace it with a different model and the company does not have cases for my new phone. I have not yet completely resolved the issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ok","review":"I found it to add too much weight when trying to use it as a belt clip and it was too cumbersome trying to get it out of the holder. I'm actually using this as a car holder instead of a belt clip. I just attached it to my dash, and set the phone inside while I'm driving so I can easily see who's calling. Works well in that function."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Concert","review":"The concert was great and my only complaint is that there are only 6 songs on this 22 minute DVD. I love the music video for \\"These Are The Days\\", but 2 or 3 music videos would have been even better. That's the only other drawback that prevents me from giving this concert 5 stars. O-TOWN should have performed all 12 songs from the O2 concert for this DVD release. If this concert had been just 40 minutes longer I would have given it 5 stars. One huge bonus is an interview with the guys. I only recommend buying this DVD if you are a really big fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong about paganism in the United States","review":"As a general overview of (neo) pagan beliefs, the book is basically accurate. However, the author clearly has no understanding of American religious beliefs, history, or American culture in general. Conceptually, the book is often astoundingly wrong--see the other Amazon reviews--and the book lacks even the basic facts about paganism or any religion in the United States. The author has not consulted the readily available scholarly work on neopaganism in the United States, and he seems unfamiliar with pagan authors as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny.","review":"This is considered something of a classic, but it beats me why.

I came w/out the poster, I contacted Amazon who promised that if returned and re-ordered, it would come w/the poster. The 2nd time I got a smaller book, again without the poster. I called Amazon who told me to return again and that the product would be placed under investigation and not available during that time. They said after about 10 days, check the item, if it's avail then you can reorder. I'm surprised to see it is still available, though, it's been a few days only and it was always available. I'd love to get it with the poster but won't risk a 3rd order!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not for kids","review":"The poses are too advanced for younger children.

Yoga is one of those wonderful things."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Darling Book","review":"Hatha Yoga is generally form based. Elephants need to know the \\"proper\\" position for their trunks while they perform asanas. The author shows where the trunks should be positioned for maximum effect.Humans can also follow the book's pictures, sans the trunk positions, and perform a nice hatha class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great choice for budding yoginis","review":"What a fun, colorful book! If you are interested in the poster (it is adorable) be sure you purchase the correct format, the book comes in two: a large format 11.5 x 9 inches with the accompanying 22x26 inch poster and a smaller 8.5x 6.5 inch edition without a poster. The reviews on Amazon suggest that the poster accompanies both formats, this is not the case.My daughter (almost 4) loves this book and asks for it frequently. Several of the poses are far too complicated for the little ones (under 8), but with Babar as our guide we've worked through about half of the poses and had a blast doing so.The book offers a nice visual breakdown of several basic asanas/poses. It not only introduces kids to yoga, but prompts skill building by teaching kids how to decode sequence and movement through static visual cues. Watching my daughter work through the poses based only on her \\"reading\\" of the detailed illustrations is great fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great drama","review":"If you enjoyed the series in the 1980's, you'll enjoy these two episodes.

I received it in the mail and was surprised to see it is larger than what I expected. The design is great, although the skulls around the circle seem to be a bit cheesy, it is one of the best baphomet pendants I have seen. The chain seems a bit flimsy, but it has not yet broken, and that is what counts. It has a nice weight to it and, I assume, would not be easy to lose. Over all, it is a great pendant and I suggest this one over any other I can find on amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome evil necklace!","review":"As I play guitar in a Death Metal band, these types of accessories are required. This one however, kicks it up a notch in the evil department. At our last gig, I unveiled this for the first time.

Before you knew it, the unholy one himself appeared and caused a catastrophic disaster, enveloping the entire crowd. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied","review":"It's a little bigger than I expected, but that's my fault, not the pendants. It's MUCH more shiny and chrome than the picture suggests, which disappointed me a little; I'm not big on flashy, reflective things. You'll definitely want to just throw the chain away and get a black cord, or a different chain, as the one that comes with it is garbage. It breaks, the chrome coating wears off, revealing a dull coppery colour, and the clasp breaks within days. However, the pendant itself is very nice, if not a bit flashy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent pendant","review":"I love this pendant.Great quality,made well,very detailed and perfect size..I give this item 5 stars for it price it is a steal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Collectible and playable Star Wars game!","review":"This game has all the details that a fan can imagine: tokens, money, community chest, house, hotels!I was very impressed :)It definitely worths the $$$ !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed bride-to-be","review":"I ordered 2 of these wraps for my upcoming wedding and was so disappointed in the quality.

But the main character in this book just seemed so overwhelmingly lost and in general, the book felt like the author was on pot or something when he wrote it. I held out, however, (it was a birthday gift from my little sister after all) and I finished the book so I have to say that after pages and pages of dull narrative the ending was relatively interesting and almost cool. But still, I wouldn't have missed anything if I hadn't read this book and I don't know if I want to give this author another chance. I'm all for searching for the things that will give one's life a deeper and truer meaning, but this book is just boring, even if it is set in one of my most favourite countries in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"bizarre waste of paper","review":"My first feeling after reading this book was that I would have been better off watching tv.

It was such a long time ago that I read something of the same intensity that I had to hold myself back in order to gain some time to ponder over the things I read, that it took me 2 weeks to read this book, even though normally it would have taken me a day and a night.

These were something no worker or inspector could miss, and they would not wash off - they were in the finish.

It kneads bread dough faster and more efficiently than I do by hand, saving my ligaments from wear and tear. With whole wheat bread, it has an alarming tendency to smoke and overheat, even when using less than the max recommended amount of dough. I believe this is because I haven't yet converted my recipes for less kneading. I'm told by others who've used these mixers that it's common for the motor to smoke and get hot, so I hope this means it will last many years despite frequent use. Still, I should probably knock 2 to 3 minutes off the kneading time of any bread recipe to avoid harming the motor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Mixer for about a Year...","review":"Buy this mixer if you don't mind fixing it every 1-2 years.

The gear housing broke after a year and since then it has been in for repairs twice. Both times, it broke again the first time I used it. It cost over [...] to get fixed and takes a month since the part has to be ordered in. I would never buy a Kitchenaid again. Kitchenaid has not been helpful on the phone as the warranty is expired and they say I should just take it in again. They also told me that mixing bread dough is hard on the machine ... then perhaps they shouldn't promote its bread kneading capability so enthusiastically."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly Great","review":"My husband and I got this as a gift from my inlaws. For the most part it's absolutely wonderful, I use it all the time. The only down side is that the whisk doesn't quite make it to the bottom of the bowl so I have to stop everything and scrape it with a spatula halfway through. We were told the Viking mixer doesn't have that problem and if we had to start all over again we'd probably spend the extra money on that instead. Still, it is absolutely worth having, we havent had any ther problems with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoyed it while it lasted...","review":"I liked this mixer a lot - while it lasted.Unfortunately, like a lot of other reviewers have noted on the web, the 500 Pro series tends to simply quit without a whimper.And a call to Kitchenaid on 1-30-2012 confirms that KA no longer repairs these unless it is less than a year old.They will replace them if they are within the one-year warranty, and you are willing to pay the shipping.It was a wonderful mixer, but it just died with no warning; all the legendary Kitchenaid Service and warranty information is long gone.These are surely cheap enough, but not when you have to consider them disposable.Now I need to find a brand that will stand behind its product.I liked the product, but the company has lost a 3rd generation customer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy KitchenAid quality","review":"JUNK!

The songs are repetitive to the point of being annoying and the singing and lyrics are inane. There is no trademark thick harmonies, no Gizmo, no spectacular production that one would expect from GC.

This book discussed the anchoring of todays skyscrapers and large structures.

There were not many laughs at all and stuck in between was this very awkward storyline that attempted to be a well rounded script, but just failed on every level. It was very uncomfortable at times when it seemed sometimes was meant to be funny, but I was not sure what to do because it wasn't. It is not one of those movies that you can watch over and over, still laugh and have fun. Its more like a movie you can watch when you have extra money to waste, see it at a garage sale or something, or if you can borrow it off the schmuck that actually bought it.

Some look good in the previews only to stink it up.This one does not!Ed Helms stars as his typical loveable dorky innocent character. I love John C. Reilly in many of his supporting roles, but in this one, he almost steals the show. It just shows his depth of range and comedic talent. Anne Heche is sexy and understated in her role. This is a really really well acted film. Someone else wrote in their review how the writing allows comedic situations to unfold and I wholeheartedly support that statement.

Well, she has read the book from cover to cover. Her recommendation, and I agree, is that you can read this book, ignoring the parts about the MCSE exams, and get as much excellent information as any of those $75 books.

In short, Windows 98:Exam 70-098 delivers one of the broadest spectrums of information in the easiest writing style I've had a pleasure to read. I've read a lot of dry, technical material and it seems like most writers have no interest in their subject, seemingly uncaring if their reader understands anything or not. But Patrick Neal in Windows 98:Exam 70-098, has a real knack for simplifying even the most complex subjects in a very pleasant tone. For me, having read a lot of books that have put me to sleep, I found this book downright entertaining!

On the other hand, this particular toothpaste is a very good toothpaste that's the right consistency and, of course, it's cheap. At retail I found it on clearance for under a buck. It's excellent for brushing after meals and leaves your mouth feeling very clean; equal to if not better than colgate smartfoam without the limited irritation.

It was heart-breaking to see his facial expressions everyday when he realized he could no longer watch his beloved show. Then one day, I was on-line and happened to come across an advertisement for Scooby products. Naturally, I clicked, saw the Mystery Machine and just knew I had to get this for him. I don't know what he enjoys more... looking at the Mystery Machine on his shelf (next to his chair) or getting to watch Scooby once again, but all I do know is, I have NEVER seen him so happy.

The chapters are mislabeled (for example Chapter 6 is incorrectly headed on each page in the chapter as Chapter 8, but the whole book is out of order like that).

It's about the mystery behind the death of a Canadian astronomer in Hawaii. The protagonist is sent from Canada to investigate it, and she discovers there are a lot of politics and intrigue behind why he died.I stopped reading it about half the way through; it bored me. I didn't care about the mystery.

All around disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"rather boring","review":"I snap up all of Mary Jo Putney's books, but I have to admit this might be changing in regards to her contemporary novels. This most recent one was a good example of the problems I have with her contemporary efforts. I never felt a connection to the main characters - they were rather boring and flat. There is value in reading about the love of two ordinary people, but these people were not just ordinary; they were boring. I felt that the romantic situations were a little contrived, too. I read romance novels primarily for the character development, this definitely took a backseat to the plot in this novel. Unfortunately, I didn't have much interest in the plot, either. It, too, was sort of dull and flat. In the end, I was much more interested in the story of the secondary characters than the two protagonists. I gave the book two stars, mostly because I like Mary Jo Putney in general, but I do not recommend this book to other readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many characters from previous books...","review":"I read pretty much all of Mary Jo Putney books, but I am a little disapointed in this one.

The two artists both seem to have a real understanding and empathy with the music. Miss Walker's mezzo-soprano is lovely and rich, but never overpowers the delicate vocal lines, and is especially effective in the songs by Albert Roussel. Mr. Vignoles is a singer's dream of an accompanist -- I never thought, while listening, that I was listening to two people, but rather to one piece of music.

Very few acts have been able to do the R&B tie in with their tracks and 'Plain Rap' is certainly not one of them. They should of learned from LabCabin that their R&B ...... The beats, with exception to the remix track, sound like something a 9 year old could make with their computer. If you are looking for a great rap album go buy Bizarre Ride II.

The principal players are young Frank Stone, his lovely young wife Giovanna (ex-Marcolli), Sharon Nichols, and the irrascable Ruy Sanchez. The *bad guys*, Cardinal Borjas and a lengthy cast of characters are seeking to neutralize pope Urban VIII, due to his acceptance of the USE and the *foreighn witches* from Grantville.The first half of the book nearly put me off from finishing--lots of plotting in the back rooms. Conspiracy! But as time progressed, we find that the simple deposition of the pope by a political process was not to be! A violent plot to murder the pope and his supporters unfolds in a burst of exciting action. Ruy Sanchez, the new husband of Sharon Niichols, and Tom Simpson aid in rescuing the pope and providing political asylum. Much better, overall, than *The Galileo Affair*, which I felt was pretty contrived.

I'm old enough to have read 1632 when it was a stand alone book, and have loved it's growing into this weird re-write of history. I am also interested in the history of religion and how it relates to political history. This book continues the 1632 series tradition of including the history of people of all classes in the story.

Sometimes the songs were just downright obnoxious, but the album didn't appear to show many surprises or changes of importance.The mixing was done relatively well on this album by a mysterious DJ, and I'd say its good if you need deep thumping music for a background to studying, reading, etc., but is not for paying a lot of attention to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed...","review":"The songs are very redundant and sound the same after a short while.

Too little solid evidence. The foundation for the authors' conclusions is lacking. This book has earmarks I often see in conspiracy books - multiple repetitions of certain \\"facts,\\" obvious objections ignored or dismissed out of hand, jumping to a conclusion when there is information to support an opposing or differing conclusion, and holding back significant information on one questionable theory or another. (Here in the interests of \\"national security.\\") This book likely made money and may have added something to the ongoing seach for truth about the Kennedy assassination, but it isn't the final answer. I don't know when, if ever, a solid, comprehensive, determination will be made. On Nov. 22, 2010, 47 years will have elapsed since the assassination.

Finally an answer to all of those lingering questions of why the Government tried so hard to cover up the factual evidence in this Presidential assassination. This book is not like Oliver Stone's made up movie about Kennedy's death, but rather the rest of the story that is stranger than fiction. Until all of the Goverment secret files are released many years from now, this book should correct the innacurate record of American history during this period. Period!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mafia Killed Kennedy","review":"This book presents the case that Mafia Kingpins like Carlos Marcello and Santos Trafficante masterminded and conspired alongside \\"rogue\\" elements of the C.I.A to kill Pres.

I can buy that the Mafia wanted JFK dead, and even set up Oswald for the fall, but this book doesn't present a cogent narrative to prove that point, just alot of seemingly disconnected and aimless wandering of facts. And there was really nothing new about the assassination itself that was interesting.

As a personal note, I lived in all those cities in my lifetime so far (I was born after 11-22-63, so I had nothing to do with it [ :) ])Just HOW in the world could Oswald have done it all by his lonesome if there were other recent attempts in these cities just before Dallas?

Featuring legendary guest trumpeter Wadada Leo Smith and saxophonist Evan Parker, Spring Heel Jack have created a sound environment both subtly dissonant yet achingly beautiful.While the guest improvisors are old school free jazzers, the leaders of this session come from a background more firmly rooted in contemporary pop music. The resulting combination yields an album rich in horn-based interplay, with a melodic and structural foundation that is as richly textural as it is nostalgically bittersweet. There is a sense of buried musical traditions in the organ chords, samples and feedback that add a level of emotional depth rarely heard in modern improvisational meetings like this.

Unfortunately some are after Corstic's treasures, and Hanse looks like a handy guy to fetch them out of Corstic's maze, especially if he can be persuaded by the kidnapping of his girl Mignureal...I like Hanse, I like humor, and I like strange magical mazes as much as anyone.

I think I sat there for the first 10 minutes, trying to get my sons attention, waiting for the fun music to start, before I realized that it had actually started 10 minutes ago. The music is so mellow, that it might be the perfect music to have in the back ground for my son to fall asleep to.This DVD is not what to get, if you are looking for something fun, with good beats, to dance and play with your baby.If you are looking to show your baby animals from different countries, and some people, and some mellow music to try to calm them down before they go to bed, then maybe this product is for you.I gave it two stars, because in between the little segments, he did like the little puppet shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow this is terrible","review":"Watered-down, dumbed-down, sanitized music.

The music is pretty, but sometimes doesn't match the country that is being shown. My biggest problem with this video involves the misbehaving puppets. In one segment, one puppet steals the other puppet's hat and runs away. In another segment, one puppet has more fruit on its head so the other puppet pushes her.

I wear ladies panties and found them too narrow in the crotch. With the Kwik Sew patterns, panties are somewhat wider in the gusset and thus suit the male anatomy much better.By following the expert instructions and ideas, i soon was creating nylon and acetate and satin panties that fit me !By learning which fabrics stretch more, I found which supported in front better and which just plain felt good.If you want old fashioned panties that fit (men would appreciate the wide bottom granny panties) this book is for you.By adjusting and updating (in your own way) the patterns for new stylishness, there is no limit to what fun undies you can have.One can even create man style panties with a pouch front that lifts and supports more !Tricot can be tough to work with but the rewards in wearing that silky caressing fabric makes it all worthwhile.Good book !"},{"rating":"2","title":"the greatest underground punk band","review":"this band kicks serious a**!

The book is written in a clear and easy to read style, with some drawings and photographs. The first half of the book covers low/unknown risk stops, and the second half focuses on high risk stops.The first half is exellent, and contains a lot of very useful information (several ways to overcome the problem of tinted windows, for example). The second half is not so good, and the book gets a bit repetitive towards the end. However, the tactics in this book are realistic and simple enough to remember even in a high stress situation.

I'm not flexible in any way, even though I'm in relativly good shape. At first, I was wary, it seemed rather cheesy, but this video has four 20 minute secessions walking you through every move in detail. I felt like I had a personal trainer. Every time my posture or form was wrong she would point it out. She knew just where a beginners weakness would be. I've only gone through the first half of the video, but I can't wait to master this program and move onto the rest of Lilias' workouts. I must say this is THE BEST video to try for a true beginner. (anyone with any experience would probably find it too simple) after a few days of using it, I've already gotten multiple comments how how I carry my self with a more relaxed confidence.

But it is intellegent, it is honest and beautiful. I think this is some of Stephen Schwartz's best work.The cast is composed of an inter-racial group of people who's voices blend together and are very charming.I didn't expect to like Stephanie Mills much in a Broadway type setting, but she really is very good.I reccomend this CD if you like to think.

Paris doesn't need to be \\"sold\\" as a tourist destination, but this book contributes so much to giving the visitor a better appreciation of what the city offers (as if that's possible!).The historical annotations provided the much-needed perspective on the significance of everything we were seeing.I especially liked the occasional bursts of humor that had me guffawing, and that added to the whole experience. Thanks for including the tip on going to the rooftop of the Samarataine for a panoramic view of Paris.

Karen is very dull and has little personality. The entire workout takes place in a boring room and the music was boring as well. The packaging makes it appear that you will be doing 7 different workouts, but there are only a few segments that are pieced together. It is a very basic workout which doesn't make me work up a sweat and the weight training segments don't make me sore the next day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repeat product!","review":"If you have the Karen Voight video titled \\"Burn and Firm\\" Circuit Training - don't bother with this product. It is the same thing!!! Burn & Firm is a great work out and what Slim Physique does is breaks down Burn & Firm by taking different segments of it and having you do part of it each day for 30 minutes. For example - on Monday you will do the lower body workout - on Tuesday you may do the upper body workout. Both of these are directly from Burn & Firm which you can break down by yourself. The only new thing on this DVD is the yoga - which I'm guessing is from one of her other DVDs. I was greatly disappointed with this purchase.

Definetly worth purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Disney Disappointment","review":"Lately Disney has been unable to produce a decent movie that doesn't have the PIXAR name attached to it. I love all the Pixar films, but Princess and the Frog is another reminder of why Disney needs Pixar so much!!! I felt like the movie had some good moments, but I would have to say the Voo-doo magic and villianous moments ruined the movie for me. This is supposed to be a children's movie targeting young girls, but I don't feel it is at all appropriate for young children to watch. I am quite surprised Disney would produce this and market it to kids given how much the movie entertains the dark magic theme. I am disappointed in the story development, lack of good songs, fear factor for children, and would never consider this a great film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racist movie","review":"From a multi-racial family, this movie disappoints on so many levels.

The interaction of the frog stories is very cute and the whole idea of a princess having to kiss a frog to make him human again. However, this story is about Voodoo magic and it is something a lot of kids will not understand and are going to become frightened when they see several images as the movie goes along. Besides the scary images (which also include showing the bad guy walking around and a completely different image of its shadow against the walls) there is also references to Satan as the Shadow Man mentions during several occasions his 'master' (or something like that).I would not buy this movie to any kid. I strongly recommend an adult to watch it first before showing it to a kid. I do not think Disney should have gone to the extremes with the Voodoo and black magic stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Disappointing","review":"Talk about a disappointment. We have been dying to watch this movie since it came out. We finally got it for Christmas and stopped 30 min into it. The movie itself for quality was great, but there is a voodoo doctor in there that uses very dark and demonic magic to conjure up spirits and demons from the other side. In return for the power he promises to deliver lost souls to the ones he calls his 'friends on the other side'. It definitely is not for children and I really don't feel for adults either since he's blatantly using satanic dark magic. It never mentions this on the case and we sure wouldn't have bought it. I think Disney went way to far on this. Will not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S ABOUT TIME!","review":"It's great to see Disney include an African-American in their princess storylines. I LOVE this movie!

They have a dark sense about in this movie,, There is the evil guy who is into voodoo and witchcraft, he sings a song about \\"having friends on the other side\\" what other side? hmmm. Also there is dancing voodoo dolls and spirits that go after the princess frog and prince frog. Really dark I feel.. It is too bad, they could have done more for such an anticipated film.

Sure you can pray or wish on a star or whatever. But you've got to back it up with action and I'm happy to show this to my children so they can further internalize the idea.Thankfully my kids, especially my not-quite-age-3 daughter loves this.

It's a story of an African-American girl named Tiana who grows up looking for her prince, while she dreams of opening her own diner. Tiana works as a waitress and tries to save enough money so she can open her own eatery. She winds up kissing a grog, getting transformed into a frog herself. Then they go on a quest to return to human form. Being where this story does take place in Louisiana there is a certain amount of let's say the darker side of Louisiana including things like voodoo. All in all it's a very interesting film.

I was initially excited as I thought it meant the return of good Disney movies (before Pixar joined) like Lion King, Little Mermaid, Pocahontas, etc. There was so much hype. After watching all the previews there I knew the film sucked.I saw the film twice. Second time was just because I kept falling asleep while watching it, due to how dull it was, the first time. I thought it might have been just me at the time so I gave it another go. Wish I hadn't.The characters are really hard to fall in love with. I was annoyed by how one dimensional they were. The film is predictable, The singing was nothing special-- and in fact, I often wonder what happened to the gorgeous singing/orchestra they used to have for the early 90's films. I don't see how kids would enjoy this. There's nothing flashy in there and in this day and age, you really need that. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Disney Movie Ever","review":"The voodoo in this movie gave me the creeps, and I'm an adult! I will not be letting my daughter see this movie and I definitely wouldn't call it a 'kid's movie.' Having the story set in New Orleans should have been interesting (especially the music, one would think) but instead it was just plain terrible. It would be difficult to identify what the worst part of the movie was: the satanic themes, the scary shadows and death scene (not fit for young children!), the painfully slow plot development, the obnoxious poorly written songs, the incredibly boring dialogue, the stereotypical characters (which I'd imagine could be offensive to some), the lame prince, or just the overall bad experience. Will definitely never see it again or recommend it to anyone. The highlight of the movie was when the firefly shot out of a person's nose. Seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Movie. Boring. Annoying Characters, Makes Mulan look good.","review":"Terrible movie. Besides a couple of \\"ok\\" songs the rest is horrible. One of the worst movies Disney has ever put out. This is pure crap that makes even makes Mulan look good. Even using this movie in the same sentence as the Little Mermaid or Lion King is a disgrace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I had heard there was a bit of voodoo in the storyline. That was a huge understatement. The story was filled with voodoo and creepy shadow people (demon looking people with screamy voices). The voodoo man ends up being dragged off to a place like Hell. This was not very kid friendly at all, and honestly I was very surprised that the main storyline of this show was all about the voodoo man tricking the prince. Good does win in the end, but this movie was just way to dark to be marketed for kids. I was really disappointed in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marvelous princess without a good prince charming","review":"I thought the idea of animating the princess and the frog was a clever idea, but the execution left a lot to be desired. This was hardly a child's movie with truly scary villanous shadows. Normally, Disney does a remarkable job with their musical animated films, but this one left me flat. Their music was not up to their normal standards, and jazz. . . Well, let's just say I don't like jazz and leave it at that. The prince came across as effeminent and a lazy bum. What hard working woman would really fall in love with that type? And he came across as a womanizer. Again, a loser. Our heroine was everything we could wish for. She was short changed with this prince charming. I did like the alligator and the witch of the swamp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie","review":"First of all, this movie is beautifully done, the characters are engaging, the visuals wonderful and the music catchy.Now to rebut the two primary criticisms I see:1. Too scary for kids: May be intense for some but my five year old daughter took it in stride. In my opinion, it is no scarier than the huntsman hovering over Snow White with an axe. Disney fairy tales always have intense scenes/characters.2. Disney's first black princess spends an hour as a frog. I think people are being way to picky on this and are missing the point. My white five year old loves this movie, watches it at least 4 times a week and wants to be like Tiana. She does not see Tiana as black, white or green----she sees a lovable character she can look up to and isn't that the true fulfillment of Dr. King's dream?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disney Renaissance II","review":"Wow! Everytime I watch this movie something new comes out. Its is such a fantastic movie. The music is great, the characters are well drawn and move fluidly, and its not too long or too short.

It is not your average princess story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie making memories.","review":"I love this movie is very funny and has alot of songs. My little girls love this movie is a heart warming tale of a princess who was told to never give up and to work hard for her dreams. The prince in the other hand was always given everything, But soon finds him self with nothing and in New Orleans. Great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Disney Magic","review":"As a fan of beauty & The Beast, and The Little Mermaid, I had high expectations for Disney's return to traditional animation. Suffice to say I was NOT disappointed. The Princess & The Frog is fun and magical from start to finish. Boy do I miss this style of animation. It creates a world and look you simply do not get in this age of CGI movies that seem to be churned out like candy on an assembly line these days. If you're a fan of Disney's more traditional musical animated movies. See this now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story.","review":"This is a great original story and is presented in a wonderful manner. Disney just keeps getting better and better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cutest Disney Movie in a while","review":"Bluray quality: PerfectDVD quality: What you'd expectDigital Copy: YES!I love this movie, and it arrived the day it came out, as always my experience with amazon. I love this movie, and it really reminds me of the golden age of disney, because of it's original animation, and it's cute, interesting, but easy to follow storyline. This movie will be perfect to add to anyone's disney collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is up with the voodoo?","review":"I love all Disney films so I was surprised that I walked away from this movie with a bad taste in my mouth. I hated all the voodoo scenes and ended up fast forwarding through those parts. Despite that I could swear I saw the witch doctor make a deal with the devil (or as he called it with his \\"friends on the other side\\") in exchange for the townspeople's souls. Then at the end when he didn't succeed in capturing the prince am I wrong or did they take his soul in payment? I found that just utterly awful. At the end of the movie my four year old didn't want to walk down the hallway to bed by himself because \\"the monsters from the movie\\" might get him. And that was just from what he saw on fastforward. I agree with the one reviewer, this movie is way too dark.I have no idea what Disney was thinking. They should have candy coated the bad guy way more. We won't ever be watching this movie again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little to satanic for me","review":"This had SUCH great potential for a great movie. The characters were cute, storyline was creative....why did we have to bring satan into it? There was an EXTREMELY scarry scene where the prince makes a \\"blood pact\\" with the devil in order to find true love. They actually show him pricking his finger and FEEDING the blood to a statue. Umm....all I can say is wow. And people are comparing it to the \\"evil\\" in other disney movies. NO WAY. This is actual satanic rituals being played out on a children's movie. I bought it without seeing it first...and now my copy is for sale at Amazon.com. The only reason it gets a 2 out of 5 for me...was because it was the closest thing to a good Disney fairy tale we have had in a long time. Wish we could have left the devil out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Too Dark For Children And Adults","review":"I love that 'black' Americans/African-Americans have their own princess, but this movie is too dark. As an adult, I found it too scary especially since there was a snake involved and she is a frog for a long period of time. There's also voodoo! I don't recommend this movie to anyone. It's just not like the other ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Aside from boring, had things I find objectionable especially for a kids movie. It had voodoo and just downright boting"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Children","review":"Ever since my 3 year old daughter saw the first preview for this movie she has asked at least once per week if she could watch it. I rented it on release day, and thankfully decided to watch it by myself first just to make sure it was age appropriate. This movie is way to disturbing for children. The demons that the Voodoo doctor calls forth from the \\"other side\\" would give any child nightmares. I would not recommend this movie for any age group."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very dark movie","review":"I was excited for my little girl to see this movie, but was greatly disappointed. The movie has alot of very dark magic, not the cute disney magic but dark and evil and scary. (They had to get blood from the prince for the magic to work, and they brought back spirits from the dead.) My daughter got scared and had a hard time understanding the movie. The princess part of the movie was cute, but almost half the movie was the evil magic. We will not be watching this movie again."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful....","review":"We let our 4 & 5 year old children watch this movie and were SO DISAPPOINTED! The obvious problem is that the princess/prince spend most of the movie as frogs, but that was no big deal. However, it could have been a very cute movie and was not. The worst part of this movie was the highly offensive \\"shadow man and his demons,\\" constant references to the dark side/demons as well as all the voodoo references that were not appropriate for young children. I also didn't appreciate the New Orleans/LA stereotypes and I am not even from LA. Our 4yo was scared. With each evil scene, we assumed/hoped it was the last, but this theme continued through the entire movie. We are accustomed to the \\"evil\\" plots of most Disney movies. There is always at least one evil character in each one. However, this movie takes it to the extreme. This is a very disappointing Disney movie. Don't waste your money. I only gave two stars for the animation. That was good....the rest awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst Disney film I have ever seen","review":"Upon seeing this film I thought it was terrible. The 'Prince' has a horrible character, so full of himself and not at all likable. Then he ends up with the girl?! Why are they doing that in Disney films these days? Making full of it guys get with the lead girl. Tianna should have ended up with a really caring guy, not this vain guy. That is not the Disney I know. The voodoo also really disappointed me as well. I thought it was quite frightening for a kids movie, or what is targeted at kids even though adults watch it"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am Black, and from New Orleans. What is this crap?","review":"Thank God I watched this on Netflix, because I wouldn't ever waste money on this. What a horrible way to advertise New Orleans with Voodoo. And why do most of the characters reference Creole food and how you should eat it? Who cares! I guess this was Disneys finger to their first African American Princess movie. The Art is half-assed and Sloppy. The Character design is not even creative the princess looks like Belle from Beauty and the Beast, and the rest of the characters were drawn by an artist who had a hangover. I mean c'mon if you wanted to make a movie to piss off the African American community just make one about Hurricane Katrina."},{"rating":"1","title":"VOODOO has no place in a Disney movie!","review":"While the colors were great, and some of the songs were fantastic I had to stop the movie at about the 45 min mark. This movie took a seriously dark turn, and it is very disheartening that Disney chose to include voodoo in a movie. Young girls do not need this type of satanic media around them, and frankly I wish I would have read the reviews before buying. I will not be finishing this movie. Watch a classic disney movie over this one any day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Voodoo mama","review":"I bought this movie the same day it came out. And the beginning was great. And then came the shadow man and all this voodoo. There was to much voodoo in this movie. I ended up giving to my 1 yr old niece. I know she don't know about voodoo she's just watching a cartoon. Still thats too much for me and her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not child's play!","review":"I took my one year old son to see this and we ended up walking out. There was voodoo magic and tarot cards which are NOT only against our beliefs, but I believe not something to be showing children (and encouraging) either. Voodoo is a real religion that curses people, and causes much misfortune. It is ironic that the cure for their being led astray by voodoo is to try and seek another voodoo witch... Very, very disappointing. I had a lot higher hopes, as others said, for Disney's first black princess. How about we give the AA community a black woman to look up to, not one that is making critical mistakes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS MOVIE IS EVIL!!!! NOT FOR CHILDREN!!

MIYAZAKI FOR LIFE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark, Demonic, Evil, and Dangerous","review":"...are the words that perfectly sum up this movie.The main thing I can say is that if you're Christian, steer well and clear away from this movie.Basically, your Disney villain this time around summons spirits using Voodoo. He happily walks around with Tarot cards and flashes the all-seeing-eye. To enhance my complaint\\", I shall say that his voodoo friends come up from death and drag the villain to Hell, where us Christians understand him to be. Now the latter scene mentioned here is done in a very dark way and is advertised as a children movie to lure in kids! Kids are watching this and learning.If you let them watch something once, you are planting the seed of voodooism (a seed of evil) into their minds and into their thoughts.Think twice about the new, trashy and evil Disney stuff before you buy. You have been forewarned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely inappropriate for children!","review":"I thankfully happened to watch this on HBO when it was out before I let my 2 1/2 yr old to watch it. Seriously, this right up there with Pinocchio and the middle of Dumbo for awfulness for kids. Why Disney would EVER think it was ok to have demons, voodoo and essentially the devil all in the same movie is beyond me. That witch doctor was beyond creepy and if they wanted him to be the villain in the movie, they REALLY should have lightened up and not made him so scary, creepy and basically seeming as if he's coming from the depths of hell. And I am totally fine with characters like the \\"under god\\" in Hercules and all the other bad guys for the most part in Disney movies, but this went way too far. I think too many people are over looking some Disney movies as not being completely suitable for small children because it's made by Disney, so it MUST be fine. As a mom of 2, I won't be letting my kids watch this for MANY MANY years to come, if at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Dark for young children","review":"I don't normally write reviews but I felt compelled to after watching this movie with my 3 year old daughter. I bought this movie thinking that disney movies are generally safe and innocent enough. They usually have one evil character that can be scary and that is fine. What separated this movie from others though was the repeated dark themes throughout. I didn't like the voodoo magic things, the tarot cards, or the spirits. So, call me over reactive but this movie would have been much better if they left all that junk out and just made it about the princess and the frog."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie just isn't any good..","review":"This movie is not a good Disney product. Try \\"Song Of The South\\". Another good non-disney cartoon is \\"Scrub Me Mama With A Boogie Beat\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"patronizing stuff","review":"What a waste of money.

I have read some of the critial reviews talking about the dark side to the film.

The Princess and the Frog tells a succinct and cute story who's charming simplicity is reminiscent of the good old days of earlier Disney films. The visuals are hands down DAZZLING; joyful explosions of color but all with a very unique aesthetic that avoid being psychadelic. At the same time the story remains fun, compelling, and at times wonderfully poetic without being sappy. And the characters are some of the most uniquely lovable and memorable I've seen in years."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars!","review":"I was very satisfied with my order...not only was it a speedy delivery, it also arrived just like it was described"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eclectic","review":"This is just great news for many fans around the world simply for the fact it has been put on cd.

It's very short and you might walk away feeling like you've wasted your time but I think it's just swell. You get to see the Supertones talking and even playing their instruments in a video.

The Supertones rock like a stone"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not a movie!","review":"For those who are panning this as a low budget movie, you have totally missed the point. This was a film about a scenario paintball game. Essentially, a camera crew chased a bunch of paintball players around.

I couldn't imagine this game without the music, images, film clips, and other various forms of dynamism of the DVDs. The game is great fun and will teach most people a great deal about Star Wars.A word of caution is in order, though. If you would never call yourself \\"a Star Wars fan,\\" then you probably will be able to answer only a handful of questions during any particular game. In fact, even the most \\"diehard\\" fans are likely to find a few questions that will leave them scratching their heads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the true Star Wars fan!","review":"If you know the movies inside and out, this game is fun for the dedicated fan. I play with my son that knows so much more Star Wars trivia than I do but find the game enjoyable. The only minor annoyance is when you land on a pie question too many times, the DVD portion of the game runs out of questions and tells you to use a question from the card deck. Not sure why they could not load up more questions on the DVD but maybe the game is not intended for a poor old Mom that answers so many questions wrong!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a little miffed","review":"When I ordered this item the description said it was unabridged. After it arrived the CD case had a more in depth description. It turns out to be unabridged and edited. How can you get an unabridged reading of an edited reading? Plus the CD case further describes On Christian Doctrine to be of great assitance to the Reformation. Saint Augustine's writings are being twisted, contorted, and parceled out if that is the summation. I would have appreciated these revelations to have been in the descrition provided by Amazon so as to not have wasted my postage having to return the item.I gave the item one star simply because it was required for posting the review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantab u lus","review":"Any book wirtten on this man is worth having in ones collection.

I used to have this album on vinyl but lost it at some point over the years, so to finally find it released on CD is a pleasant surprise. Personally I didn't feel that Gypsy Blood (which I managed to retain on vinyl) lived up to the promise of this album.

It's obviously well-researched by someone who's spent a lot of time thinking about the subject but it's not the story of Dictator Trujillo or the Dominican Republic or even a story at all -- there is no narrative. It's a book about policy written for policy wonks. It is not a coherent history, but rather an extensive thesis on how the different perceived goals of the military and state department interwoven with the personal biases of individuals create policy, using the Dominican Republic as a case study. It questions the perceived wisdom that propping up dictators and strong men in non-democratic nations at least create a framework of stability that benefits a country, if not the individuals within a country.Recommended as a sleep aid because it's the driest thing I've read in a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not inferior to classical musicians.","review":"As a classical trombonist, I will go on record as saying the musicians do NOT struggle with any passage within the symphony.

It was superb!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad a'Tall","review":"Some may find Maier a little long-winded with his accurate and detailed descriptions of how archeology works and how archaeological findings are tested for authenticity. Still others may find the love story almost unbelievable (not quite!). However, by the time you reach the end of the book you will have read a great, thought-provoking mystery that stretches you both intellectually and at least a little spiritually. I'd recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like \\"Pilate\\"","review":"I read \\"Pilate\\" and couldn't wait to read more of Dr. Maier's writings. Following \\"Pilate,\\" this book was a real disappointment. It had a fascinating plot, but the characters were completely unbelievable. He tried to put a romance in the story-line that just came across as ridiculous. I find it hard to believe that \\"Pilate\\" and this book were written by the same person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Written Novel about Faith and Doubt","review":"\\"A Skeleton in God's Closet\\" was no disappoinment. Although the beginning was a little slow, the plot took me and didn't let go. Maier presents readers with an archaelogical find that will either destroy Christianity or prove to be the most diabolical fraud in history. The protagonists must race against time to find the truth of the matter as the world changes around them. Maier was generally excellent at exploring issuses of faith, doubt, religious fanaticism, and anti-religious fanaticism. The novel deals with a serious subject but doesn't abandon humor. In fact, there is some pretty decent satire (especially directed against a fictional televangelist). The novel's romantic plot is somewhat cheesy but not enough to really hurt the plot. Overall, an interesting and at times thought provoking novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"DaVinci Code type thriller that REALLY is well-researched","review":"If you liked the suspense and faith-challenging plot of the DaVinci Code, I would recommend this book--it even mentions Opus Dei (10 years or so before The DaVinci Code.)I am no judge of great writing. Other reveiwers have pointed out shortcomings in plot, character development and dialog, etc. However, I found that the story pulled me in. I am interested in archeology, history, and the trustworthiness of the Gospel accounts.If you liked DaVinci, try this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good scholarship; great reading!!!","review":"It is always great to find an exciting read that is also scientifically accurate. This book, written by an active archaeologist, presents an exciting mystery adventure, and a great romance, while simultaneously assuring the reader that you are learning some accurate information about modern techniques in archaeology. It is especially interesting that this author's insights predicted the naming of Pope Benedict XVI, a decade before the death of his predecessor John Paul II. This book will certainly become a classic in Christian fiction. For a great book by another scientist/author, and also with a strong Christian focus, I recommend \\"The Curse of Durgan's Reef\\" by Bruce Conn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Went Beyond My Hopes!!","review":"I've never been a big fan of Christian fiction, as I usually read books on Christian theology, philosophy, history, and apologetics. I saw Paul Maier interview on the Michael Coren (Christian Journalist/Personality in Toronto Area) Show and I thought I'd give this guys books a try.Well I bought both of his \\"Skeleton\\" books and took four days to read them both. This one is about finding the bones of Jesus. The book is suspensful, but would have been more so if I didn't know that the author is a Christian. Overall this was a fun book and very addictive. I had to keep reading because I needed to know what was going to happen next.This book would have received five stars if he had just left out the romantic parts. They seemed the sort of romance in teenage novels. He could also write his women with more depth of character as I found them vapid.Over all this is a tremendously fun read, and could be read without offense by any orthdox or standard Christian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Christian archeao-suspense story!","review":"This book I first read when someone gave it to my sister for a gift (it's okay, we share!) and being a Christian and a student of archaeology I thought it was a GREAT story. I had never read anything like it except the Cooper Kids Adventures. I read it in twenty-four hours flat and almost missed a test because I couldn't put it down. Definitely a must-read for all those Christian adventure readers (and archaeologists) who want something different. Share!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Author's Fantacy","review":"I read about half of this book before giving up. The author is an intellectual who has pulled off some great novels.

I found myself asking that question time and again as I read. Despite the gratuitous romance and violence I thought it was enjoyable and thought-provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping!!!","review":"Chalk up another person who read this book in one sitting (it took 9 hours). All those who I lent it to read it within a few days. This book is a fasinating tale, that asks probing questions. The reactions of various groups are portrayed realistically, and Maier's knowledge of arhaeological sciences run deep. I think even hardened skeptics would enjoy this book and the questions it poses.this book is a bargain at any price. But before you set down to read it, make sure you don't have any minor responsibilities (like going to work) in the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biblical Thriller","review":"I found this novel to be a wealth of information about archeology and biblical history. If you're a lover of suspense and mystery, you'll find this work really hard to put down. The romantic relationship between two characters was a bit cheesy but otherwise a great read!Carolyn"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too much alcohol","review":"This novel was suspenseful and definitely a page turner. But although I am not a total tee totaler, I can't help but wonder why the characters spend so much time drinking alcohol. It was quite jarring to read about them drinking several glasses of beer/wine/margatiras almost every time they sat down somewhere.At one point, a character has just been rescued from near death, and he is given three bottles of beer to drink as he rehydrates in a cafe by the Dead Sea. I doubt any sane person would really do that in the hot desert area. Otherwise, a great book, but definitely not for teenagers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A universal sense of divine Love as the only real being.","review":"Rumi's sense of divine Love as the essence of one's own being, shines resplendently through almost every poem in this collection. He seems to say that looking for life outside this sense is somewhat like to trying follow footsteps through the sand as they dissolve in the waves in front of you.This \\"lover\\" must be seen within spiritual consciousness; must be felt in the warmth and security of the perfection of the Divine. Rumi must be interpreted metaphysically, yet speaks to the everyday experience. Drink in the spiritual wine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious","review":"This book is definitely the worst attempt at translating Rumi's work which I have ever come across. It is so bad, it is almost unbelievable. The original Persian poems are edited and twisted to the point of being unrecognisable. Whole lines and segments are left out and only the most obvious (and far too often sugary) choice of words is used for the translation, completely ignoring and/or avoiding the multiple meanings implied in Rumi's original texts. The only good thing that can be said about this book is that it might introduce Rumi to new readers. Best avoid this straight away (try Coleman Barks). Oh yes, and the book has a nice cover!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant, Sacredly Sensual - This one is a Keeper Squared","review":"Wow. I sat reading this elegantly slim volume in my local Barnes and Noble and I am surprised I didn't float away in ecstacy. I felt completely engulfed in spiritual inspiration, I felt transfixed by a sacred sensuality - and all this while sitting in the children's section no less.Rumi, as those of us who adore his work know, is a one-of-a-kind.Deepak Chopra is another one-of-a-kind.Bring the energy of these two beings, separated by centuries, and you have a winner on so many planes. I plan on giving many copies of this book as gifts - possibly to introduce people to Rumi... or perhaps, to woo a certain someone.Ahhhh, yes. This is GOOD stuff..........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Jalal al-Din Mohammad Balkhi (more popularly known as \`Rumi') is a well known 13th century Sufi poet and theologian. I have come across his work several times in that past, but I never read more than a few passages. This is the first time I have sat down and read a collection of his work \`cover to cover,' and I deeply enjoyed it. Rumi's poems are deeply spiritual and penetrate perfectly into the human condition of love and the tides of overwhelming emotions that run with it. I would highly recommend this book to anyone and I would especially recommended it to men. There are some really romantic and spiritual poems in here that I think would make a nice impression on a \`special' woman in your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Anyone familiar with Rumi's Persian originals will find these translations deeply disappoinitng. Communicates only a fraction of Rumi's burningly intense and often complex pictorial language. Highly edited, lightweight and unnecessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timesless poetry of love and longing","review":"This beautiful little book celebrates love and passion.It describes the eternal longing, the heartaches, and the ecstacy of love.The poems evoke deep emotions within the reader.Timeless and absolutely beautiful!L.

How nice to have a tiny selection to keep by the bedside for inducing dreams of love!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"The translations suck, the selection is terrible - all in all, a bad choice. Get the \\"Essential Rumi\\" translated by Coleman Barks and John Moyne instead. So much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's Only One","review":"Good show! Donegan at his best. Humorous and evocative of the birth of rock and roll as we experienced it growing up in the 50s and 60s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lonnie Donegan CD Reveiw","review":"Lonnie is a talented, humorous British artist whose songs may not be legendary, but will certainly be remembered and listened to by all who like skiffle, folk or rock n roll. I am probably the only 15 year old on the planet who has ever heard of him, but I think he's great. The CD is excellent - a must-buy for all music fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"i tossed mine in the trash","review":"less than a week after buying this cable it went out. don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"satisfied","review":"The handeling of the order was very good.The problem that i had was ordering 5 copies of the book , and then changng the order to several other copies of the same book. I thought that the first 5 i selected was canceled because i didn't go to \\"process order.\\" So i ended up withmore books than i wanted. The vedors were real good about sending the extras back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for endurance athletes...","review":"This book is at least 10 years behind other books on endurance sports (SERIOUS Training for Endurance Athletes (Browning), Sports Endurance (Tinley). Athletes into endurance sports won't get anything out of this pamphlet and should steer clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste","review":"I would have given this \\"book\\" zero stars if I could. It is 25 flimsy pages and really a pamphlet or brochure. It has nothing to offer. I am not sure whose endurance would \\"double or triple\\" from this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good B-side and cleaned up title track","review":"If you were to buy this, you'd probably be in it for the b-side. 'The Town Where I'm Livin' Now' is a nice 4-minutes-plus effort, starting with an acoustic guitar and drums, and including a descending and ascending piano line (they like to use those) at the vocal-free chorus. Nice job, and could see it as a nice addition to 'Sumday.' The cleaned-up version of 'I'm On Standby' is again a good song, with perhaps some of the atmospherics removed...still works as a straight-ahead song though...five stars because it cost $4.00 with shipping for me...lucky I guess...By the way, 'Stray Dog...' is the same version as on 'Sumday.'"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],N={key:0},C={key:1};function B(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",C,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,W)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(O,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-7149dae5"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/47.md","filePath":"quotesmag/47.md"}'),j={name:"quotesmag/47.md"},P=Object.assign(j,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
