If the others are as bad as THE TEMPLAR LEGACY, I'm amazed they've been published. Aside from spelling errors and confusing use of pronouns -- one paragraph discussing one character, the next beginning with the pronoun \\"he\\" but referring to someone else -- the story moves along at a snail's pace. Robert Ludlum famously and wisely once wrote that if you can't engage your reader on the first page, you've lost. Steve Berry has lost big time. I had downloaded this book to my reader, but I've deleted it. No thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story, poorly written...","review":"I won't rehash the many criticisms of this book... but fair warning to anyone who picks it up: the story is good, but a little cliched and dull in points. Characters are one dimensional and dialogue is contrived and wooden (tip for author - when characters \\"shout\\", try adding an exclamation point or anything other than a simple period.) Writing style is decent and the story contains fairly good dramatic elements, but there's nothing new here... a good vacation read, but nothing more. One cool thing - I like that the author highlighted his variations from actual history at the end of the book, and didn't try and pretend that the historical context was accurate - Dan Brown could take a queue from this."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!","review":"This was the first book that I have read by Steve Berry. I picked it up on a whim when vacationing in Ireland, and I had it read before the end of my vacation!!! It starts out fast and remains full of twists and turns and an excellent historical mystery!! Berry has done his homework on the Templars, and I am quite impressed!! I read his other books, \\"The Amber Room\\", and \\"The Romanov Prophecy\\" and enjoyed them immensely! I place The Templar Legacy over Dan Browns \\"The Davinci Code\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"stay away from this book","review":"I too was very dissappointed by this book. The story is ridiculous, characters are mostly one-dimensional and the few that are given a deeper background are completely unbelievable. The early conversations between Cotton and his former boss are terrible. The whole guilt-theme related to her (also completely unbelievable) relationship with former husband is repeated over and over - it's the start of every new location/conversation, and gets lethally boring.I still finished the book but knew for sure it was a waste of time once I got about halfway, Avignon and the character in the asylum... sigh. I only gave it a second star because of the topic - gotta love the Templar theme - even though its badly abused in this book which depicts the Templars as quite a deranged bunch of hoodlums. Stay away from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"More than a little disappointed","review":"I realize that not all books by the same author are going to be of the same quality, and I went into \\"The Templar Legacy\\" expecting a lot more.I was not interested in the characters, who didn't seem as though they would ever exist in real life and I really didn't care what their fates would turn out to be. Cotton, especially, seemed without a personality.The most unsettling aspect of this novel was that its \\"secret\\" was not based on any logic. It seems as though the \\"theory\\" came first and then all the jigsaw puzzle pieces were cut to fit. Where there were no puzzle pieces with which to play, another puzzle piece was miraculously found at the end.It's not unusual that Christians would be offended at the book's \\"interpretation\\" of a basic New Testament occurence.I also think that people who demand logic in the course of a novel, should be the ones most offended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blaaah. (Bland Characters=Bland Story)","review":"I am right now reading this book, but I'm finding it a real struggle to get through. It's not that the plot confuses me at all. The problem I'm having is that I cannot bring myself to give a rat's a** what happens to any of the characters (and that always diminishes my interest in a novel!!) For me, characters that are so bland and flat and one dimensional (as Berry's are here) make for a very dull read. At this point, I'm merely persevering for the sake of finishing what I started.I'd not read any Steve Berry books before. . .just spied this in a used bookstore and was dazzled by the effusive cover blurbs, so I snatched it up. Is this book a fair representative of all of Berry's writings? If so, then I will mentally earmark him a \\"one-to-skip\\" author.

The fact that it is meant to be offensive to people of religion is one annoying aspect of the book. But no one warned me about how boring the book is or that the book goes on and on and never seems to end. I did not make it all the way to the end. I am glad I borrowed a copy and did not buy it. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Rev. Berry","review":"I purchased the audio book version for a road trip and around the 4th or 5th disc began fast forwarding chapters. The action and loose plot, along with mostly weak characters -- that whole cotton thing is pretty annoying-- were decent until Berry began preaching his disdain for the opium for the masses beliefs. Why do writers seem to have a need to ruin good stories with long periods of sticky shove-it-in-your-face beliefs, outlandish lies and false conclusions. Stick to action and mystery, and leave the religious \\"education\\" to those with an ounce of true knowledge, not an axe to grind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun & thought provoking","review":"This book had many good historical points especially about the originationof the Gospels and the Templars.I enjoyed it very much. A little slow in the middle and one of the main characters lacks depth. Still it is fun & thought provoking.It was not quite as good as The Third Secret.I enjoy Berry's books - his research seems good, he ties together variousdiverse topics and has a more personal less fantastic perspective thanDan Brown. I am always excited to read his next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Bad","review":"This has got to be one of the worst books I have ever read. Come on now, 400 monks at a secret monastery in France? Do they even have 400 monks in all of France today? And one of them crazy enough to try and wreak vengeance on Phillip IV of France? Who has been dead for 700 years? And this nutcase gets elected Master of the monastery? And I don't care if they are Templars, but I cannot imagine any monastery teaching the Gospel of Thomas to its monks. From the parts that I have read of that Gospel, it sounds like it was put together by some ancient con artist. If you're going to write about the Catholic church, at least find out about it before you start making stuff up. The plot of the book does move along, but the whole premise is weak, the dialogue lame and the characters barely believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn...","review":"Started off great but then quickly fizzled to a retread of a retread of a retread of \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\" Very predictable, nothing clever, plot holes galore, poorly developed characters.

This work of fiction capitalizes on the swell of popular culture to attack the resurrection of Christ. One of the books tactics regards Bible inerrancy and addresses the supposed contradictions in the resurrection narratives (Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John in the Bible). This is a favorite study of mine and I assure you the accusations are false.Other than that, the book is an okay read, kinda entertaining in places. Not too convincing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloody terrible book!","review":"I read this book with the expectation that it was going to be a similar story to that of the DaVinci code or at least somewhat captivating. Wow, was I wrong, the book was extremely prolonged and I was amazed to find out that it never picked up. The whole book was a wretched BORE!

THE SWORD OF SHANNARA is a far better book with a more powerful and climactic story. Also, URSHURAK is probably the first politically correct Tolkien-type fantasy novel (with its characters of strong women and black heroes -- nothing wrong with that, but it seems contrived and they're only secondary to the main character who is a blonde-haired, blue-eyed, Aryan-type White Elf prince)."},{"rating":"1","title":"these bags are disasters!!","review":"I don't recommend these bags because they explode while using, I mean all of them.

I trusted 2 Ropmeans to lift 3 of my friends out of the cavern. It lived up to my expectations. I use the Ropmean in a configuration with one Ropeman attached to a waist harness and one Ropeman attached to a Petzl foot loop and the harness with a long Dyneema sling. This works ok for single rope technique ascending.I think that Petzl hand-grip ascenders might operate more easily.

The photography is very good and the FEEL of the picture is top notch. Not a mystery with a gimmick ending, Insomnia instead is a moody, almost creepy portrait of a detective who's meager morality nearly rivals his prey. Skarsgard is brilliant, he is quite a presence on screen in contrast the small roles he has been limited to in Hollywood.

I'm glad I did. Once I saw it, I couldn't wait to own a copy. I had to wait a while to get this disc, but it was worth it as this is such a great film. It's beautiful to watch and the acting, especially from Stellan Skarsgrd (whom is one of the greatest and most under-rated actors working today), is excellent. From the first scene to the last, I was glued to the screen.

We never get a chance to see him in his natural environment and form an opinion of his behavior under normal circumstances. Instead, when we first see him, he is already in the coastal Norwegian town where he investigates a murder and entangles himself in a situation that will ultimately lead him to behave as badly as any criminal that he has ever investigated. He is not a native Norwegian and he is unaccustomed to the twenty-four hours of daylight. Unable to sleep, both his thinking and his morality becomes muddled and we are left to wonder just how close to the surface his criminal tendencies have always been. A fascinating film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plainly an awesome film","review":"I've seen this version long before the new version came out, and I will definately give the Norwegian one all the credits. The new American version isn't bad, but its one of those movies I wouldn't see more than 1 or 2 times. The original version is one of my favourites. It's one of those movies that make you \\"think\\". Though it is in another language, it does complicate things for a lot of people. But since I understand some of the language, it also helps increase my listening skills ;-) Anyway, this movie is very well developed and it's a great movie overall . Only if it shows more photography of Norway's great scenery, it will definately be more attractive and motivating."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Intelligent Insomniac","review":"I saw this version about three years ago, and it is still my favorite. Ok so the plot is not original but this movie is much more intelligent than the Al Pacino version which came out later on. If you do see the A.P. version see this one first because there are differences:a) The dog is killed by the detective but the dog is already dead in the other version.b) Jonas makes an attempt to have foreplay with froya, but this does not happen in the other version.c) Jonas gets away with the murder and lives, but dies in the other version.Both are facinating to watch because of the moral standards in American cinema as opposed to Norwegian cinema. However, Skarsgaard (Ronin, Seventh Sign, Good Will Hunting) played a much more convincing detective, and Robin Williams played a much more convincing villian. I wish that Skarsgaard had reprised his orginal role."},{"rating":"2","title":"TURN UP THE BASS","review":"awesome movie to watch latenight. It was also nice to see a movie with no explosions.

The music is also horrible quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Concept, Not So Great Quality","review":"I was skeptical of making the purchase after reading the review about the quality and after receiving the produtct, I have to agree. I can't believe that Disney would allow their name to be put on such a cheaply made product.A few small parts were broken when we opened the box, the doors, the side wall and the table legs easily fall off during play.I just thank God that we didn't spend the $90-$100 that the stores were asking for or the $134 that Amazon has it listed for now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 3 year old loves it!","review":"We thought the assembling the castle would be a pain. However, my husband barely used a foul word during the process. Let's face it... this a plastic tohy not meant for years of use. However it will perfect for the year or so that my daughter is fascinated with Disney Princesses. The pieces fit together easily. I don't think we were quite prepared for how big the castle is- 30 inches or so.(I didn't read the specs) The only two negative things I have are 1) the elevator elevates automatically. Then you have to push it back down to the base. I'm not sure how long it will work with the heavy hands of a pre-schooler pushing it down.2) when placed on the floor my daughter can't play with her dolls on the first floor of the castle and you can't push the second floor up. We ended up puting the castle on a pottery barn play table. It's around 18 inches off the ground. That allows my daughter space to play with dolls on both floors. For the disocunted price it is pretty darn cute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Disney castle out right now! Forget Bratz and Barbie...","review":"This castle is an excellent choice and it's better than any other Disney castle I've seen out there. I purchased the Sleeping Beauty castle the year before and it cost me $40 more than this one and it is only half the size of the Enchanted Castle. This castle is huge and opens from the left and right and it comes with plenty of furniture for the dolls to play in. I would not buy any other castle after purchasing this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Princess Doll House!","review":"I was fortunate enough to purchase this castle at a significant discount during the holiday season. With that discount, it was really a great value. The castle, like most of the plastic toys today, is not that durable but is pretty good when compared to similar products. It has many rooms and lots of furniture and is much larger than I expected. It has a bathroom with clawfoot tub, chandelier, two bedrooms, living room, and dining room as well as a working elevator. It also has a balacony and terrace on the top.My girls, 5 and 2, really love playing with it! They also like that they can close it up completely when they're no longer playing with it. It is our second Disney princess dollhouse and definitely better than the first (the Cinderella castle) since it is so much larger with so much more furniture.Even at the full retail price, I would have still been very pleased. It's a great doll house!"},{"rating":"1","title":"broken bits of cheap plastic everywhere.","review":"Yes, the box is big. Yes, the product concept is great. But, the quality is cheap and poor. There were broken bits when we first opened the box. We ignored them and put it together anyway telling ourselves that those were just small insignificant breaks, they weren't going to affect the quality of play time fun. Then our daughter started playing. She barely touched the table and the leg broke. She put her princess doll in the bath tub and a footed claw broke off. The next day when my daughter came over with yet another broken piece that was it, the castle was boxed up and returned. Not worth the high price tag for such a thin plastic castle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty nice toy","review":"I'd read many negative reviews about this castle... however my daughter would have been pretty disappointed in Santa if he hadn't brought it (she asked for NOTHING else). It's really pretty and my 5 and 4 year olds love playing with it. It's big enough that they both can play without invading each other's space too much. (You really need a chunk of space for it!) Most of the negative reviews said it breaks easily. I can see that happening; we've been careful with it and so far so good. I had a real problem spending $120 on it, but I found it much cheaper on Amazon ($56)."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter says it's her favorite...","review":"My daughter (3) absolutely loved this castle. She has played with it every day since Christmas. The fact that it comes with furniture is a huge plus. Also the doorbell rings, the clock chimes and the elevator plays music. She loves it. One of the pieces was broken, however, I just superglued it. I did not think that returning it for something that small was worth it, since I was lucky to get it at a sale price.

Easy to assemble, and will have a small footprint if you want to store it. One thing I don't like is that is very hard to move when assembled because it will come apart when you try pulling it to move it from one place to another in your backyard.

The dimensions were too short and not long enough to support a person off the ground. (And are not listed on the product detail online.) The stand was also easy to accidentally tip backwards, and even side to side when getting into the hammock.

I think this is my first product review, and I've been shopping Amazon for years. I returned it--which was easy, UPS picked it up and I was fully refunded--kudos to Amazon.I ended up with a different model:Bliss Small Hammock Stand.

They were delightful to receive it as my mother in law has been wanting a hammock for a while. I chose this because of the size stated it's 136 inch long which would make a good match for a hammock we also bought for them.To our disappointment, the description was misleading. The size is indeed 136 inch long but what the description didn't tell me is that it will only FIT UP TO 120 inch hammock! The hammock we bought ended up too long and when you're on it, your behind will touch the floor.My father in law informed me that when they assembled this stand, some parts didn't match perfectly. Either too loose or too tight that he'd have to rig it to make it fit if they were to keep this hammock stand.Amazon was great at giving me a full refund though.Texsport, please update the description!

Right now it's being used just to hold my very nice hammock (folded over on itself, one side of the stand, because otherwise the wind would just blow it over and I'm sick of cleaning my nice hammock). In the week or so that I've had it \\"stored\\" as it is, the frame has literally bent under the weight of just the hammock. It's the worst purchase I've ever made on Amazon.

It uses a tutorial style, giving you enough to get you understanding the basic concepts before diving into MSDN, with scattered code examples and accompanying CD.The style is very readable, and my only significant criticism is that it does not introduce enough topics, tailing off with rather a weak discussion of DLLs and ISAPI. Since the book is aimed particularly at Unix systems programmers, with its implementation of Unix commands and drawing of parallels, the reader will probably feel comfortable enough with win32 by the end anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book","review":"This books fills a gap and is a great concise intro to many Win32 topics.

I saw a chinese cookbook about a style of cooking that I hadn't heard much about before. Hunan. I started cooking out of the book for my family and all the recipes were fantastic! Of course, I cut the amount of cayenne pepper in 1/4 for my wife, but it was still great. The twice-cooked pork (not recipe name in book) and the cabbage are some of my all time favorites. Once you try the carrots recipe, you'll want to make it for all your special occasions.We ate at the restaurant in Chinatown and they tasted the same as the recipes in the book. My wife was able to order 3 new copies of the paperback version at the checkout. I don't think they do that anymore.

The character of Xenia, a woman both from, but not of, the Black Sea area is the personality that the story revolves around. She is like Ovid's writing come to life and she inspires him to greater heights. The author makes this ancient world come alive and is successful in fashioning breathing personalities for both Ovid and Xenia. The story, though, at times feels like a novella and the fascinating character of Julia, the emperor's grand-daughter (who will share a fate with Ovid) sometimes seems lost behind the two major characters when she should have been given a little more space. That aside, this is a pleasant, sweetly-voiced novel about a man who will live forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable","review":"This book was recommended in a Maureen Dowd column, so I thought I'd give it a go.... I was a classics major a thousand years ago, and this novel reawakened what I love about the Latin lyric and love elegists. But forget that, the fact that Ms. Alison was able to write English prose in the SAME STYLE as these great poets is not merely an impression. It is wordplay genius. Bene bene factum."},{"rating":"2","title":"I second the reader from Atlanta","review":"This novel is both a sensory and an intellectual feast, and I think it's fabulous. For a First Novel....Wow. No matter what you enjoy as a reader--lyrical but tight prose, accurate historical fiction, intelligent romance literature, books that leave you with something you never knew about or just a good darn read at the beach, this is your poison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful writing, yet a bit confusing...","review":"The book starts off with the poet Ovid's being sent to exile in the first century A.D. Rome. Why could this extremely popular poet have done to cause the Emperor to send him away? The author spins a tale of a man looking for inspiration, who believes he has found it in a woman named Xenia, whom he meets on holiday by the Black Sea. Xenia returns to Rome with Ovid, becoming his muse and lover. When Ovid gains the Emperor's granddaughter as a patron for his newest (and he believes best work), lies and jealous thoughts starts to tear Ovid and Xenia apart. The writing captures you and takes you straight to the streets of Rome and into the lives of Ovid and Xenia. Yet, a couple of times I felt a bit lost, for the writing was a bit vague, and left things to the reader's imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Minimal and Elegant","review":"(...) this was just a complete and total departure from most modern fiction, with a first time author who appreciates the fine art of saying less, yet meaning so much more.Even if you haven't the faintest clue who Ovid is, or, like myself, have only caught glimpses of his work while in school, you'll enjoy this graceful story about a mystic alchemist and her obsession with the famous Roman writer's obsession with greatness. Xenia is a marvelous and strong character--a woman out of place with her own time who is transcendent in her wisdom. Her and Ovid's narrative is such a vivid tale of self-fulfilling prophecy that you find yourself wondering how much Alison drew from Ovid's real life persona.And, if nothing else, read this book for the grace of a good writer, whose elegance and sparity make this not only all the more intriguing of a plot, but a refreshing break from all of today's \\"Sex and the City\\" and \\"Bridget Jones\\" knockoffs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A noble attempt at explaning a classical author..","review":"I wanted to like Jane Alison's \\"Love Artist\\". I really wanted to see if she could bring new life into the story of Ovid. Well, she didn't, and I was left feeling confused and a bit hallow. In this tale, Ovid meets an unusual \\"sorceress\\" named Xenia, and they fall in love, and he brings her back from the Black Sea coast to his Rome, where \\"Metamorphosis\\" has just came out. There, Ovid gains the patroonship of Augustus's only granddaughter, who dispises her grandfather so much she aborts a pregnancy, thus robbing him of heirs. Anyway, parts of the book are quite erotic, but I don't quite understand how it ended badly for them. Alison is too vague mostly, and this detracts from the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Story","review":"I really enjoyed The Love-Artist. Well researched and beautifully written, it provides an entertaining look at the events that might have inspired Ovid's poetry and his exile, but it also falls short of being a great book. The mystery of Ovid's exile makes an enthralling narrative engine, and the language recreates Ancient Roman and the wonder and magic of the age. That's great, but it is also disappointing, as Ms. Alison seems to be capable of much more. Talented beyond story-telling, she is capable of creating great literature. Next time, I hope Alison aspires to do just that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book is so boring that it makes other boring things seem interesting. Nothing happens - it is just a bunch of pretty description. Characters are vague and uninteresting. Plot is boring.

This computer has to be the easiest to use computer I have ever owned, much more so than any PC. As an example, it took me a full day to set up a network for my families computers, and even then, the network constantly required maintenance.

It works so well, its fast, never crashed, and it very easy to use. First off, the exterior is awesome, the screen is razor sharp, and easy to look at. The base is also sweet, and it holds the screen in seemingly mid-air. But the real reason to buy this is for the software.

The graphics are beautiful, the sound is good, but unless one wants to look at pictures and listen to music, it is probably the wrong machine. It is very, very slow to respond. And it has great difficulty with hardware. In fact, it is incompatible with much of the hardware with which it supposed to be compatible. I have tried two different printers--and because of review guidelines on Amazon I cannot mention their names, and if you have ever been frustrated by trying to get two machines to talk to each other, multiply that frustration by 100 or 1000 and you will have the IMAC experience. The IMAC also works very poorly with at least one very popular Internet server, and again, since I cannot mention the name because of Amazon review guidelines, you will have to make a good inference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice computer but overpriced","review":"I am one of the few that doesn't think this computer is ugly.

The result is singularly unsatisfying, as the reader wades through pages of Mr. Dewdnet not debunking bad science, but simply deriding it and righteously thumbing his nose at it. The experience is rather like watching someone shoot fish in a barrel--except that he's armed only with a squirt gun.

The bottom is simply polished metal rather than some non-stick, Teflon-like material, which means that the iron gets really hot for all those cotton and linen things that require intense heat. And it has two handy buttons on top, one for a burst of steam, and one for a shot of water. Perhaps my favorite feature, however, is the automatic shut-off.

Every track (and I mean every track) has the exact same monotonous beat (thump thump thump). Almost no melody, very little vocals, maybe an occasional note from a bass. All the tracks are almost wholly indistinguishable. Without looking at the track number while playing you would think they cloned all the tracks from the same 5 minutes of drum machine beat. Were *any* artists involved with this or did they just turn on the drum machine for the length of the disc? I guess you could dance to this the same way you could dance to a metronome.

Major problems are:- They didn't make the modules interchangeable with other tracks. This means it is not nearly as versatile as other GeoTrax. You have no option to connect other tracks to the 'spokes' of the roundhouse.- You need to manually turn the trains around once they go in for their wash or gas.- Only one train car fits on the thing that goes around, so it doesn't work when cars are attached to the engine.

I felt bad quitting the book at around 100 pages. Then I found out one friend quit around 50 pages and another around 30!! Now, I pride myself on always finishing books, no matter how awful, especially ones that are for my book club. This one, no way!!. The other two are also avid readers).My undergraduate minor was English Literature so I have read a variety of classics from a multitude of cultures. Since I had heard that this was a rather \\"naughty\\" book for it's time, I thought it would be an interesting read.

His prose is clear and unassuming; with brilliant descriptions interspersed comfortably through the novel. I do not understand French, and have not compared Flaubert's masterpiece to Wall's. Nevertheless, I do think that Wall's translation made a pleasurable read.As for Emma Bovary's character, it seems easy to dismiss her as an airhead-what with her fantasies and novel (in both senses of the word) ideas about love. I find it hard to empathise with her, and yet, difficult to dismiss her totally, for she does mirror a slice of reality. I guess this ambivalence contributed partly to the enriching experience that this novel brought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Having read twice hating once and almost loving the next","review":"This novel is one of truth, a truth which is hard to confront. Societies make love to be a beautiful thing which can happen to anyone, but in reality it is a difficult trying thing. Flaubert's use of symbolism lends itself to a re-read or two. The scene at the aggie fair is one that requires a good deal of understanding, and it requires the readers utmost attention. Flaubert uses these scenes to accentuate the depth and reality of the novel. A good read but on the difficult side, excelent for discussion or anylization"},{"rating":"1","title":"Prose style suffers in translation","review":"Flaubert worked slavishly for years to make this the masterpiece of French prose. If, however, like me, you must read it in English, you are at the mercy of the translator's prose style. Since the story is intentionally tawdry and mundane (to contrast with the supreme elegance of the language), a translation by anybody other than a master of English prose leaves the book pointless. That 's my story and I'm sticking to it. -- Steve Sailer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is the Kindle edition more expensive than the book?","review":"Kindle has really let me down on Madam Bovary.

That pretty much means they must be stored upright, even for short periods. I also had one arrive with the front plastic piece (seen in the picture between the covers) snapped off of the back cover. A bit of glue fixed the problem but it is one more thing to watch for. It isn't like they are going to fall apart in your hands everytime you open them up. It is just that they aren't exactly bulletproof."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wake the Dead","review":"This vacuum cleans very well. The brush roll works well, it does a faily decent job cleaning up messes. The problem is that it is really loud. I try not to use it because it is so loud, you ever want to wake someone up, turn on this hand vac. It also is not very efficient. It does not manuever very easilly on stairs and does not get dirt along the edges. If you want to save time on steps use a canister with the upholstery nozzle it is more thorough, quieter and faster. The dirt devil also does not manuever well on shag carpeted stairs it basically takes 2 hands one to push, one to hold down on the carpet so it cleans. It also does not work well on cars due to all the indentations of the seats.

When they are cold if you touch the light the plastic snaps. Some of them break all by themselves. Maybe just from the change in temperature. The plastic is too thin where the spike attaches to the collar that goes into the copper tube.I replaced a couple of old solar lights from a local hardware chain.

It wasn't the battery either the solar sensor was busted so it came from the factory fully lit and wouldn't 'turn off' even in sunlight, so it doesn't work, but the other 11 work perfectly. I didn't try to replace the broken unit. Really the price for one less than a set is still worth it.

Today, while making a smoothy, I discovered that all the rubber teeth that turn the blades have stripped. I noticed some ripping earlier, but now they are completely shredded. It has lasted for six years, amazingly. Reading on Epinions, this blender is LOADED with problems. This teeth-stripping flaw has happened to people in less than three years under regular use. We paid nearly $100 for this blender. I'd expect this poor quality and life expectancy in a cheapo blender. I maybe use my three times a month. So very sad. So few quality appliances anymore.Pros: lovely color, nice big pitcher, 5 speeds (all crushing ice)Cons: expensive for what you get, very messy, and very unreliable under heavy use. BTW, the ice never crushes very smoothly."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a terrible buy - it wears out just after the warranty period","review":"I hardly use my Kitchenaid blender. There is a black rubber gadget that makes it work. This wore out after about 3 months of more constant use to make soups. Kitchenaid were awful about providing service because the warranty period was over. I would not recommend this product. It is made very poorly. Kitchenaid have known about these problems - check the many customer reviews on the internet and you will see this. I have given it a 5* to warn others because so many like myself seldom read the lower starred reviews. This product is probably made in China very cheaply and is made to last just beyond the warranty period.

But as an actual reference for restoration it is pretty lacking. It varies from being either too general, or in some instances specific to a particular model that you don't own. It either assumes you are a competent backyard mechanic, or that you are new to turning wrenches. The author has apparently never restored a tractor himself, but he has interviewed at least two hobby restorers, and apparently has watched them do a few.I would rate the book higher (at least 3 stars) if it wasn't titled as an \\"ultimate restoration\\" reference. It isn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Overview","review":"This book give a very good overview of what to expect if you've never done this kind of work before.

In fact, I don't care to even watch horror movies the way I used to - just too much real-life misery in the world. However, prompted by curiosity regarding the talents of a fellow writer, I started reading Mr. Reed's novel and ended up being reminded of how much enjoyment there is in reading a tale that offers a near perfect escape from the mundane concerns of everyday life. The stories that resonate strongly involve a woman who searches for love in the VERY WRONG place and a tale of love and obsession involving a twisted group of Vampires. I think Mr. Reed displays a brilliant talent for conveying the intensity of love - and offers a very fresh perspective on the emotional complexities involved. A few of the stories took a few pages to really get rolling - but overall, Mr. Reed does an excellent job at presenting the true diversity to be found in even the most horrific of relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biased review from the author","review":"This book is a story of love between a man who doesn't believe in himself and in a love that a young lady in his high school has for him.

Through the careful study of movements of individual Native Americans, the author presents a clearer understanding of the order of events in the battle.

The main question that plagued me (and historians) is: Did Custer or any main body approach or cross the LBH? Michno partly answers the question: By focusing on the stories of the four to eight defenders at the river, Michno proves an Army force went to the river and was repulsed. He also provides strong analysis that it was not Custer, nor were there two deaths at the river. The best book on the incident by far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Mrichno's book is excellent, well researched and a wonderful read, so much so it's hard to put down. This work and his The Mystery of E Troop: Custer's Gray Horse Company at the Little Bighorn will go down as two of the very best books on this historical event.

For a book supposedly covering vast swathes of history and offering keys to the future, the author's ontological and epistemological stance are never made clear.

A flaccid bladder of utter banality inflated by the hot air of middle-brow legalism and obscurantist prose. No exploration of any depth or detail is carried out of the disruption wrought by a market-dependent way of life on the ecological, anthropological, cultural, social, political and psychological fibres that hold together the world's various societies, or on the fragility and volatility of the global market itself, which, of course, is portrayed as a fait accompli. Thus there is simply no contextual platform for the author's analysis, and, despite the standard air of portent, no clear picture of what law and militarism can or might actually do in the near future, and we are left non the wiser about what the course of history might actually BE. This work is fairly indicative of the mainstream American understanding of history; my advice is that they take a break from making it, or we are all in big trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Beginning Readers","review":"I love these picture books for beginning readers because they make the children feel so successful. This book was fun to read and liked by a boy. At first he read with me by \\"reading\\" the pictures and soon he was reading by himself as a beginning reader.

The only thing that took more than 3 minutes for me was that I installed this on a brand new door and frame... since the mortise on the door flange and the latch were both rounded at the corners, I had to tap out the corners to be square with a chisel... took an extra two minutes. Two screws held the flange in place and two screws went through the door to hold the two halves together. The handles are great because I installed these for my mom and they allow her to go through the doors carrying laundry baskets or whatever and just open the door with an elbow or a finger.

Add in Bill Wilson on bass, Mark Coulson on drums and singer Marci Linn and you've got yourself one heck of a good-time Blues band.This recording features 100% solid Blues in the urban, electric mode. Most of the songs on this CD were written by the band members with some outstanding covers thrown in for good measure. Their Version of the Rolling Stones \\"Wild Horses\\" is especially noteworty. The musicianship is outstanding throughout the album. The individual players stand out without overcrowding each other. Joe Ferguson's harmonica playing shows that he has really studied the master players of the instrument, developing a few cool tricks of his own.This is definitely one group to catch live if you can and worth getting this CD if you can't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aladdin Sane-30th anniversary","review":"I've been a bowie fan right from the early stuff through to Lets Dance after that he lost it. This release had great potential but is a real let down. First the packaging - nice idea but the execution is not well done, it is difficult to turn pages, the inside cd holders are totally useless- eventually they will tear, (if you can get them out) the track listing on the inside sleeves don't relate to the cd (colour) track listing. As for the extra tracks, nothing of interest except the sax version of 'John..' as for the live versions, who cares. Why did'nt they make the second disc interesting like the T.Rex alternative album versions, this showed the tracks from Bolans early solo workings to full band workings. Check out The Slider and the 30th anniversary of Electric Warrior. I'm giving this 2 stars as the remastered sound is excellent. Did they mention that Mick Ronson played Bolans guitar part on the prettiest star note for note? that might have been of interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty Copy Protection?","review":"I excitedly purchased my copy of the 30th anniversary Aladdin Sane and quickly found myself very impressed with the remastering and almost enjoying the album. Almost because 10 seconds into every song the CD skipped (on both CDs), certainly not an acceptable thing for a new CD to do. All other things being equal, I was left to assume that the new copy protection method trumpeted on the back of the case was the culprit. I of course felt it necessary to return the CD and am hoping that this pressing error is corrected so that I can rebuy the disc. You are now warned. So let me give a solid four stars to the album, but the flaw forces me to rate the CD as one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vacuum Cleaner Bags","review":"The bags seem fine - they fit.

Gibraltar it is a very sturdy and customizable pedal with a lot of features such as easy hoop mounting ( you can mount it while sitting on your throne). Also, it has rubber shoeing on the bottom so you can play it on a wooden floor. I thought about buying a cheaper brand, but then I figured I am going to want a higher quality double base pedal down the road, so why not spend the extra money now.

I got this grill 4th of July weekend and love it. It's great to go out, turn a valve, hit the igniter and have a hot grill in less than 5 minutes. The grill works great and heats very evenly (though the right side of the grill seems to be marginally hotter...not enough to make a big difference).

With guest appearences by Riot lead singer Rhett Forrester on all songs (who since has passed on). Carl Canedy from the Rods on drums. This whole cd just rocks. Jack lets it all hang out on the first track \\"Concrete Warrior\\", and does not let up at all. My favorite song is \\"Wild in the Streets\\" a mid-tempo heavy riffed-up tune with an awesome solo.

Elsewhere we get stuff from the post Baz Skid Row, tracks from veterans Magnum, Saxon, Dio, Motorhead and UFO and really old style blokes like Tommy Bolin and Uli Jon Roth. What is a bonus here is that the tracks selected aren't the most obvious signature tunes you'd usually expect on a throw away freebie disc which actually increases it's usefulness.But it is just a magazine compilation at the end of the day and not one that I played more than twice just to check that I'd not missed something life altering.

I'm sure there are probably other books out there that go into more graphic detail about the haunting that are brought up in this book, but this one IS for children so I\`m sure they\`ve toned it down a lot. I've reread it now and gotten it out of my system, and see no reason for me to read it again, there just is no reread value to it. I can find better stories with better detailed experiences of ghosts and the supernatural then this one. So bottom line, its good for kids 8-13yrs of age, but not adults.

In my adult life, I have recounted many of the stories from this book as historical information as a matter of discussion with other peers as well as with other children; inclusing my own step-children.

Great mixed tape/cd fodder!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately Just Dull","review":"This sounds like it could be really cool, in a David Lynch sort of way..., but strangely, after a couple of listens it becomes very irritating. The sound quality is pretty awful. Sometimes it comes across as exploitative (at least that's what I thought).

I was hoping to be inspired by this cd and delve into penning arrangements of unusual choices. The cd was a big disappointment. Really. I tend to get excited by unusual things that are done well. This isn't done that well. I've been too bored to listen to this all the way through, and have tried a few times. I like the idea very much, but the execution just isn't there. Too bad. It really was a good idea. I'll still do some arrangements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something to Avoid","review":"I got this one after watching the VH1 documentary.

The only redeemable quality is the photos in the cd booklet; specifically, the 12-year oldish Charles Manson Family looking girl holding the oversized bass guitar."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOURSELF","review":"(Actually, zero stars.) This disc is bound to appeal to a) the terminally pseudo-hip; b) parents who'd like to wean their 8-year-olds away from the purple dino and maybe explain \\"what daddy used to listen to before he got smart and married mommie,\\" and c) those unfortunates who were unlucky enough not to be able to buy a recording of their junior-high marching band on LP. I have three years' worth of my band, with me blowing flat on occasion as second trumpet, and I am planning to release a boxed set of \\"endearing, earnest renditions of old favorites ... in which even the murky recording quality adds a touch of authenticity and a dash of, may we say, sheer, unabashed charm to this overlooked classic.\\" Good Lord.

The Bay City Rollers! Wings! Fleetwood Mac! The Eagles! BARRY MANILOW! GOOD GOD!This should be terrible, obnoxious, unbelievably bad.But it is not. These kids are having the time of their life, and they suck every bit of bland out of these songs and reinvent them with all the verve and sincerity that's missing from pop today. These are soft-rock standards that everyone knows, and letting these kids have them makes all the sense in the world.It is heavenly, magical and pure. There is nothing like sitting down and listening to all these little voices singing \\"God Only Knows\\" to make a hardened cynic believe, even for a couple of minutes. If Brian Wilson knew how much these kids and their teacher had improved on \\"Good Vibrations\\", he'd probably lock himself up in his room for another ten years.You don't own anything like this.This, ladies and gentlemen, is yr punk rock. Essential."},{"rating":"1","title":"My wife hated it","review":"It looks like this has received nothing but raves and five stars from the listeners here so, for some balance and perspective, I am giving it two stars. Like you, I was all hyped up to get my hands on this cd, expecting the best/weirdest/some kind of musical miracle. By the third song or so my wife wasn't amused, or enchanted by this kid's choir doing Wings and Barry Manilow covers. As for me, I like it, it's okay, I appreciate what they were doing and find it charming that these children were singing their little hearts out and playing bass guitars bigger than they were, but, it's not that great. Even my toddler son seemed to lose interest, if you can imagine that, after the first song or so (he who is transfixed by the Beatles \\"Because\\" and the wonderful You are My Flower cd by the band Ida). I love the songs they cover and I must say they do a splendid job with Band on the Run. But I don't see listening to this all that much, at least not with my wife around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like being at an elementary school concert - run away!!!","review":"Okay, I fell for the glowing reviews and actually liked the television special about this recording. So I got it for Christmas. We couldn't even stand to listen to the end. I'm sorry but off key children, bad acoustics, overzealous accompanyists and amateur recording doesn't lead to a wonderful album, at least not something that I would want to listen to repeatedly. Charming perhaps, but not worth purchasing. I'm giving it to my 4 year old, maybe he can appreciate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is the album you wish was good...","review":"the concept is great the execution is terrible...for one thing the acoustics are really bland and washed out. it sounds like someone taped it onto a cheap tape player. if the people who came up with the concept followed through with a little effort this could have been amazing... and that is what makes you grit your teeth, thinking that this could have been something...."},{"rating":"1","title":"in principle,","review":"I was initially intrigued by this CD but then quickly inside I felt the question \\"are these kids receiving royalties?!?\\" surge. Of course these now-adults are not, but it brought to the center of my mind how what a cheap way to fit a market model and make a few bucks. Obviously it was cheap to make and the 70's are of course in retro-vogue (following the typical marketing 20-25 year rule). The voices of children generate an emotional swoon from most of your average folks. I would much rather visit local school performances and show the kids singing my direct appreciation than purchase this CD. It isn't any better than the real thing... actually, worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, how charming... not!","review":"Because of all the laudatory, gushing comments from other reviewers, I gave this as a Christmas present to my 25-year-old daughter who now lives in Canada, and I was a bit embarrassed that I made such a poor choice. I've been to dozens of school chorus performances as my four daughters went through elementary school, and many of them were more creative and enjoyable than hearing these bewildered kids mumble through pop lyrics in an echo-y gym. Maybe it's touching and sweet to hear kids sing rock songs about anguish and lost love, or maybe it's a bit cynical and manipulative."},{"rating":"2","title":"One from the heart","review":"You want to get away from the contrived tripe that you ususally see in music bestseller lists? Sick of overproduction and empty feelings? Want a little real emotion in your life? Well check out this recording of young kids singing their little hearts out. The history of this recording is recounted in other reviews (schoolage kids recorded singing popular hits of the 70s), but what will stick with you is how much meaning these songs get from the kids. You might have heard them before, maybe a thousand times, but now they actually MEAN something. You might never think \\"Desperado\\" would make you cry on the 1,000th listen, but it will."},{"rating":"2","title":"SWEETNESS AND LIGHT","review":"Prepare to have your heart melt. joyful, beautiful and frankly left me almost speechless. recorded in a gym, with poor production values, sometimes sung off key, but who cares? the very fact that it is not all that \\"sophisticated\\" makes it all the more appealing, but I'm sure some people won't get that. were we ever this innocent in our youth? a lovely reminder of what we once were. if you don't have a lump in your throat when you listen to \\"the long and winding road\\" and \\"desperado\\" then I feel sorry for you, no one should be that cynical.we live in a increasingly complicated world. listen to this wonderful music and remember when you saw the world through the eyes of a child. despite it's shortcomings it's impossible to not be taken in by this charming record. in the the booklet with the cd someone observes \\"love enthusiasm far more than perfection\\", that sums up the \\"langley schools music project\\" wonderfully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I love music and I love to sing. One night I was flipping through the tv channels and on VH1 I saw a save the music special about this album and the students-of course I asked my mum for it immediately. Its amazing to hear kids who were my age singing these songs. So now I listen to it all the time along with my Beatles, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, Ringo Starr, U2, DMB, and Pearl Jam, Elvis and so on. My little brother listens to it as well-along with his Raffi of course!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Music as Rorschach test","review":"This CD blows me away. At times it takes me back to my days as an eight year old, sitting in my room with my friend Scott (now a professional guitarist), listening over and over to my one Beach Boy album on my lift-the-lid phono player. I can still sing along to every word of those songs. Other times (like when listening to this stunning, never-equaled version of Desperado) I am completely in the present, just awe struck by an incredible performance.Read the other reviews here. I feel as if I would like the folks who loved this album, that I'd want to hang out with them and get to know them (and go through their music collections). As far as the folks who hated it, who either had lost or even never had the ability to love this music, I just wouldn't have time for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the Popcorn, but the bag burns","review":"The small bag is a perfect size for when you're only sharing with one person or you just want a quick snack.The popcorn is a little greasy, but it's sooo delicious.The one (BIG) problem I have is that the bag tends to burn, I don't know if this is something I'm doing wrong, but I hate it.The first time I made it: bag super burnt and popcorn didn't make, bag did not even inflate. Second time I made it, worked fine. Third time, bag burnt, butter melted, big mess.My microwave works fine with other popcorn, so not sure what is wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grossly misunderstand / oversimplifies what therapy is- Unconvincing!","review":"In order to make their argument, the authors have grossly simplified and misrepresented the entire practice and philosophy of psychotherapy. The complexity of psychotherapy is reduced to a mere enemy who they relentlessly attack, sometimes without much rational arguments.I got the book hoping to read about something insightful regarding the pros and cons of psychotherapy. The premise, of course, is a thorough understanding of the whole concept of psychotherapy in the first place. But the book disappointed me greatly. It is more about right-winged, conservative \\"American Creed\\" sort of advocacy - highly politically-motivated - than about psychology or psychotherapy itself.If you are looking for an insightful analysis of the current facets of psychotherapy, this is NOT the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and well researched book, shoudl be read by all","review":"The authors bring refreshing insight and advice on this topic. I believe that every parent and more importantly every teacher and care-giver should read this book.It appears that this book is being criticized by those who also do not even recognize a medically accepted condition like ADHD, which if diagnosed in more of our children and if they were given the medication to help them, would improve the chances of many of students. Therapy alone will not help someone with ADHD."},{"rating":"2","title":"An engaging, provocative, and excellent book","review":"Contrary to the misreadings of some reviewers, Sommers and Satel are not attacking therapy. Indeed, the second author practices psychiatry in an inner city drug abuse clinic. Rather, the authors provide a refreshingly trenchant critique of the inappropriate extrapolation of the therapeutic ethos to settings where it does not belong and may, in fact, be harmful. More importantly, their conclusions are well-grounded in empirical research, as anyone perusing their abundant endnotes can see. \\"One Nation Under Therapy\\" will doubtlessly incite powerful emotional reactions, both pro and con. But if it also stimulates critical thought about \\"therapism\\" in our culture, it will count as a resounding success."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good","review":"This book was written by someone who has limited knowledge of what counseling/therapy is actually about.

Extremely poorly researched or evidence that didn't match cherished beliefs of the target market was omitted in order to increase sales to that niche."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad and wrong in so many ways","review":"The ways in which the authors have come to the wrong conclusions in this book are almost too numerous to mention. Thankfully, many of the reviews here take a stab at enumerating some of them. I'll only add this: the authors seem to think that in order to be successful and accomplished, one must be competitive. Funny, I always thought that in order to be successful, you usually have to work hard and learn how to be good at what you do. You don't have to \\"beat\\" anybody else - you just need to be good at what you do and then do it. Yes, of course the world is a competitive place, but there's no reason for us to reinforce that in our children. Heaven forbid we could raise a generation of people who were sensitive and supportive! They might be less inclined to support a policy of killing people in other countries and where would THAT leave us?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An \\"A\\" for effort...but","review":"I confess, I could not finish this book. The first chapter is so laden with self-serving references that I got the feeling the authors were obsessed with gathering references in support of their case. It made for a very boring read. And I was also turned off by a self-serving, out-of-context quotation from Emotional Intelligence, a very thoroughly researched book. For my money, a far more insightful and readable look at the therapy cult is Tana Dineen's \\"Manufacturing Victims: What the Psychology Industry is Doing to People.\\" I greatly enjoyed Sommers's \\"Who Stole Feminism?\\" and therefore was very disappointed in this book, which is inconsistent with her usual balanced, in-depth coverage. Nevertheless, I give it 4 stars because the subject is terribly important. The psych industry is, in fact, intent on establishing its authority to control our behavior, increase our dependence on its underqualified \\"helpers,\\" and make authoritarian pronouncements about our inner lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why go Gas when you can go Charcoal?","review":"The flavor of charcoal with the ease of gas.

I built a new wood deck and was worried about embers falling out and putting burn spots on the deck.

They are processing a refund, but it seems an unnecessary hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing damage","review":"This is at least the second time I have reviewed this product. The product, a Weber One Touch Gold was received badly damaged due to improper packaging.

I don't think she'll comply.Save your money and buy local."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weber One Touch Gold - Blue BBQ grill","review":"I had to have my original item shipped back because of significant scratches/dings on the lid, which would have definitely rusted over time.When I received the 2nd/replacement shipment, there were no scratches, however the lid did not fit snug and tight.I didn't bother shipping the 2nd item I received back to you.I can deal with the lid being a little bit loose, but these items were posted as \\"Brand New\\" and I'm not sure that these really are new.My guess is that these may be factory blemished items."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good, but poor construction","review":"We bought this as a gift for someone, and based on Weber's reputation, we were confident that this would be a top of the line gift. The color is cobalt blue that is extremely distinctive. The problem is that the wheels keep falling off. When the 1st wheel fell off, we thought it was assembler error. When the 2nd wheel fell off and then the 1st wheel fell off again, it became a concern. Keep in mind that the grill was just sitting there until we were ready to give it to the person. What would happen once the grill was being used? The bottom line is that we didn't have time to return the grill and get another, so before we gave the grill to the person, we bought caps for the back legs, and put the wheels inside. It was passable, but not up to Weber standards. I just hope that the rest of the grill holds together for the recipient.If you want a stationary grill that looks great......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Disappointed","review":"This may be a great grill, but unfortunately I never had a chance to find out. I ordered one from Amazon and it arrived damaged. The porcelain was scaped off of the metal during transport and this was too expensive an item to keep with several inches of missing porcelain. Since I was able to see the unexposed metal, I can report that it looked like the sort of very cheap metal that would quickly rust if even a tiny chip was to develop.Amazon was good about returning it and they sent out another. Unfortunately the replacement was left by UPS in a major rainstorm and I came home to a major mess. I had them pick it up.I honestly don't know if I would have tried a third time. I was having a party later that week and went to a local store. They only had the Weber grill in black and so I ended up with a lesser charcoal grill in vibrant red. I really liked the looks of the blue porcelain, but ended up saving over $100...and the one I bought cooks great."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Good, love it!","review":"I bought it for my husband,it is different then other grill which is you can buy $50 at the store.cooks better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Grill","review":"This is actually my 3rd purchase of this Weber model.

The Weber 22 1/2 inch is so versatile and easy to use. I have convinced numerous gas grill owners to get a Weber also. They all have and love the way you can indirect cook large items such as turkeys, briskets, etc. If you like ribs, then look now further, except only place coals on one side indirect, and put the ribs on the other side for a slower smoke. I usually slow cook baby backs up to four hours with a dry rub. They always turn out great. The quality finish is so tough, I don't even cover mine and leave it out all year long in Upstate NY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weber Kettle","review":"Just what I wanted, So sick of Gas grills falling apart after two years.

The two features I didn't realize we were losing from the 10-year old kettle we're replacing are the the cradle-bracket that holds the top when you take off the cover, and the thermometer which was part of the cover. I'm a little upset that we spent what we did, to have those features NOT INCLUDED. Will be returning it for the Performer, I guess, but we're not happy campers.

It goes beyond the popular accounts of Hawking's and Penrose's ideas, without going into all the technical detail. You get to find out (sort of) why Hawking attributes entropy to black holes, and his explanation of why we don't see the galaxies in quantum superposition. And Penrose's ideas about twistors and quantizing them, and people's caveats about twistor theory.It would help to be familiar with:- Feynman integral over paths- what is the action, and how it becomes a phase in quantum mechanics- Euler characteristic- special relativity, what spacelike, timelike and null mean- Basic topology and analysis. Like what does \\"compact\\" imply.- thermodynamic partition function- contour integral in complex analysis- what is a manifold- how you find the expectation of an operator in quantum mechanics- decoherence in quantum mechanics- what is a conformal mapThat sort of thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable for MCSE's and CCIE's, Network Designers, IS/IT","review":"This book is an invaluable comprehensive guide to network design, distributed computing, and overall client/server architecture including security.

The stories are strange, stylized and topical, with a prose style that suggests cyberpunk underpinnings as well as \\"Golden Age\\" genre tropes. Ultimately, \\"Illumined Black\\" is a chilling reflection on inner and outer space.

But as I said, it was made in the 80's so everything that we think would be a cliche today, wasn't back then. Anyway, I gave this a 2 star rating because I love Miles O'Keefe's armor design and the way his hair is set up...great for artistic values.

But it passes and we are again back in the normal universe where we understand that things just are. The reader of this book has more than one opportunity for such experience.

I can relate to her in this state much better than I could relate to Larry. I presume she feels the same way.

Most of the artists involved see digital for what it is, a great way to free film from the constraints of chemical capture (weight, expense, time limitations). The technicians are mostly against digital since it threatens their knowledge base. Many express the idea that making the means of production more democratic will make finding good films harder. But what has the film industry done that would qualify for great films? Transformers? Battleship? Batman? Smaller films, often digitally produced, are where the art is happening in now.

There was a lot of static, and sometimes the sound would go out altogether for a second or two. I also tried to upload midi files for ringtones with the included software, but perfectly good sounding midi songs sounded terrible and extremely choppy once they were transferred to the phone.

I didn't expect the booming bass from its passive woofers. The speakers are nice looking and a cool feature about them is that you can mount them directly onto the wall without any extra parts. It's very innovative. One drawback is that you have to use the speaker wires provided. You can extend the range by adding wire but you need the provided wire to make the connection to the back of the unit. Also while operating the receiver it takes a bit of time to switch between modes, ie going from dvd to aux or from tuner to dvd, etc.Overall I am happy with this unit, it rocks the house!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud fan, poor service","review":"Like another reviewer I found the fan noise to be intolerable after a month of use.

I will admit that this game did have me spooked in some areas. The ominous music was great at giving the whole game a spooky feel to it. The puzzles weren't too difficult that they couldn't be solved. My favorite was the floor puzzle, ony because I have always enjoyed tangrams. The puzzle that gave me a headache was the staircase puzzle. That one took forever to find. But once I found it, I actually enjoyed trying to solve it. One thing I learned throughout the whole game is to TAKE NOTES! You will need to copy down all of the Chinese Art symbols in order to solve the rug puzzle in your room.This is the second Nancy Drew game that I have played and one thing that I like is that if you die or get thrown out (as I have done on more than one occasion -- tongue lashings are fun), you can pick up where you left off, provided you saved your game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but had glitches..","review":"Nancy is in San Francisco in Rose's mansion.

Since this is an early nancy drew game, you have that annoying alarm clock.

The Ti set is really light and good for backpackers. Unfortunately, I found one my of set (I bought 2 sets) got manufacturing defects, the fork is bent at a smaller angle, which looks quite weird when I stack them together.Hope Brunton should do better QA on their products.Apart from this, the Ti set is quite nice! But buy with your own risk (you never know the angle problem if you buy 1 set only!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect camping flatware","review":"This is the best set of camping flatware that I have used. They are strong, lightweight, and clean up very easily.

Previously I was always losing my old lexan utensils.These are also a good value compared to other brands' sets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you need","review":"This flatware is everything that you need to enjoy your meal. Although the utensils are light they still have a comfortable easy to hold feel during use. They are adequately sized so you do not feel as though you are eating with a child's flatware set. I found the spoon to be a good compromise between a standard teaspoon ans a soup spoon. Nice serrations on the knife for slicing.

The discoloration was bad, but not quite as bad - you could see both lines. After calling the company and being told I should return it to the \\"store\\", I went online and Amazon immediately sent me the shipping label and it was returned for free. I love Amazon.

This coffee urn has been used six times since I purchased it and has performed flawlessly every time. I was a little apprehensive buying it based on some of the reviews and now can't believe I did so many family functions without it.The coffee tasted fine (I couldn't detect ANY aluminum taste at all.), I'm not a coffee expert but I never get complaints either! No problems with the spout dripping endlessly and regarding the short power cord, it's actually a great safety feature forcing you to position the urn safely on a counter top or bar top without getting too close to the edge (avoiding accidental tip overs).When done brewing remember to remove the grind basket so extra tannins and biters don't spoil the coffee's flavor. Also, using a regular grind coffee I could literally count 20 coffee cround particles at the bottom of the urn. My house hold coffee pot lets more through than that!Great bang for the buck, worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"West Bend Coffee Pot","review":"The product arrived in a timely manner and worked beautifully.

WASTE OF TIME, NOW STUCKED WITH THEM & STILL HAVE TO FIND THE TIME TO RETURN THEM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional value.","review":"I don't like all of these recordings. The 1st is brutal and the 9th is poorly recorded. But Szell's Eroica is the best (I mean it) and the 2nd, 5th, 7th, and 8th are very solid, particularly the 7th. I don't think much of Beethoven's 4th and 6th so I can't comment, but I am greatful to have solid recordings of the Egmont and Coriolan overtures. This set is certainly better than any of Karajan's. I recommend that you suppliment it with Norrington's 2nd and especially Reiner's 9th. You don't need to buy the famous Kleiber 5th and 7th because these are on the whole just as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST BEETHOVEN CYCLE EVER","review":"The Beethoven cycle by Szell and his legendary orchestra are wonderful. In short, the orchestra is perfect, the tempos are fast, powerful, oozing with power, the sound is great for such an old recording. I have many recording of these symphonies, including Karajan, however, I always return to Szell. His interpretations possess a beauty you will be hardpressed to find anywhere else. BUY THIS SET!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic recordings","review":"I grew up listening to these recordings on LP (and, indeed, wore out two sets) and they still strike me as some of the most satisfying interpretations of the Nine symphonies ever recorded. Szell was sometimes said to be a \\"cold\\" conductor, and the idiocy of that critical judgment is clear in every bar of these performances: these are some of the most emotionally powerful and intense performances ever recorded. George Szell was a master, and his Cleveland Orchestra was one of the greatest ensembles ever. This set would be one of the very best if it were at full price: at budget price, it's a miraculous bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Beethoven Symphony cycle ever recorded","review":"Many recent Beethoven recordings are known for their \\"authenticity\\" or \\"historical accuracy\\". The fact is, we have no idea exactly how Beethoven's music was performed during his lifetime, and none of the many \\"original instrument\\" performances that I have heard can come close to the emotional depth and musicality of the Szell/Cleveland recordings. In addition to reminding us of Szell's flawless leadership, these discs feature superlative performances by some of the greatest musicians that have ever lived: Principal Oboist Marc Lifschey, the late, great Clarinetist Robert Marcellus, Tympanist Clloyd Duff, Hornist Myron Bloom as well as the rest of this legendary ensemble. And all for a great price, too. This is far superior to any other collection of Beethoven Symphonies I have heard. Really, this is music making at it's best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich in spiritual content","review":"Different conductors interpret Beethoven's Symphonies very differently. Szell's performances contained in this set have been among my favorites - especially the Ninth Symphony. I have heard other recordings of the Ninth that may be better in sensory qualities (richer orchestral sound, more vivid recording...). However, this one speaks to me so much spiritually. It brings out the \`higher realization evident in the Ninth' so clearly and convincingly, with such power and subtlety at the same time. I feel very blessed to have come to experience what is contained the Ninth through this recording. It has played an integral part in my development."},{"rating":"2","title":"One out of many","review":"There are many ways to perform Beethoven.Szell's is one, and a legitimate one. Clarity and strength of line are two of the characteristics he brings to this music. If you want to linger, to bathe in the beauty of sound, this isn't your Beethoven set.By the way...I really liked the commentary by Amazon's \\"official\\" reviewer, especially the remark about Von Karajan-worship. I heard less and less in Von Karajan's recordings over the years and seldom listen to them today. It does show how one's perceptions, and musical tastes, can change over the years.But that HAS NOT happened to my perception of the Szell set."},{"rating":"1","title":"LAZY JOHN BARRY; LET ME COUNT THE WAYS","review":"Isn't anyone getting tired of hearing the same RECYCLED John Barry theme, in film after film?!

As with his other tired projects the subject get's lost somewhere inbetween. The narrator speaks with a finality that borders on the ludicrous. He sees jazz in black and white (no pun intended). This guy was the \\"king\\" of this, this guy \\"started this.\\" He even has the nerve to say Billie Holiday wasn't a good singer! Through it all we have Wynton Marsalis, the guy who had a problem with Miles Davis, supposedly because Davis didn't stick with the Jazz format he saw as proper! But more likely because Davis could play Marsalis under the table. If you know nothing about jazz I'd say get this but take it with a ton of salt. This set drones on like his other sets, something like a ten hour funeral. Get the Miles Davis album, Kind of Blue. This was Jazz, the joy of music, not a tired documentary. And Stanley Crouch is a whitey hating GROUCH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid","review":"Jazz documentaries usually fumble regarding the past 40 years, but at least they try.

It doesn't get any additional stars, as it virtually ignores too many pivotal jazz fiqures from the 50's to the present. Three episodes on swing is too much. Spend your money on cd's, the Jazz Icon series of live performances on DVD, the Jazz 101 book, the movie Round Midnight, or the Legends of Jazz DVD set instead.It's not that I don't like Ken Burns either, as I bought the Civil War VHS set when it first was available in the early 90's and then the DVD set when it became available.

The superficiality of two young men, neither of whom knows much about jazz or was alive when the major movements took place (Burns and Marsalis) set me back. The overwhelming emphasis on black musicians should be a little less whelming...for example, where are Pete Fountain and Al Hirt when discussing the New Orleans style(s) and the role of the black funeral tradition? I rate it two stars at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the Guitars?","review":"I enjoyed the history of the horn based jazz moment thru the '30s. But Burns hires talking heads who do not think that \\"real\\" jazz ever used electric instruments or goes beyond horns and piano.When the guitar of Charlie Christian arrived as a lead instrument in jazz in the late '30s, it needed and had a small electric pickup. Thus it is completely ignored as being relevant in jazz, to Burns and his stooges. All the wonderful guitarists since Christian are also ignored, acoustic and electric.No wonder Burns thinks jazz is dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rating the DVD not the Series","review":"I am not going to contradict the reviewers that have raved about the series, I think that as a Television series it's very good. But if Ken Burns considers himself a filmmaker then he should be using the full video and audio range available to filmmakers. The Full-screen format and the flat sound were very disappointing. The sound recordings of the music weren't even stereo. Let alone worthy of the reproduction capable to DVD.And a note to PBS, I really really really Hate, the forced commercials at the beginning that went on and on and on. With, of course, the fast forward and skip buttons disabled. I'll think twice in the future before I buy a DVD associated with PBS."},{"rating":"2","title":"So...do we have an alternative? Not really....","review":"I just want to point out - in lieu of the negative reviews: who else has bothered to comprise a jazz documentary anywhere near this magnitude?...yeah: that's what I thought.I developed an interest in Jazz, as a teenager (having written a term paper on Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong, as a 12th grader). Since then, I've learned a ton about the genre. But I can say over the past 35 years, Burns' effort has been the most concentrated educational effort, outside of Jazz biographies and autobiographies.Yes, there is a significant void of information, after about 1960. I do believe this is due to a combination of Burns' lack of natural passion for the genre, and, a mindset that says the emergence of Jazz Fusion watered down the art form...But at least there was an effort. In the end, the documentary adds much more to the history of Jazz, than it takes away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy jazz CDs instead","review":"If you are interested in learning about jazz,buy (1) a decent jazz history, such as Ted Gioia's A History of Jazz, and (2) eight or ten representative recordings: Louis Armstrong's Hot Fives and Sevens, Duke Ellington, Coleman Hawkins, Lester Young, Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk, Miles Davis are all good places to start. Or buy the Smithsonian Collection of Classic Jazz (is that still available?). Burns' bloated product, while containing plenty of nuggets, is too unreliable and biased to be worth your money.

It's very interesting and I learned a lot about jazz figures I only had a vague idea about in the past. However, I don't think anyone but hard-core jazz fans needs to OWN this documentary. I bought the series, thinking I'd probably return to it again and, as I have to the Ric Burns \\"New York\\" documentary, but I don't feel that level of connection to it. It's certainly worth seeing for everyone interested in jazz, history, race relations, or larger-than-life personalities but I'd make it a rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"The reason I got this on DVD was because I thought the viewer would be able to turn off the annoying commentary and just listen to the music. As far as I can tell there is no way to do this. Almost every time a song begins, some critic begins talking OVER IT, explaining why the song or artist is important. Much of what they say is common knowledge, and even the most interesting comments really only need to heard once. The whole point of getting a DVD is that you can play it over & over again. And DVDs also allow several versions of a film to co-exist on one disc. How hard would it have been for Burns to make a narration-free version? The music is nearly non-stop anyway, and all he'd have to do is linger on the photos/videos (which are amazing) instead of cutting away to the talking heads. Then you would have an uninterrupted series of some of the greatest jazz songs ever ---- a priceless jazz-video collection, instead of this annoying waste of DVD space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly Revisionist and Doctrinaire View of Jazz History","review":"Throughly dismisses all Jazz after 1960, including Fusion, Free Jazz, and everything thereafter. Marsalis actually calls Cecil Taylor's music \\"self-indulgent bullsh**\\" Apparently Taylor was not allowed to rebut this during the film. How was that allowed to air on the supposedly intellectual (but more likely agenda-driven) on PBS, I will never understand. If you think Swing is the only valid form of Jazz, you will love this series. If you think Coltrane is a God, you get five minutes' summary. So lets see here: 15 hours on Louis Armstrong and Duke, 5 minutes on Coletrane, and a total didmissal of everything after Duke's death. Reminds me of the Republisuck's \\"Fair and Balanced\\" nonsense. PBS, this is your wake-up call. Stop trying to rewrite history - Jazz ain't in a museum. Just ask the artists (most of whom are alive) whom Burns left out. Metheny, you out there?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Burns' most-flawed work","review":"I highly agree with several others on Amazon - much is left to be desired in this documentary. FIVE MINUTES were spent on Armstrong's \\"Hello, Dolly,\\" (which has as much to do with Jazz as Britney Spears), while Zawinul, Pastorius and other giant figures were given no mention whatsoever.

Objectiveness seemed to be lacking because nearly all the interviewed experts were somewhat enamored with the art form. The observer may feel the documentary too narrow in its scope. More artists should have been included. The ending did not measure up to the rest of the film.Ken Burns does show the rise and decline of a unique art form. Jazz starts as a peoples music that was especially embraced when it became a dance music. The decline of jazz started when it became too cerebral and introverted. The heavy use of drugs among the performers at the same time added even more distance between them and the audience.The film duly shows why performers like Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington were earth shakers felt round world. It does also bring up things not usually discussed in American History like the race riots during WW2.

If you love Jazz, you'll love this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jazz with a Straightjacket","review":"Ken Burns-Jazz is something of an oxymoron, if you associate the term jazz with expressive freedom and experimentation. Specifically, by the way that Mr. Burns ignores and even denigrates the brilliant work of the sixties and seventies, he seems to pigeonhole the music into a rather narrow format of musicians improvising on mainly traditional european song construction. He can't understand Mile's brilliant manipulation of blues and African influences, and so labels what was perhaps that last great burst of jazz innovation as \\"selling out\\". Lord knows what he would have thought if he had ever had the nerve to attend one of Sun Ra's rapturous sessions. I mention these two artists because during this time of stagnation and purified recreation the re-issues and release of concert performances of the two stir more fan enthusiasm than anything going on right now. Give this a couple of stars for its discussion of the early history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glenn who?","review":"Well below his usual standards of quality. The formula used with such brilliance in the Civil war documentary has not worked its magic here. This is a poorly documented endeavor where Ken Burns seems to have ventured in an area he has obviously very little knowledge of and relied almost entierly on Wynton Marsalis' perception of jazz history or should I say Wynton Marsalis' personnal preferences. Marsalis is a great master of his instrument, that does not make him a brilliant historian. Jazz according to this documentary seems to have died somewhere in the 60's. Way to much emphasis was put on racial issues, jazz musicians are notoriously colorblind. I'm pretty tired of the perrenial implication that a tune that is commercially successfull is somewhat an inferior product, especially coming from a man who as certainly pocketed millions for his documentaries good or bad. And before I forget, thanks for the 15 seconds on Glenn Miller! Or should I say Glenn who?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Burn's at his worst","review":"I love all the works of Ken Burns, but this one falls way short of all his efforts to date. So much time is devoted to Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington that I feel much more could have been told. Also was the feeling that this was more the Afro-American history of Jazz and so many greats of jazz were sadly left out. To much commentary from Wynton Marsalis and not enough from other great jazz musicianwho have been inspired by the greats of Jazz. Sorry, but it just could have been done a bit better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss it","review":"I'm a child of the the 60's. My memory of elvis is only of his later movies.

Rock and Roll is great, but boy did we throw away something special when we forgot about this music. I love it. I rarely get beyond disk 7. My Grandparents met dancing in Chicago in the late 1930's.

As many reviewers have pointed out already, the subject matter, which is about jazz music, is not complete. There were very key movements in jazz that were not even discussed. The documentary ends in the early 1960s when the jazz style of bebop was still being played. This is incomplete and a waste of film, because everyone who loves jazz like I do, knows that jazz didn't end in the 60s.This film was a total waste of time and effort. Also, why do I want to listen to Wynton Marsalis ramble on about his views of what jazz music is or should be? He's a bad representation of the music. There are thousands of great jazz musicians that should've been interviewed or at least discussed for that matter.I also want to complain about the price. You're going to have to take out a loan to buy this piece of crap. Absolutely ridiculous price for a ridiculous documentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"great stories","review":"I know this has been out for a while, now, but I can't resist... I am a musician, and have been a jazz fan for many years. I already know who these artists are, and, yes, it left out some of my personal favorites. But the stories told on this series are just wonderful! Newcomers to jazz will get a fine introduction to many of the main players and some of the music - but the stories about the musicians really drew me in. My partner didn't know jazz at all, didn't even know who Coltrane was - and now she's gone out and bought several cds... even introduced me to some new ones!If this isn't a comprehensive dissertation on Jazz, the music, it is an engrossing Movie: it tells stories, and I'm thankful for the time spent on those stories. It's especially effective as an introduction to jazz because it draws people in with the pieces about the musician's lives.It's called a Film, not a Documentary. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"incomplete and skewed with some nice sections","review":"Burns clearly is not an expert in Jazz and is relying heavily on Marsalis, who has picked and chosen his favorites. This is good for Marsalis as an artist, but bad for historians. I hate to say it but White and Latino jazz musicians get very little due. (Marsalis again). Buddy Rich, Benny Goodman, Joe Pass, Bill Evans, Chick Corea, Larendo Almieda, all of the Latino players discovered by Dizzy, etc. Way too much time is spent on a handful of his favorite, albiet great artists. The worst part is there are no complete performances. To learn the most about jazz you have to as Miles Davis said \\"Go back and sit down and listen\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"truly excellent","review":"Having been fortunate enough to be the interactive designer who worked on this particular DVD (the DVD, not the film), I can only say that this documentary is truly excellent. While I already had some interest in jazz, watching this film opened up plenty of new doors and really brought the history of this American music to life for me. Jazz is exciting to watch, informative, and completely engaging, and I would recommend it to anyone who had even a passing interest in jazz music. It's been a great honor for me to have had a part in bringing this great film to DVD.

What were the publisher's thinking? Do they want to sell books and have this recommended or not? The Intro by Elleke Boehmer is so longwinded (39 pages) and so derogatory toward the Scouts and it's founder it's mind-boggling. She obviously has no respect for the organization, and the sparse accolades she dispenses are only a cover in my opinion so she can degrade and dissect the Scouts two-fold thereafter. I recommend \`Boy Scouts Handbook: The first Edition, 1911' (the Dover publications version) until they reprint this book with a positive and uplifting intro; one that makes you want to read or buy the book in the first place. new update, the dover edition 'scouting for boys' is great. much better intro to a great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Warned","review":"Once upon a time Tami Hoag wrote romances.

It seemed to me that what we have here is Messiah-as-soap-opera, that is to say gobs of drama--much of it unconvincing--along with considerable unintended comedy. The tempos are simply too extreme, to the point that singers and instrumentalists are frequently unable to articulate. Mind you, there are some good moments, and several of the soloists are excellent. Finally, though, the person seking a dramatic version of Messiah would be better with McCreesh's. And my basic recommendation would remain with Hickox."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Another disappointing recording from Marc Minkowski (although his older recordings were not this bad). The tempi are just out of order even for an authentic performance. The recording itself is excellent, and so are the performers. The only problem is in Minkowski's approach and interpretation. Too bad!! Not recommended unless you are a collector of Handel's Messiah CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Radical is one thing, freakish is another","review":"I admire Marc Minkowski and his excellent Louvre ensemble, but what was he thinking here? Except for a few numbers taken slower thn usual, his tempos race madly, to the point of freahishness. If you don't know what you're getting in for, every number will make you blink tiwce--it doesn't seem conceivable that a good musician would commit this kind of bizarre distortion on Handel, even in the name of authenticity. I guess the amazon reviewer considers 'radical' a word of praise, but not in this case. It's a shame that Minkowski's chorus and soloists are generally superior since they are asked to sing while chasing after a fire truck.I doubt that my opinion will be popular here, but newcomers might welcome the warning. To my ears, this Messiah is unlistenable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Put, Respeck !!!!","review":"Lucky Dube is the man.

I saw them live 2-3 years ago and they were quite the show even then, but their recordinds were barely listenable. This new record is really something. It is full of great production and great songs. The album before didn't even show flashes of greatness, but this record is full of them. From start to finish the record has few musical flaws with great, shifting melodies and wonderful, intricate playing. The album also has a very well produced sound to it, but nothing too over the top, with the horns and other instrumentation fitting in perfectly. My only minor complaint is with \\"PJS\\" which goes over tracks 4-6. The song is a bit too long and repetitive at parts.

The cookbook that comes with the grill looks pretty good too. I also bought Weber's Big Grill Book.

It is really nice to put food on and be able to relax instead of having to constantly monitor for flareups and your food turning into charcoal, like a recent BBQ at my neighbors. The side burner is a nice touch, works great for saute'ing toppings for steaks and brats.

However, the last act, the ghostly stuff, does finally reach the level of compositional subtlety and complexity to be emotionally effective. Five stars for that act, three stars for the first and longest parts, averaging about four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a Gainsborough painting brought to life","review":"Tillyard's book brings to life a composite portrait of four of the most glorious demimondaines of the eighteenth century, all four of whom led lives of incredible brilliance and sparkle. One of the sisters was the Duchess of Leinster; another married Fox; a third was the beloved of George III before he had to give way to politics and marry a German princess of much less beauty and vivacity. This book does a fine job brining to life the intricate world of the highest crust of Georgian aristocracy--it's a splendid follow-up for any who have enjoyed GEORGIANA, DUCHESS OF DEVONSHIRE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I was looking for a book to help my son who has recently been diagnosed with dysgraphia. I paid 39.99 + shipping and could not in good conscious share this book with my son. Eli's writing example starts with \\"I hate my life\\" - this is not the example I want to share with my son. A very negative and insensitive image is portrayed about the teacher in this book as well. In no way could we relate to the experiences that Eli had at his school. Then a magical gnome saves the day, imaginary friends are great but this was a bit creepy. I am keeping this book to share with my son's school about WHAT NOT to get for help in dysgraphia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the paper it's printed on","review":"I chanced upon this title at the local library. Very few recipes, most admittedly cribbed from a store called Claro's, and what recipes there are are not very authentic...even allowing for them being Italian-AMERICAN.

Sad because he really enjoyed it the 3/4th's of the track that it did stayed on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and cute, but the jury's still out","review":"My son loves this toy. It's easy to set up, and the track and scenery seem to be well-constructed. But, he also got the Lil Movers Race Track for Christmas, which has a car of similar construction to the train in this toy, and the car didn't last five minutes (see my review on that product for details). However, he played with the train for about an hour with no problems, and we're hoping that whatever shortcoming killed the car was resolved in the making of this train."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke in one day...a total waste!","review":"This toy was great for the 5 minutes it worked.

This was a total waste of money and I can't believe the incredilby bad service I received from Amazon. I have been a loyal customer for a long time but they never even responded to one of my emails. The toy is a terrible. Don't waste your money.

Katz's writing is simple,direct and accessible, and as a result, extremely powerful.I strongly suggest you order more than just one copy of \\"I Couldn't Wait to Tell You,\\" because, odds are, once you've read it you'll wind up sending copies to friends (but you definitely won't part with your own).The bottom line: you can read the book in one sitting, but it's impact will last a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loving Sisters","review":"Being the author's approximate age and having a sister, I really related to this story.

They each point to the spiritual path, of honoring the God within, as the way to living a healthy and peaceful life.A beautiful construction, it goes beyond 'self help' and is easier to understand and follow than many self help books.

Maybe my problem is that I've been clean and sober over ten years, or maybe because I have a Ph.D. in psychology. I don't know. I plan to read Illuminatus and see if I can make sense of that one.

All style, no substance. 30 years were spent in the writing of this book- 30 years wasted. The only people who actually claim to like this book are those highfalutin' Eng. Lit. students who inevitably are drawn to authors such as Gass, if only because admiring his fustian works of genius makes them feel superior to all the uncultured savages of the world (read: anyone who realizes that the only tunnel that went into the making of this book is the one leading out of (or into, as the case may be)Gass' posterior.)

The wordplay, the asides, I could not restrain myself from continuing to read the novel. The novel never moved slow since aspects of Kohler were being developed over the whole thing.A short summary: This is a book about a history professor who just finished writing a massive book on Hitler, save the introduction. The book revolves goes through his character and life as he sits in anguish attempting to write the introduction.The setup may seem uninteresting, but it is far more interesting than you could ever imagine. The development of Kohler and all the people around him by Gass is phenomenal and looking at the faults of Kohler and his character are astonishing.

They are not all duets either. Most sound like 'throw-away' tracks, meaning there is a reason they were not included on regular albums. There is such a small amount of Jessi's material out there that I would recommend it for the hard-core Jessi fan but start with her Greatest Hits and the \\"Wanted..Outlaws\\" album first.

I'm wondering if there's anyone out there who can provide some better one-stroke instruction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice variety of projects","review":"Yes, as the 1st reviewer said you have to have some different products to do Donna's variety of projects in this book. To me, this is a very nice book that rolls several of her ideas into one book instead of having to have a separate book for each type of project like she often does. The only thing that bothers me & always has is that her pansies look like they have testicles! I never figured out where she thought they should look that weird in the front of the flower.

She does a classic remake of the old pop song Baby, now that I've found you.Bright Sunny south is a civil war song, that I listen to over and over.Take me for the longing is another great song from New Favorite, and the Remake Man of Constant Sorrow from Oh Brother How Art Thou, won several grammys for her.When you say nothing at All is another monumental song on the CD.The musicians are the best in the world, Allison Krauss has a very pure voice.I dont listen to much country music but this CD is a treat to listen to.

The blend of songs is extremely compelling too: from playful bluegrassy numbers to spine-chilling love songs (\\"New Favorite\\" - where you can tell it's a Gillian Welch song, but Alison really gives it extra dimension), and some great great great musical pieces. The blend of guitar, banjo, dobro and bass is so tight and crisp, it's an absolute delight to listen to.This recording is true musical inspiration at its best. By all means get it and savor it for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"destined to be a classic","review":"This 2-cd set will surely become a classic in bluegrass.

A visionary band in many ways. The driving backbeat energy of \\"Choctaw Hayride\\" reminds me of a futuristic Bluegrass train pulling me along for a wild ride. Ron's Faraway land is prophetic in its vision and simplicity. \\"The Boy who wouldn't Hoe Corn\\" makes a statement of what the Bluegrass tradition is all about and its ability to speak in many ways. \\"Tiny Broken Heart\\" is a new favorite of mine and how once again bluegrass tradition can make a statement for today's world. \\"Bright and Sunny South\\" says it all with Dan's vocal clarity in all its best. Alison's vocals on \\"Stay\\" speak directly to you as a long lost friend would.

The silly twisting and turning that brought Nikita from a poor helpless victim to becoming the head hancho at Section was just too much to believe. And all of a sudden Section has to send Operations out in the field so he can be killed. Just fresh out of operatives...sorry. This would all be a joke if it were funny, but it's not, its just sad and stupid. One reviewer made a good point, the only way to end the series was for Nikita to get out of section, hopefully with Michael.

It's open-ended, but you know the answer.It's a shame this quality show was restricted to cable--it is so much better than most network shows. If you watch all 4 seasons of LFN you will notice many guests from LFN have made appearances on \\"24\\" the past few years--Operations and Madeline, especially.

It is under 30 pages. If you want to play blackjack without counting cards, but any of the popular blackjack books, whether they involve card counting or not. I bought a bunch of them and all of them have a section at the begin on the basic strategy, which is what you are probably looking for anyways. They are better written and cost just a few dollars more. This book is worth ... tops. Buy something else, I regret buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Two things get in the way of enjoying this DVD. First, and most annoying, is the trombonist who gets his face in front of other musicians to the point of distraction. And he is not very good. The second is that not all the numbers listed on the box are on the DVD. The most memorable is \\"Just a Closer Walk With Thee\\" which was my reason for buying the DVD - not there.An added comment is that the inane interviews get in the way of the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"Nothing new here.

It is just a heap of old easy ideas. There is no need to buy the book if you are a half competent horse person.

There are allot of more worthwhile books available with more insight into this area."},{"rating":"2","title":"superb","review":"Andrew Mclean an animal behaviourist who has devoted his life to horse training and rider education is a jem in the world of trainers. His techniques work wonders and have improved my horses performance and my own understanding of those gracious animals to a formerly unknown level. Very simple to use, down to earth and scientifically founded he is setting a new standard in the industry. He is definitely my hero and I highly recommend him to any performance rider, trainer and riders intersted in natural horsemanship. May the horse be with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has no equal","review":"I have been a rider/trainer and instructor for the past 30 years. I have ridden with and trained with some of the top trainers in the world. I have read hundreds of books on the training of horses and been to dozens upon dozens of clinics with all of the \\"horse whisperers\\". After reading Andrew McLean's incredible book, I immediately went out and bought 10 copies to give to friends and trainers. I will agree with one of the reviewers that the book might be better appreciated by someone with a background in psychology and that Andrew does presume a certain knowledge level from the reader. Apart from that it is one of the most amazing books on training that I have ever come across. I began using many of Andrew's principles on our new green pony as soon as I finished the book and was simply floored by the simplicity and efficacy of the methods. I cannot recommend this book highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"well researched, not for everyone","review":"I can't say I agree (or necessarily disagree) with everything in this book, but it gave me a lot to think about.

It's mostly tribal instrumentals with some vocals samples hear and there, usually given the electronic sound. Of interesting note, track 1 does a little of the \\"alright\\" call out made popular in a pet shop boys song, track 2 is someone resinging (electronically enhanced) the chorus to Depeche Mode's \\"It's No Good,\\" and track 9 is actually a full length female vocal track, the only thing that really comes close to \\"peak hour\\", of which this disc promises whole CD worth....Track times are:1. 3:232. 3:523. 6:474. 6:035. 5:346. 4:077. 5:348. 4:009. 9:2710. 3:5211. 2:4012. 4:45"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Pump","review":"I wouldn't even give this pump one star.

Compare to the Medela Harmony & Avent ISIS I got later, it is a absolute joke - I couldn't get a drop of breast milk out and it hurts like crazy.If you need a manual pump, do yourself a favor and avoid this one. You cannot go wrong w/ either the Medela or Avent one though (Medela Harmony slightly better IMO since it is BPA-free)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy","review":"This is a complete waste of money. After the first time I washed the pump, the rubber honeycomb cup that you put on your nipple would not reattach properly so in order to pump I had to have the hard plastic against my nipples. Both of my nipples were bruised. Please spend the extra money and get a Medella pump. There is a reason why hospitals use them, THEY WORK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I did not anticipate doing much pumping, so a manual pump was fine for me. However, this one is junk. It gets the milk out (however slowly) but after two or three hand washings the massage gasket is compromised and painfully compresses your nipples. This is particularly bad when trying to ease the discomfort of engorgement when your milk first comes in.

I struggled to get thru it and I rarely found an exciting page that would normally encourage me to continue reading. I wasted money on this book because it was highly rated. I often thought of a comment that a good friend of mine said, he said; \\" I don't care how much a book cost me, if it doesn't keep me engaged, I throw it in the trash.\\" I thought of that comment on just about every page while reading this book. Sorry, but I must be honest."},{"rating":"2","title":"JSam","review":"I agree with most of the reviews. Some stated their box upon delivery was in bad shape.

I agree shorter people are going to need some propping. Bike is sturdy. Instructions are clear. Overall a pretty good bike. Seat is semi-comfortable. I really like the computer monitor. It monitors distance, heart rate and even have programs.

My nephew who assembled the bike stated the directions therfor were clear concise and relatively easy. My only comment relates to my inability to view television while riding bike since the front portion blocks the viewing area.

I am 78 years old vice under 13."},{"rating":"1","title":"Customer Service really SUCKS with this company","review":"I just bought this through Amazon and then put it together pretty quickly. Packaging was lousy, as others have already mentioned, and 3 pieces were either missing or broken, so I had to call for them. First customer service rep was ok, but the next day I found the pedal crank making a sound, and called back, but the next rep claimed that I put the pedals on wrong and refused to exchange the main part containing the gears. I held up the phone to the machine so he could hear it, and he acknowledged hearing the noise, but said I would have to open up the unit and identify the broken or loose piece on my own. The unit came w/ that part already sealed, so I don't know how they can expect me to spend my time playing maintenance technician on their product. Although the product appears to be engineered well, any company that's not willing to correct their mistakes deserves a negative rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"great deal - great product","review":"We had in mind the type of exercise bikes we wanted. We investigated several brands, models, and vendors. The Schwinn 212 appeared to be the best value. And, given the free shipping, Amazon had the best price. So we ordered.

I went ahead and purchased this in October of 2007. I am fairly active in other respects, so perhaps used my Schwinn an average of 2 times per week over the 2 year period (which works out to approximately 200 times). The bike was fairly decent to begin with. After about a year there was a discernible noise as my right foot pushed forward, but that was nothing a little more volume on the TV couldn't fix. Then tonight, to my dismay, my left pedal snapped right off where it connects to the 'wheel' section. I give it 2 stars generously. But this machine certainly didn't help quash my previously held notion about Schwinn quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product and VERY sturdy!!!","review":"We bought this quite a while back, and we really enjoy it. We're ageing ex-mountain bike riders, and at the age of 60+ we have quit riding the elements and riding indoors now~ this bike takes everything we can dish out and it is VERY sturdy.

This seems to be a recurring problem with this company."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well built bike","review":"This is a great bike. It has all the features you could want and is very confortable. Assembly was very easy and the instructions couldn't be clearer. As other reviews have mentioned, packaging is terrible and mine arrived with a broken leveler foot. However, one phone call and a new one arrived within two days - that is great service. Customer service is thru Nautilus so you might guess who is actually building this bike. I guess my only complaint is that the computer screen sits so high that I can't see over it to watch TV and therefore have to keep the bike at an angle - not a big complaint but keep it in mind in case that makes a difference in your room arrangment."},{"rating":"2","title":"I haven't buy this, but...","review":"In flames es la neta asì que aunque no tenga este cd sè q està chido, y ahora si me disculpan, tengo que poner a esta obra maestra en mi Cart.In fgames kicks ass!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy","review":"This binder holds a lot and is huge!

There are more than 20 million people with thyroid disease (not the 12 million the author quotes) and half of them are undiagnosed. If it's so easily diagnosed and treated, this would not be the case.If you want more than \\"easy to diagnose, easy to treat\\" -- and let's face it, patients deserve more than that -- you're better off with any of the books by the Shameses, Mary Shomon, Elaine Moore, or Ridha Arem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very basic information","review":"If you know nothing at all about thyroid problems, this book will give you a very basic understanding of what they are.

It uses interesting stories and facts in the book to tell about the different energies that were used. Crosby includes basic knowledge of energy, for those who are not familiar with it. This knowledge is paired with more scientific information, but the information is presented in an understandable way. Not only is the information understandable, but the book is written in a way that is easy to read.The author of this book tries to make a point on humankind's thirst for energy. I believe he was successful in his attempt. Crosby shows how people only wanted more energy as time went on, and how we continue to feed off of energy today. Not only does this book provide wonderful historical information, but it also makes a comment on how dependent we are on energy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very practical","review":"This is a very practical book of great use to those who are beginning to study phonetics and phonology.

The holes were not chew holes, but caused by her stepping on it and being poked by her toe nails. Even with trimmed nails, simply her weight and feet started to damage the bed and has resulted in a life expectancy for the fabric of about a month. The frame is still fine. I called for warranty on this and Coolaroo says that they only cover sun damage (not an issue in this case since the bed is indoors) and not wear/tear.

The holes for the screws must be precisely pre-drilled, and you are installing the screws in the holes 'blind' - Coolaroo assumes you have periscopic vision. You will need 1-2 other people to assist in positioning the blind up to the screw holes and installing the screws. I bought much longer screws, as the teeny ones included are clearly insufficient.

Customer Service told me to buy new hot-dipped galvanized screws to remount. They will not corrode. So I still have more more blinds that, I guess, will fall down sometime soon.

The size is good for serving up to 4 people. Have owned and used this slow cooker occasionally since 2004. Mine is the red color, and some of the plastic parts are changing colors a little to a darker red/purple hue. No big deal though.Only issue is that the ceramic bowl cracked after only a few uses. Nesco customer service was very good (in 2004) and replaced the bowl for free (I had to pay to ship the cracked bowl back).

I find it works best when it's about 1:1 water to clay, but some people might prefer it to be more or less runny. It's up to you. Also, you can use whatever you want - water, carrot juice, green tea, if you know what works best with your skin. For me, plain old water is the perfect mix.

Two crashes, caused by a design flaw that should not have occurred, squandered the lead the Comet had over itsAmerican rivals and it's fair to say the UK aviation has never recovered.This book traces the origins, design, manufacture and use of the jet. It even goes into detail about its long-lived military variant, the Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft.I can't think of any facets of the aircraft this book doesn't address.If you're a student of commercial aviation history, this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect product","review":"this product doenst leave any residue...not stiff. you have smooth and soft hair without the wave.

There used to be a \\"sled\\" on which the drive was mounted, and the electronics were firmly attached to the sled.

The multimedia studio would neither save audio clips of .mp3s to the PC nor transfer them to the phone as ringtones, insisting that my computer lacked an .mp3 codec. The only functioning aspect seemed to be switching on the usb modem.

Nothing about this edition matched what Motorola was telling me--the CD menus were wrong, the options were different, the serial number didn't have the right string. Finally, after I verified the purchase, Motorola sent me a link to the legitimate U.S. version of the software, and that detected my phone right away, and it's working fine.If you order from here, be sure they send you the correct edition, not the Asian version they sent me and several others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, not even if it was free.","review":"I have a commercial account with multiple phones, V365s and RAZR V3s.

I subsequently learned that there are known issues with different versions and service pack levels of W2K as well as XP. I finally un-installed the software and threw it away. I purchased what was advertised as a retail package but what I got was a CD and two cables stuffed in a bubble wrap envelope (which is what I expected for the price but it should have been described correctly).

Motorola wasn't much help either when I contacted them; they talked about using a Blue Tooth, but they couldn't tell me what to get and said to contact my computer maker.

Top 10 won hands down.It's crammed with information but fits in a back pocket and has super-useful fold out maps. Although I bought a separate map of Barcelona, I never felt the need to use it. The authors are aware that they're not writing a novel: they present nicely formatted information that I found easy to scan quickly in order to pick out the attractions most interesting to me.

Find out the history behind the community and professional bands, and how they have influenced the development of school bands. Great information about all the different kinds of bands from the 19th century including lots of photos.

This is not a Paul Young album, he is just one one 7 merrymen (who are all serious musicians), sharing vocals and playing guitar. From tigh-slapping, taquilla-swilling highs to sultry sunset ballads, this album is all about fun and living. Stand-out tracks are 'My,My,My,My', 'Shadows on the Rise', 'Raised on Margaritas' and 'Do We Really Want the Same Things'.

Maybe I'm being unfair, but I was expecting something with detail on the order of the Places Rated Almanac series. There was no such detail. The CD ROM focus seemed to be on the 50 Gay-Friendly places. I'm no homophobe, but what the H#!! does Gay-Friendly have to do with families? So overall, very disappointing book.

Rather than simply pointing out the usual claim that nazism was defined strictly by the hatred of Jews , Doctor Peikoff details the exact cultural state and philosophy that made such horrendous acts palatable to an otherwise ordinary citizens,ie. the German people. His comparison to the cultural and intillectual state of America today is chilling.William Sekerak"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant comparison","review":"While there is a tendency for those of us who are very conservative to embrace every theory about \\"WHY\\" this book is written in such a way that the reader is left to decide what is contributing to the current agenda of our government.

If you want to know what destroyed the land of \\"poets and philosophers\\" and how their intellectual heirs are trying to destroy this one, this book is a must read. My only complaint is that he gives the Heisenburg uncertainty principle what I think is unfair treatment. But Peikoff isn't a physical scientist, so his expertise is not in this field. Other than a nit-picky physics problem, this book is a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"COULD IT HAPPEN HERE?","review":"Dr. Peikoff's thesis is that: if a highly civilized and cultured nation such as Germany could spiral down into the abyss of statism, tyranny, and the mystical horrors and justification of Nazism, then it could happen to the United States, which is well on it's way to establishing a monolithic governmental apparatus that eventually will regulate every aspect of its citizens' lives. The citizen will exist to serve the state -- not the state existing for the benefit of the citizen. He might well be right -- maybe it could happen here. But, predictions are just that --predictions, and no matter how soundly reasoned, cannot predict unexpected elements or trends or movement that do not exist at the moment, but could become the deciding factors several years hence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Important Book You Will Ever Read","review":"I cannot, in my own words, invoke interest in this book for the curious reader.

It does so in crystal clear terms with impeccable logic.I do not think I have ever seen so many intellectually dishonest reviews as I have for this book. Ayn Rand, whose philosophy forms the philosophical base of Peikoff''s book, was the greatest, most profound and most philosophically consistent defender of individual rights in history--better(more consistent and more complete) than Locke, better than Jefferson. This is obvious to anyone who has actually read her works. For those who are interested, I recommend reading her works first hand rather than taking the word of her \\"conservative\\" enemies who have always been hysterically enraged by her refusal to believe in the irrational (e.g., God)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only 'feverish' writing here is Peikoff's own","review":"The negative reviews here do not look 'feverish' to me - and if that remark is supposed to be an objective assessment by an actual Objectivist, it tells me something about Objectivism. (I wonder why it is that positive reviews of Objectivist books include so much silly sneering at other reviewers. Do you suppose there is a connection with Rand's 'philosophy'?) In fact Ayn Rand had a very great deal in common with both Nietzsche and Marx, facts which are apparently lost on the miseducated Peikoff and his even less educated readers. And if Objectivists think Rand's approach to 'rights' had much of anything in common with Locke's, they are not reading her very carefully. (Or perhaps it is Locke they have not read. Objectivists do not consult original sources very often, do they?) Perhaps Peikoff's book has 'struck a nerve' because he, like Rand before him, is incompetent and mistaken - or had Objectivists considered that possibility?"},{"rating":"1","title":"contradictory","review":"I don't understand how this guy can even exist: isn't the core assertion of Rand's thought that you should never be another's disciple?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Please...","review":"I do enjoy reading various view points, but this tired rhetoric didn't get any better in long form than it was in sound bites."},{"rating":"1","title":"A MINOR WORK EXEMPLIFYING THE HOLOCAUST","review":"Penetrates nowhere near the root of the Holocaust: namely, the philosophical ideas that led to it.The \\"certain ideas\\" that led Germany inevitably to Auschwitz are not addressed anywhere in this moronic volume, whose author in fact subscribes to every last one of them. Those ideas were, and are, nothing more than variations of the fundamental atheistic creed that human beings answer to no moral authority higher than their own \\"nature.\\" The Founding Father of the Third Reich was the totalitarian Aristotle, who was worshipped by Rand and her sycophantic followers.The controversial aspect is how these ideas are being accepted right now, in America today.Warning: this creed has many guilty friends on the left and on the right, as can be seen in the truly bizarre responses below.

The first was a toddler board book, but the seller's listing mentioned nothing other than hardback edition. A toddler book is very hard to share with 25 children at circle.

Tenure battles, personal stories of anguish, and barriers to unionization provide the reader a thorough and actually entertaining escape from their own problems resulting from the increased use of contingent faculty.Although it appears as that the University of Phoenix is being singled out as the great perpetrator, the fact the students have a choice is overlooked. There are more University of Phoenix style schools out there, some of which are being organized with tremendous entrepreneurial funding sources and will probably eclipse Phoenix.The diverse array of assembled writers and editors adds variety and perspective to this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Spanish Folk-Rock","review":"I fell in love with Christina the moment I listened to her while living in Mexico.

They're great if you want to sit down and painstakingly try to figure out who's talking and what they're saying. In contrast to Michael Beschloss' wonderfully edited and audible LBJ tapes, the narrator here rarely lets you know who is talking. But more importantly, only about 10% of the conversations are discernible. You can almost never hear what Nixon is saying. They must intend for the buyer to sit down with transcripts and listen to the tapes while reading the transcripts. I don't see how else you could gain much from the tapes."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 Stars for content, 2 stars for audio quality.","review":"When you can actually hear people talking it is interesting. The problem is the audio quality is so horrible 75% of the time its not worth the effort. No narration, barely any setup to the material, like 10 seconds of presentation per casette side???However, rarely, when you are able to make out the words...its pretty amazing to hear these things.So 5 stars for content, nothing like actual proof, its on tape. 1 star for lack of narration/setup, and audio quality on everything but the phone conversations is really poor.The LBJ tapes I listened to were 10x better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Nixon Tapes","review":"If, like me, you have been avidly awaiting the production of the Nixon Watergate tapes, so you could hear this unique piece of history for yourself, you will be very sorely disappointed. As previous reviewers have said, the big problem is that you can hardly make any of it out - nor do you generally know who is even speaking at any given time.This volume is, sadly, a huge flop. Poor production values without an attempt to either clean up the tapes or help the listener in any other way (e.g. meaningful narration).The first company that can, in some way, clean up these old recordings and make them audible and clear will make a killing in the market! I would certainly be happy to pay a premium to hear them.

The number of possible creations really keeps this game feeling fresh each time you play. The only drawback here is toward the end of the game. You'll be down to that hard-to-obtain shape and it often feels like nothing more than luck by the time a particular player ends up winning; because everyone will be down to that final shape they need and hoping for a lucky roll.

I thought it would show race cars up close, but I was wrong. During the first 15 or 20 minutes the video follows some old dude (retired racer - I\\"m not a Nascar expert so maybe this guy is someone famous?) as he takes his granddaughter to a race track to look at racer's trailers, buy a tee-shirt, dance on some tires, etc. You also get to look at some rims and tires and there are some goofy songs about tires, too. Eventually they go into a driver's trailer, who apparantly is the father of one of the kids in the movie, but he's asleep and they have to wake him up. At this point you really haven't seen any good car scenes. By now my patience was exhausted so we put in a movie about trains, and watched that. Overall, a disappointing movie and not recommended.

First, the sound quality is terrible. It sounds like an AUD tape, or worse, a SB patch that has been filtered through an AM radio! Whew. Very disappointing after the first few beats. Second, it's boring! Many extended jams see the band members in a groove that's so relaxed it sounds like they're on autopilot. I love this band and have seen them live, but this isn't representative.

Coming from a different engineering background, I was frustrated by not able to grasp the basic concept and fundamental mathematic behind the subject of digital signal processing.Through the reviews and amazing recommendation engine from Amazon, I came across this book by Lyons and looked it up from the library. As I was reading the preface and the first chapter, I knew it is the best DSP book I have ever read. Each new terms and mathematical representations are introduced clearly with examples and background/history. You could just basically understand the whole chapter without digging into other textbooks.If you are someone who is just starting to learn more about DSP or an experienced DSP engineer who like to cross-examine your understanding, this is the book for you and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"crystal clear, deep and dense","review":"I bought this book after an extensive quest in Usenet-Internet for the 'best book' available on DSP, and at the end I am definitely satisfied of my purchase. I particularly enjoyed the crystal clear explanation of everything, which points your intuition in the right direction before exposing the (not trivial) mathematical concepts. By sure the Author wrote this book trying to be in the reader's shoes, always coaching him towards understanding like a good teacher does. I wish I had this book handy when I wrote my Thesis; I could have grasped the concepts without making heavy use of my mathematical intuition and background (which took five years and a MSEE to achieve, something you don't need to read this book, definitely). All the concepts of DSP are covered here; so be sure that you will be an expert by the end of the book, and you will have an invaluable reference on your bookshelf. In short: a crystal-clear, deep and dense DSP encyclopedia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent intro to DSP","review":"I am a software designer and only interested in how to use the FFT, FIR or IIR to achieve DSP on telephony devices. To me, give me a sub-routine and parameters, all I need to know is how to effectively and correctly use it. This book not only tells me what kind of the parameters might be for these sub-routines and but also the inside of these techniques plus the interrelations among various factors. This book combined with Steven W. Smith's FREE digital signal processing book (online free at http://www.dspguide.com) would allow computer professionals with no previous DSP knowledge quickly get ready for the basic DSP techniques.Highly recommended!

Requires very basic knowledge of engineering math and walks you through the most complex DSP topics effortlessly. Perhaps the best self-stufy text on the topic. Makes cover to cover reading enjoyable. Go get one for yourself. Recommended. Only question: Why all engineering books are priced in the stratosphere?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Introduction to DSP","review":"Lyons does a great job of introducing DSP concepts without getting overly technical too quickly.

Great for outdoors..","review":"This handheld will accommodate pretty much everything you would expect and require from an outdoor gps handheld. Although the screen is a bit small, the bright lcd makes up for it. The unit itself is well built, and could take a beating I really didn't expect (dropped it a few times during MTB). Ergonomic design comes in handy. The unit fits securely on the palm of your hand, and works well if you only have one hand to spare. it's light enough to wear on a belt clip. Perfect use for outdoor hiking, MTB, or walking through the urban jungle (don't suggest using it as an automotive nav system; it's like your 90 year old grandma driving and reading street signs with her only good eye).I like the flexibility of the microsd card.

Fortunately that GPS unit was stolen prompting me to buy the Garmin eTrex Venture along with the North American mapping software and a 2 GB micro sd card from sandisk. It all worked flawlessly right out of the box. The microcard fit into a SD card adapter. I loaded the map software onto my laptop and plugged the SD card into my laptop and downloaded maps of areas of interest. I removed the micro SD card from the adapter and plugged it into the GPS unit and it actually worked to show detailed maps and points of interest (e.g. gas stations, restaurants, etc).

In what amounts to a worldwide Bossa Nova phenomenon, Brazilian music in the last 5 years has inspired a vast number of talented producers from Europe all the way to Asia. This collection ofreconstructions and remixes by Peter Kruder(Kruder and Dorfmeister), Rae and Christian, King Britt, Reiner Truby Trio, Da Lata, 4hero, and others, is not only impressive for the talent it gathers on one record, but also for transcending the original versions and elevating them to new grounds, while retaining all of Bebel's smooth tropical sensuality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sgt.

But are you really going to play this CD more than once? I do like the concept of remixing, because finding a good remix is like finding money in your pocket that you didn't know you have.

I gave it two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not able to give it zero stars","review":"I didn't think it could get worse, but it did. The first CD by Bebel is simply horrible. This one takes horrible to another level. It's usually indicative that an artist has few original ideas when the 2d CD is simply a rehash of the first one. This is even moreso when one forces this electronic noise onto a musical style like bossa nova which is beautiful on its own. Luckily, I didn't purchase these CDs, someone I know made the mistake of purchasing them.Even if one can somehow convince themselves that this is good music, one should know what a spoiled brat this Bebel is. I heard her rudely ask a radio DJ here in the SF BAy area when the interview was going to end and then to make a point to correct her Portuguese pronunciation.

Indoors, however, we had to find the right distance from an object to take a pretty good picture.

We also don't like that the flash turns off when the camera is turned off. Our biggest issue though is the battery. It can only be charged through the computer (so much for taking it on vacation) and a 12 hour charge keeps it working for only 2-3 hours, at which point it needs another all day/night charge.

On Slide Show, Cashdollar cuts loose with a host of musicians, including slide wizard Sonny Landreth, Dobro master Mike Auldridge, steel legend Herb Remington, and fingerpicker Jorma Kaukonen. Armed with a roomful of instruments - tripleneck Remington and Fender console steels, Rickenbacker and Campbell lap steels, and National Tricone, Beard, and Dobro resonators - Cashdollar reveals her mastery of electric and acoustic blues, Western swing, moody instrumentals, and bayou R&B.

Elvis was devastated by the betrayals and crushed that his daughter would learn such embarrasing things about her father.

After 2 treatments my water was improving. My water finally became clear. My water was nasty. This product help me not have to drain the entire pool.

You can fit most if not all your gear plus laptop and a few folders (for me it eliminates the need for a breifcase). The wheels make it simple to use when travelling. There are two limitations: First, once you get to your destination it will be combersome to use off the beaten path, so you may want to bring along a smaller bag, flat in your checked luggage to use in the field. Second, it weighs 10 lbs empty. Some airlines have weight restrictions for carry-on luggage, which this thing can easily exceed when full. Check your airline before you fly and be nice at the ticket counter!One other note. Although it has the ability to carry a tripod, don't plan to travel with it that way; the bag will not fit in the over-head with the tripod attached. Put the tripod in another bag and attach it later if you want."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, great product","review":"Will be traveling with this product next week, so that will be the proof.

Jim's classical training and Middle Eastern influence coupled with JP & Lisa's Flamenco style have created a dynamic sound who's rhythm gets into your soul. The pure amount of passion that they pour into their music shows.Track #7, Sophie, is my personal favorite.

I'm a big fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please have there be a book on Casey","review":"I LOVED all of the books about the brothers and I just couldn't put it down. Lori Foster is such a good writer and I love all of her books and Harlequin has to let her write that book about Casey. She just can't leave it like that.

Although this book doesn't have as much detail as the FE Review Manual (it doesn't have review sections), and sometimes the problems are worked out differently than I was taught in class, I still found this book very helpful. The chemical section problems were very similar to these problems (if not a little easier) and I felt very prepared. I highly recommend using this book to study."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought it but didn't use it!","review":"It had been almost two years since I graduated with my chemical engineering degree. I bought this book along with the general review book by the same publisher. I ended up spending all my review time with the general book and I even went with the general afternoon session because the test turned out to be pretty easy. Seriously folks, the general book is all you need. I'm no genius but the test was laughably easier than I thought it was going to be. The actual test was way easier than the practice tests! Don't get me wrong, you still need to study hard. Just study from the general book, do all the practice problems and tests, then prepare to rock!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"Please do not be mislead into thinking it is as comprehensive as the FE Review Manual - this book contains ONLY problems and solutions - NO THEORY.I would not purchase this book if given the same opportunity.Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"user guide in Mandarin","review":"The phone only works with a telephone system control unit, you can not plugged anywhere.The user guide is not in English language.I ask for the correct user guide and they said to me that I have to find it by myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfies my expectation","review":"This particular unit (others may be different) is branded as Bosch but the pump unit is a Walbro. Pump module is of good quality material and build, well designed ( it is not a carbon copy of the OEM unit). Only flaw I found was that a 5\\" return hose was not fitted but was no problem. Maybe not deemed necesary but, since all provisions for installing it were there, I put it in.Not disapointed for the pump not being a Bosch turbine unit as advertised (not Amazon's fault).

Are Reviews 1 to 9 real ???","review":"I had just read through Reviews 1 to 9 and am wondering if the Reviews were written by the same person, who was close to the auther for promotion purpose. Two reasons: 1. The writing styles of the nine reviews were much the same and half of the reviewers didn't give their names. 2. The nine reviews were concentrated in the short time period of 16 days between June 30 to July 16. There was no review between March 2004 (the month of publishing) and June 30, 2004 (first review), as well as July 16, 2004 (the latest review) and Jan. 29 2005 (today).

Is there a website directing them here with a fill in the blank script?Second, what are they welcoming him back from? Maybe they mean from bankruptcy court. Or maybe they mean welcome back from North Carolina or Oregon or Alaska, or any of the other 13 states with which Wade settled a lawsuit for deceptive practices. Or maybe from D.C., since the Federal Trade Commission was a joint plaintiff. And this guy is going to tell you how to pick stocks? (Google \\"Wade Cook\\" and \\"settlement\\")Third, visit www.wadecook.com. 'Nuff said.Keep both hands on your wallet with this guy.P.S.

The examples and stories are identical; it should be re-titled as \\"The Best of Wade\\". I read the book hoping that Wade had something new to offer after his seminar company filed for Chapter 11, but it is the same old stuff.The end of this re-do book heavily promotes his new seminars, which seem the same as his old seminars (that were deemed consumer fraud by numerous state & federal governments.)Wade is creative, so I'll look at new things he comes out with - but this isn't one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think it's a great single","review":"It might not be the best of DJ BOBO, but it's still a great song and it's got a good beat to it.

The winning stories are pleasantly varried, which makes the entire book a pleasure to read. I found most stories to be captivating, in an almost-miss-my-subway-stop kind of way. However, there were a couple that didn't quite gain that status in my mind.Among my favourites were \\"The Shell Collector\\" by Anthony Doerr, for its intreguing characters and dynamic plot, and \\"God's Goodness\\" by Marjorie Kemper, for its realistic simplicity.This is the type of book that makes a great gift, and is definitely one to share around with your friends and family. (Mostly so you can have someone to discuse the stories with, and why would you want to deny anyone a good story?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"a new low","review":"Prize Stories now has a new editor. I never thought I'd miss the old editors, but I do. This year's collection has reached a new low. There are almost no stories within this volume worth reading. Anthony Doerr's \\"The Shell Collector\\" is a phenomenal story. The other stories worth reading are by: Robyn Joy Leff, Marjorie Kemper, Tom Johnston, Tim O'Brien, and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.

I am a home school mom and this GED book, helps my child to understand fractions and algebra better then any math book I've ever ran across. I love how this book breaks down and simplifies learning math.

I just dont think that its quite up to par with the rest of their work. It acts as a good step toward the organization of their third album, but doesnt have the same quiet beauty of their first. The stuff on this album is solid, but i feel they turned more to distortion, which is a change. The only thing that i really dont like about this album is on track four when there are vocals. This more or less changed my perception of the band. And the album art may be my favorite of all of their, and it really shows the mood of the album. This album has its own distinct feel to it, which is so different from their other two that when im in the mood for this, i am not in the mood for their others, and vice versa. But a truely great album that i fully recomend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent,evocative instrumentals","review":"Very impressive. I saw these guys live, opening for \\"...and you will know us by the trail of dead\\" and had never heard them before. I was blown away, and bought the cd. Live, they sound quite a bit like Mogwai, but i thought the cd was more like Godspeed You Black Emporer. An excellent young new band. Well worth the money if you like this kind of instrumental rock. Very well done, great moody soundscapes with some cool bursts of noise. Check 'em out live if you get a chance, they're quite good..."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is the best album ever","review":"this group is amazing. their songs encapsulate so many emotions. they can help you deal with the death of a loved one. they can pump you up. they can make you reflect. it's such beautiful music. this is a must-own. i think the world would be a better place if this music were more appreciated."},{"rating":"2","title":"You like it, admit it.","review":"The best compliment I can pay to this band, and this album, is that people who had a garage band will really \\"get\\" this CD. Some of the stuff is the kind of occasional messing around that your band used to do, sans vocals, that sounded so damn pretty but you wouldn't admit to liking in front of your friends. This is, of course, honed, refined, planned, and probably a thousand times better.As far as post-rock goes, my own tastes don't jive too well with Godspeed or Mogwai, probably because they're a bit too subtle for my liking. This CD, however, is priceless. The songs fit together no matter where your attention is and at any volume level. It's both busy and soft. The emphasis is more on the feel and not on showing off and no musical fidelty is lost in that attempt."},{"rating":"2","title":"would do business again","review":"quality package, timely shipment. thanks! 15 more words required for this review so here you go. and more. and more."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre instrumental rock","review":"After reading reviews of this album on here, I finally got my own copy and here is my verdict: This release is OK/mediocre, I find that it does drag a bit at times, and there aren't any moments on it that blow you out of the water like gybe! or mogwai do many times. There are some promising moments on the album like the 1st and 2nd tracks, but the rest of the album sounds a bit un-focused and bland. Maybe I need to see them live? who knows, but this CD isnt anything to get excited over."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like it","review":"I read a review in the Riverfront Times, St. Louis. I had high hopes. Sorry, couldn't get through the disc: too boring.

I was very pleasantly surprised, to say the least, by some the most amazing post-rock Ive heard. It is very refreshing to hear someone play a guitar by bouncing a pen on the strings, incredible. If you like instrumental rock, you shouldnt have to think about buying this, just go ahead and get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome independent release.","review":"I found their stuff awhile back on another website and downloaded some of this album before I bought it. Its hard to describe exactly who they sound like, but I would compare them to Nine Inch Nails and Orgy, but not so electronic on some songs. This whole disc is a great listen all the way through, even though they haven't been picked up by a major label. This album takes me away to another place when I listen to it. Awesome release, and I'm looking forward to another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"old school meets new age","review":"this album is one of the best pieces of music that i have heard in a long time.

His Chopin is daringly innovative, skewed and almost heretical. Possessed of an existential bent, Katsaris ventures intrepidly into the nether regions of the composer's soul with a startling, and blatant, manifest intensity. He brings to the Sonatas an emotional arsenal second to none, a technique beyond criticism, and an otherworldly vision that is decidedly cosmic in its beauty. To hear the \\"Funeral March\\" Sonata played by Katsaris is to have the lid blasted off your psyche; and Sonata No. 3, with its gut-wrenching Largo, removes all doubt relative to whether or not these are mere performances or, rather, musical recreations of life, death and everything in-between.[Running time: 76:56]"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the younger job hunter","review":"Written for the younger job-hunter, although certainly comprehensive enough to help everybody, Women for Hire would make a great gift for new grads and young professionals on the job hunt.

The best part: detailed embroidery stitch guides which guide you though each stitch with a combination of pictures (usually 6 per stitch) and instructions. While looking for a needlework instruction book, none of the other books could compare. Either they lacked a variety of stitches or they did not have enough pictures to serve as a self-teaching guide for a visual learner with little sewing experience.

First, her first lines are TERRIBLE! I kept flipping through the book, scanning for something that would grab my attention, but was ultimately disappointed. Secondly, it appears as though she is milking the \\"Filipino\\" angle for all it's worth. There is nothing said in these poems about the Asian-American experience that hasn't been said before (and better). I find that her poems fall flat, lack any real emotion, and are simply, well, trite.Aimee may be having her day in the sun, but I feel as though these \\"miracles\\" will quickly be pushed under the rug as poets truly more willing to quit playing it safe emerge."},{"rating":"2","title":"first time buyer","review":"got in very good timing, the book was in excellent condition, cant tell that it is used."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy to see why so many are in love with this poet!","review":"Oh! oh! oh!

It only took a few turns before one of the 2 feet snapped off rendering the tool useless. I wish there was a better option as this particular tool seems to be the most commonly found puller online. I saw the other bad reviews mixed in with the good so I took a gamble and it didn't pay off. Steer clear and look for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small, but still works. Not good for a Mini Cooper.","review":"This product is much smaller than is practical for windshield wiper removal on the vehicles I used it on. Most importantly, it's not a very good tool to use on Mini Coopers, especially the rear wiper blade, which requires the same tool due to the protruding rod holding the windshield washer fluid jet. For a Mini Cooper you want the exact same tool, but a longer version. This one is too short/small."},{"rating":"2","title":"A neat little tool","review":"It pulls the wiper arm off without scratching the paint, it is much better than trying to pry it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke with first time use","review":"The very first time I tried to pull the wiper off of my boat, the plastic knob on the bolt broke off as I was turning it. I then tried using a wrench in place of the knob and the bolt sheared in half. A truly cheaply made product and not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless Paper Weight?","review":"Stay away from, it does not even qualify as a paper weight. Too small piece and the knob made of thin and cheap plastic, does not fit the windshield wiper pivot arm, even if it did, the knob is made cheaply and weak that it separates from the little structure upon the minmum amount of torque."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"First time using this tool it broke (3 different places). The end of the screw bent and then snapped off. I thought \\"Hey, I can still use this since some of the shaft is still there.\\" Then both of the \\"feet\\" on the bottom snapped off. It is made from really cheap metal that can't withstand any pressure on it, which is the whole purpose of a puller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inflexible Design Yields No Results","review":"I purchased one of these locally in order to remove the wiper arms off a '98 BMW. The neck of the tool isn't wide enough to center the tool on the threaded stud so it's very hard to apply torque. Futhermore, the knob provides little to no additional leverage to apply torque to the underside of the arms.Ultimately, I gave up on this tool and purchased theOTC 4611 Battery Terminal Pullerinstead. Unlike the 4676, the 4611 feels like a solid tool and got the job done with only a little hassle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little tool.","review":"You may not need much but it works great. Didn't have to pay a mechanic for such an easy fix, worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seek alternative products","review":"I recently purchased this item (OTC 4676 Windshield Wiper Puller) and am quite disappointed with the quality. The vehicle for which I purchased this item is approximately 7 years old so that may be a consideration of this review.The tool fit just fine, however I have two problems with the product. First the tip of the screw is rounded - that's fine if the wiper arm comes off on the first attempt. As I tightened the screw, it had a tendency to start to slip off the edge of the end of the screw as the wiper arm didn't budge.The second issue is that as I continued to tighten the screw, the arms at the bottom of the tool that fit under the wiper arm started to bend - eventually one of the little arms cracked rendering the tool useless...and the wiper arm is still attached.I recommend you seek an alternate tool constructed of a more durable metal or one using a more effective design."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not work on my car","review":"It did not work on my car Chevy Equinox 2007. Rear wiper blade base is too wide and puller cannot center on the bolt.

I got something like this http://www.amazon.com/Lisle-54150-Battery-Terminal-Puller/dp/B000I14RY6/ref=pd_bxgy_auto_img_b and it worked fine, it will work on all wiper blades regardless of the size."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"very pleased with this OTC 4676 Windshiled wiper remover remover the fist time I used this product iw worked very easy with no problems I would recomend this Wiper Arm remover to all my friends and family keep up the great customer service at Amozon.com Theodore Jackson"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"I bought this to remove the wiper arms from a 2002 Dodge Caravan.

I wouldn't recommend wasting your time with it unless you can find it used."},{"rating":"1","title":"A true dissappointment","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love Queensryche, they are an incredible band. I appreicate the fact that they are venturing into another concept album w/a pretty cool concept (forgotten pieces of artwork, that must have taken some time to think of). The music is all mid-tempo contemporary rock, a huge departure from their sound that made them who they are. It saddens me to say that I don't like a single song on the album. I give it two stars because of the concept and it's Queensryche."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Steeped in the Past","review":"Apparently, I am not able to move on from Queensryche's earlier works. And, I am probably still reeling from what I consider a disappointing solo effort from Geoff Tate. While there are some great riffs on this album (hence the fact that I actually gave it two stars), all of the songs seem a little incomplete. In Queensryche's earlier albums, the music took you to a certain high and then pushed you over the top. I do not get this same feeling on this album. I don't feel this album ever peaks or truly gets going at all. I am not looking for another \\"Mindcrime\\" or \\"Empire\\", but, I felt each album was a stepping stone in their style up until \\"Promised Land\\". I feel they have lost that signature dueling guitar wail and have gone into this weird transgression and have never truly taken that next step after \\"Empire\\". Still a great band, and I will still see them live. Just one man's opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressive","review":"I listened to this CD with the hope that it would be better than their previous work. I was wrong. The entire album was rewritten material with the what sounded like a band mailing in the music. If you like Queensrhyche, listen to Empire and Operaton Mindcrime. Those are very well written albums and worth your money. This is not. Steer clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"DeGarmo's farewell song is on this","review":"I bought this Cd for one reason and one reason only: The very last song Chris Degarmo wrote for Ryche is on it.

The song TRIBE is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"SIMPLY PUT.......THIS ALBUM ROCKS!!","review":"THE GREATEST BAND IN THE WORLD IS BACK. EVERYONE IN THE BAND LENDS TO THE SONG WRITING AND IT IS A MASTERPIECE. GEOFF HAS NEVER SOUNDED BETTER. WHEN YOU SEE THESE SONGS LIVE IT IS EVEN BETTER.

This album is the same drivel as the &#65533;Ear&#65533; album and Q2K. Gone are the meaningful lyrics. Gone is the powerful music that made your heart pump. Gone are Geoff&#65533;s passionate vocals. (And after seeing him live again, I know he still has it in him.) I will say Tribe is better than HitNF and Q2K, however it is still just another stripped down, watered away, meaningless mess.Promised Land was their last good album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tribe","review":"This is an example of a band trying to experiment or evolve and taking it WAY too far. This album is simply boring and lackluster. The band simply seemed to run out of ideas and inspiration. It's an album of nothing but filler material start to finish. I'm glad I heard this before going out to buy it. This is the reason why downloading should be legal. You should be able to sample the goods before putting your money down. My faith in this once great band is going down the drain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Than Q2K, but That's All You Can Say For It","review":"While nominally better than \\"Q2K\\" before it, \\"Tribe\\" is as dull as can be. The guitar sound itself improves upon the previous album and the vocals are great, but there are no guitar solos whatsoever or decent riffs to speak of. This seems to be a concept album of sorts, since it's called \\"Tribe\\" and there are tribal type rhythms throughout the album, but the songs are droning and pretty uninteresting for the most part. I care to forget where Geoff Tate almost seems to rap briefly on the track, \\"Desert Dance.\\" Sadly, unlike the previous album, this does sound like the same great band who recorded \\"Empire,\\" albeit with nothing interesting to say, even though I don't think Queensryche themselves realize this yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite disappointing","review":"After much anticipation Queensryche has released Tribe, their latest studio album.I found it to be pale in comparison the the classics of the past. (The Warning, Rage for order). I had been very hopeful of a masterpiece considering Chris Degarmo had returned to record this album. It seems the band is so focused on getting their message across lyrically, that they forgot about the music. There is not even one memorable track on the album, it is a whole disc full of soft, ballad like songs. I think the whole band should sit down and listen to Operation Mindcrime and remember that is possible to send a message while still composing some Amazing rock music."},{"rating":"1","title":"For all you MindCrime fans...","review":"There is good news for all us MindCrime fans, after being dissapointed with ALL that Queensryche has done since Promised Land, I've decided to look for the good stuff. And I've found it! Check out PAIN OF SALVATION, and you will see. You must own the two latest albums \\"The Perfect Element\\" & \\"Remedy Lane\\", and you can download your favourites from \\"Entropia\\" & \\"ONE HOUR BY THE CONCRETE LAKE\\". Be aware for their 2003 album \\"BE\\".We will not miss Queensryche anymore! Well, and if we do, we can always listen to \\"Operation Mindcrime\\", \\"Promised Land\\" & \\"The Warning\\" over and over again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"remove your frontal lobes","review":"sad... wahed up ...uninspired ...embarrassing...A friend of mine pressured me into listening to this. I quite liked Opreation Mindcrime and Promised Land and a lot of their early material. I remember seeing them live many years ago backing up KISS...man they had power and passion. Do you remember the movie Planent of the Apes when the apes removed the frontal lobes of one of the astronauts. He was basically lifeless... which reminds me of this music... and anyone who would actually like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the reviews, not mindcrime but good","review":"This is a good cd from queensryche although it is not mindcrime or empire but it beats the heck out of q2k. The opening track is my favorite and the next 3 songs are also my favorites. All the tracks are good to very good. Tracl..I think 8 and 9 are my least favorite. It's not the classic they could have given 4 years to write the cd but it's still a solid effort. It puts me in mind of hear in the now frontier, promisedland, and a little something different. If your looking for a classic you'll be disapointed but if you want a solid rock cd then amybe this will add to your queensryche collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"how many different ways can one say awful","review":"my oh my (no not the old slade song) what a waste of my time. Queensryche just sucked one hour of my life away. I could have spent that hour douing something alot more productive, like staring at the wall or picking my nose. Raise your hand if you remember when queensryche had balls. This disc is awful, there is just nothing going on here, no wonder Chris DeGarmo wants nothing to do with this. Save your money and go buy something else or waste it on fast food at least you'll remember that longer than you will remember this disc. The production is awful, the liner notes are awful (4 panels with thank yous and a picture of a bald Geoff Tate...eeghads)and most importantly the songs are awful, what a train wreck...sad really, its just so sad"},{"rating":"2","title":"Musically Incredible","review":"Considering myself one of the biggest Queensryche fans on the planet, I am very happy with the newest release \\"Tribe\\". Musically, the material is incredible, Geoff Tate is incredible as usual, and the band sounds incredible. The percussion on this material is outstanding, Scott Rockenfield has outdone himself.My only problem with the material is lyrically the album is a bit preachy especially the song \\"Blood\\". One of the main reasons I like bands like Queensryche is because of intelligent song writing, but I'm getting to the point where I'm tired of rich musicians criticizing the country that gives them the freedom to do what they do. By no means is the entire CD like this, but there is some isolated songs that have this view.Overall, if you are a Queensryche fan or a fan of progressive rock in general it's worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it!","review":"Just got Tribe today. I have played it twice now and I'm amazed at how good this thing actually is. After their last album, Q2K, I thought this one was gonna be the same boring slow song one after another. I was wrong. There is a good mix on this record and a couple of the songs are weird again- I missed weird Queensryche! Tribe is just brilliant and so is The Art of Life. The album opens with....well Open....and it will get lots of radio play I forsee. I'm pleasantly surprised by this disc and recommend it to all QR fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I was expecting Tribe to be a great comeback for Queensryche considering the fact that Q2k was a major let down. I heard Open and was hoping for greatness,but instead heard their lowpoint.The only reason to see this band live is to hear the old stuff.I believe sadly that Queensryche is incapable of making in more decent albums.This cd is sadly a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter Disappointment","review":"I loved Queensyche in the 80's and early 90's. Hell, I loved bits and pieces of thier last two CD's, even though they were clearly inferior to their catalog. When I saw Degarmo was back I rushed out and got this one, raced home with some good beer, sat back in my lazy boy away from the family and cranked it up.Talk about letdowns. I haven't listened to it since. I'm sure I'll give it a fair shake down the line, but right now, 5 months later I'm still waiting. If this is all Queensryche can do then its time to hang it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ryche Lives !!!!","review":"What can I say about this albumn, DAMN!!! Best albumn since Empire. Welcome back Queensryche !! The rejoining of Chris DeGarmo must have energized the band. They sound absolutely like they have not lost a step since Empire. Keep it up guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't win new fans","review":"I've been a fan since the EP. Queensryche started off as an interesting band, but by the time Empire came out, they lost it. Yes, I know that album was huge, but I didn't care for it. Rage For Order, The Warning and Operation Mindcrime really rock.Tribe just doesn't sound like a hungry band. Where are the songs that you want to hear over and over again? Orginal line-up or not, these guys sound like they are just treading water. The mix is so lousy that you can't make out Tate's vocals clearly. Buy only if you are a completist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original line-up","review":"You can see (hear) Chris DeGarmo's finger prints all over Tribe; note the slide guitar.It seems as though Scott's drumming is kept on a short leash on many of the tracks.As always, Geoff Tate is ... Geoff Tate; In a class by himself.I wasn't real crazy about Q2K, so it is refreshing to hear the original line-up again."},{"rating":"1","title":"PASS ON THIS ON","review":"This a really bad demo. There is no bigger Queensryche fan than me but they should have retired in 92. They have a handfull of good songs since but they are embarassing themselves. They used to make historic groundbreakig records now the oly ground that is broke is me an my shovel burying the cd in the nearest landfill. If Queensryche were an unsigned band this cd would be laughed at and the A&R guy would be fired. Just keep playing your old music why waste the listeners time with this garbage. Put in anything pre 92 mostly RAGE or the Warning with headphones and all and keep smiling til the grave. As A Ryche fan I have officially stop buying new stuff from them If they were a racehorse they wouldn't be put down but they would definitley be giving rides at the local fare to children under 5. Sorry Geoff. Just sing all the Ryche songs acoustically and we will all come running back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than mediocre.","review":"I loved QR since the beggining and I went to their concerts. I don't expect any band to put out the same sound over and over again...change is good...but unfortunatelly there is nothing here that grabs me...on the previous albums, it was very difficult to find a song that I didn't like. I wish they would put a little more effort into making an album. Putting an album out just for the sake of it it's just lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing-Chris DeGarmo","review":"They say Chris Degarmo played on this record,but you might have to listen really hard to hear him.I feel sad they a once great band has lost its power.Geoff Tate and Michael Wilton are to good to stoop to this level.Maybe just maybe they should regroup with Chris Degarmo alone and start over.Chris DeGarmo was Queensryche.Without him, I just ask why?But back to the record Tribe,I can just say it wasn't as bad as QR2."},{"rating":"2","title":"good job!!","review":"After listening to this album a few times today I can truly say that I enjoy it. Sounds like a mixture of his solo stuff, Hear In The Now Frontier and Q2K. Geoff Tates is one of my favorite singers and sound excellent as usual. The entire album has a nice upbeat sound to it. Open and Rhythm of Hope would have to be my favs so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this product-Not even a star!","review":"This sounds like a good product, but it is not and the company is bad about their customer service.

So I went into the HD through My computer and cleared them off, thinking that would clear it off. Nope, it still said there were images there. Went a step further and formated the thing. Did that fix it. Nope, all it did was remove if from this earth. DOS doesn't even see it. The only way it is seen by the computer is if the hard cover is taken off and then DOS will read it.

I will admit we are only three chapters into the book, but so far the book is not helping me to understand the material the way I think a textbook should.

The only real issue I have that no other review (not even a 1, 2, or 3 star review) mentions is this. The book doesn't provide notes for conceptual pitfalls that can and will arise when reading it. A good example is the word \\"vector.\\" There are actually 2 types of vectors mentioned: one from the linear algebra camp, the other from the vector calculus school of thought. These two types of vectors are actually quite different. A vector calculus vector almost always refers back to a 2 or 3 dimensional description of the motion or transmission of mass, energy, waves, and particles in a vertical/horizontal plane or in three-dimensional space; whereas a linear algebra vector more-often-than-not represents an arbitrary set of ordered numbers in a 1XN or NX1 matrix that is simply meaningless as a physical vector."},{"rating":"1","title":"The appliques could be done better by a child.","review":"Bought the book, very disappointed in the kindergarten project appearance of the techniques explained here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good definitive edition","review":"As the others have said, the score is small enough to be convenient and large enough to read for the most part, although there are two or three pages where some staves are faded slightly.

However, the shelves, backer, and balance of the construction were thin pressed board in a monotone off-white color. It was very light weight and not the quality I expected.

Even the titles, excepting \\"A Few Fish and Anonymous Spaniards,\\" are completely lacking in imagination. If this is the best our universities have to offer, then the outlook is truly dismal. The blame thus belongs to Ms. Hoffman, a writer of some imagination and skill, but apparently a terrible reader based on this volume and her effort as editor of The Best American Short Stories 1994, the weakest of the series in decades.

My 4 month old puppies are trained to go on these pads bc I have them as indoor dogs rather than outdoor dogs. The only flaw is that I wish they were a tiny bit thicker and more absorbant only bc in the morning or after a lot of water was consumed the puddles can be a bit large. Otherwise, they are great, the coverage is perfect, even for two Chihuahua mix puppies (they are 6 and 9 lbs). I keep reordering these pads bc its the best price out there and great quality as well!

Guess I should've stuck with the more expensive kind that actually works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does What it is Suppose to Do!","review":"Overall this is an excellent product. The pads do their job and the compatible tray is a real pluse. I choose this product because it does just what it suppose to do as my puppy naturally goes on the pad when he has to. It's best to get the 100 pack as you will be using these alot for a puppy. The only problem is not with the pads, it's with my Jack Russell Terrier's temperment when he get's upset that I am not there with him. He has a tendency to claw and destroy the pads but only if I leave him alone for too long.

These things made this product completely unusable. The size small is incredibly small. I have a 7lb puppy that doesn't even have room to circle and I even think they would have been too small even when he was 4lbs. Their is no adhesive on the bottom which means he can easily move the pads around which is a total pain when you're trying to train your puppy to use the pad to pee rather than as a toy. Other than that they do seem very absorbent and I may try these again once my dog is older and completely trained.<>"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very thin","review":"I orginally purchased Downtown Pet Supply PUPPY PADS and then tried these. . .

My suggestion is to be sure to get the Iris pad holders it is worth the money. My little guy is using these with no complaint. He actually has the Iris playpen 8 panel as well and he has gone in there to use the pad on his own. I'm so proud! He is only 9 weeks old and he knows where to go. I've only had him for 3 days.

Perfect size for putting side by side in the extra large piddle pad holder too. I do have to say as well, that Sheldon gives them a test at times and piddles right on the very edge...still no leaks.

The soundtrack as a whole is simply outstanding, yet it has some peak moments: Lila Downs' performances, most specifically the opening track, 'Benediction and Dream,' the sexy tango 'Alcoba Azul' and the theme that plays during the closing titles, 'Burn it blue' which she performs with Brazilian super-star, Caetano Veloso. Also the rendition of \\"La Llorona\\" by Chavela Vargas is outstanding. The tracks that are part of his score work are also outstanding, and reminded me a lot of the music from the album \\"Ronroco\\" by Argentinian composer and producer, Gustavo Santaolallas.

I find it difficult to skip songs while listening, although I am still (after many months) mesmerized by \\"Burn It Blue\\", sung by the incomparable Caetano Veloso (with Lila Downs). What makes this album magnificent for me is it's repetitive appeal, combined with it's ability to lead me to other places...next stop for me: the other film music of (the prodigious and brilliant) Elliot Goldenthal, and more Caetano Veloso!

A lot of the stuff is tuff and I don't see why I would need to figure out a very deep, deep idea that only a world champion can fiture out to make me do well on the tests in the book.

The problems also are generally easy, I'd say of the 137 tests maybe only 30 helped at all in developing my tactical skills. Not to mention the scoring on the test thing is way off... According to the book, the average master lives in awe of me, yet I am not even an expert! I doubt my play improved more than... 10 or 15 points from going through this book. The beginner of course will improve more but even then a book with more problems will be far more beneficial.

I am sure there is more for me to learn from it, but I think other books that have more puzzles would benefit me more."},{"rating":"1","title":"This guy is confused who wrote this book","review":"I may be just a kid but I can tell you the person who wrote this book does not have his act together. He should do a better job of first introducing an easy idea then building on it to make it harder. In other words what I am saying is that Mr. Serawan may be a great player but is not the best teacher of the game. I saw his video too and he is an uncomfortable teacher and gets mixed up in front of a camera. He does not do much better as a teacher who writes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing for a beginner or someone just beyond that point","review":"There are a few major problems with this book. The writter is probably used to teaching very advanced players being such a good player he does not always understand the way much less players think.I will explain now what I mean by this.There is too much jumping from some easy stuff good for your average player who is just beyond the beginning stage to some very, very deep and hard stuff to understand. The book does not maintain a consistant pattern for players of the same level. A two move simple tactical problem and then a 10 move deep problem that only a master could figure out. And the simple idea doesn't build to the more difficult one like it should.Many people do not understand that sometimes a good player does not make a good teacher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Winning Chess Tactics Do Not Alwyasy Win","review":"I have found about 6 major mistakes in this book that tactics don't win but lose!I used my top computer called Fritz and it pointed out in the first part of this book some big, big, boo boos in the book. Well check for yourself if you have the Fritz computer. Maybe he should have had the same computer program first before writting the book or at least use it because it teaches you to look before moving, not the book but the program. I must be honest. I gave up on the book when the first 20 or so problems had the computer point out that the solution was not the best!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strangely overrated","review":"I really don't understand the judgements of the other reviewers. To me this book is a very poor way to learn tactics. The basic themes are presented in a sketchy way, and there are nowhere near enough examples of them to allow the reader to really learn to recognize the patterns involved. Apparently Seirawan's approach works well for some, but I got nothing from this book compared to Reinfeld's simpler but more extensive book of combos. The same goes for Seirawan's writing style. I guess some people like it, but to me his exaggerated folksiness is like fingernails on a blackboard. Be warned that this book is not for everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Compare","review":"This book doesn't compare to the other book I have that cover tactis, HOW TO BEAT YOUR DAD AT CHESS (much better for covering checkmates), WINNING CHESS TOURNAMENTS FOR JUNIORS (better for the entir tactics/checkmates section and entire series all together) and 1001 WINNING CHESS SACRIFICES AND COMBINATIONS (fantastic chess workbook)."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"gimme your lunch money Matthews\\"","review":"i always knew pinsky could do it... camp Aunawanna, however you spell it, really helped him find his voice... and i guess Cory Matthew's lunch money (boy meets world) really helped him get started, paying for the instruments and studio time"},{"rating":"2","title":"good cd Execution of All Things Rilo Kiley","review":"The Good that won,t come out the best song,but overall a good cd would recommend to all my friends ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, unexpected find","review":"Sounds something like a folk, Irish-influenced version of Weezer (at least when the guitars kick in). But each song has a unique, catchy melody spanning the decibel range. The lyrics get more hackneyed as the album goes on (starting around song 10), but the earlier songs are great for their intelligent verbage. Not a lot of risks in the musical melodies, but a lot of different sounds to be had. The singer has a good voice, she should push it more. Nothing awful on this album, but a lot that's really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland, pretentious music; cynical, downer lyrics","review":"Apparently, this album has a cult following, and they all like to write reviews! I suppose it works as background music, but not much more. I realize art appreciation is highly subjective and, clearly, this music has made a strong impression on some. To me, though, the album comes off as pretentious. Then again, if you hear deep truths in it, more power to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"not only for indie lovers","review":"Here is a \\"indie\\" album that doesn't sound alternative at all! Excellent gift for rock lovers. A great suprise for anyone who gives it a chance.It has generous number of catchy melodies, great instrumental set (you will think it's a major label band!! no, maybe even better!), but that's not only thing that makes Rilo Kiley different from other indie bands. They have their own personality (thanks to great singer) and a different style than nowadays slow-paced indie bands. None of those silly pop songs. This band has a future!!!That's the type of album you will want to watch a concert, hear the other albuns (which are great, by the way) and you will spread the word about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"I don't think Rilo Kiley can get any better. This album starts off with the bluesy melancholy of Jenny's voice and then blows right through ever emotion you've ever felt, ending in total joy and sorrow that the album is over.honestly if you don't get this album you're stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"This is one of my favorite albums of the last 10 years. Immensely enjoyable music and lyrics. The best effort by Rilo Kiley to date. (I am writing this after \\"Under the Blacklight\\" was released.)Calm when it needs to be, but loud when it feels like rocking (most of the time), this album demonstrates the band's confidence in themselves. It builds to a crescendo of noise during the instrumental part of \\"My Slumbering Heart\\", with many highlights along the way, before quieting down for a couple of songs before blasting us with \\"Spectacular Views\\" at the end.Only one real clunker: \\"With Arms Outstretched\\". I know that a lot of people like this song, but to me it sounds too much like \\"I Just Called to Say I Love You\\" (when she sings \\"Some days they last longer than others...\\" Stevie, sing along!). Also, the split-up hidden track is a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacularly Executed! (4.5 Stars)","review":"This was my first exposure to Rilo Kiley, though I can't exactly remember how I heard about them - actually, I think this album was one Amazon.com recommended. Anyway, I listened to the samples, which sounded good, so on a whim I decided to follow through and get the album. If you're right now thinking, \\"Maybe this might be good, but I'm not sure, maybe I'll buy it\\": DO IT! This is a fantastic album, so good in fact I've since bought RK's first album and Jenny Lewis' Rabbit Fur Coat (and have loved both of those, too). My only complaint is that I'm not a big fan of the male vocalist for RK, but since he sings so few songs, it's not a big deal, nor are the songs he sings \\"bad\\" or \\"not good\\", not at all - regularly I'd probably like them, but it's only that in comparison, the other songs sung by Jenny Lewis are so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertisment","review":"The commericial for this doll shows her swimming in water. Now I wasn't crazy enough to believe that it could actually swim, but I did think the doll could be placed in water.

Also the dolls singing is annoying, you can't understand what she's saying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Barbie, but not a bath toy","review":"I agree with all the other reviews. The doll works great out of the water, but once she enters the water she is ruined forever. I purchased this for my 4 year old for Christmas, it was by far her favorite, she played with her all day, and at bathtime could not wait to bring her in there with her as the commercial showed her in water! Since that her voice is muffled and she only lights up once in awhile on her own. I payed $9 for replacement batteries thinking that may have been the case, but she still does not work. I looked over the insturctions, and nowhere does it specify if she can go in the water or not. Now this barbie is in a bin with all the other barbies, my daughter only plays with her at bath time now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty but Pretty Boring Too","review":"It's a lovely looking doll (except for her dark lipliner) but only has three phrases and is NOT water proof. Anything with holes in it, is not going to be waterproof. The marketing for this doll was very misleading - however for the price, it's better than having a Barbie that doen't say anything or light up. Little Mermaid fans are going to love it regardless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute doll","review":"Santa gave this to our 6 year old daughter this Christmas. She loves it! She's glittery and lights up in pretty colors. The doll's singing can be annoying after the billionth time but most toys are like that. For the price and enjoyment my daughter got from this, I am more than happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disney Princess Shimmering Lights Ariel Doll","review":"The doll is adorable - my 4 year old granddaughter loves her - it only took 24 hours to open the packaging (just kidding). It would be easier to get into Fort Knox! Ariel really does light up and she can take a little rough handling - I would recommend for pre-school age and kindergarten children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy - especially at this current price!!!","review":"This was one of my daughter's most anticipated Chrismtas Gifts - and also brought the most tears! While I agree that (when it works) it is quite beautiful and she was thrilled with the look, I experienced the same disappointments as previous posters. While it claims to be a water toy - following its first trip into the tub, it began to malfunction. Some posters say that the voice came back after it had time to dry out but ours was never the same again. The TERRIFYING screeching noise it made as it died mortified my 4-year old who cried more tears over the demise of this one toy than anything she had previously owned. I cannot understand its current listed price at $54.95! Even if it had worked as stated, it wouldn't have been worth half that price! Avoid this toy - even if you plan to not put it into the water, I think consumers should rally against it on principle - it doesn't do what it is marketed to and has the potential to mortify young children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful doll not great for water though","review":"We purchased this doll for our 3 yr old who is an Ariel fanatic. The doll is very pretty (although loud) and our daughter loves it, however, even though the directions say water toy we had the same problems that a previous poster had. The first couple of times the doll was wet she would sound muffled but once she dried out she was fine. She didn't recover after the third time and now when she sings it's a terrible screaching. My daughter said she sounds like Ursula when she's mad, and is scary. We finally had to remove the battery because if you made her light up and sing she would screach and wouldn't shut off on her own. I would recommend this doll for any Ariel fan but would strongly caution against getting it wet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Doll!","review":"After reading the reviews I purchased this doll for my daughter since she's become such a fan with the release of the video! Naturally, since she IS a mermaid, she wanted to put her in the bath with her but I told her Ariel would lose her voice and wouldn't be able to sing to her in bed at night so we should just sit her up near the tub! Really a beautiful doll, love the sparkly tail..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT put this doll in water!!!!","review":"I bought this BEAUTIFUL doll for my daughter's birthday in July '06. Since it says in the packaging that the doll is a water toy, we allowed our daughter to take Ariel to her swimming birthday party later that SAME day. Ariel sings a nice song - but it is difficult to understand some of the words and it is quite loud & annoying. The lights in her tail are gorgeous, though!! BUT!! Once the doll was submerged in water, her singing became very obviously affected by the water going into her 'speaker holes' & within an hour of the party - Ariel stopped working altogther! Neither my husband nor I believed this doll should ever be put in water because of the speaker holes & the battery area that is in her back that looks like it would also allow water inside....but we found it stated on the 'directions sheet' inside the box that this doll is a water toy - so we allowed it - and now this pretty doll does not do anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing toy!","review":"I bought this toy for my 3 year old daughter (who ADORES Ariel). It is a very beautiful doll. However, it is a bath toy that ceases to function once it is placed in the bath! Once she placed the doll in the tub a couple of times it's singing sounded strange and then finally quit singing altogether. Needless to say, my daughter was quite upset. Honestly, I am simply amazed that Disney ever allowed this toy on the market... Like I stated earlier, VERY disappinting purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Life is the Bubbles\\"","review":"I purchased ths item for my daughter's 5th birthday. She loves it.She takes it into the bath with her even though I was a bit apprehensive about it. As other reviewers stated, it is unclear as to whether it is a water toy or not. The packaging doesn't clearly say. Very odd. After numerous baths, Ariel still sings and talks. Her voice gets a bit quieter but after a while, it ggoes back to it's normal volume although I wouldn't mind if it stayed quiet.One important recommendation for anyone who purchases this item, when flying, do not take it in your carry on luggage! It is full of liquid. We did and luckily the security person that searched my daughter's backpack, let us take it with us."},{"rating":"1","title":"cute but don't put in water","review":"this is a cute toy for any little mermaid fan but it did not last long; It worked great for about a month and then I purchased new batteries which cost about $8.00 and shortly after it stopped working.

Sadly, the Harry Peat Remix of this amazing song lacks any energy. It rips the passion & urgency completely out & turns \\"What Happens Tomorrow\\" into a trancey, chilled-out lounge-fest. Boring.\\"Silent Icy River\\" is less than 3 minutes long and is only a fraction of a song. It's merely a piece of music built around the 3rd verse of \\"What Happens Tomorrow,\\" which was ultimately edited from the album version. Interesting & artsy- but a true B-side would have been nice.The video for \\"What Happens Tomorrow\\" is also included here. A young couple in love lay atop their car in an empty mall parking lot & look at the stars. The starry sky then turns into Duran Duran. The band looks great, but this is not exactly their brightest concept.I love Duran Duran, but someone needs to hook them up with better remixers & video directors.

It was funny to see when it picks the appropriate time to wake me up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not loud enough","review":"I don't rely on this watch alone to wake me up. Its alarm signal is not loud enough.The watch does provide one useful capability: it tells me how often I moved around during my sleep, and at what times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far too quiet to be useful","review":"While the device does seem to work as advertised, the alarm is far too quiet to be useful. The sound is timid even by watch standards - a barely audible chirpy beeping that isn't going to wake anyone. If you sleep with your hands under blankets, it just makes things worse. In two weeks of use, it has never managed to wake me.It's a brilliant idea for a product though, and seems to be well-made. Maybe if the watch worked in conjunction with a base station that had a proper alarm, it would be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aboslutely ridiculous.","review":"I don't know if the \\"theory\\" works or not, because the watch is total garbage. I have other complaints, but I'll just list the biggest. The $5 watch that costs $100 comes with a very soft beep for an alarm. You cannot make it louder in any way. So, the watch may or may not wake you up assuming it's right next to you, but once you put your wrist under a blanket, it's completely inaudible. In the summer, if you sleep without a blanket, it might wake you up. However, if you care at all when you wake up, set a real alarm also, because this one will probably not wake you up at all. I fully support their right to charge $100 for a $5 watch that includes some new inventive \\"technology,\\" but it would be nice if they made it to actually work. I have no other description of the implementation of this idea other than: ridiculous. I'm sure they'll fix this problem at some point, and I think they now have a $200 version that vibrates. Do not buy this watch until they fix this problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, but Effective","review":"When I first bought the Sleeptracker, I was bewildered by the device. I wondered what sort of alien technology they planned to use to wake me.Once I started using the Sleeptracker, I realized that the alarm is just triggered by a motion-sensor. I toss and turn most nights when I sleep. I quickly realized that when I rolled over in my \\"wake up window\\" the alarm went off.So, while not \\"space age technology,\\" the Sleeptracker is a pretty useful little device. I use it nightly. I usually just turn the alarm off when it beeps. But, when I DO get out of bed at the Sleeptracker's command, those are my most productive, efficient mornings.So, yeah, it works. And, I'd recommend it for anyone who REALLY likes to use their snooze button several times in the morning. But, you still need to muster the willpower to roll yourself out of bed when it beeps at you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, but a bit too large","review":"This really does seem to work! It is much easier to get up when you are already partially awake. However, the watch is too large for my tiny wrist, and it slides on my arm during the night. Sometimes, it then won't register my arm movements and the alarm will just go off during its normal time. There also may be some type of unconscious awareness of the watch being there, which might actually cause us not to sleep as deeply, I'm not really sure. If you have trouble waking up, this is certainly worth a try (although going to bed earlier helps too)! I just wish there was a way to trade in the watch for a smaller version."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment!","review":"I found the SleepTracker complicated to use and simply does not work as intended.

It turned up it leaked when I was swimming in the ocean.... I was not diving, just swimming. All inside is rusty now. So Chinese low quality junk. I feel like I threw money into the trashcan.

The visuals are amazing on an HDTV. I am about 30 mins into the movie and I have to say that the story, acting and animation is horrible.First the actors from the first do not lend their voices to this one.Some of the characters seem to be different than from the first movie. The acting is pretty stiff and cliche (the tough cyborg guy is annoying).Some of the fights are just stupid for stupids sake. I mean does Duenan and Briarious need to spin and do cartwheels while shooting? It doesn't even look cool, just stupid.Why did they go with CGI models 100% this time? Did the old animated cells not work anymore? It sure looked a LOT better.The events from the first movie don't even seem to play a part at all which is a shame.I loved the first movie but I wouldn't consider this deserving of the same name.

I wonder if the movie writers read the original stories at all!The Animation quality is not up to the standard of the first movie. The characters are not rendered is the same beautiful style of the first DVD. It is close, but it is different.One Star. There are alot of cool Mech models in this the 2nd Appleseed DVD movie.

This movie however was visually superior in every way, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The action scenes are great and the story was pretty engaging as well. I felt an emotional connection with the characters, and the english voice acting was also well done. Extremely well done 3D visuals, FX, and superb animation blended with motion capture made this movie one of the favorites of my entire collection.Personally I don't have any complaints except one scene where a part of the character Brearios's head clips through his body a little when he is laying in a hospital bed, it was the only serious visual flaw I noticed during the whole movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Some.","review":"After you watch this awsom movie you'll run out and try to find Appleseed. both are just remarkable."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing!","review":"State of the art!

Depends on the viewer.","review":"I like the film because the graphics were a better improvement than the first not that the first was bad in the first place. The story was a little more creative that the original because the first part was a little more slower paced in the begining (Not including the intro)and picked up more in the middle. While this one picked up more quicker in the begining keeps you in the suspense till the end. The voice acting i felt was a better improvement than the original as well.Is this movie worth buying? YesWill it be better than the original? YesGo get it and watch it you won't regret it. And for those who hated the first and writes that the sequel sucked. My reply is why did you see it in the first place if you hated the first? Leave the reviews to the ones who like the first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad For An Action Flick","review":"For an action release, this is very good. The action is intense and is driven by a plausible story, characters and animation. The plot holes and sometimes less than stellar writing will take audiences out of the element sometimes but overall there isn't a lot here to complain about. Despite how much I didn't care for the earlier release from this series, this release is surprisingly entertaining to watch.

Visually groundbreaking, and bigger and badder than ever.Now Ex Machina comes out and does it a step further, filling out gaps in the last film and giving viewers an even more visual stunning, 3-D groundbreaking special effects that is balls-to-the-walls sci-fi/action/adventure that will surely satiate those dying for these types of films.The problem is - they don't make enough of 'em!The latest Highlander animated film was another great one.Man, wating this on my 70-inch HD TV was truly remarkable. If you don't have that, then you need to rob a bank to get one.This is great film-making. Let us shope the animae Batman movie coming out this summer is this incredible and groundbreaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn inducing","review":"I felt the animation was very well done. What brought the movie down for me were the long moments of NO ACTION filled instead with long moments of boring dialouge. The whole \\"being posessed\\" idea has been done too many times before and seemed like an easy way out when it came to creating the plot for this movie. The main character says Riorios so many times they should have put a count at the bottom of the screen.PROS: Great animationCONS: Unengaging storylineLong moments without any action"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - save your money","review":"Truly disappointing in so many ways it's hard to know where to start.Dialogue - The worst aspect of this movie is the unbelievably horrible dialogue; so bad it will make you cringe.Story - As others have noted, you get the feeling there were multiple writers for the story and they kept getting fired and only using half of the previous writers work; a few almost interesting points are brought up in the movie and then abandoned before they can be explored. It should also be noted that the movie steals (without adding or improving) quite a lot from other movies, the matrix, the borg cube, etc.Animation - While it's admittedly a nice clean HD transfer, the actual CG animation used looks like it's from one of the straight-to-video Barbie movies; half the time the characters move in a very unnatural, stilted way.My recommendation: instead of purchasing this, just watch the previous Appleseed movie again, it wasn't that great either, but much better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Appleseed Excellence Continues","review":"The second installment of the Appleseed movies is another excellent effort in both art work and story development.

The complexity of the plots and characters is a testament to their attention to detail and has a tremendous influence in American films(The Matrix, Transformers, etc.). This film is an animated feature and not a cartoon which addresses the idea of man vs. machine and how they co-exist. Filled with cyborgs, hybrids and heavily armored vechicles this movie is very entertaining and never lets go of the throttle once the action starts."},{"rating":"2","title":"More action!","review":"I'm very happy I purchased Appleseed Ex Machina.

So i did enjoy it to the fullest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ex Machina gets a B+","review":"If you liked Appleseed you'll like this, but don't expect to see anything new. The eye-popping visuals are back with a finer palette of colors but the storyline is weak. It feels more like an episode than a movie.Personally I liked Vexille (2007) better. It will undoubtedly draw comparisons due to the fact that the writer/director, Fumihiko Sori, is the same man who produced Appleseed (2004). But I think you'll find the storyline to be a little fresher. Still, Ex Machina is worth buying. I suggest that you buy this product at a retail store. My pre-order on the collectable metal case edition arrived sealed with the discs and nothing else. No chapter booklet, nor did it have the special edition comic that came with a retail purchase.

The finale was a total matrix rip off. The action scenes were OK, it just wasn't as cutting edge as the first. I was also surprised to see the Blue-ray only had a dolby digital sound track. No new generation codec. If you like anime, you'll probably enjoy it, if you don't, I wouldn't suggest this as your first view.

Appleseed was much more better than EX Machina. Also, this movie didn't seem to be as dark and had more of a generic Hollywood feel to it.

The graphics are better on EX Machina, but who cares if the movie isn't fulfilling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for the beginner","review":"As the title suggests, the premise of the book (actually an extended essay) is to discuss the connections between Taoism and architecture. In his treatment of the material, he presupposes that the reader has a familiarity with both architecture and Taoism. Thus, a reader without a background in architecture or Taoism quickly becomes confused. Combined with the inherent difficulty in understanding Taoism, this makes the book very difficult to read. If the reader is truly interested in Taoism, I suggest buying The Tao of Physics or The Tao of Pooh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this!","review":"This table saw insert is cheap plastic.

The fights? Frazier/Worsham: Do you honestly care who wins this one? Next up, a massive BJJ fighter faces a \\"warrior training\\" practitioner, with predictable results. The Goodridge/Schultz fight was entertaining: big takedowns! Mark Hall faces a Sumo opponent: if you saw part 1 or 3 you can guess the outcome of that. Don Frye faces a BJJ man in the evening's best fight, although it is rather one sided. The superfight was a diaster: Shamrock should have broken the tacked-on rule and knocked that big goof out, but he decided to be \\"Mr. Sportsmanship\\" with disasterous results.

I've been hoping for a book that focuses on the home, and ways to not only bring magic in, but also tips and ideas for decorating in a more magical way. The first few chapters seem to do exactly that - with detailed descriptions of what a witch's home could be, basic blessings, tips on finding the center of your home, etc. I was really excited! Unfortunately, soon after, the author committed the cardinal sin of many Wiccan titles: trying to do too much. She seemed to lose her focus, and the book becomes a mishmash of different ideas - protection, elemental work, feng shui, color magic, herbal magic, etc. Because she tries to cram so much in, she manages only to skim the surface of any of these areas - which means she gives information that has been given 1000 times elsewhere. I'm not new to magick, so I don't need the \\"color magick 101\\" course.

In the final chapter of this book (\\"Begetting\\"), Dr. Weisman includes an archaic and rather offensive discussion of the inherent inferiority of adoption,...Dr. Weisman is... not sufficiently experienced about life to attempt a credible book on suffering. Her chronic illness is really not that burdensome, and her whininess with respect to her initial infertility quickly becomes tiresome."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling and deeply moving read","review":"Weisman is an extremely gifted writer, and I suspect a gifted healer as well. She has the rare ability to communicate personal and painful experiences in a way that is universally accessible. Reading her book, I felt at times that I couldn't put it down, that I got carried by the lyricism of her language. At other times I found that I could not read more than a section at a time, because the content of the stories she tells -- about her experiences both as a hurter and as a healer -- are so full of genuine struggle and sentiment that I became overwhelmed. Weisman tells of her own struggles and frustrations without self-pity; she tells of those of her patients' and loved ones' without self-aggrandizement.

The typical household would have to save 50% of its pre-tax income for 4.8 years to put a 20% down payment on that typical house.They warn that Denver, CO can be cold at night even in the summer but no similar warning is given about Boulder, CO.They warn that the summer is hot and humid in Saint Petersburg, FL but give no such warning about Wilton Manors, FL, Key West, FL or any other recommended city in FL."},{"rating":"2","title":"I choose Austin!","review":"This book went into pretty good detail of the listed cities.

Tons of characters constantly taking shape and the plot is both mysterious and sexy at the same time. So many characters to either like or dislike and the dialogue is fun and easy to get lost in. I am luckier than most people because I have had the pleasure of reading advance copies of the whole 4 bk. series and all I can say is each eposide is better than the one before. The final book in the series, \\"Le Fin\\" is my favorite and believe me it is well worth the wait it has an ending that will surprise everyone. Very entertaining! Now that The Lambert Series has ended I find myself excitedly waiting for this author's next novel, also a Murder Mystery, \\"Exposure Behind Closed Doors.\\" From the synopsis of it this book should prove as exciting as The Lambert Series, but unlike this writer's last four books, her newest novel stands on its own as a one book deal. I can hardly wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS ON-GOING SOAP OPERA!!!","review":"Forbidden by Victoria Taylor Murray is the second book in The Lambert Series. A series that I fell in love with after reading book one of the series, \\"THIEF of Hearts\\" -- A story taking center stage in Boston and slowly moving to an island paradise created for only the richest of people. The entire (4) book series is built around the one earth-shattering week in the life of the main character Nouri Sommers, a young woman that jumped into marriage with a wealthy man she knew little about. Now only a short time later, Nouri has suddenly realized that her mysterious husband is not the man she thought him to be. Needing answers to the ever-growing number of questions now surrounding her and her marriage, Nouri lets someone from her past back into her life to help her out.The compelling mystery that started in \\"THIEF OF HEARTS\\" draws the reader deeper into the turmoil of The Lambert Series with \\"FORBIDDEN.\\" In my opinion The Lambert Series is a MUST READ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book,","review":"I recently read both this book and Thief of Hearts and I have to say I enjoyed Forbidden even more although both books were intriguing.

As a bowler with over 40 years' experience, even I did not understand most of the jargon. The \\"technique\\" descriptions (grip, stance, target, etc.) did nothing to explain how to implement or execute the technique - and the accompanying images didn't help a single bit.

He then goes rambling on about all these different things that he just said you should never do and often leaves the basic concept he was addressing with a meager 4 sentences.

Which never concluded any information on the topic. Then instead of going over all the variations of an approach, he makes it quite clear that this should be the method for every bowler. In my opinion bowling involves individuals, and on mans view will not work for every bowler. It would be more helpful if he used his insight in bowling on how to work with the different variations that you can see in bowling."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to learn names of pro bowlers then buy this book","review":"More of a study guide to learn about pro-bowlers.

Aside from the incongruent terminology, blurry pictures (probably swiped from the web) and convoluted instructions, it instructs you to use the pincing kind of clippers rather than the shearing kind. The pincing clippers give you link joints that dont meet, creating mail that sometimes won't even stand up to costume wear. She also uses unusually thick wire for my tastes.

It was by far one of the most boring works of fiction I have ever read. There was no veiled art world gossip; in fact, I didn't feel that the portrayal of a museum environment was captured with any accuracy. The characters might as well have been cardboard cut-outs. It could have taken place in a local Target. I detested the main character, who is basically a dumpy housewife/scholar. The descriptions of her homelife and marriage were uninspired and uninteresting. Her house, her appearance, and her relationships seemed unkempt and boring.The only value I found in reading this was a few quotes from Rumi (and, yes, we get it- she likes Rumi)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading!","review":"I laughed, I cried....

Eight long and very very very very very slow untitled tracks relying not on melody, musicianship or lyrics but exclusively on \\"mood\\". Critics call it \\"post-rock\\" or something like that only because listening to progressive rock is not cool, so they just invent a new label for the indie crowd. (\\"Alright! This is NOT prog!

The album is composed of two sections. The first half is pretty accessible post rock, with some great tunes on Untitled 1-4. The second half is mostly ambience, not as listenable or accessible as the first half but still serving as a nice outro for the album. Particularly Untitled 7, and 11 minute long epic. This is often used by the band to close their live shows due to its build and intensity. Here, too, it serves as a nice closer, slowly drifting into Untitled 8 and ending the album. Better than any other Ros release besides Takk, and, depending on the day, their best. A worthwhile purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Amazing","review":"It really is that good. Get this album.

Personally, it brings to my mind the sight of fresh snowfall; others have described it as bringing to mind the stars, or the ocean. It may have a similar effect on you.Do this music justice.

It's interesting to hear NPR and Rolling Stone christen Sigur Ros under the rubric of \\"post-rock\\"when the music they make would've been considered simply \\"goth\\"not even less than 5 years ago.Dare I say,Sigur Ros's latest CD doesn't pack nearly as much instrumental punch as,say,Dead Can Dance,Piano Magic or Scorn. It's not bad as background music,I'll give it that much. Still, it's not nearly as engaging as the blatantly evident influences they acquire their sound from. If you simply MUST have this CD, I'd recommend NOT paying [money] and seeing about getting a used copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good (3.5 stars)","review":"Personally I like Sigur Ros' debut better. ( ) is a good album, but only the first \\"side\\". The first four tracks (unfortuatly the shortest) are very good... the perfect soundtrack to cold days with gray skies. The last four, however, border on post-rock/GYBE noodling which to me gets boring and flat. If only this had been an EP, I would have loved it.One techincal note I'd like to add... Sigur Ros clam that the lyrics are supposed to mean whatever you'd like them to mean (since there in a non-existant language), however I swear to you that every single track with lyrics sounds like the phrase \\"you sigh\\" is being repeated over and over again. My personal lyric sheet reads: Track 01- \\"you sigh/ you sigh/ ooooo/ you sigh\\", and etc for the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"(Where do they go from here?)","review":"The melodies and bowing and extraordinary, but sometimes the vocals get in the way. It can get on my nerves to hear the high pitched \\"you sigh on, you sigh alone\\" Hopelandic over and over. Track 8 is absolutely sublime until he cuts in and starts telling us again that we sigh on (sigh). Maybe that's why I dig track 3, an instrumental. I happened to play (the live version from Philly concert) while re-watching the opening scene of the film \\"We Were Soldiers\\" with the movie sound off and headphones on. The complement of the slow bittersweet crescendos and melodies made those first eight minutes stand on their head. I don't know what the original intent of the director was but listening to this tune with that scene made me cathartically sad about humanity. Sigur Ros' music is like fine shading and worked well in \\"Vanilla Sky\\".I think these guys should be writing more soundtracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Words cannot describe this beauty","review":"The music of Sigur Ros is gorgeous. This album is a spine-tingling journey with songs so lovely that titles would do no justice to their beauty. It is an album that is so powerful that while you're listening to it, it will transform everything you see into something completely beautiful. It is like nothing I've ever heard before, and they deserve huge amounts of praise for it. Some say that their music is sad and depressing, but everyone has times like these, and a perfect way to spend these times is by listening to this album. What therapy!!! The only problem with this album is that when it is over, you are launched back into the perils of reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius","review":"Well, what can I say? \\"()\\" is genius. If you liked Sigur Ros' second album \\"Agaetis Byrjun\\", then you could not possibly be disappointed with \\"()\\". The album is an epic 70 minute piece of music that can be the soundtrack to whatever mood you're in. The sheer depth of emotion it can bring is amazing. Purchase this and put it into your cd player. You will be mesmerized. You will smile. You may find tears in your eyes. You cannot help but be caught up in its beauty.This is an album I'll be still listening to in 20 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart Drenched...","review":"To even read a review of this album would put me to tears. No words could do justice to their magnificence in this album and their interpretation of their world and the people around them. It's abstract and put togther at the same time. Although, what they have done, is made this feeling global to anyone anywhere in the world. This will bring you closer to your feelings, yourself, the world, and your heart. This album, beginning with track 1, will stop your heart, flood it, and flood your thoughts."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Ethereal Enchantment","review":"Sigur Ros without a doubt are true pioneers in the musical frontier. Lay aside their bizarre performances and unorthodox use of instruments and what you will hear is an ensemble of euphoric \\"noises.\\"The voice, guitar, ambience and music in whole all blend in to form a phonic masterpiece. The creativity and beauty of this unique band can only be matched by Radiohead and a very few other off-the-wall musicians such as Bjork.After listening to () over and over again in a dimly lit room with a coffee mug in my hand, Sigur Ros have become one of my favourite bands ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different","review":"That's just one of the ways to describe this album. Ambient, ethereal, symphonic, moody and brilliant would be some of the others.The album is basically a 8-track 71-minute instrumental, with vocals used as an instrument, rather than for lyrics. (There are words in the tracks but it is hard to discern what the exact words are - probably something in Icelandic.). The music is most similar to Radiohead's \\"OK Computer\\" (surely one of the greatest albums ever, so no small plug) - progressive multi-instrumental symphonic rock, with a shimmering, enveloping every-note-is-valuable feel.Ideal for when you're feeling mellow, or just need something to let your spirit float upon."},{"rating":"1","title":"carpe diem","review":"I'm giving this album a low rating because of the nasty surpise I discovered on this disc. While the music is as excelent as always the disc I purchased has a special copy prevention feature that prevents it from bring played on a computer. If you intend to listen to this on a stereo system, then by all means buy it and enjoy. If however, you plan to listen to this on a computer (for whatever reason), save your money and don't buy it. It won't play at all on a MAC and the sound quality in Windows is at such a reduced level that it sounds worse than some 15 year old analog tapes I have."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried, I really did.","review":"I tried to get down to this, hoping the hype was deserved. But all of these nameless tracks do nothing for me. It also doesn't help that the album's lyrics consist of 4 syllables repeated. If you are going to make up the language, at least make it sound good. I guess if I want epic wordless \\"rock\\", I'll have to stick to GY!BE. Buy one of their albums to hear how its done, without gibberish and all this pretentious blank packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"nothing too fancy, just a nice listen","review":"People take Sigur Ros very seriously, maybe beacause of the whole \\"these songs don't really have names\\" thing and the \\"we made up our own language thing\\" but they don't seem to lofty or serious when you really think about it. This music is somewhat predictable even though it is often beautiful. The tempos are lumbering and the instrumentation is thick and somewhat unconventional. It is moody, or just very emotional, but not a terribly eventful or arresting listen. This band doesn't really need to give the songs names because they can barely be called songs; the two halves of the album kind of run together a little.The only thing to say here is this stuff isn't complicated, just elegantly presented and very nice to listen to as you are doing something else or if you are just in a very chilled mood. Basically either you like it or you don't, so just listen to the samples and you will probably have the idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"You Sigh....\\"?","review":"I reiterate Amazon's review of this album. Tracks 6 and 8 are instantly likable but some of the others might take some getting used to. This is certainly not an extension of Agaetis Byrjun, it is far less polished and lacking the full orchestra treatment. Throughout most of the tracks I keep hearing \\"you sigh\\" over and over and over again (if your going to partially invent your own language to sing with like these guys wouldn't you add a little variety?). Maybe I just don't \\"get\\" the motivation behind the repetition (some kind of artistic statement?) but I still appreciate the beauty of this remarkable music."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXQUISITE MOOD PIECE","review":"I fell in love with the subwoofer-trembling echoes of \\"Agaetis byrjun\\", but this complilation sounds introverted and contained, somber and complete; a marvel of music. Imagine a thick but tingling organ, Birgisson's near-whistling vocals, piano on one side, and wisps of synth on the other...most bands can only sound this graceful by whispering, or feigning delicacy. Sigur musters the effect with an iron fist, every detail aggressively beautiful. You need good speakers to listen to this music, not to mention a good non-pop appetite. Delectable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you, Sigur Ros","review":"Today was one of those days when I was grateful to be alive. The crisp sun, the forest, the Flon Morand with its little waterfall, my doggie, and Sigur Ros playing in my head. A sublimely beautiful moment.The music is ethereal and substantial, calming and uplifting. It is harmony-with-nature. It is ahimsaa.The fact that the vocals are not in any tongue I understand - language as pure sound - only enhaces the mystic pleasure one gets from that voice.It is no wonder that Thom Yorke has \\"noticed\\" Sigur Ros.So. Thank you. Thank you for helping to make a moment so beautifully sublime."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge step down for Sigur Ros: emotionless","review":"I thought their last two releases comprised some of the most beautiful, fresh, progressive, emotional music in the last few years. But this recording is a big step down. You know how much you love the Nothing Song, and appreciate the live versions you download through file sharing? Well, here the version lacks any of the pathos, any of the despairing urgency. Rather, all of the songs on this album homogenously blend together in a kind of self-loving soup. As we hear the same couple of words repeated over and over, the music never goes anywhere, and its one groove isn't particularly profound or heart-rending. Rather than moving and fresh --as their last two albums-- the listener is now left feeling the lead singer is some really pretentious guy singing in the shower. Self-love and complacency come across here, rather than the pensiveness and raw, quiet emotions that made them great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paying Tribute","review":"I write this review in honor of my recently deceased brother. This was his favorite album and it wasn't rare for him to listen to this in his car and with teary eyes say \\"It's just so beautiful...\\" and it is. I thank Sigur Ros for this album because the emotion that they captured is phenomenal. I shared some of the closest times with my brother while listening to this album and it's simply great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical Euphoria","review":"To be honest, i had never heard of Sigur Ros until i seen Vanilla Sky. I became obsessed with the last song they play at the end scenes of the film. I later found out it was (Njosnavelin) track 4 on the () album, so i ordered the album and listened to Njosnavelin over and over again thinking to myself \\"no way could the rest of the album be like this\\". I was wrong for all the right reasons. This album is genius, i've listened to it countless times, feeling inspired and uplifted like no other music i have listened to before. This is music for any hour of the day, every week of the year. If Sigur Ros produce another album as powerful as this one, it's mine no matter what other music critic's say about it. Do yourself a favour, BUY THIS ALBUM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their most accessible album yet","review":"Once you get past the gimmickry of its packaging, this latest outing by Sigur Ros is a gorgeous exponent of the kind of rock made famous by the Moody Blues and Pink Floyd. The incredible thing is that, without even being intelligible lyrically, it manages to make the experience an intellectual one. It's as if Edvard Munch's screaming man on the bridge found himself surrounded by ice floes and singing in Neil Young's tortured voice. The music shimmers and twists, building in majesty until its grand finale in track 8. The journey is its own reward. My favorite Sigur Ros cut will always be \\"vel til loftarasa\\" from Agaetis Bryjun, especially when played over the evocative video (viewable on their web site), but there are plenty such moments, my favorites being tracks 1 and 6, on the new album as well. If this is your first trip to the mysterious country of Sigur Ros, their latest CD, whatever it may be called, is a good place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rebellion On Words?","review":"Perhaps you've heard that this album in sung in the language of Hopelandic, a mixture of Icelandic, and the minds of the band Sigur Ros. It's my thought that this album is a rebellion on words, making it perhaps, one of the best concept albums in the history of music.Concepts supporting my theory:1) This album is sung a language no listener will understand2) The lyric book is nothing but blank pages3) The title () cannot be pronounced4) The only words on the entire cd case or cd itself are 'Sigur Ros'. All the others are stickers, littering the plastic wrapper of the cd.I believe they are trying to ease our culture's dependence on words, and send us more into emotions. Well, I'm not sure it worked, because you take much more time DESCRIBING the title, instead of just saying it, but it's a good jumping off point."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"I'm sorry to disagree with some of these 5 star reviews this is getting. Everytime I hear one of their songs, I worry about that friend of mine that cuts her wrists just to feel the pain. This sounds like something I would be afraid to play near an old folks home because the tennants would think it's time to go to the next life. If you're really into the low-key, lets just sit and veg out on mind numbing dark vibes, GO FOR IT. If not, skip it. Listen to your friends copy before you go jumping on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"need to be in the right mood for this CD","review":"I like this CD in small doses. But it can be very grating when the lead singer repeats nonsense words (they don't mean anything in Icelandic for those who don't know) over and over again, or when he moans. But the music is so idiosyncratic anyway that knocking it for the moaning is pointless perphaps. At its best, Sugur Ros is a 21st Century Cocteau twins with more discordance and less melody. I prefer Cocteau twins"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quaaludes finally arrive in Iceland","review":"Reading good reviews of this band led me to seek out some of their music. I've concluded this is one of those bands who owe their success to the tragically hip music fan who gravitates towards artists whose music is so pretentious and unfathomable that most people reject it, hence, their popularity. These are the people who think Pink Floyd sold out after Syd Barrett left. It reminds me of when I was forced to sit through a set of White Stripes at a festival show. Looking around at their supposed fans, most of what I saw was boredom. But I also got a sense that no one was willing to be the first to say \\"Jeez, these people really suck.\\" A modern version of \\"The Emperor's New Clothes.\\" The only suggestion I would make to Sigur Ros is, when recording vocals, it would be better to place the microphone in the same room as the singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste Of Talent","review":"I hate to say it but, although they are very talented and write some great music, especially instrumentally speaking, Sigur Ros ruin it all with smarmy, pretentious, overdramatic, and feminine sounding vocals. The music is hard to take seriously with that terrible crooning all over the place. At least it's all gibberish and you can't understand what he's saying. Either they should go instrumental or find a woman if they want feminine vocals. I still dig the distorted bowed guitar sounds. Listen to Mum instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music for mosquitos","review":"I became interested in Sigur Ros () after finding a YouTube video segment of a live performance of Track 7. I wish that I had not spent money on this album.The first few tracks really set the tone for the album. Music for mosquitos, with Asian influences. As is noted by other reviewers, the lead singer repeats a nonsense word/phrase over and over, throughout the album. The music is conventional and droning. The first tracks contain something that is very reminiscent of a mosquito buzzing my ear while I try to sleep. This has more in common with jazz than rock, more like what a rock band might do if they had to fill an hour jam session with atmospheric stuff.This isn't electronic, its too annoying to be ambient, and has too much conventional rock to be \\"post-rock.\\" I recommend Debussy's Jeaux, and Jean-Michel Jarre's Zoolook to this. (Right now I'm listening to Corsican Chant to get this out of my head.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Accept it for what it is.","review":"I can't imagine anyone calling this souless just because it may not be as dense as the last album with lots of bells and whistles. That's absurb, to pan something just because you thought the last one was the best thing ever, and you expect the same thing out of \\"( )\\". It's beautiful art that takes me somewhere.. I would like to see YOU try to make this music. So what if they're \\"reinventing the wheel\\" ? Are you going to tell them how to express themselves. It's their art. I know from seeing them live that to call this music souless would be a silly mistake, and I'm sure they would be offended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Icelandic tour guide","review":"It wasn't until I visited Iceland that I could understand that Sigur Rus translates the Icelandic landscapes into sounds.Their magical and low paced music is a guided tour through the Blue Lagoon, Gullfoss, and órsmörk. Each track makes you feel as if you were walking on the green moss, the ice, and the lava fields of Iceland.I recommend listening to their music while you drive across Iceland. And once you are back home, it will make you remember your Icelandic adventures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply put, this is incredible.","review":"Where do I start with Sigur Ros? They are one of the most original and though-provoking bands of the past decade, and this album shows why. () is a collecion of 8 beautiful and moving songs, like if Radiohead quit making pop songs and started to play with an orchestra. The lyrics are sung in a made-up language, which is both strange and familiar. Track 1 is the one that is the most famous on here, and it's a good opener. Dark piano and organ give way to a string quartet and a lot of vocals. After that, we go from slow funeral marches to uplifting soundscapes back down into depressing slowcore. It's an incredible album, and it's one that everyone should own. 5 stars for these strange folk from overseas."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the most beautiful things I've ever heard","review":"I have to admit, i probably would have never heard of these guys if it werent for the movie Vanilla Sky. It features song #4 in probably the most beautiful and stunning scene in recent cinema. That is why i got the cd. However, the entire cd is incrediblely melodic, relaxing, and soothing. THIS IS A MUST HAVE CD. also, watch the last scene in Vanilla Sky. That will convince you to buy the cd because of the amazing song."},{"rating":"2","title":"well dude","review":"in response to the review below me, you've just gotta let it take you where it takes you, not where it takes everyone else. personally for me this music is escape, and i just imagine sunny, warm days leaving the place of dread and moving on to more excitement and peace, if those could exist at the same time. its really peaceful to me. starting from depression it seems to go to a new day, where you can for once feel warmth and love, and everything you couldnt feel the day before, as you were trapped within yourself. a new beginning, thats what this album means to me. so anyways, try to see the 3-d picture if you want, dont like it if you want, no biggie. all you need is patience and a will to find what you're missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter trash","review":"Just what is this suppose to be, music to get annoyed by?

You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even Mediocre","review":"This album is not even mediocre- it's simply bad. After about three songs I just couldn't take it anymore. The high pitched distorted voices in the background have the same disturbing effect as a mosquito buzzing in your ear. The melodies are very plane and lack sophistication. It almost sounds like a child toying with a piano, repetitively playing the same four random keys. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"are you kidding me?","review":"If I could rate music on amazon with negative stars i would. I really think this music is a terrible and cruel joke. Save your integrity and your friends...stay clear of this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Untitled tracks??","review":"I'm a person who likes to take different tracks from different artist and put them onto one cd.When I bought Sigur Ros, I wanted to add just a few songs from the album, (), to my own personal compilation.I have a cd software that extracts tracks from the cd itself.When I did this with Sigur Ros's (), up came titles for all the eight songs.So if this is what shows up, then how can it be an album with untitled tracks?Here is what the tracks are titled :Track 1. Vaka, Track 2. Fyrsta, Track 3. Samskeyti,Track 4. Njosnavelin, Track 5. Alafoss. Track 6. E-BowTrack 7. Death Song, Track 8. Pop Song.I know that I'm not the only one in this world who sees these titles, so can anyone explain to me why everyone says the tracks are untilted?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mad Genius !","review":"I am not going to write a thesis on why one should listen and enjoy or listen and trash.The entire concept of this album is simple: Have listeners experience music and not experience the pre- fabricated fluff surrounding a CD.Yes there is little packaging provided by the Label's promotional department to increase sales and that is the beauty of this project.This CD is bound to be a rude musical awakening and for any member of a generation raised on the musical hype of Britney, N'SYNC etc...I compare this CD to the classic 70s musical revolution that has since become referred by many as a masterpiece \\"Mike Oldfield TUBULAR BELLS\\".You can only truly form an opinion if you venture to take the trip !"},{"rating":"2","title":"charming , pure , and finally back!!!","review":"And finally They have returned...!! Sigur Ros is back with an astonishing cd from beginning to end, resuming their charming ways for everyone's delight!

I was also offended by the \\"anti-traditional religion\\" remarks.

They say that 95% of people are co-dependent - that is impossible. They make you feel that doing good for others is a NEGATIVE thing and that no one should need anyone else. What's wrong with being kind to another person even if it means you have to give a little of yourself up? This book is a serious relationship ruiner - if you want to get help and you DON'T want to be told to just \\"leave your relationship\\", then DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!

I'd actually give this about a 3.5, but if push comes to shove, we'll go higher than lower. He truly gets into the spirit of things, and The Ranger is my favorite of Cotton's characers.

The design, while easy to put together, is NOT a good one. Tubes slide into other tubes, but there is no locking mechanism to keep them from turning. This means that they are able to rotate at any moment, and dump the person in the hammock on the ground. Came out to the backyard yesterday to find the whole thing in a jumble on the ground after a light wind.ALSO-there are TWO hooks on either end to hang the hammock (did NOT notice this in the picture) this means that there is virtually no \\"swing\\" to the hammock, making it basically just a lounge.I am going now to see how much of a pain it is to ship it back, even tho it is obviously NOT the retailers fault it is such a poorly designed product.

It's filled with a 2 inch thick foam core surrounded by a very light cotton filler (YES-I disassembled it). This bolster claims to be 6 inches thick. I'm 170 lbs and it flattens to about half that when I sit or lay on it. The bolsters I used in class are probably filled with all cotton rags -no foam and that's what I expected from Hugger Mugger.

It's Andy guest hosting a variety type show. Most of his comic performances are covered. Foreign man, Elvis, Tony Clifton, Latka on Taxi, Andy playing Bongo drums, Andy busing tables, and an hilarious ventriliquist act with Howdy Doody and Little Red Riding Hood. There are interview segments intertwined with the skits and two musical guests Freddy Cannon and Slim Whitman (watch Andy as Slim sings, er lip syncs his song). It's well worth the price for a peek into the highly crazy and complicated world of Andy Kaufman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye opening for new fans","review":"I became a fan of Andy Kaufman when I saw Man on the Moon. I had seen him only on Taxi, and I really didn't know much about him at all. I saw MOTM the first day it came out, having heard about Andy. I'm only 15 years old, you can't blame me for not knowing much about him. In any case, it was a great show! I really was surprised that Carrey seemed somehow rougher and stranger in ways than Kaufman himself. To me, Kaufman was a genious, but at the same time was still the little boy who played his shows to the wall. The video was a nice display of his talents, it had Latka(or the foreign man), Elvis, Howdy Doody, and plenty of bongos. The only complaint I could possibly make was that there was more of Slim and that other guy than there was Andy. Oh, almost forgot that I loved Tony Clifton! He is so funny! Sorry if I didn't help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Andy's finest performance","review":"This is definitely the most entertaining Andy Kaufman DVD available, it contains all of his best routines performed to perfection.The Midnight Special definitely captured Andy in his prime and it's amazing that he was able to cram so much into one show.Here's what you get:-Foreign Man-Elvis-Tony Clifton(His finest hour!)-Andy working at Jerry's Deli-Andy wrestling \\"the ladies\\"-Weird gibberish puppet routine-Interviewing Slim Whitman and Freddy Cannon-Andy with his entourage (Bob Zmuda, Bob Shapiro, etc.)Basically, if you loved \\"Man on the Moon\\", you'll get to see some of the same material performed by Andy himself.Buy and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Familial Division Of Opinion","review":"My husband Jim and I watched this together and we had very different reactions. Jim thought that actor Jim Carrey did a better job of playing Andy Kaufmann in the \\"Man In The Moon\\" movie than the real Andy K did doing his act. While Jim's busy rejecting the real thing, I am convulsed with laughter watching the tape, holding my sides! Perhaps one clip shows our division better than any other. There's Jim seriously watching Andy K talking to the interviewer about keeping his humility by working as a busboy, while being a big tv star, and there's me, absolutely incredulous that Jim can't see that Andy K is putting him/us on! Andy never breaks character and always comes across as wholly sincere and white, middle class while making the most outrageous claims. I'd give it a 5. I think Jim would give it a 2 but, since I'm filling this out, it gets a 4! Ok, maybe you do need an odd sense of humor to enjoy him but he was a hit in his day, wasn't he?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Horsepuckey","review":"This work is very short on fairness and long on sensationalism. Few historians doubt that Reno was inebriated (as the previous reviewer accruately states, is never mentioned in the film), and he lost his confidence when splattered with the brains of Bloody Knife. But Reno was not alone - Benteen (while not a friend of Custer's) had a long and honorable record of bravery. He would not have left Custer and his men to die if he could help. This film tries (unsuccessfully) to hide the poor tactical decisions of Custer. The most obvious being spliting his command in three before knowing the strength of the enemy. By the time he does know, it's too late. I'm surprised that such a dubious theory was put forth by the National Geographic Society."},{"rating":"2","title":"put your lips together and whistle for this one","review":"Being new to Victoria Alexander's work, I found this book to be heartwarming and funny.

A proponent of white, male hegemony?The problem with this book and the whole gamut of \\"multicultural\\" (it should be called what it is: leftist and politicized and dishonest) pedagogy is its presumption that curriculum in the United States is racist and that it must be reformed if racism is to end.

I was not at all disappointed, and this was truly worth my time. The world of zombies is given a fresh and creative spin with this zany story where everyone eventually becomes a zombie unless precautions are taken. The 50's-esque fashions and attitudes are also amusing.Having zombies as pets reminds me of Shaun of the Dead (If you've seen both films, you know exactly what I am talking about) This movie actually has some rather endearing parts, with Fido getting to know his new owners/family better while there are problems, just like in real life (like Mom's unhappiness, for example, or the old perv with the pretty young zombie) Overall, this is a FUN movie, and really isn't much of a horror movie, despite what the cover might depict. Check it out, you won;t be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost there","review":"\\"Fido\\" drags on a bit, to an end that isn't so bad. The use of pastels and overall color saturation, which is by now a long-worn device to indicate the 1950s, I could have done without. \\"Pleasantville,\\" as example, depicted the '50s with less hyperbole and to greater effect, its b&w-into-color; template notwithstanding. This 90-minute movie might have clicked better as a 60-minute episode on a cable network.Still, there are interesting facets, not the least being seminal moments of individualism, feminism and diversity from the POV of way back when. The characters are well delineated and well acted, especially by Billy Connolly,of course, who conveys his character with only grunts and groans and YAHHHS!While watching \\"Fido\\" I was reminded of \\"CSA - The Confederate States of America.\\" If you haven't seen CSA, you should."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This movie is by no means scary, but it is definitely entertaining.

So I was like sweet I am going to watch it. This was one of the funniest zombie movies I have ever seen. Very unique in it's story and it is shot like \\"Leave it To Beaver\\" episode which just adds to the comedy.I have since gone out and purchased it. Most B-Movie zombie flicks are just tolerable at best. This movie is actually really good and actually makes me want to see more of this alternate universe. I do not understand anyone who would bash this movie....all I can think of is that they were upset at the new \\"Day of The Dead\\" movie which is horrible.

A \\"Pleasantville (New Line Platinum Series)\\"-like town (it that 1950s demented kinda way) but with collared-controled zombies. Zombies are used for labor and as servants. The Robinsons get a zombie and he is named Fido by Timmy, their son. All hell breaks loose when the collar stops working.The film is very funny describing an post-zombie war era. Children's \\"outside activities\\" in school are target shooting, 12 year olds are allowed to carry guns and zombies are everywhere. They are the help!Fido is actually a pretty nice zombie and very soon the entire family (minus the dad) grow to love him. The acting, makeup, story and just about everything is great in this film.Carrie Ann Moss is great at flirting with the zombie, Billy Connolly at playing Fido, the zombie.

You will find much more campy humor than blood and guts in this one, and for the intention of this film, I think that's okay.

I was mesmerized watching her; dazzled and calmed all at the same time, watching her nonchalantly let lyrics float from her mouth, easy as 1,2,3. You have to remember that most clips come from later in her career; they didn't have MTV in the 1930s! Billie's rendition of Fine and Mellow on this DVD is worth the purchase price all by itself.

Google this product and you will see this is a quite common bug.Mattel is aware of this problem but will not stand behind this product since it is a joint venture with Organon."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun toy","review":"I bought this for my daughter last year for xmas, she had just turned 5 at the time. She really likes it and felt she had her own computer. The games are fun learning tools to help with letters and small words. The only thing I do not like is it has no volume control, so if she brings this in the car, it gets a little annoying on a trip of any length. In addition, you cannot use headphones either. Overall, I would recommend this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"No volume --- only one setting --- LOUD.","review":"Although there are a lot of great things about this item, I couldn't get past the fact that we couldn't adjust the volume and it comes with a volume setting we found to be too loud. Bummer --- a volume control could have made it a real winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE get me some earplugs!","review":"First of all, this item is very loud and has no volume control and no headphone jack, so you have no choice but to listen to it at a ridiculous volume.Secondly, the recommendation or 3-9 years is absurd. My daughter is 5 and has mastered most of the tasks on this \\"computer\\" in no time at all. For the price, I would expect a toy to keep a child's attention for longer than a few days!In short, don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too simple","review":"I ordered this product for my 5 year old daughter for Christmas, considering the recommended age group of 3-9 years (by toys r us) (it's 3-12 years by the manufacturer) This product is way too simple for a 5 year old, probably more suitable for a 3 year old. It focuses on teaching letters and numbers, something most 4-5 year olds already know, and certainly most 9-12 year olds. Get it for your 3 year old, but expect them to master it quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"An on-target slice of life","review":"Clowes gives a very effective characterization of his main characters, and even the minor ones come to life. Again and again I kept feeling a sense of recognition in his narrative- his characters did and said things similar to what I or people I knew did when we were teenagers. Insightful and impressive- I would highly recommend it, especially to anyone who hasn't realized how good some recent graphic novels can be; it ranks with the best novels and stories I've read lately."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is the suburbs","review":"Ghostworld definitely captures the clean, clinical anomie of suburban life. I didn't like it at first, but by the end I have to admit I found it rather touching in an understated kind of way. It captures the longing, the stasis and the frustration of this environment very well, reminds me an awful lot of so many people I knew growing up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghost World","review":"I love this book because it's so subtle- and initially appears so slight, yet read once ( which can be done very quickly) I came to realise how much I knew about these two girls; That a solid picture had been created out of many subtle moments.The character are to fall in love with and relate with. Single frames are so \\"true\\" so poignant to my life. Anyone who has grew up with comics this is the ultimate love letter to your hobby somthing to cherish as taking a medium that is simple- aimed at short attention spans and being returned with somthing sublime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"Vapid teenagers who achieve neither redemption or tragedy by the end of an overwrought tour through their shallow existences. Excellent artwork of very plausible characters, but little pleasure gained from knowing them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two bimbos","review":"Two inspid American imbeciles discuss other people's looks, what does and doesn't suck, and deliberate for whom they should spread their legs. No plot, no payoff, no point. Pretentious claptrap for self-enlightened indie clowns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't like the movie...","review":"I didn't like the Ghost world movie, but the graphic novel was a lot better. There were a couple of times I got confused with people (heh, maybe it's just me) but it was funny and there were moments when I could relate to the characters and the artwork was cool what with the blue and all and so overall I would recommend it to anyone who is as addicted to graphic novels as I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like SIP better","review":"I picked this up at the library after watching the movie a couple of years ago. I remember liking it OK, so I decided to check this out. It is OK, but zI find enid and Rachel so mean that I can't identify with them: they seem to see the worst in everyone and spend their entire time hurting others. I had a hard time sypathizing with them. I also had a hard time getting into the drawing style; it seemed too.. distant, i suppose. I much prefer Strangers in Paradise, which has something of the same premise (the friendship between to young women), but I identify with Francine and KAtcxhoo more than Enid and Rachel. I would recognize why others might lkike this though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely overrated","review":"I am usually not so hard when reviewing, but I truly disliked this one. While the artwork is good, the storytelling is not and the literary sophistication, so highly praised among other reviewers, is at best ok. But I am not going to analize it so throughly because it doesn't even deseve it. It's the typical portrayal of the emptiness of adolescence and the reluctance of the two characters to enter an equally empty and depraved adult world.I just found it without any substance whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"I disliked it enough that I felt that I needed to leave a review","review":"Both of the main characters in this book are (purposefully, I think) annoying to read. They display so much ignorance and stupidity that I figured the story must be a coming of age story or something. It's not. They are just as bad all the way to the end. I understand that they are unreliable narrators. That, combined with the fact that they don't really change, makes this book a frustrating experience. This is a book about kids who do and say a bunch of ignorant and selfish things and act like self centered jerks. They do this for the entire book. That's it. That's the whole thing. That's why I disliked it so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"i really dont see a point","review":"i really dont see the point in this reading this nonsense.

Every panel is either hilarious or disturbing or both. Clowes even parodies himself, giving main character Enid (played by Thora Birch in the entertaining Terry Zwigoff film from 2001) a crush on the cartoonist -- then revealing her disgust when she actually sees him in person. The relationship between Enid and her cuter but more insecure best friend Becky feels so true, so real and ultimately so damn heartbreaking. Clowes throws in these moments that would smack of sentimentality in anyone else's hands, but instead play as genuinely moving when surrounded by so much oddity and nihilistic banter. A fun, creepy, silly, hilarious, moving graphic novel. This book is a subversive little gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"The fact that Black Lab are doing this on their own, without the \\"assistance\\" of a record label just goes to show you how badly these labels have missed the boat. Durham and Ellis have created a brilliant album here. Highlights are \\"Mine Again\\" and \\"Weightless\\" (for me anyway) but the album is great all through. I am so grateful I stumbled on Black Lab way back in 1997. I have all their albums and look forward to the day they are out touring again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible...","review":"I can't believe all these positive reviews! Blah...This turkey is pretty awful with Edgar doing his best to sound like a cross between a Las Vegas lounge singer and Stevie Wonder. He sings normally one minute, wails hysterically the next. Gawd...It's not even good lounge singing or Vegas music let alone, rock. One of the most inauspicious debuts of all time.Deserves a minus 5 if I could give one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty awful","review":"... It has to be Edgar's worst and I think the Stevie Wonder comparison he (or she) made below is pretty accurate. I was wondering who Edgar was trying to sound like and now I know, so if I want something that sounds like Stevie Wonder, than I'll get the real Stevie Wonder, not some lame-duck imitation of him.Check out \\"They Only Come Out at Night\\" or \\"Shock Treatment\\" which have the likes of Ronnie Montrose and Rick Derringer on them. At least you get some smokin' tracks on them and not a bunch of fake soul music. Even \\"White Trash\\" has a couple of decent grooves on it although I prefer the Stax Rhythm Section or the JB Horns over that one.So for those of you out there who think this is a brilliant soulful album, I would suggest you go for the selections I mentioned up above. Or try Neil Diamond or Englebert Humperdinck. At least they don't pretend to be something else.

Normally I prefer my course texts on introductory material to be very explanatory, and hopefully clear. This book is neither. Rather than spell things out in simple terms, the author makes it quite a chore to follow through on both his logic and equation progressions.I imagine that if you already knew everything, and just needed a nice fat book on Electrical Engineering for reference, this one would do nicely. It however makes for a very frustrating intro."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of mistakes","review":"Don't buy it unless the profs threaten you to.

And i smelled the inside of the wrapper that wraps around the outside of the box and it smells like baby powder. I never ever smell like baby powder. I am so angry.

They did give me free shipping...again woopy-do, $5. I'm beginning to wonder if we are doing too much for our customers when we discount for just about anything they are not 100% satisfied with.In case your wondering, yes I ordered another bottle at full price..(it's that good!!) but next time someone else is going to get my business"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not recommend this","review":"This is the worst scent I have ever tried from Dior.

I made the mistake of buying this CD at the behest of a friend after hearing only samples of the music, and it was a huge disappointment. I thought it wasn't \\"going\\" anywhere because the samples online WERE only samples; instead, I find out that what's online is just about all there is, and that the album as a whole is no more cohesive than those samples. It moves me not at all; I wish it DID, but there's no emotion there.

The beat to this version is great, but it is only 3 & a half minutes long & features only a few background vocals at the beginning. I guess there will never be a full-out vocal club mix available on CD. The closest thing I know of is the Jason Nevins Mix on the \\"Queer Eye\\" soundtrack.Bottom line: Someone needs to take lessons from bands like Erasure, who still put out singles with multiple remixes & non-album songs that are well worth the money. 13 bucks is just too much for an album version that I already have & a short, vocal-less club mix.

My favorite song is track 11. \\"face up, face down\\" was wonderfully done, I think that having Darren Dunstan (the american voice actor for Maximillion Pegasus) do the vocals added a nice touch, and helped connect the songs with the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd is extremely great!","review":"Since I wasn't that much into Yu-gi-oh when I got this, I thought it would be bad with all instrumental songs, but I was wrong!!!

Stillman forces you to look at all myths differently. I realized my conception of Myth was wrong, and I was using the wrong definition for myth. I read the Aeneid shortly after reding Stillman and it made a lot more sense than t had wehn I read it a few years before. Stillman should be read before reading any classical myth because it helps you understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for the intermediate player / coach","review":"I feel I had a good handle on mechanics and teaching how to throw, hit and pitch.

POT, the music enhances the movie's drama without being overbearing. However, on it's own, if you've seen the movie first, or went through the rooting for Barbra to finally find love in real life (POT was produced before she met James Brolin), the music, while including a couple passionate pieces, is too depressing to stand out as a best.

However it is on the upper end of the price scale. When the car seat arrived, it was a perfect fit for my daughter who was a preemie.. she came home at 4 lbs and 6 oz. I really liked this car seat because my daughters head did not flop around like in other car seats and she seemed to be quite snug in it. The red buttons to raise or lower the handle bar are a bit tough to press, and sometimes the car seat doesnt want to cooperate coming out of the base. But I guess thats the price you pay for safety.

The seat is so deep it's hard to take the baby in and out (and since I have to do this and leave the seat in the car due to its weight, the baby always wakes up).The fabric is very hot, and the straps are very awkward. I never want to leave the house. The seat sticks in the base and the straps are hard to loosen.I would not buy this car seat again. It's a hassle. The stroller that works with it (forerunner) is just as bad, and I cannot usually fold it. It's simply too hard to do. Despite high safety ratings, if a seat is so bad the parents never want to take the baby anywhere, what's the point? Maybe the reason it's so safe is because using it encourages the parents and baby to never even get in a car and risk an accident."},{"rating":"1","title":"DID NOT PASS CRASH TESTING!!!","review":"Make sure you do your homework before buying this.

At least the cd is, i dont know about live shows, thats how i tend to rate bands but this cd could have been alot better. The production is horrible they try to do too difficult of unision rhythms and they can't pull them off. Sometimes the drummer sounds like he just randomly drops his stick on the snare.

This book could only possibly be of interest though to someone who already believes what Findlay does - but it's hard to read 'On The Edge of the Etheric' and not believe it. It can thus only be recommended to someone who has read a few of Findlay's classics, or at least similar literature - otherwise it may seem unbelievable. 240 pages.(More recent but equally convincing books on Spiritualism are 'At The Hour Of Death', 'The Supreme Adventure' and 'The Scole Report'.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Valuable!!","review":"Excellent!

Although slightly slower than the majority of recordings out there, these two exhibit a mastery over the song where they can play off of each other rather to, eliminating the frequent jolts that plague most other recordings. This recording alone more than makes up for the price of the album.The only criticism I have would be the recording volume. The mastering puts the volume a little on the low end, though I suppose I may just upgrade my sound system for this album alone. It would be worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captures the amazing journeys of two young men!","review":"I recently viewed this film on PBS.

I have played it regullarly for the past decade. I picked this offering up because I Saw that Richie Furay was with them again. I am sooo Glad I did. Every song is done to perfection. The Richie Furay numbers are great (I've liked his voice ever since the days of Buffalo Springfield), yet it's the surprises from the other talented members of the band that take this CD to the next level. Their version of JJ Cales Magnolia is fantastic! Spellbound, and Indian Summer are great. My personal favorite has to be Rose of Cimarron. It's just a great rendition. The playing and unpretentious presentation is flat out enjoyable. The buyer gets both the DVD and the CD of the show. This is one of the best buys of great music I have gotten in the past year. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigh....We all get old.","review":"I bought this CD/DVD collection based on some good reviews I saw here and elsewhere, having been a huge Poco fan back in the '70s and early '80s. I have no problem with a bald Rusty Young and a fat Paul Cotton...what I have a problem with is the acute lack of energy in the performance. The recent release by Poco of their \\"Indian Summer\\" tour DVD shows the sharp contrast of a band at its musical peak and one that is marking time until the end. The only moments of life come when Richie Furay comes out to play some dated but fun material (i.e. \\"Let's Dance\\") The rest of the disc is dominated by slow ballad type numbers that miss what a Poco concert was all about. It's fun and nostalgic to see the guys out there playing, but buy the '70s concert disc. There is no comparison in the quality of the performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well received","review":"Purchased for my father, who greatly enjoyed it.

A couple of tracks are OK, but the majority are very cheesy and sound like they hired someone off the street to sing them.

So it seems that this is from the same sessions as yeilded the \\"Stripped\\" live album (the other 3 tracks on that CD single are all from the \\"Stripped\\" live dates).

I recommend buying the remixes of the title track, but leave the rest for your friends to buy, so if tempted you can listen to theirs.

If you like other Eurodance groups such as Ace of Base (The Sign era), Milk Inc., DJ Encore f/Engelina, and Sylver among others- you will love this album. Some of the best tracks are \\"Follow You\\", \\"Searching\\", \\"Pray\\", \\"Something\\" and \\"Feelings\\". Another great track is \\"Cry\\" which is sung by David (he also sings \\"I Dont Belong 2 U\\" on the album). Overall a great CD, perfect to just put on and groove to.

Because of the crazy price we paid for them, we take good care of them and bring them in every winter. The hose system they provide is worthless and has to be replaced with something more durable. And the screen top they provide gives out after awhile and there is no easy way to replace it. They use \\"plastic rivets\\" (for lack of a better way to describe it) and so we will have to come up with a way to replace and re-rivet it. When I bought these, they were $119.

Then the hose spout broke off with a simple tug of the hose. Now there's just a flat open hole in the side where the hose should connect.During its short life, the hose repeatedly fell off the spout despite all efforts to tighten the cheap radiator hose style screw clamp. Hose falling off means dumping out all the stored water. Not a pleasant experience.The flimsy overflow hose died of sun exposure a few years ago despite the fact that the barrel is mostly shaded throughout the day.What a ripoff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Hose Design","review":"The hose / barrel interface is so poorly designed it WILL leak and what good is a water barrel that won't hold water? The indentation where the hose is attached makes it impossible to get a screw driver on a clamp to try a fix it without taking the water out and turning the barrel upside down. The hose they give you is so ridged that using it has the effect of ripping it off the little, short pipe. I'm going to have to fix this.My fisrt attempt will create a new hose system on the existing exit pipe using a short, extremely flexible piece of hose to attach to the barrel that will not streess the connection when it used.If that doesn't work I'll try revising their little interface connection or plugging it and making a new one.Don't buy this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have had four for 3+ years, like them","review":"I came to amazon looking for a replacement screen for one of my barrels.

This book was horrible. This group of 3 authors did not do a good job. The ideas and points did not run smoothly together from one point to another. It seems like the 3 authors did not work very close together to make sure their ideas connected and related directly with each other's ideas. It was as if the authors went from talking about point A, skipping all the way to point F, then going to point C, then back to point F, etc. etc. Their ideas did not flow in an understandable sequence.

Maurice Kildare, was perhaps the most prolific writer for western history magazines from the 1950s through the 1970s. Unfortunately, his legacy is tainted. The articles he wrote, though based in fact, are heavily fictionalized. He published a great deal of folklore and fabrications and passed them off as facts. He wrote many memoirs of his childhood, but they conflicted with each other. At different times he claimed to have grown up simultaneously in Oklahoma and Arizona. When called on this by a complaining reader to Real West magazine, he claimed to have grown up in both places. This memoir, and anything else he wrote, should not be relied on as history. Gladwell Richardson was a story teller, not a historian, and his articles should never have been published in magazines like True West and Real West, because much of what he wrote was neither true nor real.

As a mother of six I like what she did with Meagan Hampshire and how those changes can make you feel both emotionally and mentally. And Nicholai, can I just say yum!

This same, heretical attitude I take to the Led Zeppelin cover of \\"Ramble On,\\" being that the String Cheese Incident can perhaps in its own way match up and even surpass the original wizards. Those are the definite strong points about the album. However, one of the issues I have with this album is that for the most part it sounds a whole lot like every other jam band - in other words, they're not doing much of anything too original in their class.

Mung, one of the first Japanese to encounter the western world, has been recalled to public life at the age of sixty-seven. He may be old but his reputation is formidable. As leader of the Black Dragon society, the secret eyes and ears of the Meiji Emperor, he is a man to be revered - and attacked. The clouds of war are looming over the Far East. Mung's name as a peacemaker makes him and his family targets of intrigue as Japan's military elite thirst once again for the bloody honour of combat. The first victim of the evil Shibata's cunning is Mung's adoptive grandson, Hiroki. With Japan flexing her military muscle toward Korea and China, and then, dangerously against the might of Russia, these are turbulent times for Mung. Times that call upon his reserves of inner strength and strategic skills to ensure victory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Compilation!","review":"Listening to the EasyDisc line of blues CD's reminds me of days long gone where you would put a stack of 45's on your turntable and listen to singles all day long.

The disc features Carey Bell, Sugar Ray, Rod Piazza, James Harman and lesser knowns Carlie Sayles and Randy McAllister. It's true, no Sonny Boy Williamson, Mojo Buford, Little Walter or Mark Hummel, but an enjoyable mix nonetheless. I am not real big on compilations but I must say the CD's in this series are the exception to the compilation rule.

I was a little concerned about how it would take being in a moist environment every day, but it is doing well and not showing any signs of rusting or marking from the water.It was very easy to install. The brackets are easy to line up and the rod comes with anchors that are easy to install after drilling common sized holes. I hit a stud on two of the holes on one side, so be sure to use a very small drill bit first to see if you have a stud present before drilling the large size hole to accept the anchor. The decorative ends snap right on to the base plates.I have a standard size tub/shower (standard being what a typical contractor would install in typical home) so the rod fit exactly without needing to be cut. If you think you have an \\"oversize\\" shower, you may find this rod to be too short. Any smaller than \\"standard\\" and you simply cut it down to size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rod is great but price is absurd","review":"These go for $50 at big box bath stores. If you use one of the the twenty 20% coupons they send a year to get it for $40, that puts this one essentially at double the price. Amazon products are almost always the cheapest around; they should not allow their reputation to be tarnished by this nonsense. Go to Moen's website; even they put the MSRP at $10 less than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This was a horrible purchase. The only part rx was the 5 foot rod. Neither of the ends or connections were included in the box. It's absolutely unusable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This shower rod is very good. It fit my shower perfectly, had the appropriate mounting hardware, installed pretty easily, and looks great.My only issue was that installing the round end pieces that cover up the mounting brackets was not as straightforward and resulting in my rotating it excessively as I tried to get it to lock into place, and the sharp edge of the cover cutting a circle in the paint like a cookie cutter. This is mostly hidden by the cover, but it does show slightly on the bottom side.Nevertheless, this was likely my fault for not understanding how it clicked into place and being too forceful with it.Overall a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moen Rod that rusted.","review":"It was a beautiful rod AT FIRST. After about 3 months rust began to appear and now it's just another cheap looking bathroom fixture that needs to be replaced.

I shopped Lowes, Home Depot, Walmart, and Overstock.com for this item and none of them were even close. The next best price I found was at the Lowe's brick-&-mortar for $39.99 + tax. As always, Amazon shipping was quick and packaging was in new condition - no damage whatsoever.Installation was an adventure, becuase I had to trim the bar quite a bit. Our tile made our opening about 58-inches. Uncut, the bar is a bit over 59-inches. Mounting brackets are sturdy metal, not the cheap plastic stuff. These metal brackets made for a solid installation. My installation also included drilling through our glazed ceramic tile. That took the most time, effort, and patience. I used a hacksaw to cut down the rod, just cutting a little each time until I had the tightest fit possible. The key to all of this is patience. It pays off in the end.Amazon does it again!

One, Stableford loves to use the five-dollar-words, and neither his dialogue nor his interior monologues (even given that this book is supposed to be the autobiography of its principal character) ring true at all. No actual human beings talk or think the way Mortimer Gray does. The style is turgid in the extreme.Two, for a philosophical novel of ideas, there's little that's innovative. The philosophical issues of \\"spacer vs. planet-dweller\\", \\"genetic engineering vs. cyborging\\", \\"hedonism vs. stoicism\\", and even \\"death vs. life\\" are not dealt with in a way that is more interesting or entertaining than has been done by previous authors. Plus, Stableford commits the great error (in my mind) of actually trying to depict the contents of a Great Work for the Ages.Bruce Sterling's _Schismatrix_ went over much similar ground 15 years ago in a much more entertaining way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their last rockin' disc","review":"Not their debut, but still kick a**!

Every member of this band does a superb job. CJ's vocals are amazing, he has a huge range and his voice is gritty yet clear. Superb guitar and bass work give the music a really high quality feel and the drums are very good too.There are some really great songs on this album, from rock anthems like 'you're too bad' and 'mamma didn't raise no fool' to ballads like 'when I look into your eyes'. I rarely listen to ballads on most albums but the ballads on this album are first class.This is the second classic album from an amazing rock band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage does not age well... not like good wine.","review":"Any band that releases an album with a song titled \\"Rock You Tonight\\" should be banned from ever recording ever again.

Although this one doesn't have as many of the big hits (Love of a Lifetime, Don't Treat me Bad, and All She Wrote), it does have the great Top 10 ballad \\"When I look into your eyes\\" (These guys have always had a great touch with the ballads). Anyways, besides that hit, you'll also find several other great songs, including the rocking opener \\"Reach for the Sky\\", and my favorite song on the album, the \\"Sleeping with You\\", a goofy, rocking ode to getting some action. If you're a Firehouse fan, this is a definite must-own. As for new fans, you might want to go with the debut first, as it has most of the big hits, but FIREHOUSE, HOLD YOUR FIRE, and their new album CATAGORY 5 are the definite purchases for any Firehouse fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hold Your Fire is a must-have for any Firehouse fan!!","review":"After 14 years, this album is still getting rotation in my cd player. I love the speed of \\"Reach for the Sky\\" and it's catchy rhythms. My favoirte song from this album would have to be \\"When I Look Into Your Eyes\\" and \\"Hold The Dream\\".

Now, 40 years and some later, I find it on this album (which also tells me there were 3 other versions. Lucky I got the right one!) Well, not only is the song just as I remembered it, but there are many other deep, Proustian treats here. Also revealing to me is how good Nancy Wilson was, and also how moving Sukiyaki was (in stereo, they say, for the first time). Regarded as a novelty number back in the naive, ethnocentric 60s, it is a beautifully sung pop song, the emotions quite affecting, even for those of us (including me) who can't understand a word. If this album is an indication of how good the rest of the series is, I'll be getting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"South Beach With Gentle Breezes...","review":"Having recently booked a trip to South Beach, I wanted something I could listen to that encompassed the vibe of the area.

She travels courageously across the Rockies by horseback, alone, as a woman, and dressed in garb which should have resulted in her death from exposure. Yet she is very matter-of-fact about her travels, detailing a vivid life of Western pioneers - their isolation, their poverty, their difficulties as immigrants, in the post-Civil War time period. I'm surprised this didn't make the San Francisco Chronicle's list of best non-fiction books about the West."},{"rating":"2","title":"great example of \\"true\\" life in 1870s American west","review":"Book delivered quickly - great condition.This is a great example of \\"true\\" life in 1870s American west, as seen by one who lived it, not as a tourist"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing woman!","review":"It's hard to really understand what life was like in the late 1800s along the front range of the Rockies, but Isabella makes an interesting job of explaining it in her letters to her family (the basis of the book). What makes it so fascinating is the casual way she talks about climbing Long's Peak (a 14K' mountain near Estes Park), sleeping in an unheated room with no chinking between the logs and having to brush snow off her bed before lying down, or riding for days between towns and having to stop at people's homes for the night as though it were commonplace. Perhaps it was back then, but seems almost incomprehensible in today's world of motels and anonymous encounters.The book is likely to resonate more with people familiar with the Estes Park area as we can compare the places Isabella rides through with their modern-day equivalent, but it's still an interesting read for anyone who wants a window into the pioneering world of 100 yrs ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed with this book","review":"My first impressions of this book is that it is hastily put together both in printing and content. On my copy, the print quality is poor.One of the most important devices in a good handbook is the index. The index of this book is sparse to say the least, with most of the built in functions and triggers not directly indexed at all, so that you have to trawl through the book sequentially to find the things you are looking for.On the my first reference to a built in function, I found a glaring error. The very first page I looked at contained an obvious contradiction. I have not yet had enough exposure to the rest of the book to say if that error is out of character, though I would hope it is.I would say that as it has its place as a book to aid learning, but falls a long way short when used as a reference to an experienced forms developer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful at all!","review":"The style of this book is mostly a dry enumeration of facts plus a set of extremely detailed tutorials. By extremely detailed, I mean something on the order of \\"click this button, this window appears, select this option, etc..\\".This is just all wrong for me. What I look for in a good technical book is an explanation of concepts following a logical progression of ideas. The target audience of this book are professional programmers but it reads like a user's manual for non-technical people.This book can serve to acquaint you with the various features and tools available in Oracle Forms. But if your aim is to become adept with Forms, this book barely gets you started towards that goal.5/16/2003I've had this book for a while now and I've hardly used it.

As an experienced Oracle/IT professional, trying to learn Oracle Forms from this book has been extemely frustrating. The author is verbose rather than concise. Important information about a single topic may be spread across several sections making it difficult to get an answer to a specific question. As another reviewer stated, the index is weak. The author offers many warnings and tips that I eventually learned to test out for myself because, in a lot of cases, were just plain not true. There are tutorials on OOP, SQL, and PL/SQL that are tedious if you already have that background. I'd reccomend this book only for someone with little Oracle background who has a lot of time and patience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"The book is full of typos and mistakes in the code examples. Even with that the book has been helpful in some situations but hard to use. It is written like a huge tutorial and if you don't get something in the previous section, the next section doesn't work.

Why can't there be more books on this subject to choose from?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Index was HORRIBLE. No CD? C'mon I paid [$$$]","review":"A refence book without a good index becomes a novel you have to skim through. I had to do this on several occasions. What is sad is that the Table of Contents was pretty in depth (17 pages which is more than the index). When I need an answer I want a place in the book that will point me somewhere near the item I'm looking for. I was lucky because I had read the thing from cover to cover, so I had a general idea where to look. It covers the various form elements in advanced, but I could have gotten the same data from a help file.It would have been more useful with a better index. I found the downloadable sample files, but why not have a CD? Not recommended for the beginning Oracle user."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very impressive","review":"I am a beginner in Oracle Forms and Reports. I bought this book as a supplement to the class I am taking. The book talks about companion software, but there is no CD. It turned out to be downloadable SQL/PL*SQL scripts to be installed in my environment (You must have Oracle Developer client, not Windows environment, installed on your pc with permissions to create databases and tables, etc.) and run those scripts to setup the databases and tables.

I started reading that book and it looks like the author used the sources the KGB provided specially for him. You cannot compare that book with “Enemy at the Gates�?by William Craig, where the different sources were used in order to help readers to understand the real history of the WWII. I would recommend reading that book to anybody who wants to get the real picture about WWII and how Soviet Union won the battles. But Albert Axell copied the books I used to read when I was a kid in Soviet Union and our grandfathers told us that the real history of that war is different."},{"rating":"2","title":"S M O O T H!","review":"I read mystery novels for pleasure and entertainment, and this book certainly gave me those. Besides...The novel covers socially significant topics that will help each reader (trust me) understand him/herself and other important people! It open windows to problems many of us face at one time or another, and offers guidance toward solutions. This is a story for the world we live in today, post 9-11.That may be important, and yes, this is an important book, BUT, what's more, it's an exciting tale by a very smooth, talented writer. No hitches to stop the action or draw a reader out of the story. And a terrific story it is. I cared about the characters and what was happening to them, and stayed involved from first page to last. Highly recommended, whether you're a lover of the literary, a mystery buff, a psychologist, or just one of the folks who likes a good, entertaining story, well told.Thank you for GRAVEN IMAGES, Nancy Mehl.

I found this online and wasn't sure about the quality and such, and was afraid it wouldn't arrive on time. I went ahead and bought it anyway, hoping for the best. It arrived the day before Halloween and was adorable. She kept the headband on which I can hardly believe and everyone thought she looked adorable. It was a nice weight, better than the Superbaby costume which was REALLY thick, but it was a fairly warm Halloween this year. But at six months, the amount of time she was out made the weight of the fabric a non-issue for the most part. But it was warm enough to not have to cover it up, but not so warm that she overheated. It was a light jacket kind of day as I recall so she was just right."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Workout Video","review":"What I like about this video is the rest period between the sets which are a real challenge.

She managed to pop the lid on the top of the little house open one night, so I taped it shut. Then somehow she got the whole green top to come off, so then that got taped. The cage is very hard to clean. Yes it comes apart in pieces, but have fun putting it back together! I will never buy a cage with bars. Shadow loves chewing on them, which is very noisy. The bar that holds the ball in place broke after a few weeks.

Around day five the ball wheel became excessively noisy, but I was able to adjust the ball connection so it was quiet. But now, day seven, the ball is SUPER noisy, and you know these little guys like to run at night...I can't seem to quiet it. I'm not sure if this item can be return either. Personally, I wouldn't buy it again, i would look for something more sturdy, and with a separate ball, and a regular wheel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer be AWARE","review":"This is a terrible death trap for regular hamsters. Bought this cage for my daughter's hamster and thought at first it was great. My daughter loved the colorful pieces in the cage. However BE AWARE it is hard to keep together as the pieces are a challenge to make fit. The worst thing is the tube that runs up the cage. Our hamster got stuck and almost died. This is not suitable for regular hamsters. This cage should only be used for very small animals like the robot hamster. The top cage also have a very week latch and our hamster escaped twice by just pushing up the top latch. This cage should be a recall!!! I would not recommend this cage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible cage! Don't buy if you have a larger pet that would like to eat your hamster!","review":"I have figured out that CritterTrail makes several crappy hamster habitats! I returned the Dazzle habitat because of the poor quality and a ridiculously big gap where you couldn't prevent a pet from escaping. I then read the reviews on Amazon and realized I wasn't imagining the poor quality. So I exchanged that cage for this one. As other reviewers have stated, the ball is very loud when rolling atop the cage. But the worst part is that the hamster forced the hatch of the look-out tower open! Luckily, the cat wasn't there at the moment or we would have had one dead hamster (as I sadly read another reviewer state). I now have a tight band clamping the tower hatch closed so she doesn't escape yet again. She is constantly trying to get out from that spot now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money if you see Amazon listing a cage","review":"I was disappointed with this cage. I do not think this cage was new at all, as Amazon had advertised. The wheel was already assembled. There were scratches already on the wheel like somebody had used it. The wheel does not even sit on the turning table. All the materials that came in packaging were wrapped in plastic tied together with red tape...why did you advertise that this product was new when it was not Amazon?! I am disappointed because I was expecting better straight from the company, and this was my first time ordering straight from Amazon. It also took the company a long time to ship the product. Usually when I buy from other people on Amazon they ship next day, it took Amazon 4 days to ship, which was annoying.

Plus you have to clean the ball about every two days. And poop gets into the little tunnels so it is impossible to clean! And when the mice or hamster or other animal climb on the bars, it sounds like the whole thing collapsed and it's even worse at night. So you should not buy this cage unless you want poop all over the room the cage is in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap piece of junk","review":"Don't waste your time on this cage because it will ultimately end up in the trash! It is very cheap. We had to replace the ball the first week due to my daughter dropping it on the floor and the plastic broke into pieces (a wood floor). Our hamsters escaped (3 different hamsters on 3 separate occasions) and all three ended up with the cat! If you want to forego the heartache for your child in losing their pet this cage is poorly designed and easy for the animal to escape! They constantly used the ball for a nest, dragging their bedding into it. So much for the exercise ball. They also used the look out area as their bathroom and that is hard to clean out! Nearly every part of this plastic cheap contraption of ours is duck taped together because it has broken so easily. Do not buy this, it is easy to put together but is flimsy, the plastic is flimsy and will not last!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap","review":"Although it has already been said, it can't be pointed out enough. The hamsters escape because of the cheap quality.We have had the cage for 2 months and now she is escaping easily. The flimsy device designated to hold the ball in comes up allowing the hamster to wiggle out through the opening. We have taped it down and that works well except she now can't use the ball for exercise. The ball gets dirty fast so it requires daily cleaning. The cage comes completely apart when you go to clean the base and the plastic snaps to hold it together have broken. If the hamster wasn't getting out all of the time I'd give it 2 or 3 stars, but if it can't do the most basic of functions then what's the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good cage but can be easy for hamster escape","review":"This was a great cage for the first few weeks.

I wouldn't recommend this product, do waist your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I did not purchase this from Amazon but a pet store. This was ok for about a month and then the ball attachment began to break down. Once that happens this cage is basically worthless because the ball attachment covers a huge opening at the top of the cage.

I'm already seeking a new cage for my sons hamsters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"Bought this from Petco for use with Gerbils just last weekend and am already moving to a fish tank. I had the cage on my wooden garage workbench. The ball rolled off the top of the cage onto the workbench and the clips that hold the ball together broke. The depth of the bottom pan is not nearly deep enough as half the bedding ends up on our floors. The ball clouded up from gerbil waste within hours of them moving in, requiring it to be cleaned daily, unless you like watching waste go around in circle.

The paint is a bit thick but you could water it down or just use other paints with it and in addition to what it comes with. (basic colors). the paper it comes with is more of a cardboard than card stock, and it does pop up a bit in the middle, but think that is on purpose to help assist the paint spreading process. When i needed more paper i just used some watercolor paper and cut it to size. My students love to experiment with color, speeds and distances (of splash) - they enjoy looking at the finished product just as much as the process.

First time we used it, it deflated slightly after about 3 times down a short hill. Second time, if sprung a leak and deflated completely after 4 runs down a 100-yard hill. Construction is cheap, as are the materials. There is no way these snow tubes will last more than a couple times out without failing- simply because the material and construction is too cheap to last.If you want a a snow tube that is built to last, look for one with a hard plastic bottom and much thicker material on top.

On the plus side, it worked very well and was very fast for a few runs. Also, delivery was fast and uneventfull. Two patches were included to repair hole, but, AND THIS IS IMPORTANT, upon taking the tube home to repair I found the leak was actually the result of a split in the seam between the top and bottom pieces of the tube....MEANING IT IS NOT REPAIRABLE!

The book does a wonderful job of explaining the suffrage movement in simple yet entertaining terms on each page. Each page includes about one paragraph as the book is aimed at young readers. However, if you are an adult and want some quick leisure reading, this book will not disappoint you. It is also perfect for reading out loud to little ones.

Back in Evan's hometown, something similar seems to have happened to Evan's uncle. All of this is presented effectively, which is what makes the conclusion such a disappointment. All of the various plot threads come together, but it all feels very arbitrary and sketchy. The final explanation for the supernatural goings-on is vague.

This game looks and sounds like it is 3 to 4 years old, Infogames must have been put on a quick deadline to get it done. Graphics are very poor, details are lacking, and there is very little a child can explore on their own. There is little incentive to play it again after completing it one time at each skill level.

Unfortunately, once you have played the game once (which takes all of 20 minutes)you have pretty much exhausted it for entertainment value. Oh sure, you can change the level to increase the difficulty but it really doesn't alter the game play, it just adds a few more items to each \\"puzzle\\".

The characters are cute and charming but the movement from one game to another is very frustrating. Even the three year old thinks the computer has frozen while waiting for the next segment to appear. Pretty frustrating for a three year old...and the adult \\"playing\\" the game with her.Visually it's clever and enjoyable but the mechanics do not measure up.Except that if the child you are getting this for is a confirmed Dora fan, I wouldn't recommend it.

I really feel the two star rating is generous. My daughter is Dora crazy, and even she shows little to no interest in this game (and she loves edutainment computer games).The program is not well executed, and there is little asttention to detail. One my daughter noticed was that at the begining of the game Dora collects 5 books to return to the liebrary.

From the church elder run amok - \\"if there is a bad idea to be thought\\" kind of effect, to the contentment, gentleness and grace of small town life, every chapter told a special story with a thought provoking ending. The widower and the Chinese twins, spiritual warfare in a pacifist church, and delivery of a demon bus, Diet Sodas for the wedding anniversary, Ulysses S. Grant 5, Spelling Bee Champ, taking the sex out of secretary, the midnight toilet installation, and the Golden Goose & the lottery winner, all make the ordinary into something truly remarkable. I can't recommend it highly enough - all ages, either gender.

Thus four stars instead of five, but please understand that this was a pleasant read by a writer who knows his craft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful book!!","review":"This is a perfectly delightful book full of memorable characters.

Mr. Gulley has a true talent to convey real life like no other author that i've read recently. Even though Sam Gardner is a pastor of a small Quaker church, he finds his parisoners downright annoying at times, but tries to love them anyway. Most of the chapters, which seem more like essays to me, spoke to me as nothing had in ages. I laughed, I cried, I read entire chapters out loud to my husband and son. If you are looking for a book that will wrap you in a cosy blanket, then curl up with ANY of Gulley's books with a cuppa tea for a wholly enjoyable afternoon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MORE MR. GULLEY!!!","review":"This is the first Phillip Gulley book I've read, so I can't compare it to his others, but this book was one of the most delightful reads I've had in a long time. It was way too short and just as I was totally falling in love with Harmony and all it's inhabitants, the book was over! Many heart-wrenching stories and many laughable moments as the pastor of Harmony Friends Meeting takes you on a visit of this small town. In the same vein as Jan Karon's Mitford series, but not a complete story, but a series of vignettes. Please Mr. Gulley.....MORE!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"The whole Harmony series is very enjoyable, and it among my favorite in the fiction genre. They are all light-hearted and full of wonderful and entertaining characters. The books follow Sam, a pastor in a small-town Quaker church, and the eclectic group of individuals who are members.You will likely find yourself laughing out loud at the antics of Dale, as he undertakes his scripture-egg project or his salvation balloons. Fern Hampton may drive you nuts, but you'll learn to love her.Many reviewers compared this to the Mitford series, reading this one because they enjoyed the Mitford series so much. I tried reading the series after this one, and found it dry and dull.These books are easy, pleasant and clean reads. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Story-telling at Its Best","review":"Delightfully entertaining, touching, funny, and sometimes heart-wrenching, Philip Gulley's endearing stories of fictional small town Harmony are story-telling at its best. A page-turning snapshot of small town America, as seen through the eyes of the minister of its little church, and gently sprinkled with wisdom for living all our lives. A little reminiscent of TV's Mayberry stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Link To the Past","review":"I have read all four of Phillip Gulley's books and have enjoyed each of them. Home to Harmony is his first book of fiction. I was a little concerned about changing format from the first three books, but I found I had nothing to worry about this is a wonderful book. The characters are warm. The stories take you back to a time when things were simple. My home town is not so small anymore and reading Mr. Gulley's books are my only link back to my little town, I thank him for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A close second to Jan Karon!","review":"I loved this town.

This book was funny, at times poignant, but somehow lacks heart and soul. While not a devoutly Christian person, I felt a certain satisfaction after each of the Mitford books, plus a genuine affection for the characters.

I have often made biscotti for gifts or deserts and always everyone wants the recipes. I refer them to this book. I can heartily recommend it to anyone who wants to bake biscotti.

Why it is out of print (and it is VERY hard to find, because no one will part with their copy) is a complete mystery. This very substantial book (hundreds of pages, large format, hundreds of photos) is the absolute definitive work on bathroom design. In awe-inspiring detail, Alexander Kira analyzes bathroom functions versus bathroom fixtures. Imagine, if you will, hundreds of pictures showing people showering and urinating in front of calibrated background grids. The book is at once scholarly, on target, and hysterically funny. It will forever change the way you think of the simple toilet. If you ever see a copy in a used bookstore...grab it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scientific analysis of today's horrible bathroom facilities.","review":"Cornell University's Dr. Kira performs extensive scientific research on how humans use bathroom facilities, and discovers our current designs and practices are WRONG. For example, our sinks are much too low and our toilet seats are too high. Urinals are designed to splash on us(!), and women's restrooms would be much more useful if they still had female-friendly urinals (which they did until the 70's). Dr. Kira provides many new designs that solve the problems we tolerate out of ignorance.How could so much detailed research and beneficial new designs be overlooked? An Amazing book that is totally relevant today (humans are still the same, and so are toilets).

He gives examples of structures and inscriptions found in the \\"old world,\\" then goes on to compare similar ones found in the Western Hemisphere. Scholars with open minds seem to support many of his conclusions, but criticize his \\"translations\\" of ancient writings.

This in itself puts 'Blue Light, Red Light' right up there with ANYTHING Sinatra ever released. Keep in mind, Frank didnt write his own music.... (with only rare exception).. The fact that HCJ could, and did and DID with such AWESOME RESULTS is astounding.If you like Sinatra you're gonna be blown away by this album. Nobody today compares to the man on this album. (NOBODY).Anyone who says \\"there will never be another Sinatra\\" might want to step back for a while and listen to this 1991 album. They'll stop and think awhile...

Waste of time and Playmate of the year were awesome albums. Still today they are permanently in my changer. As for MFZB it lacks everything that zebrahead are, there wild and witty songs about off beat topics and really crazy sounds they made are totally gone off this album. They truly did \\"sell out\\" or did something really stupid. Zebrahead are a huge hit in japan, like blink 182 or some ragged pop star is in america. I can only imagine the dissappointment of a whole nation. Either way Zebrahead best bet is to get back in the studio (and fast) and tell everyone that martians abducted all of them and in place put in Godsmack, maybe they can save some face than and not sign there own tombstone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"playmate and waste are far better","review":"Want to know what I think about this CD? IT MAKES ME SAD. Zebrahead are this amazing band I got into when I first heard \\"Get Back\\" off Waste of Mind. An amazing song...awesome CD. If you've never heard them, think extremely fast punk interlaced with funk, a dj, and two singers with opposing ways of singing...and lots and lots of tongue in cheek lyrics.Their follow-up, Playmate of the Year, did not disappoint either. It was fresh and fun, just like Waste of Mind.But this. THIS. This is music that you can pick up from Blink, New Found Glory, Simple Plan...all that crap they call punk rock nowadays. It's power chords, dull lyrics, no funk, no fun. All that I listed above in the previous cds...GONE. Is it an improvement? No...they've lost what made them special, and now aren't worth listening to, unless they change their act.I would however, highly recommend both old cds. Pick them up now if you haven't heard them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still zebrahead as always...","review":"Though the cd lacks humor, the songs are a culmination of their last two releases.

I think that this cd will grow on me the more I listen to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty much trash.","review":"It seems as though this once orginal band has jumped on the \\"punk\\" bandwagon. They used to be a cross between funk and rap, with a tiny bit of punk. Now, if you listen to the CD, there is only 1 funk song, which isn't even that good. They're now 90% punk pop, with whiny pop punk lyrics and simple guitar riffs. Where are all of the crazy G solos now? Zebrahead went from a great orginal band to yet another punk band. I do NOT recommend. Bad choice, not worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best CD Ever","review":"When i heard \\"playmate of the year\\" for the first time Zebrahead became my favorite band instantly.

The first cd is even better, the songs just get annoying for the most part there are like two or three good songs and the rest are just crap like Rescue Me is. I wish they would go back to Playmate Of The Year."},{"rating":"1","title":"zebrahead, where did it go wrong","review":"If im being honest i havent heard a decent song on mfzb yet. I think going from unique to linkin park is possibly the worst thing a band could ever do. I mean is anyone honestly trying to compare this to songs like someday or fly daze? there are no good lyrics on this album there is no good music. Yes its heavy but so what? So many bands have done it better than this and im not blaming Zebrahead for that because this is not their musical strength.Just to give a bit of balance to the review my fav bands are foo fighters, third eye blind, goo goo dolls etc. this album is therefore not aimed at zebrahead fans like me who prefer good lyrics to shouting. For the record i bought this CD listened to it once through and swapped it for the new beastie boys one the next day. For the love of crummy cake get the beastie boys album instead or better still Waste of Mind or Playmate of the Year, both great albums"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"It's difficult to believe that this is the same group that created Waste Of Mind. Like Incubus did with Make Yourself (after S.C.I.E.N.C.E failed to fully breakthough to the mainstream) Zebrahead completely dumbed down their sound on Playmate of the Year and now even further on Mfzb in an attempt to gain commercial success. Fortunately for anyone stuck listening to a radio they probably never will in America, simply because they sound like every other irrelavent wannabe pop-punk band crowding the airwaves. It's time for Zebrahead to remember what separated them from the pack in the first place- mainly an extraordinarily talented lead guitarist and a lyrically gifted rapper. This stripped down version just isn't worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"Uggghhhh. I just can't possibly imagine why any old school zebrahead fans would actually like, or worse yet, love this album. I have followed Zebrahead since the late 90's, and this is by far the worst thing they have ever put out. Their early work had a hardcore vibe, Waste of Mind had a very funky sort of vibe, and Playmate of the Year blended pop and borrowed from electronica for many of the beats. Mzfb takes Zebrahead and turns them into a pop punk band with a rapper, maybe to buold upon the Sum 41 hit \\"Fatlip\\", or maybe for other reasons. But theres no way around the fact that this is just awful. Most of the songs are indistinguishable, and Zebrahead's trademark sense of humor is almost non-existant. The music is still fast and bouncy, but compared to what they've done before, the guitar work is mind numbingly simplistic and has been done by just about every other band in the pop-punk genre. Shame on all of you 4 and 5 star reviewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissapointment","review":"There was a lot of hype for MFZB, and all I have to say is WHAT FOR? This is probably their worst cd, the production is awfull, the songs are uncreative and just lame. Sopposedly they wrote 80+ songs for this CD, I'd hate to hear the songs that didn't make it. Zebrahead was my favorite band up until I heard this CD, now I am less of a fan. There is only one good song, \\"Hello tomorrow\\". Breakthough CD? I think not, sorry but maybe next time Zebrahead"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Dissapointed","review":"I have to dissagree with some of the previous ratings. I was a much bigger fan of their earlier released stuff, they went to a much more \\"pop-punk\\" sound. If that's your style, definately pick up the album, but if you were into the uniqueness of previous material you may be let down. To each their own, surely give it a listen, but you may want to check out some tracks or clips before buying. I got it for 3 dollars so really I can't complain but I figured I'd throw out my input."},{"rating":"2","title":"This ROCKS!!!","review":"There are at least 5 hits on this album!

During my years of working with parents in my psychology practice, I often recommended this book to parents to help them to understand better how to use behavioral change methods with their children, some of whom were difficult children, some were normal active children, and in some cases, the parents just lacked the knowledge. Well written and strikingly devoid of \\"psychobabble\\", the author gives a clear, simple explanation of how to use point systems effectively and is especially good at pointing out to parents the importance of their attitude and behavior toward the child during their training.

I say this as I have studied the art of knife fighting and knife defense for the past 12 years.

Some of the story is realistic (eg., the man's family take the infant to a doctor, who proclaims that \\"this is a normal, healthy two-year-old\\" and chastises the family for wasting his time), while other parts are fantastic (the man-infant, out on his own [?] happens into a convention of other regressed adults and has to pretend he is a simple two-year-old to escape them).

It's somewhere between inspiring and saddening.In the younger aged sections, I thought the Japanese study/footage was incredible.

I usually really enjoy this genre, but never before have I been subjected to such an over-romanticized, milk and honey bunch of hooey. According to this book, Esther's was a life of joy from almost beginning to end. She's faced with a few sorrows here and there, but for the most part she joins a harem where she is lavishly treated almost from day one. Most harems were not the place of luxury and pampering portrayed in this book. Basically, I give the book one star for historical reality and two stars for readability. Really, if you like this genre, go out and get yourself some really good reading like \\"The Red Tent\\" and Orson Scott Card's \\"Women Of Genesis\\" series.

That being said, it was wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"personal view of a farming couple struggling after 4 years of drought. This woman is practically a saint. Not only does she work her fingers to the bone, push the family's spirits up, and pinch every penny, but mitigates her husband's ungrateful attitude. They seem aware that this is the worst moment of their lives. Sadly, he seemed to always sacrifice the family for his personal ambition and pride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Heartwarming, uplifting, emotional. At times there is love and at times there is conflict. From struggling to relief. A touching story of life's hard times and good times. It portrays how living can be so difficult and so satisfying at the same time. It touched my heart. It is an amazing story of a family deeply dedicated to saving a farm, and dealing with the emotions of relationships. The type of documentary that can be watched over and over. You will find yourself pulling for the family and hoping for the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many interesting facts. I really liked this book!","review":"There are a lot of interesting facts in this book. For example, I never knew there were two different stories about how Judas dies in the New Testament. Cayce's book provides a lot of this type of information. Lots of facts. Greek and Aramaic translations are covered. Numerous translation errors are covered. Alternate interpretations of the New Testament based on translation errors are covered. Some minor errors. Some major. So this book is more than an introduction, but less than a scholarly textbook. Just the right amount of information to stymie any Christian Fundamentalist who might be trying to convert you! I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in finding out more about this subject. Two thumbs up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Off topic","review":"The idea that the historical Jesus differs from the post Easter Jesus presented to the world by the early church is well documented. This book tends to rant too much about John and Paul, without getting into the scholarship. When he does get into some of the scholarship he gets it wrong. For example the author states that Matthew is the most accurate gospel. No one gospel is any more or less accurate. Mark is the first gospel and influenced Matthew and Luke. The author misses a very important fact about John's gospel,that it is written as a defense of the faith against the gospel of Thomas. The blend of physics, faith and karma at the end of the book is dubious at best. It just another spin on things that someone pulled out of his...well, you get the idea. On the postive side anything that pokes at the scourge of fundamentalism deserves some praise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Information seems accurate - needed an editor","review":"I bought this book based on a radio interview with the author as well as the positive Amazon reviews. The book does cover much of the material I expected it to, and it seems accurate and well documented. But I was very disappointed with the quality of the writing. Mr. Cayce seems to have a hard time sticking to one subject at a time. Instead he changes topics regularly, often repeating points he has made previously. While each of the sentence are generally tight and coherent, they are put together in some pretty disjointed paragraphs and so the end result seems sloppy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very intersting book.","review":"I really liked this book. A friend of mine recommended it and I'm glad she did. I started reading it and when finished, I liked it so much that I read it again. Many interesting things that I had not known. Definitely worth the read. Jesus comes through with a fresh perspective. I especially liked the final Addendum chapter of \\"How Everything In the Universe Really Works.\\" An interesting mingling of science, philosophy, and religion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! This book also answers the question, \\"Why Are We Here?\\"","review":"I was very impressed with this book. Extremely interesting subject matter. The last chapter and the Epilogue also speculate on how life works. Karma. Reincarnation. The age old question of \\"Why Are We Here?\\" is answered. Very interesting indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I highly recommend this book!!!,","review":"This really is a wonderfully interesting book. I read some of the other reviews, and they are absolutely true. If you are a conservative Christian Republican, you probably will not like this book, but if you are an open minded and spiritual individual, you will enjoy this book a lot more. I really recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"old school mexican style saw him in concert three times and in joyed every single one of them well worth the price for this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Green Hornet Strikes Again!","review":"The company known as Video Treasures has done it. They have successfully raised a film from the dead A long, long, time ago a list was published called \\"The Lost Sound Serials\\" GHSA was one of them. There was no hope to ever see this story again, until Anchor Bay makes a fine print brought fromk Universals original film negatives. As for the movie, it's good but not great. Warren Hull brings more dignity to the role of GH. Keye Luke is a passable Kato, but expect no Bruce Lee, Kato rarley gets into a fight. The story is full of action, adventure and heart stopping cliffhangers. It's great fun for children and adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best live video footage","review":"What you have here are both of the Budokan, Tokyo concerts on CD from 1966 ...I preferred the first performance...the second lacks definition and is weak in output....altho both shows find the band singing and playing weak..as compared to their earlier days....This pair of shows were heavily affected by the smoking of marijuana before gigs....a very big thanks to Bob Dylan for that contribution....He probably killed the biggest band of the century.The video quality of the DVD is great....here you get to see the band in color and crystal clear....and it even brings to light their mistakes onstage...as well as their classic Beatle sense of humour.For the completist...this is a must...but if you dont want to have your memories of The Beatles tarnished by sloppy performances and obvious drug effects onstage.....better forget this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"beatles disappointment.","review":"Very unhappy with this.

I wish it was the right color but it is still a good flag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I thought!","review":"I saw somebody reading this book on MUNI (That's public transportation for those of you unfortunate enough not to live in S.F.) and asked how it was and he told me it was \\"Great!\\" I asked what it was about and he told me it was about terrorism and politics and current affairs and the internet. And it sounded interesting, so I picked up a copy and WOW. Well, it IS about what that man said, but to me it's MUCH more of a story about one man's survival -alone with himself and his ghastly captors, and how he lives with the mind games and the terror. It was a very quick read, but not a \\"beach book\\" quick read, it's literary. And by that I mean it has beautiful prose and it's just very graceful. I really enjoyed it, but I wouldn't say it's such a political or current events book -although again, it is- but rather a study of one man, surviving. Some readers may not like the violence, but it really was essential to the story. I will read this author's next book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great starter bit","review":"This suited my needs as a beginning router-er (er-er).

A plausable indroduction, but after that totally downhill. Way too may characters and way too many subplots for the average reader with a really boring murder mystery to begin with. Avoid this book at all costs. 76 per cent through, I put it in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creating a new group","review":"This book was not up to his usual par, but still worth reading because of his use of reoccurring charactors. I felt he struggled to get this one written it did not flow for me as his other books before had. He is creating a new cast of charactors and blending them with the old cast and I think this book was just a prelude to his next book which will be on track once again.If you enjoy a well written book you will never fail choosing a John Lescroart book. I like the reappearance of characters from past books which enhances the book because you know so much more about them than just what is written in the current book."},{"rating":"1","title":"who kidnapped Lescroart?","review":"I have read many in the Hardy/Glitzky series and was looking forward to meeting another character, possibly getting another series to count on. This is no where near the quality of writing and story as in the other books. As other reviewers have stated, the story starts out great, then just falls flat. The \\"hero\\" cop seems to be sleeping through his job, letting his buddy Hunt figure things out. Hunt himself is a dorf and seems to just haphazardly romp through the drama (hey everyone, let's solve a mystery!). About half way through, I really didn't care.My main question was, who really wrote this book? I don't think Lescroart wrote it. If you have read any of his other books, or even just read this book's acknowledgment, you can see that the quality of his writing is so much better than what was found in the novel. John, you need to find another ghostwriter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked the story, not the narrator","review":"As I often do, I bought this book on audio CD. I can be quite distracted by an annoying reader, and this was no exception. The initial audio reviewer above applauds the narrator for his \\"genuine voices.\\" No. Male readers should be prohibited from employing falsetto voices for female characters. Yikes!! Despite the poor delivery, the book itself is entertaining and moves along at a good pace. I'm sure the print edition would be great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, but let's hope it is a temporary blip...","review":"As some previous reviewers noted, the author has introduced two new characters in this effort, abandoning my favorites, lawyerDismas Hardy and cop Abe Glitsky, who thrilled me in several novels. I just don't feel engaged by the new guys, Wyatt and Juhle. The book is overlong, the hunt for a missing babe gets a bit ridiculous, and it becomes a chore to finish. Perhaps the next in the series, with condensed \\"back stories\\" for the heroes, will move faster and more credibly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Lescroart winner","review":"If this book had been written by someone other than Lescroart, it would have been an OK read. But knowing that the author brought several characters so memorably to life (Dismas, Abe, their wives and associates, etc) in a previous series, I expected more from this new effort and was greatly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment","review":"This book does not deserve a sequel. The longer I read the book the more conviced I was that this was not a novel but rather an editorial about issues the author has with the State of California. Finally near the end of the book, the story seemed to come together. However the new characters in the book just did not gel for me. I found no warmth between them but rather this seemed to be more of an adversarial friendship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed up muddled mess!","review":"What happened to Lescroart? He would have been better served starting with new characters and a new location. Trying to weave the old in with the new just does not cut it. He did not build up the new characters into people you really cared about. The crime solving required leaps of imagination that quite frankly I was unwilling to muster. It seems like going back to Hardy/Glitzky as elder statesmen of the SF crime solving might be a better choice for the future!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment...","review":"A quarter of the way through this book (as far as I could tolerate it) I was asking myself if this is a rehash of one of his earliest unpublished attempts at stringing a story together. As it has references to a well-established Hardy it has to be a fairly recent rehash. As with every other Lescroart book I have read, I had great expectations. It started off sort of OK - but once it started expanding into the secondary characters it lost all 'depth' and just seemed silly and inconsequential - sort of what I would consider a 'rat pack' novel. I was actually questioning the possibility that Lescroart could ever have produced such an amateurish effort. Maybe his publisher demanded something from him during a slow period. This was a big mistake. I'm hoping he can recover his form with the next book. Oh John! How could you do this to your faithful readers?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great start, but . . .","review":"This book showed great promise early on but quickly degenerated into a very boring story. After reading more than half of it, I gave up. The many storylines and lifeless characters were major factors, and I decided I didn't care how it turned out. In short, a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tedious Read","review":"There is only so much disbelief I can suspend, and this book exhausted my supply. After the character introduction and exposition of the crime, the author lost his way through the interminable and illogical ditherings of the so-called plot.
