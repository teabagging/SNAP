If they used thicker aluminum this product would be much better, but of course this would cost them more and I have a feeling they don't care about quality. The foam is fine, it's what is needed for insulation, but the bottom line is they KNOW they have a problem with a flimsy product and are still producing a product that is cheap.

To compare how much more \\"modern\\" Chekhov can sound (and Chekhov was, is, and will remain always MODERN), read Robert Payne's translations. Payne eliminates the clumsy clauses and unnecessary commas and lets the story shine through.Ford's introduction is interesting, but note: he says NOTHING about the translations.

Instead, the plot degenerates into endless, repetitious bickering between factions of characters, so that the original concept is never developed and the book reads more like a tedious, petty soap opera than a novel. Despite the title, the characters never actually do go on the quest that is discussed endlessly throughout the book.

He lets the good guy stand up, brush his hair, tie his shoes and square up...well, almost. Horrible.The acting is disastrous. The stars are a bunch of jits guys, so I wasn't expecting much, but I was still surprised at how bad the acting was. Horrible.

Well worth keeping on your Kindle to repeatedly dip into.The \\"Folio Society\\" editions of his work are very well made, often available 2nd-hand via Amazon & are fine additions to any library.(NB This review is appended unaltered to other public domain Saki works)"},{"rating":"1","title":"some ok songs, but some real garbage too","review":"there are some good songs by MTX, but there are also some absolutely terrible songs by the donnas, and a few others too. the video by pansy division is pretty funny(they didn't mean for it to be like that). but i wouldn't reccomend it too much"},{"rating":"1","title":"the wrong book was sent wanted art game book by David Rkosenberg","review":"the wrong book was sentit was a gift birthdayasked what did you think about the book after it was readthey did not like it so we talked about itand I said this does not sound like the right bookso he let me look at itand it was the wrong bookstill working on getting the right book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Invest in Better Cords","review":"I was very disappointed with these cords.

We (the readers) are given more information about the Jedi Order and the working Master/Padawan relationship. But to me, Ms. Watson skipped too much time in between this book and the last one. I prefer a tighter link as demonstrated in previous novels. I feel cheated out of a whole other novel when she does that. But maybe I'm still ticked off about JA8. I will miss Xanatos. He was too cool to come to that sort of end in the series and he always made for interesting reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Again...too short.","review":"*sigh* I'd like to add my voice to the chorus that wants these books longer!

Even though Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon weren't together for much of the book, the addition of Adi Gallia and Siri was nice. And then there was those foreshadowings of the Empire. Very chilling. Masked Soldiers, a weapon able to destroy a planet, a central evil controlling the whole universe, and a darkness that surrounds the Jedi. And Qui-Gon sees a vision of Obi-Wan living alone on a desolute planet. Very interesting. Although there was no bad guy in this story. Not really, anyway. But I guess it's possible that it is leading up to something. As I said, not the best, but it was an interesting addition to the Jedi Apprentice series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ever so Fancy","review":"I bought Fancy for my little niece and she loves her.

There were lots of great reviews on Amazon so I was hoping that Huggies' claim for these seeming more like real underwear was true. Unfortunately, I was greatly disappointed when I opened the package. They feel just like my young daughter's Pull-Ups. My almost 8 year old son sleeps soundly and often wets the bed. We've been trying different things for him but one thing he does not want is anything diaper-like. I'm afraid if I show these to him, it will really be a hard thing for his self-esteem (as we all know, this is hard on kids). I'm going to have to look for the GoodNites Boxers...they disguised the 'diaper' part of these better and my son was more open to wearing them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Son loves them","review":"My 4 year old son loves the designs on the diapers and we have had no problems with leakage.

Second, they say \\"front\\" and \\"back\\" very clearly on them. I'm new to this whole mom thing (came to the game about 8 years late) and diapers confuse the heck out of me.

We have been having trouble finding a product that keeps his bedding dry. We had been using regular pull-ups, and night time pull-ups, but they were leaking through to his sheets every night/morning. So, I thought we could try these since they are for older boys.We bought the smallest size, though the packaging says for 38 lbs, and my son is only 34 lbs. I didn't think it would make that big of a difference. Apparently, it does. He leaked out of these worse than he did with the regular pull-up. It was like he didn't even wear ANYTHING to bed. It soaked through his bedding, and his mattress protector, down to his mattress.I'll be contacting Huggies today to see if they have any advice for us on what to do.

But on some of the pieces, the end of the song was abruptly cut-off. On Voodoo Chile, Crossroads and \\"She's Not There\\" the end was chopped off, right in the middle of the music. The least they could have done was to fade it out, but the volume was sustained at the chop point. 5 stars for the music and -1 stars for this screw-up, which averages to 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diversity for the maturing Classic Rock audiophile","review":"I'm usually the last in line when it comes to live albums, and overly long performances with few lyrics and covers sound like bad ideas, too.

Like many of the reviewers here, I have been listening to many of the great guitarists over the years. Unfortunately I cannot say that this is a recording that I can recommend. Frank Marino does have a high level of technical skills - he can play all of the notes required in the music. He can play with dazzling speed. What I found lacking was emotion. At times, I found the music derivative of Hendrix and Duane Allman but the emotion those players were able to wring from their instruments was not there for me in this recording. Without emotion, the long guitar breaks are not memorable and simply fall flat to me.If you are into Frank Marino, you would probably enjoy this. The sound quality is very good and the song selection covers a range of many years for Marino and MR, so your favorites are probably represented here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frank is technically very good - but lacks originality,","review":"One thing about Frank Marino is that he is a master at copying other great guitarists' styles and sounds. This DVD proves that in spades. This is also the reason why Frank's career never really took off.Frank lacks originality. He has no \\"signature\\" sound of his own, unlike other guitar greats like Carlos Santana, Johnny Winter, Jimmy Page, Ritchie Blackmore, Jimi Hendrix and Eddie Van Halen.Technically, there is no question that Frank is very good, which is why I find it so disappointing that he doesn't concentrate on developing his OWN sound. Copying other guitarists is like going to a karaoke bar and watching someone trying to sing like Frank Sinatra and Whitney Houston.Finally, this CD is far too long and repetitive. To me, it comes off as one huge Frank Marino ego trip and nothing more. Frank should also ease up on the gazillion special effects as well.My interest in listening further waned after the first 20 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing link","review":"\\"He's Calling\\" (cd #1, track #3) is the track which made me aware of Frank Marino - I had never heard of him before. They played the track on the radio (www.classic21.be). It made me go shopping for the album on the spot. Guitar-sound-wise on this album Marino is a bit of a missing link between Frank Zappa and Johhny Winter. Brilliant piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Live works for me.","review":"This recording really showcases the prodigious talent of Mr Frank Marino.

If I were Jeff Beck,Jimmy Page,Eddie Van Halen,Eric Clapton,etc.,I would really not want to get into a guitar showdown with Frank Marino.It is almost scary how good he is.So amazingly good in fact it even occurred to me that Frank may have sold his soul to the devil.He played this set for three solid hours with no break whatsoever,just one heavy song after another.He just loves to play and play it all...rock,blues,jazz,and the solos...very hot.It's far out and it's perfect.Frank Marino is the man!"},{"rating":"1","title":"get what you pay for","review":"Guess u do get what u pay for, made cheap \\"metal\\" feels like u can bend it with ur hand.

Price from Amazon was less than I found elsewhere. Case was smaller than other brands for this size saw (desired); the other major comparable brand was an ugly slime green color.

It is very inexpensive and for good reason. This model is not made to stand up to any type of rugged conditions or use. I am sorry I did not put out the extra money to get a good chainsaw that would last for several years. The saw did not even come with a plastic carrying case, but a small piece of plastic to cover the chain itself. I cut two small trees up with this saw and the chain itself was already dull and would not cut anymore. As a seasoned woodsman, I have never used up a chain that fast.

The drawings all look the same and they are very dated hair styles. The text is clear, but somewhat different than the information in another book (Handel's \\"Cutting Your Family's Hair\\"), so it can get confusing. A better book would need photos of every step and more detailed info.

This leaves Angelica surprised being that she never knew her grandfather was a millionaire.This book is extremely boring with no surprises or action at all. It lingers with the fact of Angelica losing her virginity within six days. I don't like how the author stays on the same topic, meanwhile taking forever to get to the point! This makes me not want to continue reading the book. Although I am still reading the book and also hoping there will be some action somewhere throughout it.

Apparently her loving grandfather was a very wealthy man and had a lot of money. The sick part is in order to get the money they want her to go to a family doctor to prove that she isn't a virgin anymore at the age of twenty one but Angelica is one of the most innocent characters I have ever read about.

(the latest release available) and the upcoming release in Feb. 2013 Scooby-Doo! Mask Of The Blue Falcon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scooby-Doo and the Monster of Mexico","review":"My 6 year old daughter loved it like she does all the Scooby-Doo movies! she wasn't feeling well one day and this brightened here resting couch time. . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scooby-Doo in Mexico","review":"Scooby and the gang take a Mexican vacation to visit friends and find El Chupacabra instead. Of course, the Chupacabra turns out to be the result of special effects by the crooks who want to scare people off their land and purchase the real estate at discount prices. The identity of one of the crooks may surprise you.This is another in the new series of animated Scooby-Doo movies that are far superior to the old cartoons. The stories are better, the mysteries more involved and there's more interaction amongst Mystery, Inc. members.If you like Scooby-Doo, then don't pass this up. It appeals to adult fans and kids alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scooby-Doo is a child's video hero.","review":"I, for one, am glad that they keep making Scooby-Doo movies. The old stuff is still fun to watch and the new ones are great for me and my nearly 3 year old son. I have to admit though, El Chupacabra from this movie and the ghosts from The Boo Brothers is scary for my son to watch at nighttime so I don't offer it as a choice at night. In this day and age of foul mouths and violence on TV, I am glad to offer Scooby-Doo as a choice for my son."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius Scooby movie","review":"This tale of the Chupacabra legend was very well achieved, I love the fact that the Scooby Doo gang is traveling in the new series, LOVE the new theme song, but the old one is still my favorite, the mexican characters are quite accurate, good accents, the right attire, and totally love the song in Spanish during the chase at the ruins, in many of the latest episodes the gang has evolved with the times, we see Daphne with a cell phone, they also have lab tops and the music is according with the situation and the place,..

Unfortunately, the author's ponderous, wooden narrative and puerile dialog dampened my initial enthusiasim. Though the book is filled with interesting anecdotes and insights that only a person who was actually there would know, they are squandered since the author's command of English is at the level of a grade schooler. I had to stop after only 2 chapters since I couldn't bear it, it was like being forced to watch Sesame Street.

Heat proof my foot! I called Amazon and they were great about replacing the lid but without using a lid the versatility of this piece is somewhat restricted in my opinion.

The impression I got was that if you were a Catholic, or a Mormon, a Jew or a Muslim or anything other than a fundamentalist Christian who had to be preached hellfire and brimstone to every Sunday, you were in the wrong and disillusioned. No matter what you thought you thought, you were as Frankenstein, blaming the world for your badness, not as Dr. Jekyll who recognized his badness and desired to be separated from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreemly Bias!","review":"The way this book presents itself, I was hoping it would show the contrasts of Christianity and other world religions/views, or the way the rest of the world views Christianity... but it's just a totally bias opinion of how \\"Christians\\" see the rest of the world. If you are a born again, this book will probably re-inforce your own views, but if you really want an introduction to world religion/views, go out and buy a few books like the \\"For Dummies\\" series on religions that will present the whole story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth reading","review":"It gives a clearer understanding of world views on an easy to understand manner.

I first took this book out in the field to the Arboretums in San Francisco and Berkeley. I found the book easy to use for IDing native trees. I also took this book with me on a trip to the eastern Sierras and trees that I have previously looked at as \\"pines\\" turned into Lodgepole, Mountain Hemlock, Whitebark, Red and White Fir, and Jerrery Pine.

After using it the first time (and never using metal utensils) I washed it by hand in the sink and the \\"indestructible diamond coating\\" flaked off with the food! This product is not what it says that it is and, therefore, is a complete rip off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly engineered","review":"I was excited about this pan based on the reviews of Swiss Diamond's cooking surface. When I opened the package and tried to remove the pan the long handle fell off. I replaced the screw but I was unable to tighten it as the screw hole in the pan was stripped out. It was obvious that the projection on the pan was not long enough to provide adequate screw threads. I consider this to be a serious engineering problem and am surprised that the company has let this slide by. The pan may cook nicely if it stays together but I am better served by a Lodge cast iron grill pan at $20.This experience was disappointing to me but at least Amazon took care of the return promptly and without any problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mickey comes out great every time!!","review":"I was so excited to order this for my six year old son at Christmas. The waffles come out great everytime I use it! Just follow the instructions and enjoy. I use a ladle to get the batter in evenly. Doesn't take long to figure out how much batter is too much. I have found the Bisquick Reduced Fat to make really good waffles, even better when you drop chocolate chips or pecans on top of the batter before closing the lid. Always have extra batter and waffles freeze well in ziplock bags and make a quick breakfast before school.

The waffler was intended to replace our well used Vitantonio Model 1950 Mickey waffler. Our family grew up with that waffler and used it for many years.The Villaware waffler is quite a disappointment. The issue is not its operation. The issue is the image of Mickey that is formed in the waffle. The image is very shallow, resulting in a waffle that doesn't even look like a waffle. My daughter had one of the waffles, and even she was disappointed with the waffler. I had previously hesitated to return it because it was a gift from her. It has now been returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"mickey mouse pancaker","review":"This is advertised as a waffle maker, but it is not. There is not a ridge or waffle involved. It is a pancake form of Mickey Mouse. The old version which was discontinued was a waffler, and photo they use shows the waffle that the previous item produced. The new Mickey Mouse Waffler would not show up well since there is no depth to the facial features, and there is only a hint of an outline of the face of Mickey Mouse.If you truly want a waffle maker this is not one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Waffles Every Time!","review":"I used this waffle iron for my son's birthday. Not only does it make the cutest waffles, but they're perfectly done every time, and it's unbelievably easy to clean. With the red ready-light, there's no guess work.

But if I had something to tell you, it would be about how funny, how amazingly funny that story is, and as you may think, this is my favourite TV show, and that plays right into my wheelhouse, for I know a lot of Series, and no one worth this one, no one really. So I hope you'll enjoy it, even if I know you will!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just can't catch a break!","review":"Feelin' a little sorry for Leonard, whatwith all his mishaps with Penny (most of the time unintentionally). But aside from that and those times he at first couldn't catch a break, this season was pretty full of surprises (both in plot and in guest stars, top one being Stan Lee's cameo) and trademark nerd humor, even with a few nice religious jokes (\\"Stop correcting me or I'll kill you, I swear to cow!\\"). Though I do find it sad what happens with Leonard at the end, maybe next year there'll be a rebound?Here's to hoping."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st show I've ever laughed out loud","review":"Introduced by reruns accidentally.

Do come out of their shells in time w/effort. Can be quite charming after they get over the terror. I digress, Sheldon thinks he knows Everything til he finds he doesn't. His mom is endearing w/him & he w/her. Watching Leonord alternately fold & stand up to Sheldon - a story unto itself. Howard, so small & all that slimy enthusiasm for women. Roj - so sweet til he gets vendictive. Last, but most certainly not least, Penny attempts to help them deal w/life outside of work & protects them.

Things are all roses for awhile, even with Sheldon as a roommate but things get either muddled or completely clear for Penny when Star Trek's The Next Generation Will Weaton nudges her over the edge and she dumps Leonard.

There still are some interesting places for the characters to go, so I'm curious as to how the writers will handle this. The series finale hinted at a possible romantic relationship for Sheldon, which should be interesting in several dimensions.Now I think the writers need to give Penny more to do- we know she's from Nebraska and has a brother, but beyond that there's not much background. What's her last name? We've seen (or heard) the other characters' parents- what are Penny's parents like? It would be fun to see Penny finally get some modeling or acting work. If I were one of the show's writers, I would put together an episode or two where Penny gets a bit part in a low budget sci-fi movie, and the guys overwhelm her with suggestions on costume and lines and keeping the science real.Anyway, TBBT is one of my favorite shows, and I'm hoping for a great 4th season."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soft Kitty stuffed animal","review":"Does not work.

Sure, you could complain that the characters reinforce the general nerd stereotype, but really, that makes it easier for viewers to engage and feel some familiarity with the characters. I particularly like the evil Wil Wheaton character, where he plays a diabolical version of himself. What I like about this Blu-ray version is the extra interviews and the tour of the set. I love the little extra peek into how they make it."},{"rating":"2","title":"JPod meets No Hope for Gomez","review":"This show always makes me think of the characters ofJPod: A Novelre-written with the dry humor ofNo Hope for Gomez!.As with NoHope, BigBang's characters are hilariously consistent. The things they get up to make perfect sense to them, and after a while they will to you too. Getting to know and understand the characters is half the fun of the show. The other half is the slew of awkward social situations that is thrown their way, much like we saw happening to Ethan in JPod.The third season finally sees Leonard and Penny becoming an item, Sheldon finding his nemesis in Will Wheaton from Star Trek, Howard developing a relationship with a woman who is not his mother, and Raj finding a way to talk to women.Not to be missed by fans of the previous seasons (or ofNo Hope for Gomez!orJPod: A Novelfor that matter :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"a good laugh","review":"Total 3rd season of what I think is one of the funniest shows on TV these days.

Never, I mean never, I's seen a sitcom use a laughing track in this way. But, by judging the great reviews and ratings, the producers coul not care less with my opinion.I mean, the jokes are great by themselves.

In other words, it's full of information that's available in myriad other remodeling texts. That information is well presented, but it's nothing exclusive to this book. What I expected, and where it falls woefully short, is a good discussion of issues particular to basements. Water gets perhaps two pages, humidity/moisture nothing at all, slanting floors and floor drains nothing. He does mention egress windows and basement mechanicals. Overall, however, far too much space given to general building techniques (probably over 80% of the book), when in fact what I think is needed is a lot more depth and detail regarding issues related to basements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good ideas, good for the wife, not the builder","review":"Good ideas in here.

I say guide because I did have to supplement a couple of times (namely the drywall and HVAC sections) with more in-depth books. But German lays out everything in a logical step-by-step manner and most of his explanations are clear. I didn't run into the insulation problem that some others had because I used a separate book for hanging drywall and insulation.

I just got that song out of my head, and here we go, he wants to watch it again.Of course, beautifully shot, haunting, incredibly sad and then uplifting at times. Every American should be watching this and 500 Nations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go West!","review":"This is an incredible piece of filmmaking. This is Ken Burns' long-overlooked documentary masterpiece about the birth and transformation of the West of America. Every \\"chapter\\" is more engaging than the last. This doc is also very well-balanced as far as the white Native American points of view. \\"The West\\" spans the devastation and ingenuity unique to American History. This doc is completely overshadowed by \\"Baseball\\" and \\"The Civil War,\\" (IMDB.com has thousands of votes for those two and only about 100 for \\"The West\\") but this is as good as it gets. Go West!"},{"rating":"1","title":"selective and biased","review":"Well, I looked at the one star reviews before purchasing and thought they were blowing hot air. However, $60 later I find myself agreeing with them.The West according to Ken Burns, is a revisionist history which takes the phrase \\"politically correct\\" to mean \\"selective historical moments to be presented in a totally biased way\\".Getting away from the \\"pc\\" issue, the film is \\"choppy\\" in the extreme with no seeming connection between the 'events' being presented. If you like your history presented 'chronologically' (as I do) then this fails in the extreme.Now I know the liberal/marxist pc colors Ken Burns wears I will avoid anything else by him.One final point - before all you pc-ers start flagging this review down please appreciate I understand events do not occur in a vacuum, and that there is more than one side to a story - however, if you're honest you'll admit that more than one side was not given."},{"rating":"1","title":"Selective History","review":"I looked forward to viewing this, since the history of the west is so rich. It would have been very difficult to present a comprehensive documentary of its history, but it seems that in this case Ives doesn't even try. He is consumed by victimology. It is perfectly appropriate to give a comprehensive account of the Native Americans and the great injustices that were done to them, although much was left out about the different tribes, regions they inhabited, culture, etc.. I would expect that this would be a major part of the series, which it was. Unfortunately, the rest is literally drenched with some sort of guilt-driven quest by the director to include every persecuted group of people, and individually outline their plights (blacks, chinese, mexicans, mormons). The message has become terribly boring by now. Whites bad, everyone else good. And only a passing mention of the Donner party? Believe it or not, you get a much better history overall from Kenny Rogers' \\"The Real West\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty negative story told here","review":"Ken Burns searched high and low to find as many negative stories about the west as possible - and succeeded !!

I personally thought too much time was devoted to the Noble Savages. Much singing of the Indians was evident but absolutely nothing to explain what the singing was about. There was no coverage about the outlaws and lawmen of the West. I think that at least some information regarding this aspect of the West should have been included.Overall a somewhat disappointing product. If I had it to do again, I would not purchase The West."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars is not enough!","review":"Absolutely gripping, and heartbreaking how the West was not won! It brought me to tears of how Native Americans lost so much but have endured throughout the years.

A fantastic job and the main title song will haunt you forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocking and informative.","review":"With all the years of American History we got shoved down our throats, none of it made an impression on me like this documentary series. I borrowed this boxed set from a friend, and together with my son, got a history lesson I'll never forget. It makes me ashamed to be a white person in America (at least I can console myself with the fact I'm only second generation). It's been a while since I viewed it, and would love to own it. The slaughter of the Buffalo, along with the indigenous people was mind boggling. The information about the South Western territories was facinating.

Reading this work, though, was disappointing for me. Supposing a Christian world-view [although this was not made plain up front], both the neuroscience and the theology were facile, lacking depth and scholarship.

To start, the poster is as vivid as the photo. I was also pleasantly surprised with the good quality of the paper. It is of a low weight card stock rather than paper. The weight of the paper, as well as the glossy finish, means it would hang well bare. I have it framed in a frame I purchased at a second hand store for a few dollars; it looks great! It has a large border; I used a frame where the border wasn't necessary.I purchased this for less than what I can find locally, which includes both taxes and shipping.

It complements the book fine, and it's detailed enough that you have to think about and know what you're doing to be able to complete the pages. However, they can get pretty short and each grammar point is pretty exclusive to its own page. It was good practice overall. The Genki series in general was not that helpful for me. It's organized in a random way that doesn't make much sense to me. The stories for each section have nothing to do with each other and just use random vocab and grammar for the section. The book does not have an engaging vibe that makes you want to learn Japanese more. I honestly would recommend Adventures in Japanese, the high school series. Vocab in the first chapters were in the last chapters of Genki I. Grammar is mostly the same, but there is less instruction and explanation in Genki. Do not use Genki if you are learning by yourself with only that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful!","review":"This book does a fantastic job of painting Malcolm X in the eyes of those who knew him and were touched by him. It really gives an insight into the life of one of the most influential men in history. I loved what Maya Angelou, Eldridge Cleaver, and Robert Penn Warren had to say. Other highlights are the interview with Claude Lewis, Malcolm's last TV interview with Pierre Barton, and On The Air with Joe Rainey, in which Malcolm discusses his split with Muhammad.

Unfortunately nobody thought to prepare the woods before photographs were taken: the wood surfaces were not cut or planed but sanded (truly horrible!). I would be ashamed to own a copy of this book: it definitely is a waste of the wood which went into making the paper it was printed on.A great deal of the information in this book can also be found in Aidan Walker's 'Identifying wood', a more modest effort which at least is modestly priced. Anyone really interested may be referred to R.Bruce Hoadley's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't try that at home","review":"A caution seems in order. Over the millennia many tools have been developed for working wood, but razors are not among them. Using a razor on a dense wood will result in \\"wood marks\\" on the razor, that is, in the best case. It can go horribly wrong.The only reasons that only \\"minor marks\\" can be seen here is that the haze of sanding marks and sanding dust overlies everything.On the positive side the book is well printed and bound, and of course wood is so beautiful that even the treatment doled out here can not obscure its beauty entirely. Somebody who never saw wood or does not own any proper woodworking tools may be impressed by this book. However such a person would do a lot better with the \\"Good Wood Handbook\\" by Jackson & Day (cheaper too!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"100 Woods : A Guide to Popular Timbers of the World","review":"I found this book most useful.

In Hill's treatment, three strikingly different, very beautiful and successful women meet in the GYN office and due to a power outage find themselves bonding and ultimately, agreeing to kill for each other.I must say I wasn't expecting much from Getting Hers (I have Ms. Hill's Rhythms, but never got through it), but I really enjoyed this book. Hill's refreshing approach kept me turning pages. That Vincent was in some form of law enforcement, positioned to get Tess wasn't a surprise.

I apply my face wash to my face first and then follow with the brush so that I don't lose much cleanser on the actual bristles themselves. It has helped to rejuvenate my overall skin health. A little bit of pressure works to exfoliate very well. With daily use, thus far, it has held up well and has not developed any unpleasant odors or mold/discoloration.

I've actually used a couple of the recordings to introduce people to there music, because the high-gloss production of Wasp Star and Apple Venus Vl.1 isn't to everyone's taste.

However, there are some wonderful moments here, in particular the title track, which just seethes with raw sensuality. One of the earlier reviewers made a disparaging comment about the predictability of the lyrics. I couldn't disagree more. I was jolted almost out of my car seat when I heard a woman sing so honestly and openly about sexual desire. And for the reviewer who said some of this song's lyrics could have been written by a 7th grader...you may be right. But remember--she's not talking about love, here. She's talking about sex...as a drug. And that subject does not call for the use of ethereal, metaphysical language. Down and dirty is the proper vehicle. And I, for one, love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first great make-out album of the new century","review":"\\"Car Wheels on a Gravel Road\\" is by all rights a masterpiece and arguably the best album released in the 90's.

But Lu's dreamy eroticism is more \\"in your face\\" here, and the album sonically evokes \\"Time Out of Mind.\\" Not a bad chalk mark to aim for, and her singing has never been better. Rookies may want to go elsewhere first (her eponymous one, \\"Car Wheels,\\" and \\"Sweet Old World\\"). But she continues to be one of the most satisfying musicians of our time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta Give it To Her","review":"I've never been much of a fan of Lucinda's and have always considered her work overrated, though I *have* enjoyed Emmylou's covers of some of her songs. But this time, I've gotta give it to her--this album is excellent, well-produced and well-conceived, and the voice rings true in both senses of the term."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Good As Car Wheels....","review":"My feeling about Lucinda's latest work is as follows:I love the choice of songs on Car Wheels but I believe the musician-ship on Essence is the best! I love this CD and it's mood. Bo Ramsey is so grand on this CD that I went out and bought his CD, Weeds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetry to Music","review":"Wow - I don't understand some of the weak reviews. Agreed - this isn't Car Wheels....but do you really want her to continue to crank out the same album repeatedly?This is not a \\"feel good\\" CD - rather a haunting one. Her song \\"Lonely Girls\\" has very few words - but paints a vivdly bleak picture. I shed a soft tear during the first listen because it was a zinger for someone I know. \\"Bus to Baton Rouge\\" puts me right in that oppressive house she describes. And \\"I Envy the Wind\\"....well, to me pure poetry.If you take the time to \\"feel\\" this CD - you will be greatly rewarded. This is a soul-stirring compilation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucinda has never sounded better","review":"Although some called Essence a let down after Car Wheels, this collection of songs seems to stand up over time much better than that album, which says a lot considering just how strong Car Wheels On a Gravel Road is.Production-wise, Essence is Lucinda Williams's most gorgeous record to date and the full range of her voice is finally recorded for the world to hear.These songs are \\"slow-burners\\" and get under your skin before you even realize it. Think of the way Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks delivered the re-arranged version of their song \\"Silver Springs\\" in 1997, and then imagine a whole cd of that level of songwriting.Highlights include the title track featuring rock's most under-rated singer Gary Louris (of The Jayhawks) on back up vocals.The best example of a sublime cd we had during 2001"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't let hype fool you....","review":"Yes! is my answer if I were to be asked what I thought about Lucinda's music. I wouldn't get too deep, because her music isn't that deep. But it throughly examines the shallows, in other words, it stops to smell the roses on an otherwise normal walk in the park. I'm not a fan of many artist, just because they are all human and will eventually show that they are...not so \\"god like\\". She's not so \\"god like\\" and knows it; makes you think she might just know what your feeling in those early mornings alone in bed staring at the ceiling."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"perhaps it's a bit unfair because lucinda engenders such high expectations, but i was really disappointed with this recordthe songwriting is weak, the singing is weak, and the arrangements are dullsomething kicked all the life out of the music--the songs are not all the same, but for some reason they all sound the same--and embarrassingly, you can sing most of them after one listen, they are so simplistic and cliched"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst album from someone who knows better","review":"This is without a doubt a terrible album.

Our girl has taken a left turn down a deadend street and it is not a pretty trip. There is not one song on this CD I care to hear again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Startlingly Bad","review":"Essence is such a weak, disappointing release that it is almost inconceivable that Lucinda Williams' loved ones and friends would have allowed it to be shipped. The absence of Steve Earle in the background is flashing like a big neon sign. The lyrics are manufactured from old issues of Southern Living and you can hear Ms Williams' trying to make her voice raspy and sad. Don't listen to this CD while driving; you immediately go to sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely Lucinda","review":"Great cd if you like Lucinda. It has some great slow songs (Reason to Cry and Lonely Girls) and some great driving (or cleaning the house) songs (Get Right with God.)You can't go wrong with Lucinda Williams.

I was happy to see that it didn't require 10 more years to hear new studio work from her. As a whole the album is as well composed and heart felt as anything else she's done, however Essence is discernibly different in it's studio minimalism (as opposed to a live quality). She is still wonderfully mournful and exposes a longing that is by now her moniker. However, this album comes off as intentionally bare rather than the stream of consciousness/acoustic sensation that her albums normally give off. This is not to say that it sounds contrived, but rather Essence is the result of lots of work and is trying something different (for her anyway). [Think Vespertine by Bjork]. As an album much more accessible than Car Wheels but misses the natural quality that is so enjoyable about seeing her live and in her self-titled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted: better production","review":"Essence really points out how important production is. Gone is the interesting instrumentation (accordians, mandolins, layers of guitar etc..)of her previous records. With the exception of a couple tracks, gone are the interesting male/female vocal harmonies. Even though these songs are her weakest batch so far, they could have been rescued with some interesting production in the vein of Car Wheels on a Gravel Road. She would have been wise to put these songs in the hands of a Steve Earle or Roy Brittan because they fall so flat on the energy front. It almost seems like she was too close to the project or was surrounded by people that weren't being honest with her. I bought it and will keep it, but I am disappointed that the bad taste of this record will linger until she redeems herself with more of the great work that we have come to expect from her. She should have released a live record to tide over the fans until these songs were ready."},{"rating":"1","title":"ESSENCE - Doesn't do it for me.","review":"I'm sorry - I've listened to this time and time again and I still don't think it's much to write home about.Lucinda fires up here and there but for the most part there is so much resignation in her voice that the whole effort leaves me flat.I get the feeling she's whipped this one out without much time or effort - it's so monotonous! Give me the narrative style of \\"CAR WHEELS\\" any day! If it took 5 years to finely craft that album, maybe ESSENCE needed more than it got."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sparcity has its limits","review":"I've been a fan of Lucinda Williams for as long as she's been recording, and I'm very disappointed in this album. It hits one emotional key and pace and then keeps repeating, repeating.Individual songs are sparce and have a certain melodious quality, but none really stand out from each other. The album would have been more exciting if she could have brought some variety to it. And some of her ultra pared down song lyrics seem to miss out on her lyric inventiveness that she's known for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I really liked \\"Car Wheels...\\" and this one just doesn't do it for me. I listened to it 3 or 4 times and just got more annoyed. Too simple-minded, downright depressing sometimes, and the production is contrived. I think she deserves to be in a more cohesive band setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks enough essence...","review":"In brief, I was disappointed in this album. My first exposure to Lucinda Williams was \\"Car Wheels on a Gravel Road\\", which I consider to be an outstanding piece filled with creativity, great guitar licks, and real feeling and emotion. This album seems to have been thrown together with leftover songs that lack complexity and polish. Somehow, she left me feeling that her essence was just not in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"..., I like this recording,,,","review":"Beautiful, haunting, moving, sexy, gritty, and ... good writing, playing and singing. Her best by far. \\"Essence\\" is just hot, and \\"Bus to Baton Rouge\\" is a heartbreak of the first order. Get a copy for the house and one for the truck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucinda straight up.","review":"Being a rather recent convert to the fine essence of Ms. Williams, I preordered this CD without hesitation having grooved to CWOAGR (real loud) many many times. Essence does not disappoint; from the soothing opening track Lonely Girls to the foot stomping Get Right w/God this CD is priceless. I could listen to Lucinda all day cuz her voice is singularly expressive and her writing is unparalled. \\"Nothing you say could ever make me take you back. Are down baby, down with that?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Orpheus Praised","review":"This album of haunting longing and beautiful melodies has that sad, often bittersweet flavor that Orpheus, its muse, inspires.Adult themes are handled masterfully for anyone who walks through this (backstage) door. Ms.Williams is at a peak of hermusical powers, & lets us in on many \\"secrets\\" of the bar/musical scene, loneliness & all. And with one of the more listenable, interesting voices around.Several tracks stand out for me--\\"I Envy the Wind\\" resonates w/ anyone who has ever longed for someone they'll never have. And a \\"..touch of \\"Blue\\", glistening..\\" is achingly appropriate for all of us at one time or another. \\"Essence\\" is gritty rock with gritty words--perhaps too up-close for some, but its lulling quality is hard to resist or deny.Ms. Williams has completely given herself to her muse, which merits a few listens--then if any of these tunes haunt you till you hear them again, don't blame Lucinda...blame Orpheus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music that cuts to the bone!","review":"Lucinda Williams never ceases to amaze me! 'Essence' goes in a totally new direction than her breakthrough 'Car Wheels On A Gravel Road', but is still an amazing CD. Instead of the picturesque Southern travelouge that wound through 'Car Wheels', on 'Essence', you get raw, stripped bare emotion.... from the sadness of 'Lonely Girls' to the longing of 'I Envy The Wind' to the overwhelming sexuality of 'Essence' (Real, human sexuality that Madonna only wishes she had), even to the medicine-show spirituality of 'Get Right With God', Lucinda's words and voice paint an unmatched emotional picture. I gave it four stars only to show my personal preference for 'Car Wheels'. It should be more like 4.98 stars. Anyone who likes personal songwriting and real emotions with their music needs this CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"essence of pretension","review":"the true grit of lucinda does not emanate from her new title \\"essence\\". considering she took umteen years to release \\"car wheels...\\" maybe she should have taken more time with this one.

The film gives a very nice overview of all of the major guns from the beginning of the war until the end. It includes operational coverage of the guns on all fronts. The narration is clear and the background sounds are OK although I am pretty sure the sounds are dubbed and not authentic. The video itself is very good. It includes some very rare footage including the only video I have ever seen of a Bison.

I've read and taught the Tarot for over 20 years, using various decks, but usually going back to the RWD for its accurate and rich symbolism. The deck was given to me without any paperwork to explain the meanings, so I read entirely from intuition, allowing the artwork to stimulate me. It is proving to allow me to provide very accurate and insightful readings. This is probably not a good deck for beginners simply because of the lack of descriptive pictures for the pip cards. It is very beautiful and evocative. I would recommend seeing it before purchasing, unless, like me, you like collecting decks even if you know you may never want to use them regularly. Every person is unique and what speaks to one person, may leave another cold. It's very personal, especially for tools of divination.

The rumble feature only works when you get hit, and the \\"anolog\\" feature means they just made the joystick work. I still use the D-Pad since that is what the controls were originally made for. They also took out the way to become invincible, that PVC vest. The game is still pretty easy, though. The dumb thing is you have to beat the game in Hard mode to get Easy mode.

After faithfully using my first jar daily, my neck and chin show more definition and tightness. Since continuing to use it for the last six months there is a significant difference in the definition of my jaw line compared to my friends who aren't using the cream. How do I know?

Fleur Leigh ages from 10 to 12 in the course of the book. She is a Hollywood child, the daughter of Charmian Leigh, a radio star trying to get into TV, and Maurice Leigh, a game show producer. The 9 chapters of the book(it takes place in the 1950's) are organized roughly around Fleur's nannies, who don't last long. Charmian Leigh, the mom, is a wonderful creation. Selfish, ambitious, histrionic, full of bad ideas, she is reminiscent of some of Dickens' meaner characters. The book is funny, but Fleur's search for affection and kindness is very serious. Constantine, the gardener provides kindness but his employment is always in jeopardy due to Charmian's jealousy. So the book is funny- the wealthy in Hollywoood funny- but also our affection for Fleur makes it affecting as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnifique!","review":"What a magnifique story!

It isn't badly written, so perhaps I should include a disclaimer. I do not ordinarily enjoy fictional books about children who have miserable childhoods, although I have occasionally found stories in that category which rise above the implicit drawback of being voyeur to a child's pervasive unhappiness.This book isn't one of them. It isn't very funny, for something that is supposed to be a \\"gentle comedy\\", and there is no one in the story, besides Fleur, who isn't either tranparently loathesome or impliedly perverse. Even the good guys in Fleur's life, like Constantine and her grandmother, are lacking. Constantine had all the earmarks of a pedophile, and her grandmother abandons her, rather than reach some sort of compromise with her own son.What an unpleasant and ultimately disappointing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"In my opinion this book is pretty much a waste of time, being a very rambling, often unlikely, quite amateurish (throw in lotsa description) series of pages.

I guess you have to be a gay Columbian in New York to appreciate this book. Save for the donkey beastiality in Chapter one, and his weird dance with incestuous voyeurism as a kid, I can't see how this book was ever published. The last chapter was rushed, the wrapping up of the plot holes were really predictible and 'too good to be true'. Throughout the book all the characters were not very developed, you have a feeling of superficial brushing off of them by the author. I was more interested in the Columbian foods that weren't explained very much.

The fact and circumstances of Newton's mental collapse of 1693 give him possibility to discern the vacuity of his personal psychological hellhole and urge him into interlacing of real and fictitious love affairs that lead through nothingness to rudiments of new hope and understanding.The language of the book, its pseudo-Gothic shades of mystery and psychological descriptions of the heroes are excellent.

(Personally, I'd get comfortable with the Syriac script by going through \\"Classical Aramaic\\", then - definitely! - work through Thackston's \\"Introduction to Syriac\\".)This is not to take anything away from Muraoka's book. But I don't see it as a book for absolute beginners. The breakdown is about as follows:introduction to the sounds / script - 16 pagesgrammar - about 50 pagessyntax - 30 pagesshort section of exercises, plus a key - 10 pagesparadigms - 18 pagesbibliography - 24 pagesannotated readings - 60 pagesglossary - 25 pagesA knowledge of another Semitic language is helpful.If you're interested in learning Syriac, buy Professor Thackston's \\"Introduction to Syriac\\". And when you're done, if you want to learn more grammar, and get some more practice in reading Syriac, buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good first reference grammar","review":"As the previous reviewer says, this is not for the beginner unless he or she is already familiar with other Semitic languages. The Hebrew scholar might consider starting with Muraoka's Classical Syriac for Hebraists (which I've not used, mind). But this is a good basic reference grammar, with the advantage that it uses Eastern vocalisation, which is rather subtler than Western and throws new light on words you thought you knew well. The print is admirably clear, and transcription is provided too. Best of all is the bibliography by Sebastian Brock, which gives a good idea of what Syriac literature is actually available in print.

Save yourself the trouble and get a better one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much sliding, but otherwise fine","review":"I do have sweaty hands, so maybe there is no yoga mat that will work for me, but I slide even in the beginning with my first downward dog. Though the mat was new, plenty of cushion, the smell was not overwhelming, but I have only used it once because it is absolutely useless to slide around like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"So I purchased this mat for going to yoga with and it's just not pratical. I find the thickness to be too much (although I won't knock it too much for that as it is described as Extra Thick) making it heavy. But an even bigger problem with this mat is that there is next to no grip with this at all making most yoga positions impossible to safely pull off. Really useless as a yoga mat however it's making a great padding under our carpet and could be used for other things, just not yoga."},{"rating":"1","title":":-(","review":"I really like the thickness of the mat.

The color is right on and the price was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice mat, a little slippery","review":"This mat seems pretty nice... it's think enough that my back doesn't hurt by the end of class like with the thinner mats. I bought one of the cheaper colors (dark lavender), and it's nice, though slightly more pink than I was hoping for. The only complaint I have is with slipperyness... I was sliding out of downward dog, but I'm hoping that will fade with time; I have only used it for one class so far. The smell is not bad. It's a little bit rubbery smelling at first, but I laid it open for one day, and now its unnoticable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Slippery Mat","review":"My boyfriend purchased this mat for me as a Valentine's present last month. I was so excited to have a thicker mat. First off, I've never had a problem with sweaty feet or hands. This mat was horrible.

It is thick and \\"plush\\" as mats go, but it's not sticky at ALL - I can't do down dog and be comfortable in the studio. This means it's nearly, well, useles... I can use it for home practice, where I can control the temp and number of layers I'm wearing, but otherwise, definitely spring for an extra $30 and get a Jade or something similar.

I started to notice the mat was absorbing sweat. I would clean with a diluted solution of witch hazel & place the mat on a chair in the sun daily to dry out. Now 2 months later I have to soak up the sweat with a dry towel before drying in the sun and the mat smells funky. If you are NOT practicing yoga in a heated room, you will love this mat. But if you ARE practicing in a heated room pick another mat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stable mat, gets me through Ashtanga","review":"I'm 5'4\\", so this mat's length is more than adequate. It has perfect cushion for my sensitive knees. I do not find it to be overly slippery -- slipping in poses like Downward Dog is, I've learned the hard way, largely due to not exerting enough force with one's hands: you really have to press the index finger and thumb, and force your weight up and back. That said, I've got really sweaty hands, so I did also buy one of those Manduka hand towels to place at the top of my mat -- that has helped considerably. I primarily practice Ashtanga and this mat has not failed me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a different brand!","review":"This mat began to \\"shed\\" after five minutes of use.

I mean, there isn't much of a difference between one yoga mat and the next, but this one was a pretty bad one to buy. I've used it 5 times now and all I do is slip on it.

Got that Slate Blue crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mat","review":"I use this mat during my p90x routine for abs, yoga, and stretching.

I have only used it twice, and I do agree with others that it is somewhat slippery, but it hasn't caused me any harm. I haven't washed it yet, so that may help. As far as 1/4 inch mats go, this is a good thickness, I just wish that it was easier to find even thicker ones for a decent price. I really like the color and how long it is, and most of the research I did before purchasing this indicated that this was the best mat in this price range, so I think it was a good purchase. I use it about two or three times a week, and will update if it gets significantly better or worse over time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mat is too thin for most exercises","review":"The mat is sticky enough to stick on the ground, but it is way too thin.

Again if you sweat a lot this is a main concernRight length and width. Enough for your own comfort and small to fit inside an apartmentI have found all this concerns resolved in this yoga mat (that's why I give it a 5 stars).And last but not least, the price is just right. It beats me how a single piece of synthetic foam could cost up to 80 bucks... I've just paid $16 for this \\"single piece of synthetic foam\\" and I'm really happy with it.Totally recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The smell goes away--after a while","review":"I, too, had issues with the smell of the mat when I first got it. I purchased 2 mats--one for me and one for hubby--and had to air them out for well over two weeks. They must be unrolled to allow them to fully air out. I imagine if I had washed it off it might have happened more quickly.That being said--once the smell dissipates--its a great mat with the extra padding that I now need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, not great","review":"This was my first bought yoga mat. I've tried a variety that the studio provides so I have to say that this is a very standard yoga mat. It's good and does the job, but the surface irks me a bit, because when I sweat, the surface gets a little slimy. Maybe over time though and through usage, this film will wear off and it will leave it a bit more matte. I gave it four stars though, because everything else is good and fine with this mat. It stays where it's supposed to and resists bunching up. I've tried an ideal one at the studio, just wish I could match it. I will probably shop around town next time so that I can try a bunch of different mats out, but this one will be more than fine for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great but ..","review":"Seemed like a decent mat - however I ordered RED and the company shipped a PINK mat with an inventory tag that said RED.

All your focus will be on just trying to keep your hands and feet in place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped in the washing machine","review":"When the mat arrived, I decided to wash it before using it. Their website said that it was machine washable, so I put it in my machine on the gentle cycle. Unfortunately, when I went to take it out, there was a long, shallow rip in one side of the mat. I've never had any problems with my washing machine ripping things in the past, so I'm pretty disappointed about this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falling apart!!!","review":"Very thick mat. However, I have been using the Jillian Michael's Dvd's and I have used this mat for 4 weeks and there are holes wearing in the mat from repeated use. This mat is not very durable!

I do not recommend this item...I guess you get what you pay for!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slippery Situation","review":"I wanted so badly to like this yoga mat. However, it worked better as the family slip and slide.

Too slick to handle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"YogaAccessories Mat","review":"I haven't had this yoga mat long but so far its a really nice yoga mat.

I haven't noticed the smell that prevous reviewers have complained about. Its quite a bit heavier than my previous yoga mat but the weight is worth the thickness of the mat.

I also appreciate that it is Phthalate Free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mat","review":"I heard about the odor that is imbedded into the mat, and that can be easily fixed by airing it out. I didn't even need to shower it down. Another note, the mat is slippery especially for yoga. I think I'm nit picking, but they cut the mat a little off. Meaning there are patterns/texture on the mat that signals a straight line, and it was cut slightly off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird slippery substance on the mat!","review":"I read the reviews that said this was a slippery mat. Having never purchased a new yoga mat I wasn't quite sure what they meant by all the slipping. They were right. I went to my yoga class sporting my super cute mat only to slip and slide in almost every position. My hands felt like a sticky slippery substance was on them, almost like they were sweating (which they never do).

It's awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect first yoga mat!","review":"I bought this for my first official yoga class and I really love it. The class I am taking is made up of 99% beginners and compared to the yoga mats they purchased, I am very happy with this mat. Some other mats were much thinner or had seemingly 'calming' designs on them that were kind of distracting to me for some reason.I chose the Jasmine Green color and I really like how vibrant the color is. The mat is a bit cumbersome, but I can fold it in half hotdog style and then roll it up to fit the mat in a backpack for easier carry. Stored at home, I just have it rolled up in the corner with some other work out equipment.While there was no smell when I got the mat, I have spot cleaned this mat with a damp cloth and some lemon juice after a class or home use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extra Padding makes a difference","review":"Padding on this really helps my yoga sessiona.

I have used maybe 5-10 different yoga mats in my practice, and this is the first time I've had this problem. I do not recommend this mat unless you are only using it for padding. I need to purchase a new mat, or figure out some way to make this one less slippery, because it is unusable as is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Yoga Mat","review":"This mat is the perfect size and thickness.

They've worked perfectly.These mats are extra long, so more of your body can be on the mat. They're very thick with dense cushioning, which is great for your wrists during tough Yoga moves and back during ab moves. They're durable and will clearly last a long time. The grip is great without being too tacky, so you don't feel like your hands are sliding during downward dog.We don't have theManduka BlackMatPRO 71-Inch Yoga and Pilates Matto compare this mat to (the Manduka mat is the \\"price is no object\\" Rolls Royce of Yoga mats), but given the immense price difference, this mat will do for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so sticky mat","review":"Just got it recently.

Stay away from this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slippery","review":"This mat is extra cushion-y and forgiving on the knees but it was very slippery. Doing downward dog was an exercise in futility as my feet and hands would just steadily slide out of position. I ended up buying a mat from Lulu Lemon.

This mat just sits in the corner now, lookin' sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great mat for an affordable price","review":"I bought this mat when I wanted to start P90X and I am 100% satisfied with my purchase. From the reviews, I noticed that some people had some issues with the bad smell coming out of the mat but I did not have such problem. I can say the mat is almost odorless. I was about to be lured into buying a mat with similar specifications which would cost me around 90 bucks but I am so happy I came across this one and I ended up buying it. By the way, the ultra thickness does make a big difference.

The extra thickness is definitely appreciated when on hardwood floors, and as a taller guy, so is the extra length. Keep in mind that the rolled up mat will be thicker, so it may not fit in your yoga bag.

Most yoga positions I did had an added level of difficulty with my hands and feet slipping the entire time. I have never had hands and feet that were overly sweaty but this mat makes them that way. I haven't noticed any funny smell like some of the other reviewers. I gave 2 stars because I do like the extra thickness which provides added padding.

I used it twice since purchasing and was so frustrated by how much my hands and feet were slipping that it really disrupted my practice. After class the second time I asked the instructor if there was anything I could do, and she said that she used to have a mat like this and that the only thing she could do was buy a yogitoes mat to keep from slipping. I should have spent an extra $20 on a nicer mat in the first place as opposed to having to purchase an additional item.

It is true that it can be a bit slippery when 1st purchased.

The mat did its job, was decently slipper, but I had my towel set up, so it never caused any problems. I just lost my last mat, so decided to buy something on amazon to replace it.When I purchased this mat, I noticed there were a LOT of reviews saying this mat was very slippery. I figured it couldn't be worse than my older mat, so I gave it a go. Let me tell you, this mat is VERY slippery! I couldn't believe how much my feet would slide on this thing when they went off my towel, it almost seemed slightly dangerous.But with that said, I have my towel, I'm just the average yoga goer, so I don't need anything crazy.This mat does its job, and for $20 I can't complain. My next purchase however will probably be a more expensive mat, to see what all the rave is about with these \\"non sticky\\" mats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better weed eater","review":"OK, so it takes a little manual labor, but for the quietness of this tool, it makes it all worth while. I don't suppose many folks use the scythe anymore, but if you have a pretty large area of overgrowth and you want to take it down quickly and quietly, this is the tool. Each swing takes out a huge area at a time and in terms of speed, it beats a weedeater, hands down! Once you get a rhythym going, it's actually kind of nice to use. Get a shot of exercise and accomplish something while doing it. The blade and handle will run you around $100.00, but it is worth every penny.

Anyway I strongly recomend that you do not buy this album...well unless you have trouble sleeping at night then maybe you might want to get it because it will bore you to sleep after about the second song.

I have the last CD she made and I loved it. I am a Missouri born bluegrass lover and play the banjo some. I live in Pennsylvania now but hear and know a lot of bluegrass pickers. I went out this weekend and found this new CD. I paid more money than usual and would be glad to do it again. This album is one of the best I have ever heard. There is not a song on there that you want to skip over. The music is just outstanding. All instruments are superb. I have played it for 3 days continuously. The song about Bill Monroe is the only song I have heard that really does him justice. He would be proud to hear it. Rhonda and the Rage are true blugrass and I honestly believe this will be the album of the year. It's just the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voice trumps all!","review":"Like many people in the last few years, I suspect, my knowledge of bluegrass music starts and pretty much ends with the soundtrack of O Brother Where Art Thou, so I don't pretend to have any insight to add to the country v. bluegrass debate. But I'm not deaf, and I sure recognize talent when a startling voice like Vincent's shakes up my bones and gets the juices flowing immediately. I first heard \\"Driving Nails in My Coffin\\" on car radio during a long roadtrip, and nearly drove off the road trying to write down her name. Vincent is a perfect example of the rule that substance always trumps form, whether it's art, music, or literature. I don't really care what you call this type of music. Vincent has a voice that transcends genre or style. Whatever it is, I can't wait to hear more of it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rhonda Rocks!","review":"I am a new fan of Rhonda, and boy am I glad I found her! I have always enjoyed Bluegrass, but something was missing in the vocals for me. Rhonda has the right tones and emotion for Bluegrass!

The emotions were so present, that this album becomes more alive each time I play it.If you enjoy great music and great harmonies, this is the album to buy! The picking is the best of the best, and the vocals are to cry for! Rage on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Star follow-up for Back Home Again!","review":"Rhonda surely outshines herself with her lastest effort 'The Storm Still Rages'. This fantastic album released in June 2001 is another collection of pure bluegrass. Rhonda begins the album with another catchy tune, Cry Of The Whipporwill, which Rhonda also opens her shows with. Rhonda covers several Osborne Brothers songs on the album, with my favorite being 'Bluegrass Express' which will have you singin along instantly! Other standout tracks include Rhonda's cover of gospel songwriter Carl Story's 'You Dont Love God If You Dont Love Your Neighbor' which I think is one of the best written songs ever! Also Rhonda does a fantastic cover of her mentor Dolly Parton and Porter Wagoner's hit 'Just Someone I Used To Know'. Rhonda, now sponsored by the Martha White company, closes this album with a cover of the Martha White theme, originally done by Flatt & Scruggs.

The message is soothing and spiritually uplifting. By sharing examples of the meditation exercises that she practices and teaches, you are given a rare opportunity to become more connected to your inner self. Through her extensive knowledge and wisdom of such subjects as reincarnation, kabbalah and angels, you will learn just how vibrant and relevant Judaism is in the 21st Century - the \\"New Age\\". Mindy is the rare author that combines scholarship with first hand experience. She not only knows of what she writes, but will inspire you with all that living a faith based life can be. Suddenly, your own concept of a Jewish life has a beautiful, expansive new way to be expressed. She is truly a spiritual guide, and as you travel with her in this wonderful book, you will most certainly feel God's presence leading the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want a lesson on Jewish Morality...","review":"The only reason I gave this book 2 stars was because the meditations were good. However, for the author to start drawing moral and philosophical conclusions based on circular questions is ridiculous. For the most part the book is filled with the same nonsense you may find in any book on Judaism. If you believe it, great, if not, reading this book will certainly subject you to it. It is a poor attempt of legitimacy for various biblical phrases and 'ancient texts' (that were by most scholarly accounts written 1,000 years ago) through bad proofs, and decent meditative experiences - although whether the origin of some is judaic or not is questionable. This book is comparable to any other occidental religion trying to 'adjust' to a new paradigm, regardless of how many times the author cries otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Must Read\\" for hunters, hikers and outdoor folks","review":"I found the book hard to put down.

I wasn't sure about doing yoga, since I haven't done it before, but I tried this and I'm glad I did. The instructor, Rocki, seems to really know what she's doing and gives different adjustments depending on how flexible you are and how far along you are. That's really saved me since I'm not very flexible. I like all the different poses and the breathing really helps - it especially helped me in the first trimester when I was nauseous all the time. I'm not sure how I can have more energy after working out, but I do with this DVD. I LOVE the meditation at the end. I think Rocki's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific! Couldn't get by without it!","review":"This tape is great! I'm so glad I found it. Every time I use it it makes me feel better. The stretches are nice and slow, the poses are a challenge but not so difficult I can't do them and it feels like this instructor really knows what she's talking about. I like the different options she gives, depending on what you're capable of doing. It feels like a work-out, but also makes me feel energized (how is that possible?). I love the meditation on the baby at the end, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes me feel great!","review":"This will be my third baby and I wish I'd had this video for my other two.

I try to do it in the morning and I feel good all day."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much talking by Rocki, cheesy video","review":"this video has high hopes, but Rocki never quits talking and is so cheesy and annoying, she reminds me of Denise Austin as a wannabe video star, she annoys me to the bone. The moves can be intense. but you have to work too hard to overcome the instruction flaws and poor music. I will be trading this one away."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I don't care for this video. Most of the time is spent either listening to Rocki talk or doing kegel exercises, which I can do in the car. There are a few good poses, but it's not enough. I switched back to the yoga tape I was doing before I got pregnant, and I've found my back and hip pains have gone away."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I am not a yoga expert but I have been doing it sporadically for about a year. I already had Shiva Rea's video when I got this and the difference is huge. Shiva has models in each trimester showing the specific modifications you need to make, and she not only shows but tells you how to do them. Everything flows and it's very relaxing. Rocki has lots of variously pregnant women who appear to be doing pretty much the same thing, and her suggestion for modification is \\"do what you feel is comfortable,\\" which is fine, but not very concrete. I was uncomfortable that she demonstrated downward dog without modifications, since I have heard that your head shouldn't go beneath your waist. I found the repeated kegels boring- a few are fine, but it seemed like half her program focused on kegels. And the leg lifts were not relaxing. She goes too fast and practically counts cadence. I look for stretching and relaxation from yoga and this did not fit the bill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tuned in to myself and my baby","review":"I really enjoy this video. I find it to be as challenging and relaxing as you make it. The more I do it, the more I'm able to deepen my stretching and my breathing. The poses are pretty easy to follow and the instructor is very soothing. I am 7 months pregnant and have been doing the video on and off for about 4 months now. There are 5 other pregnant ladies to follow, so you can adjust the poses as necessary to remain comfortable. I like the way I feel when I'm done - I feel tuned in to myself and my baby. This tape works for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More frustration than relaxation","review":"If you have never taken yoga before, this is not the video for you. When I found out I was pregnant, I wanted to find an exercise program that I could work around my schedule, and a yoga video seemed to be the perfect fit. However, I found that this video did not give me enough warm up time, nor were the positions explained enough for my non-experienced need. The video moves very quickly, and I found that I was more frustrated than relaxed in trying to keep up. It would have also been helpful to know that I would need a padded mat, foam block and extra blanket for props. The box states that it is \\"appropriate for any stage of pregnancy & all fitness levels\\", but should add that it is helpful if you have participated in a yoga class before viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"best yoga workout ever","review":"I love this tape! I've been doing it since my first trimester and I always feel better the days I work out with it. The breathing makes me feel good and I especially loved the meditation at the end.

I don't know what I'd do without it !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I found this video disappointing. If you have bad knees, it is probably not a good idea to use this video because it involves sitting on your bent knees for long periods (painful!).

Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"very weak, lacks substance, other videos are better","review":"I don't care for this video at all. Rocki talks too mcuh and she is constantly kegel exercises, which is not much of a workout. Some of the moves are ok, but it's a rather boring routine. Leisa Hart's FITMAMA is so much better and well worth it, this tape of Rocki's is not a tape I recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prenatal Yoga","review":"I purchased this tape along with Shiva Rea's and I tried it only once in my fourth month of pregnancy. I was fit and regularly incorporated yoga into my fitness routine before pregnancy. This tape has, in my opinion, the potential to lead to injury in at least some women. Poses are not fluid, as they are in Rea's program, and many are sustained excessively long. Despite following several of her modifications, I still managed to irritate a number of ligaments while performing her routine. As a result of my experience, I decided not to use the tape again and have relied on the Shiva Rea tape for pre-natal yoga."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheesy and too easy","review":"I hadn't tried yoga before I got pregnant so I thought that I'd try a yoga pregnancy video, just to see what it was all about. I was very dissapointed. Most of the video seems to be of Rocki using an overly-soothing voice talking of how to bond with your baby. Too many cheesy phrases of nourishing your baby... During this, the excersised are very easy, I'm in fair condition, and wanted to get a video that would help keep the extra weight gain off (I gained a few too many lbs. during my first pregnancy). I don't think I made it through one session without yawning. I was hoping for some good excersises after looking at so many good reviews. There are some fair leg excercises at the end which is the only part I can stand to play. I'll probably try to sell it on ebay instead. Very dissapointed, I plan to try one more yoga pregnancy dvd, hope it's not so easy and cheesy."},{"rating":"1","title":"too yoga'ish, not for beginners who anyone new to yoga","review":"i really was frustrated watching and trying to do this video. I have attempted yoga in the past, and sometimes really like it, but this video was too much for me, way off the beaten path. Rocki seemed nice, but doesn't appear to be a solid instructor, i liked my FitMama video alot more, and was happier with it. This video was overbearing and too much yoga'ish stuff for most people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly NOT recommended","review":"I am an avid yoga enthusiast and was in great shape when I learned I was pregnant, so it was important to continue with my active lifestyle and incorporate prenatal yoga as part of my reportoire. I was sorely dissipaonted in this video in my 1st trimester becuase it was WAY too easy and lacked any traditional yoga conditioning. I recently came back to it 1 week before my due date (I suddenly craved a change!) and was even MORE disapointed because the movement actually hurt me! She puts far too much emphasis on child's pose which is terribly uncomfortable in the late stages of your pregnancy AND she has you rotate your hips/belly while on all fours which is against ALL of gravity's rules. I was laid up for 3 days thanks to just 1/2 hour of this video. Worst part is I KNEW BETTER!!!

As others have noted, you can only remove a row or two at a time - and only if the row of kernels is straight. If the row isn't straight, the \\"zipper\\" snags. It's also difficult to use because the ear of corn is hot and it's painful to grip the ear and work the zipper. Instead, I'd recommend the \\"corn cob cutter slicer stripper knife.\\" While it isn't perfect, it gets the job done better than with a knife, and without sending part of your dinner all over the table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corn Zipper","review":"It was difficult to use and overpriced.

It did not work.It was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break!","review":"Well built, but a worthless design. The cutting area of the tool is too narrow and not deep enough to do a satisfactory job. It tends to cut 1 1/2 rows of corn kernels if the kernels are of large size. There are other corn cutters available that do a much better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corn Zipper Gets Stuck","review":"I had better luck using a steak knife. I had corn flying all over the kitchen and not in the bowl. This device does not cut deep into the kernels, but drags and leaves a considerable amount of corn still on the cob, therefore, you have to retrace your path. It's more work that I bargained for and not really worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corn Zipper","review":"Although the corn zipper works well, it only removes 2 rows of kernels at a time. We find using a knife much easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort","review":"We had high hopes for this little device. My in-laws grow and freeze a ton of corn each year and wanted a better way of getting the corn from the cobs. It cuts only one or two rows at a time and was extremely messy to use. Using a good old-fashion knife worked much better and didn't cause a huge mess. Sorry to say but this little device just isn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corn stripper","review":"Very disappointing. Shaving the corn was tricky, difficult and time consuming. Sometimes to close and took too much of the husk and sometimes too little of the kernals. Better off just flossing your teeth after eating. The stripper is now just taking up room in a kitchen drawer."},{"rating":"1","title":"MESSY!","review":"This utensil is, unfortunately, a waste of money. Removing corn, two rows at a time is far too time consuming. Just use a paring knife for better results. Also, the kernels seem to self-launch resulting in a corn covered counter - what a mess!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I use raw corn in many of my salads and I looked forward to having a handy device to strip the kernels off the cob. What a disappointment this gadget is! It absolutely mangles the kernels. I'm back to using a knife, which at least produces whole kernels, rather than tearing them up or squashing them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, but doesn't give you whole kernels","review":"This stripper is well-made with heavy stainless steel and a very sharp blade that takes off two rows of kernels at a time. Once you get the hang of it, you can strip corn off the cob very quickly.However, there's a few gotchas:1) You can't align the blade with the rows of kernels, so you wind up splitting half of them in, well, half.2) Depth is fixed, but if you don't hold it tightly to the corn, you'll leave good stuff behind. Also, the last pass tends to cut deep since there are no kernels left to ride on.3) Often the corn kernels will stay put on the cob, even though they've been cut. Just shove the row off the cob with a corner of the tool.I wind up going back with a bird's beak parer to get the last bits of corn, but this beats using the paring knife for the entire process. The split kernels are fine for the corn puddings, etc, that I'm typically making when I use this little gadget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corn RIpper! :)","review":"This is one of the most practical tools for anyone who does not like to eat corn-on-the-cob.

Thank You!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works, mostly","review":"I want to love this product but it's not perfect. However, it's still better than any other way I have found.Very well made (as are all Kuhn-Rikon products) in hefty stainless, with very sharp blades. The blade is about two-kernels wide and strips two rows per stroke. Which is ok, but of course, the varying widths of a kernel guarantees you are slicing through kernels much of the time. Still, beats a knife which always slashes kernels open with every stroke.Best feature: You can generally get it to remove the kernel without leaving much behind or snagging some cob. This is fairly easy to do but not without some struggle to keep it from hanging up mid-stroke.Someday, someone will think of a way to strip kernels off cleanly and wholly. Until then, this is the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knife still works better!!","review":"I tried the corn zipper and think that an old fashioned knife still works better. With the Corn Zipper it only cuts one row of corn and a knife you are able to one whole side of the cob and can do it in half the time. Didn't work for me Sorry!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works - slowly - but works!","review":"The Corn Zipper works great - really great - the only negative is the small amount of corn it removes at one time. (1-2 rows) I will still use it because for some reason I make a lot less mess than when I use a knife. I'd be really excited if they'd make a wider one and I'm sure they will - give 'em time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Try it...you'll like it!","review":"Nice item! And it really works.

Excellent Story!!!","review":"James Byron Huggins is one of, if not my top, favorite authors. His stories are masterfully told with a prose that challenges the reader to think and maintain an educational thought of the story in the reader's minds- eye. His writing is beautifully done to weave an intricate story, captivating the imagination of any reader.This book deals with Nephilim, one of my favorite topics, and ties in biblical characters and stories to form a modern-day adventure.Even if you have never read any work by Mr. Huggins, (which, if that is the case, you are missing out!) but you like action/adventure/science fiction stories about monsters and demons, this book is for you.I anxiously anticipate any more great work that comes from this author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Roller Coaster Ride!","review":"Huggins takes the reader on a breathtaking adventure right from the get-go. All the elements are there for great suspense: Victims trapped in an ancient monastery, threatened by a mysterious and powerful creature that isn't supposed to exist.

You may not be able to put it down before the final page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps you up all night","review":"This was so good, it kept me up all night. Scary and suspensful you really feel the creature creeping up on you, and forces you to examine if there could be a monster under the bed. He is a master at the good vs evil plot line, incredible fight scenes and plenty of action. This is a fast paced page turner. I think this will make a wonderful movie if handled correctly. The hero was sympathetic and I really appreciated the spiritual theme. I would recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah Huggins Does It Again Alright!!!!","review":"I can see how pratically a new reader of James Byron Huggins would love this book and think of it as awesome, but after you read his novels the plots are so predictable. Hey huggins, come out with some new ideas please. Any one reading this review I suggest you read either Cain or Rora, both which are masterpieces of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for Huggins fans","review":"This is James Byron Huggins' worse book. If you're a Huggins fan, then buy it. However, if you are not, try reading some of his other books such as Cain, Hunter (perhaps his best) or the Reckoning.

But The Gravity of Sunlight is not about politics or Africa. It is about Agnes. About her unfulfilling marriage.

This book is about Agnes, not the apotheosis of Africans, and the Africans whom Agnes does meet are in no way \\"demonized.\\" Sadly, this critic's predilection to see racism will distort anything he reads.

There is a lot of babble about love, but I never knew what anyone meant by it, and the sex scenes struck me as sentimental and fraudulent - unfelt. Children are used as accessories.A really smug performance.

In a year that gave us such albums as Michael Jackson's Off the Wall and The Cure's Three Imaginary Boys, one album stood out from the rest. And that album would be Unknown Pleasures by Joy Division. No other debut album can do what this album did. With Bernard Sumner's guitar crunch, Peter Hook's throbbing basslines, Stephen Morris's on point drumming, and Ian Curtis's baritone voice and dark bleak lyrics, Unknown Pleasures is perfect from start to finish. With tracks such as \\"She's Lost Control\\", \\"Shadowplay\\", \\"Day of the Lords\\", and \\"New Dawn Fades\\", Joy Division took the punk sound and added in darker emotions.

I saw hundreds of 5 star reviews and bought this expecting all this musical genius but it literally just sounds like 4 british guys banging away at their instruments in a garage...Is that the point of this? No, really I want to know. I was expecting something powerful and layered and wonderful after the reviews I read but all 10 songs sound the same and Ian Curtis's singing is totally depressing.And message to critics, just because an album is minimalist and bleak does not make it \\"a classic!\\". The album cover is the only thing I liked about this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Infinite","review":"This recording never grows old. It was the beginning of so much and unlike other bands who started movements and became outdated, this is still a great listen and remains interesting so many years after its initial release."},{"rating":"2","title":"abstract, austere, stunningly original","review":"Unknown Pleasures is the musical equivalent of a near-death experience: it terrifies you in the beginning but by the time you regain conciousness, you emerge with a bit more insight into the other side. I've never heard music more remarkable. Each song sounds like an excercise in madness, they could all collapse at any moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"The sound of music","review":"This was the first CD released under the name of Joy Division (the Warsaw recordings were more basic rock songs, but also very good). Unknown Pleasures is a brilliant, confusing album. Should you dance? Should you cry? Should you just shut up and listen to the lyrics? I've tried a combination of these three and it worked. I would have given this album more stars, but there's definitely one included for the album cover (I bought a T-shirt with this drawing on it, something I normally wouldn't do, just because of it's sheer beauty). Somewhat less dramatic than Closer, but nearly as perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"So I read online complaints about this Rhino 180 gram vinyl record being defective. I thought it was just some unlucky buyer until I bought two brand new copies of this LP (from two different sellers) and they were BOTH DEFECTIVE and in the same way: there was a dent across the vinyl from the record press. When you play the record, you hear a tearing noise every 4 seconds or so. I tried to contact Rhino about it but they never replied to my e-mail or my phone calls. I've heard that not all copies are damaged; maybe you'll get lucky."},{"rating":"2","title":"innovative pioneers","review":"highly influental and can never be compared to. so many artists try to cover their songs and all seem to fail miserably to grasp the sound, especially all the electronic artists. give it up!! get off your computer and play some instruments if you want to cover a band like joy division!am i the only one that notices that amazon has the track list wrong? or did the band change the titles at one point?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It worked, but was a pain","review":"I bought this cable from the seller \\"JUNRED\\" that claimed their cable was better than the Eforcity Cable.

They bring a fresh perspective to the genre that retains its old dance music roots but adds a dimension that makes for excellent listening. Perhaps it is their energy and intensity that makes them singular; perhaps it is their passion and the beauty they imbue their music with. It certainly has something to do with their sometimes nontraditional bass lines that drive the music and the harmonic structure that gives it depth; the music is always intriguing and engaging! It is a combination of these things that makes Lunasa the best. You must listen to this group if you are a fan of Leahy, Altan, Natalie McMaster, and other groups that produce fine instrumental music rooted in celtic tradition - Lunasa blows the rest away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celtic music at its best!","review":"The first time I heard Lunasa was around St. Patrick's Day; my dad bought tickets to see them. Almost instantly, I was caught up in the rich harmonies coming from the stage. The music can fill you with such feeling. It sends messages: about sadness, happiness, or just having fun! Songs such as Inion Ni Scannlain is beautiful; it lifts you up. And Morning Nightcap is quite a toe-tapper! These musicians truly know how to play good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with its manufacturer origin....","review":"My mug for 8 years has recently broken, and I wanted to buy a new mug to replace the broken one.

I was disappointed.... I wish there is a way for me to find out where the mug was made in before I purchased it.I would give this item 1-star, but since the design of this mug is nice looking, I decided to give it a 2-star.Now this mug is just sitting on my desk as a pens/pencils holder..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Party-Full of Fun","review":"I saw this movie twice while it was in the theater and loved it both times. The filmmakers take the enclosed area of a sex shop on Christmas Eve and proceed to create a world of characters that extends far beyond your expectations. The style of the film is - self-consciously - like Clerks, but don't be fooled into thinking this is a mere rerun. This movie is unique, and sports a combination of personal histories, mysteries, cameos, as well as musical numbers that will beg you to sing along. This is, hands-down, one of the most unashamedly fun movies I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Elegy to Alcoholism","review":"While I very much appreciate the review already on this site, I cannot give credit to this film that statement entails. Two very talented actors, one very flat, selfish and deluded poem. It could be titled: \\"How I Met My Ex and Got Drunk - for Lunch.\\" The poem feeding the drama evokes the pathetic wish that the copy editor, played by Mr. Rickman, could somehow have had a different life or resurrected the old one by simply showing up. Being rude, drinking to excess, insulting his former lover, played by Emma Thompson, is all deluded excess this poor character thinks will win him back some semblance of a life better than he has. It is all very depressing and not very original. It is also very whiney and tedious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Song of lunch","review":"I wanted to see this movie due to the stars, who were in the movie. Boy! what a disappointment.

But thanks to James Horner's penchant for repeating himself, it's not. His Marine theme is enjoyable and the use of Native American chants is ok, but overall he simply redoes previous music. There's a bit of Enemy at the Gates and Mask of Zorro in this score. And he's not done reusing it, in Troy he uses some od the same music. If you are a hardcore Horner fan, buy this cd. If you don't mind the fact that it is repetative music, buy this score. Otherwise, stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS ALBUM IS POOR, DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Once again, Navajo songs were pushed aside from the making of this soundtrack, there is no Navajo songs, nothing...I am so angered as a Navajo myself, they should have put Navajo songs on the album but didn't.This is more of Shakespeare's type classical music...! Do not buy!! If you want to purchase Navajo songs, I suggest you look elswhere!p.s., if you want Navajo songs, may I suggest purchasing:Dougles Spotted Eagle: Closer To Far AwaySacred Spirits: Chants And Dances Of The Native AmericansBrule: One Nation"},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best score by horner","review":"No doubt that this is not one of James Horner's best score. I can tell this because the theme of the movie wasn't compatible with Horner's deep inner self, emotional style of music. Movies of this type such as Braveheart, Glory, Titanic, A beautiful Mind bring out the best in Horner. I recommend seeing the movie before buying any soundtrack. Some reviewers complained that the song in the commercial was not on the cd, it wasn't even played in the movie. You can't expect that for every movie(such as this and Saving Private Ryan). Another reviewer said that this cd was poor because it contained no Navajo songs(again none were played in the movie). Yes this album is poor, but not just because it doesn't contain any Navajo music."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WAS ROBBED!","review":"Maybe I should have thrown my money into the wind. Haven't seen the movie yet, but all the commercials on the radio with the beautiful American Indian music, it's what I EXPECTED on this CD and was really mad that none of it was included even tho that was the main theme of this movie. Thanks for nothing. Unfortunately I don't have a sound card on this computer and couldn't listen to any samples but I bought the CD anyway, just blindly assuming that the beautiful American Indian music would be there. Instead, I get a CD full of tired, boring, military music and military drum rolls we've all heard before.

Fair enough. The trouble was that I could not walk away believing that the scientific community is killing debate because the filmmakers did not make their case with any attempt at balance or sobriety. Had this been done, the film may have been a great deal more effective. As it stands, it's simply another voice yelling loudly among others. This did not add to debate or conversation, but surely made the idea of debating the merits of intelligent design a great deal less palatable to the powers that be. I'm sure the filmmakers lined their pockets nicely, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a \\"Best Buy\\" from my point of view, but ...","review":"I thought this was a disappointing presentation and was not really worth the hype it was originally given when it was released. I was left with the feeling that although this topic is deserving of a good debate with people who were willing to provide their deep knowledge as to why they feel and think how they do, they do not do that on this DVD - in my opinion the general level of debate was superficial!I cannot help but comment that National Geographic and Nova productions cover this sort of subject in greater detail and with greater understanding being given to their viewers.But then again, Ben Stein is a comedian and I guess his sense of humor shines through this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Shill for Bible Literalists","review":"A documentary used to make superstitious people feel good about themselves by attacking science.

Forget whether there should be an argument, intelligent design is a stupid argument, and Expelled is a rather transparent documentary. It's clear from the start (literally, the first sentence in the movie) that Ben Stein has a religious agenda. He tries to make the viewer believe he is objective or even pro-evolution and then gets convinced of intelligent design... Nonsense. For the record, evolution is true. Natural selection is one of the ways it could have happened. The latter point is only somewhat controverted in the scientific establishment, the first one is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful","review":"Although this film in and of itself will probably not change anyone's mind or ideas about the origin of the universe, it is a useful tool when having a conversation on the topic. I thought it was well made and presented some compelling arguments in support of those who agree with the theory of inteligent design. If nothing else, I certainly enjoyed Ben Stein's sense of humor.For additional insight into this topic, I would reccomend the first 2 chapters of 'Mere Christianity' by C.S. Lewis. As the title clearly states, the latter portions of the book lead into religious topics, but first 2 chapters are non-dogmatic and are aligned with this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth scares","review":"We found this film very interesting and even an eye opener.

Evolutionary concepts are grossly mishandled by the filmmakers, quotes from biologists are taken out of context, statements are made only addressing the pros without the cons on their behalf, and so on. Even Ben Stein, who has little to no background in any of the fields of specialty, is heard in the form of voiceover dismissing and roasting every heavily edited video clip of someone from the opposing viewpoint.I would not have minded this movie had it showed both sides or at least gave cons with the pros to the intelligent design side, yet the filmmakers have failed to do so, instead making a very biased and intellectually insulting documentary that just serves to further confuse those who are curious about the debate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propoganda at its worst","review":"Ben Stein and company try to manufacture a conspiracy to silence IDers by blatantly lying and trying to link evolution to all kinds of absurdities.

See expelledexposed.com, run by the National Center for Science Education (great organization!) for more.It's all well and good for the makers of this film to cling to a primitive and ignorant view of biology. But to suggest that their anti-scientific political movement, \\"Intelligent Design,\\" has any role in education (except perhaps as an object lesson in how NOT to do science) is an act of cultural vandalism against all of us who prize, and whose lives have been immeasurably improved by, science.Shame, shame, shame.Puck"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dishonest tripe","review":"I haven't seen this movie.I'm not totally unqualified to review it, however; I am in the movie, and am even thanked in the credits.

Pure hypocrisy, as is on prominent display in this disgraceful propaganda film.This is a movie that obtained its content under false pretenses, that in the absence of any actual link, tries to slander evolutionary theory by cartoonish and false association with Hitler and Communism, and simply isn't funny or entertaining.See expelledexposed.com for the full story on this shoddy collection of celluloid lies."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Intelligence Displayed","review":"That unmasked pseudo-intellectual ben stein and the makers of this hideous (and incredibly dull) little film had to lie to get their interviews should be enough in itself to warn thoughtful people off watching Expelled.

Because is not a debate that you see on the screen, it is a virulent attack. As usual, with the image of good guy with an open mind.There was the nazi misconception but also there was the inquisition. Remembering that is very important to balance.

By the time he got to showing how scientific study can cause atheism, and darwinism fits right in with eugenics and Nazis, I found it difficult to actually finish watching it.This shouldn't be in a \\"documentary\\" category. It should under \\"religion,\\" with a synopsis describing it as a story of faith about a godly man named Ben. In Ben's story, he attacks ungodly people, apparently because rebranding \\"creationism\\" as \\"intelligent design\\" didn't fool enough of us to think it might be something different.A documentary worth watching on this topic isFlock Of Dodos: The Evolution-Intelligent Design Circus.

(using the same logic, then, St. Paul's letters gave us obedient German Nazis... see Romans 13) ... and Stein should know better than to spread such nonsense.The other part of his argument--that universities persecute proponents of ID--is equally specious. If ID'ers had good science, then universities would love to hire them, and journals would love to publish their works. Indeed, should universities hire professors and pay them good money to teach flat earth, or young earth theory? The existence of elves, or Santa Claus? Or that the Civil War had nothing to do with slavery?[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see!!!","review":"What can you say, Ben Stein asks all the right questions.

But nonetheless, this doesn't stop Ben Stein from touting his exploitation of a horrible human atrocity in history to push his conspiratorial polemic with his Discovery Institute cronies who fail to even explain the methodology of Intelligent Design. The punchline of this movie is that there is no scientific methodology, but it is perfectly okay to hold a scientific position at a University and lazily wax on the power of sky fairies and Unicorns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reviews here not based on art or merit","review":"This documentary is artistically done and makes its point well. The point being that those in academia who question Darwinism are shunned and/or fired (when possible). Professor Gonzalez is a perfect example: he was probably (I think totally) more qualified than the tenured staff, yet he was dismissed. To ask where the stuff came from that made up the big bang in the first place, or the beginning of life, is apparently a big no-no. So yes, this is worthwhile seeing. The only thing I didn't like about it is that President Reagan was included in it, making it look like all the proponents of Intelligent Design are Republican. That's not true, and I've seen a number of complaints about this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignorant propaganda","review":"I was thinking of giving this piece of trash two stars, because some of the material in it is genuinely interesting, but the stench of its odious demagoguery eventually became too much.Just as it might be hard to identify which specific piece of garbage in a landfill stinks the most, so it's iffy to identify which specific piece of garbage in this film is the most rank. But I think its take on the Holocaust must be one of the top contenders. Richard Weikart's \\"From Darwin to Hitler\\" forms at least part of the basis for Stein's odious propaganda.

It will simply encourage your beliefs and won't bring up anything that might make you second guess yourself. You're really the only person this movie is aimed towards.The rest of us understand that evolution is as much a fact as the fact that the earth is round. And much like Galileo's discovery, Darwin's won't be fully accepted by the religious in our lifetime. But it will eventually, and in the future this film will be looked back on and laughed at for its naivety.It can be frustrating, but there's no use in getting worked up over religious willingness to be blind to scientific facts. It will just take time for them to understand, and we all just have to be patient until they catch on like they did with the earth being round and revolving around the sun."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"greatly displayed the ignorance portrayed for people who don't know the basic arguments. seemed Dawkins didn't fully understand the cosmological argument at all and having to presume that aliens brought us here. lol.

Just thinking about that fact puts a smile on my face. Like many other people, I'm sure, I paid for another movie but walked into the Expelled cinema instead. Sadomasochistic torture, I know, but I just couldn't miss the opportunity of seeing this intellectual embarrassment when it was released. I went in expecting it to be a huge, steaming pile of misleading nonsense. I was not disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is NOT about Intelligent Design!","review":"It's about FREE SPEECH. It is about how WRONG it is that one side in the evolution debate is not being ALLOWED to TALK or TEACH or WRITE or DEBATE the subject. That's got nothing to do with religion or science.

He can't, and \\"Expelled\\" proves it. Lousy in every respect: research, direction, editing, lighting, narration...you name it. Stein's lame attempt to discredit *real* scientists through clever editing and documented deception is a comic failure.Anyone with a college education--or a reasonably good high school education--understands the mechanisms of natural selection. Those who are educated *and* religious usually have little difficulty accepting scientific truth along with their faith; some don't and, like Stein, choose instead to attack biology because it threatens their deeply held mythologies and superstitions.Stein's cinematic tripe isn't going to change anyone's mind about evolution or religion; content aside, though, it is a very poorly produced film, and it has certainly exposed Stein as a hack."},{"rating":"1","title":"And people wonder why America is fading","review":"If this sewage truly reflects the opinions and critical thinking ability of the American public, it's no wonder America is on a horrible decline.Ben and crew should be embarrassed by this self-destructive and intentionally ignorant film."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"No Intelligence Allowed\\" is the right way to describe this film ...","review":"Lets be honest here, this is a propaganda film in the purist sense.

Not once during the entire content of this movie is there any mention of evidence to support the 'Intelligent Design' hypothesis. The whole film is dedicated to exposing perceived prejudice against those that wish to espouse ID as an alternative to the Theory of Evolution and yet no-one seems able to explain what the strengths of ID are. Ben Stein's attempt to link the Holocaust to Darwin is simply shameful, the disingenousness of producers whilst interviewing participants has been widely reported across the internet and everyone but the most religiously biased individuals understand that Intelligent Design is nothing more than a long line of efforts to promote Biblical creationism.In short, this movie does exactly the opposite of what it intended. It merely exposes Intelligent Design advocates as the fundamentalist nutcases that they really are. Ben Stein should hang his head in shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expelled: no intelligence demonstrated","review":"This little piece of religious propaganda is only another reason why fundamentalist christianity needs to be checked in our society.Intelligent Design is a complete sham, it's creationism and a conservative judge has ruled it as such. However, if you get a droll former nixon speechwriter to use the holocaust and outdated definitions of a very powerful scientific theory to make ad hominem attacks on men of science, all of a sudden ID becomes a relevant theory? Sorry, in any logic class this would fail.Not to mention the filmography isn't particularly high caliber either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter tripe","review":"This is no more than a propaganda piece put forth by the Discovery Institute. It is comprised of misrepresentations and even, yes, outright lies. It has neither scientific nor sociological value, nor even tells a very good story. It attempts to blame the Holocost, among other social ills, on the Theory of Evolution, which is nonsense.Ultimatly, it is yet another attempt to put religion into the science classrooms.I gave it one star because the DVD might serve as a pretty good coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning to Ben Stein Fans","review":"This is not a Ben Stein entertainment film, this is creationist religious propaganda.It's likely no one's mind is going to be changed by these weak arguments.

Ben does like Borat, in suckering religious humanists into exposing their silly religion and their shallow selves. I learned a lot from this movie, and have thus lost a little of my ignorant bliss. He shows us how America is now ruled by Peer Pressured Propaganda ala Hitler Youth movement. Just as in the Inquisition when a religion became state sponsored, Lazy minded people have learned the party propaganda well enough to reach powerful positions, and now they work to keep their power by freezing \\"science\\" (religion) where they understand it, and spend all effort on fighting to keep from having any new ideas becoming popular, by declaring their theory of \\"science\\" as official, all-encompassing and irrefutable (religion), attacking anyone's credibility that dares not to conform.

Intelligent design has been \\"expelled\\" from science classrooms globally because it is not science - it is politicized religion.At the very least - 'extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.' Even if you believe that there could be a designer, consider whether there is sufficient evidence to convince the global community of skeptics (i.e., scientists).

Basically, everything I read about it beforehand was lukewarm or negative. This was not only true of mainstream media sources as at least two conservative reviewers panned it as well. I viewed it only for informational purposes as I don't know much about intelligent design and wanted to learn. Due to my religious beliefs, I was sympathetic to it as a theory, and my only complaint about the documentary is that Stein didn't spend more time defining it precisely. Particularly fascinating was the segment on DNA. I recall that one reviewer stated that the film refused to interview experts whose opinions clashed with ID, but that is not true.

Students need to realize that it is the theory of evolution and not the law of evolution...A theory is an idea without 100% backing by the scientific community. Creation is also a theory.....Free speech is a law(fact) yet it looks like people who fire people because of their ideas are the real morons that some of you speak of in these reviews.

But after all is said and done, if those in the Creationist camp are indeed a bunch of imbecilic, propaganda-spewing, anti-science establishment crazies, then let us settle this the good ol' American way. Let us create a free and fair forum for a lively and equitable debate. (And I do mean more that just posting opinions for reviews.) And to up the ante, let us take the debate to the classrooms of our great USA so that the facts - or lack thereof - may fight for themselves.If Ben is as IDiotic as half the reviews (um, comments) purport, then what does the Scientific community have to lose.

The fundamental ideas of the film -- that scientific theories opposed to Darwin are \\"expelled\\" from the establishment, that ID is one such theory, that belief in evolution leads to eugenics and totalitarianism -- are of course utterly wrong, but that's been covered so thoroughly in other websites that there's no point in going into it here. If you do decide to watch it, I highly recommend pairing it with the excellent Nova episode,Judgment Day - Intelligent Design on Trialabout the famous Dover, PA trial in which the judge determined that \\"Intelligent Design\\" was simply religious creationism in secular clothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why so many 1 star reviews?","review":"My husband never asks me to buy movies. And he just called me to order 2. I had to post a review when I saw how badly the movie is rated. I can't imagine why, especially since I remember when he came home raving about it after seeing it in the theatre. I think if you are interested in I.D. (he was and didn't know much about the controversy) and can stomach a documentary then I can imagine you will love this film. My husband isn't into documentaries so I was surprised he even liked this film.

It's not convincing to anyone but the people who already believe evolution is a sham (and if they need a movie to validate their beliefs, their beliefs probably weren't that strong in the first place), and it just alienates everyone else by blindly attacking evolution instead of using reason and logic to debate it. I feel sorry for the pro-evolution people who were interviewed because their words were twisted to serve a different purpose. I would not recommend this movie to anyone at all. Seriously. This movie is not worth the packaging it comes in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Polarizing the debate","review":"If you want to know what ID proponents face from fanatical Darwinists, just look at the negative reviews to this video and the way they get \\"voted up.\\" For those in the middle, with no bone in this fight, you owe it to yourself to see EXPELLED and form your own judgment. Any documentary that gets so many people upset has to have something going for it. And it does. Stein is clever and he unmasks the pretensions of Darwinists who pretend to be valiant defenders of science but instead are as dogmatic and vicious as any inquisitors of the past (the only difference is that the laws of our land prevent the violence to times past).

And what's more the lies aren't even told in an entertaining way.But you don't need to believe me. Check out Rotten Tomatoes where currently expelled has a score of 8%.

Well, in all fairness there was another couple who walked out in the first 20 minutes, no doubt to get their money back and salvage the rest of their evening. Let me be brief because I already see many others have made very succinct arguments why you shouldn't part with your money to buy this tripe. First of all, you WILL be amazed at how bad the arguments are against evolution and how they use a red herring approach to claim all of society's ills on this theory. Second, you will find yourself bored as it drags on with each odd tanget it decides to pursue (maybe you should also order a book with this purchase to keep you entertained while watching the dvd). Third, you will want your money back. We got ours back after complaining at the theater. The manager just laughed and said how he had to do this more times than most for this particular movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's unconvincing, boring, and just plain wrong.","review":"It's kind of hard to believe that this movie isn't supposed to be satire.

Ben never asks the right questions. Here's just 4 simple questions he doesn't ask:1/4) If ID is NOT religious, what's the scientific difference between ID and what every university on earth teaches?2/4 Natural selection is not random chance, so why do ID defenders treat is as such? (even if it WERE random chance, the universe is large enough to handle such odds.)3/4 We don't know the origins of life, why is not knowing the answer so scary?4/4 Ben brings Nazis into the mix to show how bad atheism is, but why doesn't he give equal time to the Spanish inquisition, crusades, witch trials or the genocide of the native americans?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Words","review":"One of the things they did not discuss and the one thing that could of brought some validity to this film\\"Testable Hypothesis\\"Intelligent design proponents love to throw around the word science yet avoid the scientific method.

Throw a rock in a pack of dogs and the one who barks the loudest got hit. Darwinism is antiquated. Only One has explained the origin of life and it is not a Darwinist.

( I was out of town and hand nothing else to do.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Champion of Academic Freedom","review":"I really enjoyed this documentary. This clearly demonstrates how anti-intellectual evolutionists are. If this doesn't show that evolution is a religion and not science, I don't know what does. Ben Stein has a great sense of humor in this documentary, and it is enjoyable to watch. It is also frightening to see how taking a stand on truth will cost people their jobs in \\"respected\\" institutions of learning and intellectual \\"freedom\\".

It exposes the juvenile irreducible simplicity of those who rely on verbosity and bellicose behavior to defend what is both illogical and unobservable empirically. With the advent of breaking the DNA code the very concept of variations and \\"so-called\\" evolutionary adaptations being a simple to complex equation is adolescent at best. What we find is adaptation within species which validate the ID concept that variations are a process which is the result of a pre-exisitng body of information which both preceeds and exceeds the process of adaptibility some mistakenly call evolution. What we observe scientifically is the exact opposite of evolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"well-sourced perspective articel about Intelligent Design","review":"I was impressed at the breadth of the perspective on the issue of whether Intelligent Design Theory actually is scientific theory. This documentary uses direct interviews with esteemed academicians, relatively unknown professionals, and some political activists involved in the issues around Intelligent Design. It is shown that whereas Evolution Theory was once roundly opposed by the large majority of society, Evolution Theory has become almost axiomatic among contemporary scientific/politic cross-sections of society. The first portion of this documentary, which comprises about 80% of the play-time, is a secular investigation of what actually is behind the various positions on Intelligent Design.The last portion of this documentary involves application of theology to secular ethics: if Evolution Theory is taken to extremes then what might be the overall social/political results?"},{"rating":"1","title":"How to tell skeptics from believers","review":"I was one of the first to comment on this movie, based on a personal communication from Ben Stein himself. For some reason, Amazon failed to publish my review.Anyone who is capable of separating scientific discovery from fantasy will recognize this movie as kissing the behind of religious fantasy in the face of evidence that conclusively contradicts the \\"THEORY of Intelligent Design\\".The most appalling aspect of this movie is the way in which they interviewed scholars, plying them with trick questions, then taking their comments completely out of context to make their point, contrary to the beliefs of those they interviewed.Check out Richard Dawkins website for his comments on this movie.I once had respect for Ben Stein, but this movie has shown me that his perspective is either completely contrary to mine or he is using a popular issue to line his pockets.To those who believe ID is real, do your homework (with an open mind). It just doesn't fit the facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bias and Dishonest","review":"The right questions were never asked during this film and you get the feeling that that wasn't the point. It also demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the scientific process. Science and truth aren't democratic and have no agenda. The just are. IF someone can produce real evidence of intelligent design, it would get published. That is why \\"teach the controversy\\" just doesn't work. As far as science is concerned, there is none. This documentary could have been so much better if he had tried to do it honestly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dishonest and biased.","review":"From his gratuitous misquoting of Darwin (Descent of Man) to his exploitative interviews with Dawkins and Myers (who believed they were being interviewed for a different film), Stein offers not one glimmer of concern for honesty or integrity in this frankly awful film. As a work of propaganda is is sure to be effective, but it loses all moral high ground with such underhanded tactics. It is thus most effective as a demonstration of the remarkable lengths creationists feel they are permitted to go to get to the truth.

To make it short - Expelled is absolutely terrible. Ben Stein is trying to explain something he clearly does not understand. The movie confuses facts, and misrepresents theories and facts. Terms are used wrong, and terms are even invented to just prove an incorrect point.

In addition to being boring, aesthetically mediocre, and dishonest, EXPELLED is outright sinister.In an interview shortly after the limited release of EXPELLED, Stein says, \\"Science leads to killing people.\\" No, this is not a quote-mine. The context is a plain comparison of the ID movement to science, and Stein's conclusion, which is lucidly argued in EXPELLED, is that \\"science leads to killing people.\\" At first I was angry about a quasi-hero of mine professing belief in a bankrupt ideology, but after thinking about it a little more, I'm genuinely worried about Stein.

Unfortunately, the movie completely sidesteps the merits of I.D, and what you're left with is rather silly. There is a good reason not to want a scientist on board that believes an \\"intelligent designer\\" created the universe: quite boringly, it is the same reason you don't want a scientist that believes in \\"magic.\\" Can a scientist conduct science with such a belief? Are they inherently worse off and less productive than scientists with no preconceived faith-based notions? Well, that's what the \\"documentary\\" is supposed to be about, but it strays from that point entirely too far.Be prepared to find plenty of rather propagandistic silly dramatics such as scenes with Stalin, Hilter, skulls, the mentally infirmed, and other nonsense that has no bearing on the debate.Save yourself the time, read the wiki page on Richard Sternberg."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ben Doesn't Know What Science Is","review":"I saw the movie on Showtime recently.

Though I usually read 2 or 3 books at a time and can easily jump from one to the other, I could not put this book down until I finished it.I wish there had been more to this volume.

It is light enough to easily carry around - big enough to read even with bifocals - and has ALL the streets on it, even the little narrow ones. It also has the metro stations clearly identified. So, with this in one hand and your metro ticket in the other - you can go anywhere you need to go in Rome to see ALL the major sites and most of the smaller ones too. You don't need a car or taxi in Rome - just your streetwise and a metro ticket. In fact, by looking at the Streetwise, we could see that many attractions were grouped close enough to each other that we could use the map to just walk from one to the other.

While the streets are accurate and well labeled, the area of coverage is just plain silly. If you don't care to see the area east or south of the Piazza Navona, this map might work for you. Otherwise you will be far better off with the free maps that are offered at just about every hotel.

As the navigator in the family, I brought several maps with me - printed and offline iPhone apps. While each has their strengths, this is the map I always had with me and constantly used. Its form factor - simple fan fold, about the size of a business size envelope - is extremely handy - easy to grab, unfold and refold. The fact that it is a heavy weight paper and is laminated is great since we experienced several days of rain. It took me a while to get used to flipping it over from the northern areas to the southern areas of the city, but once I mastered that, all was fine. We'd occasionally make a wrong turn, but I'd quickly be able to get back on track. And in Rome that's not necessarily a bad thing since the city is all about narrow streets and hidden treasures. I would definitely recommend getting this. Enjoy your trip!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great and sturdy map.","review":"This map is great.

The free map from the hotel was much better plus the hotel staff pointed out highlights on the hotel map. The Streetwise map is narrow in height and covers Rome on both sides. So it is almost impossible to follow a route across the city since the opposite sides do not line up. We stayed near Termini train station on the west side and went to the Vatican on the east side.

The chapters are divided into very short subheadings, and initially the episodic nature of the writing is somewhat distracting. However, the book gains momentum as the investigation draws to its climax and Shelton is captured. I was appalled to learn that during the years of Shelton's crime spree, he was arrested fifteen times for a variety of lesser offenses, yet every time he was released with no connection made between him and the highly-publicized rapes. There was little effective coordination among investigators in various precincts and divisions, who were slow to realize that they were all looking for the same man. The investigation was also hampered by the common misconception that voyeurs (like Shelton) don't engage in, or progress to, violence and rape"},{"rating":"2","title":"F***ing brilliant!","review":"Slap stick, disgusting, crude, vulgar, barmy, its all here and above all its original! worth 50 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This is slapstick at its best, with more 'slap' than 'stick'.Completely over the top, radical, often very physical comedy with a very twisted slant.A little less weird than The Young Ones (not a bad thing) but just as frenetic.

Britcom fans remember them from the Young Ones, another great show. The show is loaded with slapstick sometimes so violent, it would make the Three Stooges cringe.

After that are over a dozen songs in a variety of languages, all perfect for getting a child to sleep, or putting an adult in a very mellow mood.

THEY DO NOT HAVE FRENCH CUFFS AS ADVISED"},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative, and a great read!","review":"This book is an excellent introduction to Shiva and, through him, to Hinduism and even Indian philosophy in general. Designed for a Western audience, the book is divided into sections about different aspects of Shiva and his worship. Wolf-Dieter Storl approaches the subject as an anthropologist, giving historical and cultural background to this Hindu God. In addition, he intersperses his analysis with stories from the great Hindu books of mythology as well as anecdotes from his time in India. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in a serious, in-depth look at Shiva."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lot's of pretty pictures","review":"This should really be called \\"I'm so smart look at all the cultures I know.\\"I just wanted stories about Shiva."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my absolute favorites","review":"I first read this book when I was a sophomore in high school. I was blown away at the time, and it remains on my shelf of re-reads. I have recommended and lent it out many times, and replaced it when one friend was taking too long because I couldn't live without it.It's a teddy bear of a book - comforting, lighthearted, next to my bed at all times, and continuing to get better as it and I age together."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a gem and a keeper","review":"I still can't figure out exactly what sort of book it is. It could be a fun little fairy tale told with a sly wink and sharp sense of humor. It could be a commentary on the power of myth, disguised as a fairy tale. It could be an author's clever joke, where the story itself is not particularly interesting, but instead you turn the pages to see how the author use the rhythm of language to weave a sort of magic spell which transforms the story into something wonderful. Whatever it is, I enjoyed the book very much, and will keep the book and reread it many many times over the years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too snide for me","review":"I got this book after having it highly recommended by a friend. I admit to being disappointed. Though well written, it's just too snide and tongue-in-cheek for me. Perhaps I take my fantasy too seriously? Unlike The Princess Bride, this book came across as being actively hostile to fantasy conventions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than The Princess Bride","review":"I've found most fantasy reading to be worse than romance novels. The plots, ideas and characters are so predictable that I skirt the library's fantasy section like a hospital wing full of plague victims. However, Barns' \\"One for the Morning Glory\\" is a real gem. Much like Goldman's \\"The Princess Bride\\" it plays upon the horrid stereotypes of the genre with great wit and charm. The story employs the usual cast of goblins, witches etc, but remains original and captivating while never taking itself too seriously.If you like \\"The Princess Bride\\" but skipped through the many monotonous parts, \\"One for the Morning Glory\\" is definitely your kind of read. It moves quickly through a series of action packed adventures which reinvigorate this tired genre. It's a much better and frankly easier read than \\"The Princess Bride\\" and boasts equal amounts of charm, exploit and humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album ever","review":"Invincible is the greatest music ever made by Michael.

It's so sad, because this album has so many great numbers and a kind of new tune as you never had hear Michael sing it before. It contains many great lovesongs and ballads..if I should compaire it to one of MJ's other albums, it must be \\" Off The Wall \\".I can only recommended this great album to all..Hurry and go and get a copy, you wont regret it.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Butterflies","review":"I was so pleasantly surprised by the song \\"butterflies\\".

Go get it!A fan from Berlin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Solid, But A Few Weak Links...","review":"Overall I'll say that I am impressed by this cd. I wasn't expecting much in this day of great artists turning to crap, and when I listened to the CD the first time, I wasn't impressed at all. But I persisted, and after a few times through, I really like it.THE most solid track is #15,\\"Whatever Happens,\\" featuring Carlos Santana on guitar. It's a VERY good song, with a kind of haunting feel to it. Kind of reminds me of \\"Little Susie\\" at times, but I feel it is a better track overall.The first 3 songs are similar, dancy type songs. BUt please don't assume that that is all the album brings. The remainder of the album are soft, beautiful ballads. The best of these I would have to say are tracks 8, \\"Speechless,\\" and 14, \\"Lost Children.\\" Very, very nice.All in all, I am impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The King Returns, Long Live the King!!!","review":"Simply fantastic...I missed you and now I remember why...God has truely blessed us all with you Mike..If I would be critical, I would like one or two faster cuts.

It has been an album that many people have been waiting for. I have been a Michael Jackson fan since grade school, when wearing the Michael Jackson Jackets were the cool \\"In Thing\\" at the time. Michael Jackson is an individual with roots of Entertainment that go all the way back since the 70's. I recommend buying the album and listening through it a couple of times. It has some really good \\"Sexy\\" tracks when are alone with your spouse or girlfriend. Songs like \\"Butterflies\\" and \\"Heaven Can Wait\\". My favorite song on the album is the first song \\"Unbreakable\\". It is an up-beat song that will have you playing it over and over again. This is an album that has potential to give Michael Jackson a new beginning.

I am a true fan, but Mike went a little crazy on the History and Blood on the Dance Floor Albums. Decent at best would describe them, but Invincible has put me back in favor with the \\"King of Pop\\". I think that in a age of such groups as Nsync's, BSB, and so on.

Well, he's finally decided to come around, and in rare form! Michael has gone back to his R&B roots and taught these new-jacks a thing or two about vocal arrangement, style, orchestration, and beautiful lyrics. Don't believe me? Listen to \\"Butterflies\\". I divorced Michael after the Dangerous CD, and now I'm ready to reconcile. Go cop this CD! - Veda"},{"rating":"2","title":"Legacy","review":"This was really not a bad CD. I enjoyed most of the songs. I would have gotten this earlier; however, I was listening to the reviews regarding this CD, which I normally do not do, and never got around to purchasing it.

With \\"Invincible,\\" Jackson isn't reinventing pop music. It's more like a return to his roots - songs like the hit \\"You Rock My World,\\" \\"Break of Dawn,\\" \\"Heaven Can Wait\\" and the gorgeous \\"Butterfly\\" are refreshing in their soulful simplicity, especially after his inspired but bloated last effort, \\"History.\\" When Jackson is singing about love, he's terrific; the \\"message songs\\" like \\"Privacy,\\" \\"Lost Children\\" and \\"Threatened\\" don't come off as well. It seems as though Michael is desperate to defend himself to his listeners, but his fans will love him as long as he keeps putting out impeccably produced feel-good grooves. All in all, despite the criticism resulting from an over-abundance of hype, \\"Invincible\\" is a solid set of songs that live up to the standards of the former pop king."},{"rating":"2","title":"MJ is back!","review":"I\`been a Michael fan as far i can remember.

However, this doesn't mean that it's nota good album. On the contrary. Invincible is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the best R&B album released lately; the hot-shot producers who took part in the album, combined with Jackson's (who still didn't lose his magic) talent created good songs, which, perhaps, aren't as strong as some of his earlier work, but are still worthy of listening.If you are looking for a good R&B record - purchase this one. Try to forget the fact that this is a Michael Jackson album and enjoy the music without comparing it to his earlier works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael proves to be Invincible!!!!","review":"Invincible is Amazing!!! Michael Jackson has really done great with this CD. Each song is great. No matter what mood you may be in, there is a song to listen to. I truely believe that this is his best CD.

I expected great things, however for spending 35 million dollars on this album he wasted his money. Why did the album not do well? play this next to THRILLER or OFF THE WALL and you will know why. One of the points is we can't judge him on terms of his music alone any more. He brings up his personal struggles in his songs all the time. There are some good songs on this album like YOU ROCK MY WORLD however there are alot of martyrdom songs. The part where sony did not promote this is hogwash. The week this came out he was everywhere. On vh1, trl,instore signings, and to top it off he through himself that big starstudded tribute. I think people are finally giving up.

The first single, \\"You Rock my World\\", which has a rather catchy beat, is my favorite on the album. \\"Heaven can wait\\" is another favorite of mine. It has a slow-moving, almost sappy nature.

INVINCIBLE is somewhat different from MJ's past albums, it represents a michael we havent heard before.Although there are 3 songs about the tabloid injustice and thats what i like about MICHAEL, DAMN THOSE TABLOIDS, still the new album is more focused on love rather than anger on tabloids(HISTORY). You will hear a new MICHAEL on some of the songs like HEARTBREAKER/ INVINCIBLE/ and specaily on 2000 WATTS. Although i trust MICHAEL will always make great music, i was a little afraid at first that INVINCIBLE will be an ok album for me because of all the talk that he is going to do something different, but when i heared it i realy liked it and i think its great, once again MICHAEL JACKSON HAS PROVED TO ME THAT HE IS INVINCIBLE with his new album, just like he was with all of his career. check out MJ's voice on BUTTERFLIES.MICHAEL, keep up the good work(your unbreakable).by: FAHAD KHALIFA AL SALEH(an mj fan for 15 years, ALWAYS WILL BE)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of Michael Jackson","review":"This is undoubtedly his best CD ever. The essence of music is displayed at its finest. He was at one time one of the greatest singers out there.

Seven years fans waited for another studio album and then it was announced \\"Invincible\\", Not quite. The man is so talented in what he does, yet he gives us Billie Jean all over throughout the album. And what about that Track Invicible. Didnt the beatles do something that weird called Revolution #9?

Michael is the greatest entertainer of this century. He's persecuted like Jesus mainly because of racism-that's why a lot of programmers (not of color) at radio stations wont play his music.No way are they going to let a Black entertainer remain more popular than Elvis or The Beatles-which he has already accomplished. You see it always comes back full circle in the end to pure racism after all the smoke has cleared. His music sounds better than the crap that's being played by these younger artists and it all has a contemporary sound. But you know, the more they reject and criticize Michael the more I will stand firmly by him and support him and so will all of his true fans.Long live The King of Pop-anointed the king by his dear friend Liz Taylor not by himself like the racially biased media has proclaimed so venoumously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invincible?

The first three tracks just scream to be released to the radio. I don't think that Mike has had a better opening since \\"Off the wall\\".

The melodic chorus from these songs will stay in your head for weeks.The up-beat songs will have you stomping your feet on the dance floor.

This album has no good songs to it and I can't even get through the whole CD. This album didn't do well only selling 2 million copies compared to 26 million of Thriller.

This is a cd that the fans will appreciate and listen to for a long time to come"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"Invincible is a great album.

This is another great album by the Master of Pop. \\"You Rock My World\\" is a top-class pop hit, but you also get \\"Break of Dawn\\", \\"Invincible\\", and 13 more quality recordings.

This album once again proves Michael's exceptional musical talent and creativity. His work only keeps getting better with time. As always, all songs from this album have a profound meaning to it.

Dangerous began the slide as far as I am concerned. Some good songs, but a few were a bit plodding and overlong. Invincible just really takes everyting that was awful on Dangerous and throws away all the good. Some of the tracks are listenable, but most are too long, plod along, go round in circles in oddly timed stoccato beats that seem to be very clinical and cold. It's all fake hand claps, sequenced drum loops and beatboxing type noises. Where are the guitars? Where are all the layered vocals? Where is the piano? Where are the melodies and for God's sake - drop the guest rappers. Awful! This is all programmed blips and bangs and it sounds fragmented and jarring.It's not truly as horrible as some are suggesting but it is a hard listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"No fast music :((","review":"Looking at the title of the album, I thought it would be another great dance track album with fast catchy music like \\"Blood on the dance floor\\". However I was dissapointed, really dissapointed with the slow numbers on the album. I would rate this at 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"I found this new CD to be a bit disappointing. Michael Jackson went from being angry and screaming in his music to sounding like he is on tranquilizors. This CD is very melow and very R&Bish. There are no pop songs to get you dancing. I was hoping to hear some new dance tunes from him but this time. If your into light R&B then you'll like this CD. If you like Pop/Dance music your out of luck here."},{"rating":"1","title":"ItsNotMattola'sFault,ButTheManInTheMirror","review":"Michael Jackson is blaming everyone for the poor sales of his lastest CD,\\"Invincible.\\"Now he's playing the race card and bringing in the Rev,Al Sharpton.The one to blame MICHAEL is THE MAN IN THE MIRROR.The record is the worst I've ever heard from this GREAT Artist.Jackson has insulated himself from the Real World for years,and thinks he can Jump Back to his Thriller Days,and go on from there.I think this is the BEST Thing that could happen to Michael.Its time to Make That Change."},{"rating":"2","title":"HE'S BACK!","review":"After a lengthy hiatis, the King of Pop has returned, with probably his most daring and innovative project yet. \\"Invincible\\" showcases a typical, but modern-day Michael in full-force. Song selections to look forward to: (1)\\"Unbreakable\\", (2)\\"Break of Dawn\\", (3)\\"Heaven Can Wait\\", (4)\\"You Rock My World\\", (5)\\"Butterflies\\", (7)Don't Walk Away\\" and (8)\\"Whatever Happens\\". Overall, \\"Invincible\\" is a creative and well-rounded project, so expect to see much more of Mike in the coming future.To all the DIE-HARD MICHAEL FANS...BE ENCOURAGED! The King has RETURNED, and he's taking NO PRISONERS."},{"rating":"2","title":"The King is BACK!!","review":"This cd is HOT!! You have to check out the song \\"Heartbreaker\\". It is an uptempo number with a bouncy beat. It will remind you of a Timbaland track, although it is not produced by Tim. The ballad \\"Speechless\\" is a beautiful song about neverending love. \\"You Are My Life\\" was co-written and co-produced by Babyface. If you are familiar with the works of Babyface, you already know that this will become an instant classic. I am so glad that Michael is back. The History cd was not very good overall, but with \\"Invincible\\" Michael Jackson reclaims the throne as the undisputed King of Pop. Buy it NOW!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album! A most have!","review":"This is an amazing album because It's the first album MJ relesed in six years. Of course this isn't thriller, nor is it like any Micheal Jackson album ever heared by the human ear. If you know the song \\"Nad Your Head\\" by Will Smith, expect for most of the songs to sound like that especaily the first song \\"Unbreakable\\". The 3 best songs on the album in order are 3.Unbreakable, 2.Threatened and drum roll please....1. You Rock my world! This song is awesome, one of kind and I most say is one of the best songs he has done in a long time. Know this is very tecno music but is still awesome. now almost all the songs on the album encluding You Rock my World are love songs and from my point of view have the word baby in them once. This is mostly a love song album. But is a most have for any MJ fan or Music Person in general. well enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Gold - Once again.","review":"This album is amazing, the professional union between Michael and Rodney Jerkins is fantastic. I've been a Michael fan since the very beginning and his voice sounds as if he hasn't aged a day. To all critics that have panned his album, grade the music not the person. Could a critic withstand the intense scrutiny that Michael has, I don't think so.Rock on Mike!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"you need some time to get into it","review":"First time I listened to the whole album I thought there were way too many slow songs on it and...basically, the album sort of...sucked except for a few songs.Then, we you get to listen to the songs some more, it gets better and better as you get to know the songs (even The Lost Children). Now i reckon this is one bloody great album. Practically all the songs are fantastic except for You are my life and maybe Dont Walk Away.Standout tracks would have to be Whatever happens, Speechless, Unbreakable, Threatened and You rock my world. I cant seem to get into Butterflies like other people though.I was thinking about the bad reviews he's getting and i thought that the reason crittics hate this album is because they just listen to it quickly through once and dont take time to get to know the songs like other people that bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"King of Crap!!!","review":"to bad none of the young generation that MJ is so desperately trying to appeal to remember the days when he actually had talent. now he needs to enlist the help of like a million producers and songwriters, resulting in a record that sounds so bland and generic it makes me ill.Michael, why dont you just get a great soul band together like you should have done 15 years ago..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Stinks Ouloud and is not true MJ Music Quality","review":"I love all of MJS music but this album stinks. I painfully skipped through songs and dreaded the vocals and the music. Everything he records sounds like music breaking. The songs were not as excellent quality as MJ usually has had in the past. I don't think Sony should be blamed for this mishap. MJ should have known better to put out this album. He needs to get back to the real instrument sound of playing them, not machine creating and better songs. Sorry, but this one is awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be \\"Invisable\\"","review":"Are you kidding me? Where have you gone King of Pop? King of Slop is more like it. This CD is directionless. MJ's work is obviously affected by his spiraling personal life. This CD is not worth buying. skip it and buy his old stuff"},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael Jackson is a one hit wonder","review":"You will not see \\"INVINCIBLE\\" featured on vh1's Ultimate Albums.

His next album should be called 'Granny Beats from Kiddie Land\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, he [is bad]","review":"With the added irony of the title, this musical nightmare of MJ's is to pop music what Battlefield Earth was to SciFi movies. Buy it only for humor and novelty, but don't expect to hear decent music.This is a colossal disappointment, considering how spectacular some of his earlier stuff is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grow up Michael","review":"Well, most of the reviewers here liked this album but most of the world did not. Michael seems to think that it's Sony's fault that this album sold so terribly. He doesn't grasp the fact that people are sick of him. His personality is so outrageous that it's sickening. To say Sony didn't promote his album because he's black is laughable. When was the last time Michael Jackson was black? The real reason why nobody bought this album is because a lot of people still think he's a child molester, people are tired of his superiority complex, the music is just awful and he's a total cry baby now that people don't like him anymore. Grow up Michael and retire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I have this album, and there are 16 song on it. There are about 2 or 3 that are actually good. This may explain why only 2 of the songs were actually made into music videos. This album is only good if you are a HUGE Michael Jackson fan, but otherwise, don't waste your money. It's not going to make you feel the way Dangerous or Bad or even Thriller do after you listen to it. Like I said before, this album is really just for the HUGE fans. Casual fans like myself will NOT like this album. I recommend buying just the handful that are good. To me that was Cry, Privacy, and even Speechless. I didn't care for the others, and unless you really love EVERY song the guy sang, you probably won't either."},{"rating":"2","title":"stunning!","review":"The most beautiful album- The world cannot deny this mans talent.

BUTTERFLIES, BREAK OF DAWN,HEAVEN CAN WAIT,and YOU ROCK MY WORLD. Those tracks alone are worth the purchase of the album. These are great songs. I am curious to know what was people expecting from the gloved one. I still support Mike."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Invincible\\" promotion","review":"First and most important this is a great album. Is it one of Michael's best? I think so but that's up for debate.

Yes!!!, without question."},{"rating":"2","title":"Total MJ Fan","review":"I bought this CD [and his previous albums that have been remastered including interviews with Q. Jones and his thoughts about MJ, the songs that didn't make the cut, the making of some of the songs, etc.] the very next day after watching his September 2001 concert that was aired on CBS 11/14/2001. YRMW got me hooked immediately. I fell in love all over again with him and his performance. It made me realize how much I enjoyed his music and dance since I was a kid. His innocense and humanitarian spirit is at the heart of everything that he does. I love every song on the album, and as always they are autobiographical and the lyrics read like true poetry with no cliches. He's a creative genius and I think that pretty much lets him get by with everything else. ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good album!","review":"We tend to have our eyes caught on his eccentric behavior or stories around his unreasonable death. But we should never forget that he was a great singer and dancer and composer. As everybody feels, because of unprecedented sales of \\"Thriller\\", his subsequent albums was unable to get as much attention as it was supposed to. Please listen to the songs in this album. They are well composed, arranged and sang by Michael Jackson. It really brings his soul and attitude to entertain people. I really feel sorry for his death and sad when I think we will never be able to hear his new songs any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album...too bad some songs were over-produced","review":"Because this album sold the fewest among the grown up Michael Jackson solo era it was considered a flop.

Once again, the King Of Pop has proven that he is the greatest entertainer that has ever lived. Thank You Michael!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than I was Lead To Believe","review":"The songs on this cd is mostly easy listening music. I love to listen to the slow ballads that Michael Jackson sings. You can hear how wonderful his voice really is. I listened to some of the reviews in the media on this cd and I was missed informed. The review said that this cd was horrible. This is why he didn't have the sales that he was looking for. But this is false. I enjoy this cd extremely and I have my twelve year old son listening to MJ's music and he enjoys this cd, also."},{"rating":"2","title":"such a beautiful album","review":"he covers every musical style he's ever done in the past 36 years and put it onto this album creating a diverse selection of music for fans to enjoy though the main focus are his r&b/soul roots that are an element embedded into each track. He also plays instruments on many of the tracks here and works with many producers. I can't wait till his next album I hope he does smooth r&b cause the man delivers the jams."},{"rating":"2","title":"An almost Classic Michael","review":"I disagree with all the criticism this album has received. I found this album to be well produced, and having elements of the classic Michael Jackson I grew up with.While I do not like all the tracks on this CD, (let's be honest, people, you never like all the songs) it has enough to make the record worth the money.\\"Break of Dawn\\" is, in my opinion, the best track on this album. Its just plain good. In fact, all of the first six songs have me listening all the way through them. 2000 Watts is an odd track, seemingly out of place on this album. However, it does showcase Michael without his trademark falsetto.While I have not cared much for the material Michael has released within the 1990s, except for \\"You are Not Alone,\\" \\"Invicible\\" is a good album. I think have of the criticism for this album stems from the fact that this is Michael Jackson. Give this album a chance, and ignore the critics."},{"rating":"2","title":"creative effort from the king of music","review":"This album is a creative effort from the king of music, something that seperates him from other certain family members who could never live up to how amazing and talented he is. With Invincible, he goes back to his r&b roots and offers us some of the best vocals of his career, and combines it with gritty dance-funk and beautiful pop and r&b ballads throughout the album. It's like a potpurri of different musical styles, with each song representing a different colour in the bunch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"One of the greatest things about Michael Jackson is his versatility. Also I think his fame is a symptom of the strangeness that surrounds him. He's not going to be a \\"normal\\" person by the standards by which we measure others. And I think the fault of most people is that they try to look at him as being someone who should be logically accessible as well in our concepts of our own worlds. I really liked this cd and recommend this highly for the beats."},{"rating":"2","title":"People, this a great album","review":"I can't believe why this thing didn't sell more than it did.(10 million copies) It has at least five potential singles that could've made great videos. The best tracks are the first four, Butterflies, 2000 Watts, Whatever Happens, and Don't Walk Away. The worst song is Cry, which goes a little slow for me. Please buy this!!!! You won't regret it!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his best!!!","review":"Bought his latest \\"MICHAEL\\" album from SONY in 2010 on his estate's behalf but I think this album was definitely better"},{"rating":"2","title":"He's Back.","review":"He told us he was bad, then dangerous...now invincible. Definitely vintage Michael. The album consists of your typical up-tempo and mid-tempo tracks and the staple preachy song-in this case, \\"The Lost children\\". (Remember \\"man in the mirror\\", \\"Heal The World\\", etc.) With that said, the album as a whole doesn't break new ground but shows all the boy bands the real blueprint for a pop album. \\"Whatever Happens,\\" a track featuring Santana on guitar sounds like it could have easily been apart of the Supernatural sessions of a couple years ago-- its one of my favorites. Listen to the album, decide for yourself. Is he the invincible one?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Wonderful","review":"When I heard that Michael was coming out with a new album I was a little worried that it wouldn't be great, he has gone through so much heartache from people picking him apart and just being mean.

The promotion for this album was terrible how else would it's release escape the notice of a young female college student? I remember \\"Butterflies\\" and \\"You Rock My World\\" being OCCASIONALLY played on the radio but not enough to establish that Michael had an album out. Anyway fast forward to almost 10 years later and here I am just now discovering this fabulous piece of work! No lie I have been playing this like crazy for the last few months. This totally blows Thriller away IMO and better showcases his vocal range as well as musical stylings. Its a shame that there weren't more videos for the songs on here and shame on Sony for not promoting this album the way they should have. This is a must have CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TOTAL MASTERPIECE","review":"I can't believe some of the bad reviews this album has received...those that have written them really need to give this album a few more listens...i know when i first listened to it, i wasn't all that happy with it...but then again, that is like most albums you buy...very rare do you like an album from start to finish the first time you hear them...anyway...i have listened to this album alot and i absolutely love it..from start to finish...some of the high points for me would be the songs, \\"speechless\\"...\\"2000 Watts\\"...\\"Threatened\\"...these are my favorites at the moment...but believe me, the more you listen to this album, the more it grows on you...all of the songs are great...and i highly recommend this one for any MJ fan. WE MISS YOU SOOOOOO MUCH MICHAEL...AND HOPING THAT YOU ARE AT PEACE!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not his best but a lot better than HIStory","review":"[T]his is a very accomplished and polished album with some of the best songs michael has ever done on it. if you trimmed the fat off this album - speechless, the lost children, the ennio morricone influence at the beginning of that track with santana on it and that awful mutual appreciation rubbish at the end of that song, then i think we'd be left with a classic mj album, though he does need to stop getting awful rappers in on the faster songs. don't walk away is a classic as is you rock my world and butterflies. threatened is truly awful i'm afraid. it would have been a good song if it wasn't for the thriller rip-off dialogue on it. so there we have it- play with the tracklisting a little, dump the soings you dislike and enjoy. anyway i'd rather have too many songs on an album than too few. it would still never be as good as bad though."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Michael at his Best\\"","review":"I bought this CD because of a fan sponsored initiative to get this CD to #1.

This album is BLAZING, it is amazing, it has some amazing beats. It is not perfect, but is close to it. I mean Heaven can wait, Whatever happens are just heavenly. Unbreakable is a 5 stars TRACK. This album contains the best male vocals I ever HEARD!

The one song that touches me the most is \\"You Are My Life.\\" That's one song that gets played over and over and will certainly be fated to be a number one hit. Another cute one was \\"Rock My World.\\" Chris and Michael's banter back forth was cutsy, but a nice touch. Untoucable, the beat was good but I thought the lyrics were a bit self-centered. If this was a lash out at the press song, it sounds a little cocky, especially after all MJ has been through. All in all, not bad. Worth the money spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Comeback","review":"The CD is great. I would have given it 5 out of 5 stars, but I really think MJ should refrain from the inclusion of the \\"kids\\" related songs. It brought the entire energy of the CD down a notch, but at least the songs are toward the end of the CD. Otherwise, I think the energy of the CD is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"A COMEBACK IN THE MAKING","review":"This cd is incredibly awesome. It shows a sensual side of Michael Jackson yet still gives you the fire everyone has been waiting to hear from him again. If he was looking for this album to jump start his comeback into the mainstream of entertainment, then I'd say he's accomplished his goal. The songs give off vibrations of heart, rock, soul and caring. It's right up there with \\"Thriller\\" and \\"Bad\\" as far as quality goes.

Where do I begin? He has shown us he's unbreakable and invincible. Michael's talent takes us to yet another level.The songs \\"Unbreakable\\" and \\"Privacy\\" show us how Michael feels. The ballads are amazing, especially \\"Heaven Can Wait\\" and 'Cry\\".Michael, I love you so much. You are the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Invincible","review":"Michael is singing better than he ever has and the quality of the music in Unbreakable, Heartbreaker, Invincible, and Threatened is crisp,clean,and groundbreaking. If only for the first three tracks, one is tempted to go out and buy the best sounding system he can afford in order to realize the full potential of these songs. Simply put, these three songs are just one big jam fest. The other songs are great too, but I am still listening to the first three."},{"rating":"1","title":"MJ Can Do Better!!!","review":"Please don't get me wrong, I LOVE MICHAEL JACKSON!!!!! But \\"Invincible\\" is by far his worst album yet. I waited in the cold all morning to be the first one to buy it when it came out, but I was very disappointed once I had listened to it.Michael Jackson, in my opinion, is the most talented musician alive today, without a doubt, but \\"Invincible\\" seems too self-conscious. It's as if Michael keeps trying to replicate Thriller's success without taking any risks. \\"The Lost Children\\" is one of the worst MJ songs I have ever heard. He tries to cater to children too much with his music but he has to realise that they aren't the ones that fork over the money for his albums.I'll always be a fan of Michael's, he's the greatest, I just hope he realises that there is a reason why \\"Invincible\\" isn't lighting the world on fire -- because he is capable of producing much better music than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst, believe it.","review":"This is the worst mess you'll ever hear, Michael Jacksons weak voice is drowned out by digital booms and voice alterations not COOL from cheesy rap cameos to creepy kiddies, this sounds like demented elevator music , Butterflies, 2000 watts, The Lost Children??? hated it,.. how corny and weird can you get? is it over for the ol' king. Get some writers under 55 next time. Every track just gets WORSE and WORSE. pitiful"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent come back by the king","review":"Not a bad album at all, atleast in comparison to what's out lately. Could have been better if the slow songs were more about romantic love and happy relationships rather than loneliness and victimization. Otherwise this is dope especially that rock my world joint with Chris Tucker. Yo Michael, next time around hit us with more uptempo songs.Peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talent Invincible!","review":"Even at the age of 42, Michael Jackson hasn't lost his amazing talent of creating pop music at its undeniable best. As the recent single \\"You Rock My World\\" indicates, \\"Invincible\\" is a compilation of Michael at his new, 21st century best; pushing both his musical boundaries and those of his producers to the max. From the heart-stopping rhythms of \\"Heartbreaker\\" and \\"Threatened\\" to the soothing and riveting emotional melodies of \\"Butterflies\\" and \\"Whatever Happens\\", \\"Invincible\\" is not just an album for the fans, it's an album for all those who enjoy great pop music. Its grooves, hooks, and beats seem to to override and usurp the beat of your heart and permeate straight through to your soul. Once again -- and with relative ease -- Michael proves that as the reigning king of pop, rock, and soul, he is indeed truly invincible."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good purchase","review":"first off, micheal's new material is not up to par with the epic works of his past. there are some shining moments on this mostly ballad laiden album.

This album is NO WHERE as good as Dangerous, Thriller, or Bad. He is trying WAY to hard to get a new generation of listeners. Tomorrow he is on TRL on MTV. What is this? This isn't his \\"generation.\\" I think this album should be in the economy bin. Maybe 2 songs on it are decent, but NOTHING stands out like his old albums.

Brandy's Full Moon is So much better!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I've thrown away cd's that sounded better than this one...","review":"This album is by far the weakest noise to ever come out of the Epic/Sony studios. Michael should wise up and hire Quincy Jones to be his producer again...kinda funny that all of Quincy's MJ productions were smashes... I listened to this disc twice- once in horror, the other in disbelief. I immediately took it back to the store and demanded a refund. I've been in the music biz for 20 years, and I've never heard such a terribly overproduced massicre of an album like this one. DON'T BUY IT! YOU WILL BE SORRY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Invincible? No - Pretentious? Yes!","review":"Unfortunately, it seems that Michael Jackson's personal suffering and would-be martyrdom is playing itself out in his public life and in his music. Unfortunately, neither is even remotely interesting. I wish him all the best but I think musically he's done and generally has nothing more to say. I hope he finds peace so that he no longer feels the need so subject the world to his artistic mediocrity."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a journey!","review":"This album is an awesome progression of music as Michael journeys and grows. This album has so much heart and energy, it will blow you away! The way Michael writes makes him a true genius, it gives anyone the ability to parallel to his songs for they are not specifically written but soft edged so they have universal meaning.This album will bring out the heart in you and as it did to me, make you wanna dance and release the love."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Action than Mystery","review":"In general, the book is good. The plot flows well and the main characters are well-written. However, even through the book starts with a murder, the identity of the killer does not stay hidden for long. By about halfway through the book, the details are revealed and the book turns to how to convict the killers. There is nothing wrong with the way it was done. However, it takes away a lot of the suspense.In general, this is a good book. But I am not sure it really classifies as a mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow....","review":"What a book! I first heard about this book through Prophecy in the News website and I was very interested in what Mr. Horn had to say about this subject.

I for one would not waste time or money to buy this book, unfortunately I did both waste the time and the money on this book.

Really just a cut-and-paste of various facts and theories, lumped amongst some very poor fiction. The characters are all one-dimensional stereotypes, and the central character (\\"Joe\\") just seems to want to kill anyone in order to get his own way - is this Christian; or how about trust in Jesus? I would think that Christian fiction, whatever that may be, should at least lead the reader to a sense of deeper faith or wanting to know more. This book does neither. Beware ... deception at work. This book is will only leave you with the empty feeling of having wasted your hard-earned money and more importantly, time. It troubles me that some very smart people have put their name to this.

It goes into possible last day scenerios that most of us never even consider and does it in such a way that you believe it could happen that way. Scripture and comments included in the book makes this scenerio seem even more possible. A look at genetics that will make even the most tough skinned person shiver. A great book.

It was mostly a layperson's guide to petroleum geology. About a third the way thru' the book diverged from its premise - that we are running out of oil - and didn't return to it until the last few pages. The author is trying emulate the feat of his mentor - Hubbert - who in the 1950s managed to predict US oil production would peak in 1970 when others said it would last forever. The really interesting information, what we are all going to do after 2004 when the oil supply peaks - was missing. The projections of shortage were based on statistical extrapolation of existing oil fields. Of the emerging oil fields in Siberia, the author says \\"there is no oil in Siberia - only gas\\".

New one stopped working Aug 1, 06 and still has not been fixed and it is almost three weeks later. I do get to talk with lots of people at tech support, Kari, Shawn, Keo and Kristin. All of them are really sorry about the fact that my treadmill does not work but, they are not able to figure out what is wrong with it and get it fixed. They sent me two different parts and two different service companies. Unfortunately neither one could fix my machine with the parts sent and both service companies complained to me about Horizon. So, if you are lonely and like to talk to nice people who are really sorry, buy this machine and you can talk to tech support for Horizon for days, weeks and I am sure longer. Machine looks nice, when it works it is ok. When it does not work, it makes you feel stupid for buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The best Electro Industrial Band from Canada","review":"Some argue that it is the FLA and Puppies of the world.

You would think that a product designed to be portable would be a bit more rugged.Even after having it repaired, it continues to flatly refuse to play some DVDs while others seem to work fine.

Inevitably, at a peak moment in the movie, it will freeze and skip. Once that starts happening, forget it. It will never recover, so the only option is to shut it down. Even then, good luck in getting it going again. I am not sure why it skips. At first I thought it was due to movement, but seems to be able to take movement for the most part, and will skip even when perfectly still. I have also tried cleaning the discs, but that doesn't seem to help. I have decided that it is because this player is a piece of junk. It is so frustrating trying to watch something and have it act up for no apparent reason. I have been tempted to toss the thing against the wall many times.

The music is in the era of very early Jimi Hendrix recordings, except of course Hendrix could express himself a hundred times better than Scofield on the guitar. My second thought is that Larry Carlton has played these kinds of sounds producing incredible guitaring, whereas Scofield seems so uncomfortable trying to get through each piece. He sounded like a novice improvising poorly, and didn't seem to really get into the groove of the tunes. In conclusion, either Scofield should not be playing this kind of music or else he is not as good as everyone seems to be telling me. Ritenour, Carlton, Coryell etc would blow Scofield away if they played on this album.

The batteries have a very short life and a very long charging time. If you accidentally leave them on the charger it will distroy them.

For light household use, the driver's pretty much average for a 12v, but the saw and sander eat up the poor capacity NiCD's pretty quick. Forget about replacing the batteries, too, since they are the same capacity as the originals, and about $50 a pop!

You should not compare the saw to 500+ watt pendulum saws, but the convenience of no cord is superb and it does feature a roller guide.In Australia it comes with a one hour charger that works well, and as a bonus the drill and saw work (suprisingly well) with older 9.6 volt B&D; batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea but awkward to use","review":"I received the Multi-tool B&D kit and I was encouraged by the concept when I opened this xmas gift. A sander, drill and saw all in one! But when I started to use the Multi-tool I realized this tool is not well engineered. Changing from one tool to the next is clumsy. The tool is way underpowered. In the saw mode, the Multitool bogged down when cutting thin wood! Also this tool is much too loud suggesting poor gear design. I did find the sander handy for corner sanding. Also the drill is good for low torque screwdriving. The final issue I had is how hot this tool gets even in light duty jobs.My wife will be returning this tool. I prefer dedicated tools that deliver in one application."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four years of good light to medium duty jobs","review":"I've owned the Multi-tool for four years, and recently had to replace one of the original batteries.

Recently we've added a room to the back of the house 19'X10' and again the driver did a fine job. Now we are gutting out a closet a bathroom and laundry area and combing them into one large bathroom and again one fully charged battery will last most of the day driving screws.

What do all these talented sopranos have in common? They are all true Verdian spintos. Angela Gheorghiu does not belong in their exalted company. She may be, one day in the far future, an equal to Renata Scotto and Mirella Freni, but definitely not equal to the aforementioned Verdians. She has a light lyric soprano that is pleasant to listen to, but she does not have a spinto voice. She perhaps could pull off Gilda and Desdemona in the opera house. However, she should not under any circumstances tackle Elisabetta, the two Leonoras (one of which she has already sung), Ada, Amelia, and Elvira.

She should stick to that repertory."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst Verdi recitals in history!!!","review":"Angela Gheorghiu has a small voice. She should not be tackling these great spinto arias that Verdi wrote. Her voice is just too small and weak. Her \\"Pace, pace mio Dio\\" is underweight vocally. There was some digital fakery going on in \\"O patria mia\\". Shame on this Rumanian whoreslatch for resorting to studio tricks in order to \\"sing\\" the high C. This guttersnipe singing Verdi spinto arias is like Maria Callas trying to act funny or Rita Streich singing Brünnhilde's Immolation Scene from \\"Die Götterdämmerung\\".

Of course a fantasy (almost a nightmare).FOr instance, I think the way how she approached to the Leonoras and Aida, it's good.I like Gheorghiu's voice, but it looks as her worst enemy has choosen her repertoire for this CD.

In any case, it was just what we wanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for College Students","review":"This is one must-have item for those living in dorms where you have neither a kitchen nor are you allowed to bring up a stove lest you set off the smoke detectors and have fire trucks coming after you :DIt boils water really quick and you can heat up all your canned food/instant noodles in this pot or boil eggs too. The possibilities are somewhat endless.There is no auto off button but it doesn't bother me the slightest. Treat it like a normal pot where you're not supposed to leave the stove and you'd be fine. Just pull the plug out when its done boiling or set it on low if you want to keep the contents warm.Its cheap, its efficient, it does almost anything.For a poor college student like me who face lots of restrictive cooking dorm rules, this pot is just perfect.*used it for 2 months now and it shows no signs of rust in case you were wondering about that. I make sure to dry it after every use though and not leave any water in it overnight."},{"rating":"2","title":"tonight i feel like elvis longing for his longlost twin","review":"This is just a great CD - smart, touching, weird and funny lyrics, haunting melodies, great instrumentation.

Nobody twists the English language as well as Clem Snide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another very good album....","review":"It's not quite as strong as \\"Your Favorite Music\\", but this is still one of the best things I've heard this year. I think it's worth the purchase for the song \\"Ice Cube\\" alone, easily one of the best and the catchiest things Clem Snide has done yet. Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daniel Thonon's Beautiful Music","review":"This CD is fantastic, even though it only has a couple of new tunes that he doesn't already have on another CD. If you don't have the other CD, then buy this one. If you are a lover of diatonic accordion music, then you can't go wrong listening to Daniel play so beautifully.

I especially love the quick adjust buckles to secure the straps to your stand. These aren't the standard friction-type buckles but rather a flip up / lock down buckle that makes adjusting strap length very easy. A great product - I'd buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice straps for the price","review":"I ordered 2 sets of these from Amazon. I have been satisfied with all the Allen products I have ever bought. These backpack straps are padded and adjustable with plastic adjusting buckles. I added my own quick release steel clips($1.79 for set of 4) for fast disconnect from the stand. IMO these are the best value in treestand backpack straps bar none."},{"rating":"2","title":"From South Florida to Florence Italy","review":"I was browsing for my first time on Amazon.com and I was extremely happy to see that Gary Clark CD is now available through this great medium. Some time ago, I bought several copies of \\"Simply Grand\\" after a Gary Clark live performance in Boca Raton Florida. I have taken some to my hometown, Florence Italy. My family and friends here and in Florence, love artistic musical expressions of high level. Gary Clark does just that. \\"Speak Softly Love\\" is powerful, moving and original. It sets the tempo for superb and exquisitely arranged performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can tickle ivories with the best of them!","review":"Seen Gary perform live.

Turns out the whole album is fantastic and makes a great listening experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Grand II is quite simply the grandest!","review":"Gary Clark's opens Simply Grand II with \\"Speak Softly Now\\" which reminds me of one of those old German Music Boxes. His version of of \\"Castles on a Cloud/On My Own\\" reminds me of raindrops falling. Clark's \\"I've Got a Crush on You\\" was a jazzy rendition. \\"What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life\\" was melancholy but at the same time hypnotic. \\"Theme from 'Ice Castles'\\" is Clark's feel-good inspirational contribution to this CD. \\"Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man,\\" \\"I Will Wait for You,\\" and \\"Tenderly\\"sound like a harp being played. \\"Love is a Many Spendored Thing\\" really showcases Mr. Clark's talent. \\"People,\\" \\"My Reverie,\\" and \\"Amazing Grace\\" are whistful and soulful. \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" shows us Mr. Clark's dramatic side. This CD has something for every mood so I hope this review will encourage others to buy it and enjoy it as much as I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Sentimental to the Spiritual, Simply Superb.......","review":"\\"Can't Stop Loving 'Dat Man\\" brought back memories of nights in New York, martinis, the city lights, and a very good friend.

The only reason I'm writing this review is so the next person like me(a true jazz fan), won't get burnt. I'm stuck with this and two other of his cd's becasue nobody else was brave enough to tell it like it is. Gary's an easy listening pianist just like Davis Osborne, in the liberace tradition... If you like over the top liberace style paino go for it, if you think Kenny G is jazz, fo for it, if you have muscial integrity and like sophistocated jazz with touches of improviation or creativity stay the heck away from this cd or any of Gary's cd's, your lookin' in the wrong palce.

It's a good ensemble-type show. I like the secondary characters as well as the mains. The dialogue is well written, and supports development of and interaction between characters. It's very light on forensic information, but there are plenty of shows that cover the bases on the science of crime-solving. The Mentalist sports a more unique method of figuring out who done it.

They would actually have to make improvements for me to call them amatuerish.

The edge glass was all intact, though cracked.This glass is apparently tempered, as all the glass pieces were roughly rectangular in shape.It's too bad that Swiss Diamond doesn't warranty lids, as I'd surely get this one replaced under warranty.

The sixth time I went to use the tool, it seized and smoke came out of it! Total life of this unit was about 15 minutes. I bought it more than 60 days ago so the retailer will not exchange it. I have written to Black and Decker through their web site several times. I have not heard anything from them. I realize, I may have a lemon.

I checked to make sure that I had all the parts in place and tried again. This time it did start. I tried it this morning and it won't start at all. I am sure it is the juicer because I have tried different outlets and taken it apart and put it back together multiple times. :( Up until now I thought this was a great juicer @ a great price.

But cleanup is pretty awful especially with soaking wet pulp and all the juice left in the basket.

I am so tired of fighting with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good Juicer-----","review":"I have been juicing for a very long time. Our old Juiceman finally is not wroking properly after about 15 years- however the juice from that is still way more dry than the one from this juicer. The liquid pours out the top and when you pull the plunger back to put in new fruits and its sprays juice everywhere. The pulp catcher is way to small and the strainer gets clogged very easily. Its a disaster. I used it twice and boxed it back up for return. It is made out of very cheap flimsy plastic. If you are looking for a sturdy juicer to use for years if you are a serious juicer- this is NOT it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Inefficent","review":"Received this item and put it through some trial runs - apples, grapes, mangoes, strawberries, and blueberries. On all items, there was a large waste of juice. It did virtually nothing to the mango, and left large unprocessed chunks on the others. Other reviews talked about wet pulp, but I thought it would be minor. I would say 10-15% of the juice remained in pulp in most cases, and 90% with the mango. Like I said, a lot of large chunks of fruit were in the pulp bin unprocessed. Based on other reviews, we thought this might be adequate for our use, and the low price helped. However, the waste will far outweigh the low cost. We are returning this juicer and will upgrade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice looking, Inefficient","review":"I've had many juice extractors before and this one defenitely looks better than most of them and is reasonably priced. Unfortunately it is an extremely, i mean extremely inefficient machine. The pulp it leaves is not just wet, it is soaking with juice. Even lightly squeezing that pulp with hand produces a lot of juice, which this machine could not collect. It is no wonder it happens though, just take a look at the extractor mechanism and the first think that comes to mind is \\"hm, this must miss a lot of juice\\" and indeed it does. I would return it if I could and get a better machine, as I am paying almost twise as much for produce for the same amount of juice. The only question I have is who writes all those reports praising how good a machine this is, probably Warring itself.Do not buy this machine, look for something else, you can hardly do worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"something to talk about","review":"I was pleased with the preformance of this juicer.I had had a different kind of mixer given to me before and that one did not compare to grace and accuracy of this beautiful juicier. I found myself finding reasons for wanting to use this juicer. It was also easy for my children to use and clean up after. When I use a product the clean up is also very important and for that it won my heart. You will also find it conveinent to clean up after and to use. You would also find this great as a gift for someone.If you know someone who enjoys the kitchen work and not all the messy clean up then here is the gift of all gifts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jammin' Juice from a Leaky Loser","review":"I bought my boyfriend this juicer and he rushed to the grocery store to buy fresh fruits. We bought some very yummy oranges and okay apples from Fairway. Very excited to make this juice. We had to spend a bit of time chopping the fruits to fit into the narrow shute. The machine itself was very easy to use. Just put in the fruit and turn the motor on. However, as it was making juice, it splattered all over the place and drips of juice began to leak out of the seam of the front panel. We took the machine apart to make sure we assembled it correctly -- we had. The design is severely flawed. Quite disappointed. Now we're on line checking out other brands.... However messy this rumbling machine, the juice, as mentioned above, was JAMMIN'!"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 star juicer at very low price","review":"Ive had this juicier for a few days now and I am extremely please with it. Ive juiced carrots, beets, celery,kale spinach and broccoli and I haven't had any problem with any of these. I haven't done fruit yet as I have cancer and it is recommended not to use fruits because of the sugar. It is very easy to use and not loud at all. Cleanup is a breeze, just be careful of the blade as it is very sharp. All in all a great juicier and I'm happy I purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"It works but not well.","review":"We purchased this juicer about 5 years ago; we had it about two years before it killed over. It does work and the price is affordable but you get what you pay for as the more often true than not saying goes. It is quite loud and you do not get much juice from it. Cleaning it was OK. We have upgraded to the Breville BJE200XL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"This thing is worthless.

After one use, it's going back.It's a nice looking unit, but out of the juicers I've tried it is one of the messiest.The lid doesn't seal well and pulp ends up getting on everything within a 3 foot radius of where you are working.There is also no dedicated pulp \\"bin\\" like some other units. The pulp just ends up in the area around the juicing screen. This is fine, but there are a lot of little nooks and cranies to clean here. Also, the pulp builds up very quickly.I juiced half a pineapple, one apple, and 3 oranges. I got about 20oz or so of juice. After this, the unit was packed full of pulp and required cleaning.I would not recommend this unit at all for folks without a garbage disposal (it's the only way to get it clean)."},{"rating":"1","title":"works good for a while, but it's not all that great","review":"This juicer does a good job at juicing but leaves a lot to be desired. The opening isn't wide enough and you have you cut up everything to fit, then it doesn't juice everything and huge chunks get wasted. The blade is hard to clean and the pulp holding area is not very big so you have to stop in between if you are doing a large batch of something. After a while the unit becomes VERY difficult to open and close. I recently broke both of the bones in my arm, and now with my weaker arm strength I cannot use this juicer anymore. It's good for muscle men, but for people with injuries, women, or elderly people I would not recommend this juicer, get one that is more user friendly."},{"rating":"2","title":"leaky but easy cleanup","review":"I just got my juicer and use it everyday. It didn't move around but leaks a little. It also spits out small pieces of fruit, like grapes, if you don't put the pusher into the feeder fast enough. Cleaning is indeed easy, not more than 5 mins usually. And the most time is used to scrub the mesh, remove the pulp and wipe my counter because of the leaking. But overall, I'm keeping this juicer and enjoy juicing everyday."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst","review":"Weak, very hard to clean and messy. Total waste of money. I own it for a couple of months and looking to replace it. The only good thing about this product is design. Is is pretty cool. If you're looking to decorate you kitchen and not going to make any juice, go ahead and buy it, otherwise pass it on."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE product","review":"This juicer is poorly made, pure and simple. The pulp container is difficult to put on and take off. The lid to the pulp container does not secure completely and juice leaks down the sides. Most importantly, the juicer is started by a tiny, fragile safety knob located on the bottom of the pulp container. When this tiny, fragile part snaps off, as it inevitably will when you're fighting to disassemble the thing, the juicer will not start, and a replacement pulp container will run you a whopping $25. Do yourself a favor and go with a juicer that doesn't have a locking pulp container like this one and stay away from Waring products whenever possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke from the start, no word from company","review":"I got this as a gift in Oct. I finally got around to trying it in Jan. The top cover was broke and so the motor won't engage. I contacted Warring about a replacement and have heard nothing. Even registered the machine online. Would love to juice but I guess I won't be doing that anytime soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"I returned it","review":"I bought this thinking that it was a good priced juicer. I used it and was initially happy with it. However after using it several times I actually noticed that the plunger that you use to push the vegetables down into the grinding basket actually had pieces scraped off of it. Also the shoot where you put the vegetables into is small as others have noted. I ended up buying a masticating juicer. I would recommend springing for that if you can splurge for it. It get more juice out of the vegetables and is much easier to clean up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"We've had two of these and they both failed. The locking mechanism is made of plastic and breaks off. I used it lightly--maybe once every couple weeks at the most. Waring did replace the broken piece once (i paid shipping) but it failed again in the same place, so I'm done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money- Waring Pro Juicer JEX328","review":"This Waring Pro JEX328 is IMO a waste of money. As I should have remembered you get what you pay for. There's still lots of juice left in with the pulp and large pieces of whatever it is you are juicing .... in the pulp container. It's in my Goodwill box right now though I shouldn't wish it on anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inefficient","review":"I bought this item because of the price and high ratings it received on Amazon. When I got it though, I used it and realized that it was leaving behind a LOT of pulp that was still VERY juicy. My final verdict is that I should have shelled out the extra $$ up front because in the long run, it'll cost me in wasted fruit.Overall I'm disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too weak. Have to cut up fruits and vegies real small","review":"This juicer is very disappointing. The feed chute is very narrow so I had to cut up my fruits and vegetables real small. I had to use a lot of muscle just to push a carrot down the chute. I hardly got any juice out of my carrots. I had a breville juicer that I gave away to my sister that didn't require too much pushing, plus it squeezed out a lot more juice. This juicer also leaves big junks of fruits in the pulp container, and the pulp is very wet. Not an efficient juicer at all. I gave it 2 stars intead of 0 or 1 because it's not very noisy, plus it does work, if you're willing to spend lots of preparation time to chop up the fruits, or use some muscles to push down the chute, and waste a lot of good juice. I'll be going through the trouble of returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it! Love it! Love it!","review":"This is my third juicer -- the first two were very cheap models with only about 140 watts of power. This 400 watt-er quickly and efficiently juices anything you put in it. I got it for a great price at Sams Club. The motor is quieter than my cheaper brands and far more powerful. The pulp is relatively dry and clean up is very easy. The only minor problem is that the juice streams out SO QUICKLY that it does splash out of the stainless steel cup that is provided -- but that's a minor inconvenience I can live with. I'd highly recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of juice","review":"The juicer does the job but wastes so much fruit and veggie juice. After juicing when I open the top I can squeeze the leftover pulp and there is sooo much juice in it still that didnt even get into the cup. Also large chunks of carrots and celery dont even get juiced you can see them in the pulp. This is not a good veggie juicer it seems to do better with citrus fruits. The top feeder is small so you have to cut all fruits into small pieces. Its alot of work to use this juicer!!! Also the inside blade is hard to clean and there are always chunks left on it no matter how long or how hard I scrub it. Please Try a different juicer... You get what you pay for in this case!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Using it since 2006. Working exceptionally well.","review":"I have this juicer since 2006 and never had any problems. I would definitely recommend this to everyone. I bought it only for $22 (\\"refurbished\\", $31 with shipping). Considering such good price It has been doing its job very well which exceeded my expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great . . . but isn't.","review":"I got sucked into buying this by its appearance of \\"industrial strength.\\" It has been a big, big disappointment. Cleaning is easy on the non-rotating parts--just rinse them right after using. The mesh rotating thing is an entirely different matter. It's an absolute b*tch to get it clean, even right after juicing. Waring supplies a cleaning brush (another reason I bought this machine), but it is a joke. It's useless, repeat, USELESS, for cleaning the mesh. The only worthwhile thing about this juicer(?) is the stainless steel cup that comes with it, and that's not worth what the juicer costs.It's junk. Don't waste your money. Spend more and get better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Juicer!!! Why Buy Anything Else?","review":"Received my juicer and wow, what a deal! so much juice and so little wasted juice! pulp is barely moist. does a great job on carrots and apples. I was surprised how powerful the 400 watt motor is and it comes with a 5 year warranty! I purchased mine for only $44.00 new from Macys on Amazon, what a deal, I should have gotten 2! Im glad I didnt spend $350.00 or more! Why buy anything else! get one and see what I mean!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Juicer!! Don't let the low price fool you!!!","review":"I bought this juicer in an effort to become healthier. In any event, I was not sure if I would like juicing or the clean up, etc. Therefore, I did not want to make a significant investment. To my surprise, this juicer works wonders!! Not only does it juice just about anything, the clean up is a snap!! I have been using this juicer for about two months now, and I am still loving it. I would highly recommend this product to anyone interested in living a healthier lifestyle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable and does great job!","review":"Have been using this juice machine for 5 years now.

I would strongly recommend this juicer to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good juicer!","review":"I bought this juicer a couple of a years ago and it wasn't good at all. It wouldn't juice anything correctly. I gave it away and didn't buy one for a while. So recently I just bought the Breville BJE200XL 700-Watt Compact Juice Fountain and it's AMAZING!!!!! Now this is what I call a juicer at an affordable price. It juices perfectly! I've had it for 3 days now and used it a couple of times and it's amazing. I don't recommend the Waring JEX328 at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous, Poisonous. Amazon to please delist this hazardous product.","review":"This Juicer has a top cover that is cast in flexible plastic. It's so poorly designed that the plastic is far to flexible and touches the spinning blade when you press down on the vegetable with any force at all. The pieces of shredded plastic end up \\"somewhere\\".The juicer has that characteristic smell of melted plastic when left out of use for too long -- this is extremely unhealthy. Consult one of the recent popular documentaries about the effects of plastic poisening on people's health.The plunging hole is very small. You'll often find yourself having to slice a vegetable down the middle to get it to fit in.Vegetables easily get stuck in the hole. Then you have to press down hard -- and get shredding plastic again.My experience is only with the typical things one would juice: carrots, apple slices, celery sticks. So I am not trying to juice anything exotic w.r.t. my comments.This juicer should not be in production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy and wasteful","review":"Easier and healthier to eat a fresh apple or carrot.

This was our choice based upon reviews carried by Amazon.com. We juice about 2 lbs of carrots each day and it runs wonderfully. We have no problems, it does not over heat, cleans simply, doesn't need filters and looks great. We would use it more, but just haven't been home that much. You might buy a juicer with greater capacity, but not one that is any more satisfying to own. By the way, some customers have talked about how the housing leaks some when juicing. We have had no such problems at all. Enjoy.."},{"rating":"1","title":"looks good, but broke!","review":"This juicer looked sturdy and was affordable.

I like the stainless steel cup (no juice stains). The motor very powerful (400 amps) and is holding up well; I've juiced lot's of fruits and veggies so far. The strainer is a snap to clean (I recommend you use an old tooth-brush instead of the brush they give you). Cleaning the pulp after use is also a snap.Cucumbers, apples, and pears go through very easily. Red beets take a little work. Carrots are easy, but make up the majority of the pulp. Also, too many carrots will clog up the pores in the strainer (so be careful) Romain lettuce and parsley are a little tricky. I recommend folding and juicing it first, then any fruits later. I tried cabbage; big mistake (it stinks). And, do not mix grapefruit with any veggie juice (the high acid with veggie juice tastes aweful after a few days in the fridge and is just bearable fresh).Overall, and excellent addition to my lifestyle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice looking but very inefficient!!","review":"I got this juicer as my wedding present back in June. I was very excited to use it. However, it did not meet my expectations at all. It leaves pulp with lots of juice still in it. I tried carrots and celery sticks. This Waring juicer leaves some chunks of my veggies. What a waste! I planned to use it on the daily basis, but it is a pain to clean. Yes, the parts do come out easily, but the cleaning is a big mess. It takes me a long time to clean after each juicing session, especially the mesh. Juicing is healthy, but I would recommend another machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great juicer","review":"This is my first juicer. After quite a bit of research, I decided to go with this one. I've been using this juicer for about a month, and I am very pleased with it. I agree with one comment on using a toothbrush instead of the the brush they give you. It cleans the filter, and especially the teeth on the blade very well. It does leak out of the seam at the top a little, but I notice this happens when I am juicing cucumbers, bell peppers, or fruits with high liquid content. It doesn't leak when I juice carrots, spinach, ginger, and other things. Not a big deal. Overall, a great product. I use it almost every day. Very easy clean up. Looks great too. Definitely worth the price guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value For The Money","review":"I will start by saying that I am not an expert on juicers. However, I know a good kitchen appliance when I try it. I just tried this juicer and I made a variety of juices. It handled everything I wanted it to do very well. Some juice from the oranges I juiced did not drain into the cup, but I am told that is to be expected. It kind of hung out at the bottom of the \\"basket\\" with the pulp. This seems to be a very powerful, economical, and easy to clean juicer. I was impressed at how quickly and easily it was doing the vegetables, especially the carrots. The basket and surroundings pop out for easy cleaning. A minus is that some juice tends to leak out the front seam near the top of the appliance at times (especially with the oranges). Over all, I would recommend this juicer to anyone who wants a cheap but good appliance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Juicer!!!!!!","review":"Enjoying my juice. This is a great product.

The New York CD is more upbeat and contains an incredible collection of good track from unknown artitst (not including Schiller).Overall, I think this is money well spent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Got just what i ordered.

Korn are one of my favorite bands and I didn't want to hate anything that a member of the band does. But when I listened to this CD, my first reaction was to laugh, and then it turned to sobbing. What was in Fieldy's head that made him think this CD was good? No offense but come on, this CD really stinks! I can't imagine anyone actually enjoying this CD on a regular basis. The production is great and some of the beats are as well, but the downfall of this album is truly Fieldy's lame lyrics and his very annoying voice. Add the two together and you get a tragedy from every perspective. If you are looking for some great rap/hip-hop albums, I recommend Wu-Tang's \\"Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers),\\" Outkast's \\"Stankonia,\\" Ice Cube's \\"The Predator,\\" Cypress Hill's \\"Black Sunday\\" and Dr. Dre's \\"The Chronic\\" and \\"The Chronic 2001.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"OH...

Unfortunately this isn't the case. Fieldy's voice sounds like a poor-man's Snoop Dogg, with lyrics that sound like they've been written by an uninspired Cypress Hill.

And then the lessons move on to more complex pages like maps, forms, frames and timelines. I loved all of it!

I know me, and if things get described in too much detail, I tune out. This book was just what the doctor ordered. It contained step by step instructions on how to complete specific tasks. It covered settting up sites, adding graphics, forms, tables, frames, animation, timelines. Everything I needed to get started. It went through the steps in a very easy to follow way.

BUT such things as a whole chapter about Solomon's guess (all \\"Beethoven Scholars\\" have one) as to the identity of the Immortal Beloved, to whom Beethoven wrote (but may not have mailed) an ardent love letter -- then no real attempt to make this supposed relationship relevant to the man's life and work. More fuzzy stuff about Beethoven's attempt to become guardian of his nephew. Spare me.If this is the \\"definative biography of Beethoven,\\" lord help us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beethoven: Down the Garden Path....Again","review":"One would think a revised edition would correct the errors of the past, but here is an exception. Most of the mistranslations, misinformation, and inaccuracies of the original book have been carried over into this version. Although soundly criticized by mainly European scholars, this book continues to dazzle American academicians who have never bothered to double-check the primary source material from which quotes have been taken. Truncated quotes, misquotes, and half-truths support theories which the information in original form would have easily shown as false. The psychoanalyses included are ludicrous and often based on misrepresentations of facts. A strong caveat to all readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry and Pedantic","review":"I was amazed at how little my interest in Beethoven's life translated into any attachment to this book. I've been reading it off and on for over a year, during which I've zipped through other more engaging books. I keep going back to Beethoven in the hopes that it will take off but it never does. It reads much more academically than it has to - I've encountered much greater depth in far more accessible styles of writing. Although the book is fairly recent, it reads as if it were written in the early 20th century. While there are interesting facts presented, the weight of the narrative style demands far greater effort than the rewards of putting up with it give you in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much pseudo-psychoanalysis","review":"A generally interesting, and presumably authoritative, narrative of Beethoven's life and music is too often de-railed by whole chapters of amateurish, armchair Freudian psychoanalysis. It is further side-tracked by the long-winded pursuit or trivia [for example, an entire chapter (40 pages) of stuffy prose evaluates alternative theories on \\"who was his \`immortal beloved'\\" -- who cares? her identity is irrelevant].The New York Times Book Review may think this is \\"a landmark of Beethovian scholarship and interpretation\\", but in my view, the narrative frequently suffers from a rather pompous style of pseudo-academic writing. A good edit is clearly warranted. Not really recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable and boring","review":"I found this book unreadable and extremely boring. It was so dense with meaningless detail that the narrative flow virtually ceased - the endless inclusion of irrelevant detail sucked the life right out of the book for me. After a while I began skimming the pages in an effort to escape the onslaught of useless details. Although this book claimed to be a biography about a life, the writing style itself lacked life. I have read several books by Ron Chernow who also writes biographies and Chernow proves that you can be scholarly without sacrificing readability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Botched production","review":"This box set offers examples for any kind of music that Sun Ra and his Arkestra made. Unfortunately, the liner notes are full of orthographical mistakes, the cover illustration is horrible and the sound quality often is the same. It's a bit very expensive for that. But if you focus on the music, it's worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible sound quality","review":"This might be great material, but who can tell?

I was afraid to give it a try. This book gave me basic enough information that I could understand it and follow it. What do you know, the hair cuts turned out ok.

They are similar in size, but they stack much higher in the cupboard. The color is yellower/brighter than it looks in the picture. In any case, they are attractive.

When I received it, I found it to be a piece of junk. It is made in China, and it is HORRIBLE! It just doesn't work. The keys don't work right, the space bar was bent and sticks, the carriage didn't work right, the color selector typed letters black with red smears. The instructions are horrible. It arrived in pieces and I had to \\"fix it\\" to get it to type anything. The best thing to do with this typewriter if you order one, is to take it from the delivery man and throw it in the garbage. Typical Chinese made junk. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I realize that manual typewriters are a thing of the past, but I got this new for my elderly mother who likes to type letters. It was a huge mistake! I tried it also, and the action is mushy, the keys uneven in the touch they require, the left margin didn't work and the replacement ribbons come only in black/red and are very short.

But just remember about your karma, when doing any type of spellwork"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I bought this books several years ago and for some reason just got around to reading it. The spells were very simplistic and the affirmation were wordy. I found the formatting annoying.

The layout of the spells should have been conducive to having the book open if that is what the author recommends.If you are curious buy used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ethics?","review":"A good collection of simple spells. However, I'm only giving it a star. It briefly discusses \\"Ethics\\". Yet it offers spells such as \\"TO WIN THE LOVE OF A *CERTAIN* PERSON\\"?

Use your best judgement."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent source for simple spells","review":"Janina Renee performed a work of magick in itself when she wrote this book. The spells and instructions within it are simple and understandable for anyone interested in Magick or Tarot. The wide variety of spells is also a treat if you are looking for any one specific thing. Money spells, love spells, even spells to bind trouble makers, this book has it all. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked for me!","review":"I totally recommend this book. I just bought it over the weekend since I have tarot cards but always wanted to use them for something more than readings. I tried the love spell and action spell since I was currently having some issues with my boyfriend. The next day I receive a page from him saying 'I love you' and he's never said that.

Amazing I can't even remember the headliner, maybe Tears for Fears. I've never heard an Adventures song on the radio, and I suspect 99% of music fans from the 80's never heard of this band. But if you can find this CD at a reasonable price, pick it up.\\"Another Silent Day\\" and \\"Raindrops\\" are solid tracks, but \\"Always\\" and \\"Love in Chains\\" in particular are high energy, and almost haunting in their harmonies and production.A couple other tracks are worth a listen as well, but it seems the band ran out of creative energy on the later tracks.

This teenage girl thought the worse thing that could happen to her would be her artsy mother embarrassing her yet again. Then, her father - the \\"normal\\" one, the parent she chose to live with after the divorce, the optometrist - becomes the epicenter of a scandal.I read this novel when it was released in 2002 and it haunts me to this day. To say this is simply about what happens when teenagers realize that their parents are people too would be accurate, but incomplete. This book is an absolutely amazing story of a girl, a family, and a violent crime. Stunning."},{"rating":"2","title":"A slow moving book, but still very full of powerful emotion.","review":"In The Queen of Everything, high school junior Jordan MacKenzie has many problems including her dysfunctional family, her strange school life, and an annoying boy named Kale who just keeps following her. This book starts out a little slow, but after a little while, it becomes hard to put down. The plot line is amazing and very well thought out, and the characters are very realistic and true to life. This book has very true emotions and it will have the reader laughing and crying right along with Jordan as she discovers life's lessons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book","review":"I loved this book. You didn't want it to end. I can't wait for her next one. My book group read it and there is alot to discuss for book groups. I disagree with the people who said it was slow and agree with the people who thought it was the best. Jordan was just like a friend of mine and her mother. I know a hundred Kales and he reminds me of so many guys. I wish she would do a sequel. This book was different and awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Queen of Everything","review":"Very slow, TOO MANY WORDS!! The book does not grab your attention.

She wraps decriptions up in descriptions and you lose sight of the original point. Mind you, if this wasn't targeted for teens (I am a teacher, always looking for awesome bookd to reccomend to my students) it is a rich read. If I were in high school trying to read this never ending metaphorical mess of TOO MANY words there would have been no way I would have gotten through the first chapter. Now, a little more grown-up I can somewhat appreciate it--but still, for an AWESOME story idea, there are TOO MANY WORDS and she tries MUCH too hard to 'show' her story."},{"rating":"1","title":"You are what you eat...","review":"This review is geared toward parents who monitor what their kids read...My 13 year old daughter checked this out because it was on her A/R reading list. I thought by the cover art and the title itself, that the book was worthy of my inspection. I did a speed read through this book and was disgusted with it. I realize kids passively hear and see \\"mature themes\\" everywhere and this is why this type of material doesn't come into our home. This book has lots of profanity, detailed teenage sex (including the main character losing her virginity), murder, adultery, and plenty of good old teenage hatred toward everyone over the age of 29.That said I realize not everyone shares our tenets of living. This book is typical of what you would see in an R rated teen movie. If you allow your kids to watch R rated movies, then this book would be allowed I'm sure.

The climactic scene in which the converted monk sits at night talking to his former fellow soliders who are behind a tall chainlink fence (they are now in a POW camp waiting to be shipped home to Japan) is one of the most moving moments I've ever experienced.

One of the great - and timeless - aspects of this work is the blending of so many styles, plus great musicianship and lyrics.

Ali plays similarly on both, producing a constantly changing stream of complex rhythms, the basic pulse implied rather than stated. Lowe's tenor doesn't have Coltrane's power and intensity but his less unrelenting, more varied approach has its own attractions and taps into a wider tenor tradition. There is no great sense of Ali and Lowe listening to, and feeding off, one another. Rather, they manage to do their own things without getting in one another's way. But they do it superbly and if you're into free jazz grab this record before it disappears again."},{"rating":"2","title":"One riff heavy disc","review":"Past is Prologue is one riff heavy disc.

In one of those rare occurances where 2 different recordings exist for a single revival, it's great to be able to compare Shields and Wills with their predecessors (Donna Murphy and Jennifer Westfeldt). Brooke Shields gamely brings her own spin to the role of outspoken self-reliant Ruth, and her \\"100 Easy Ways to Lose a Man\\" is full of comedy and mirth. Jennifer Hope Wills has a glowing and lilting soprano voice which suits the numbers of Eileen to a tee. The rest of the cast remains the same (only the tracks of Shields and Wills are new, the rest recycled from the 2003 album). Not essential if you were satisfied with the Donna Murphy effort, but one can never have too many recordings of this heavenly score."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster Brooke Shields","review":"No one in his or her right mind would purchase this recording after hearing the Donna Murphy revival. While I actually have a lot of respect for Brooke Shields as a comic and \\"pop\\" dramatic actress, I was extremely disappointed with her acting and singing on this recording.

This album is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many \\"Wrong Notes\\" in this rag","review":"Although Brooke Shields recived positive reviews in her run as Ruth in Wonderful Town I was VERY VERY disapointed with this recording, I think it is just verry simpal Brooke Shields is no Donna Murphy. Considering that Brooke Shields isn't one of our better vocalists, it is still a load of crap. Beyond Shields' and Wills' vocals, the rest of the recording remains the same as it was with Murphy and Westfeldt. Several tracks are untouched from the 2004 edition; these include the overture, \\"Christopher Street,\\" \\"Pass the Football,\\" \\"A Quiet Girl,\\" \\"Ballet at the Village Vortex,\\" almost all of \\"My Darlin' Eileen,\\" and, but for a spoken line or two, \\"Conquering New York\\" and \\"What a Waste.\\"BUY THE ONE WITH DONNA MURPHY- A REAL BROADWAY STAR"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"This album makes me upset.

The choice of background trips to illustrate the points is also very correct."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious And Ultimately A Bore","review":"Sorry to disagree with so many here but I really wanted to enjoy this. I've read other works by the author that I thought were very good and I believe he is a very talented and thoughtful writer.In this book his reflections on his travels seemed joyless and trite. His interpretations of the artists and what they were conveying through their work didn't always seem to ring true to me. I kept reading hoping this would get better but I was disappointed. When he describes places he visits the people who inhabit them are strangely absent from his reflections. As a frequent solo traveler I believe you don't know a place unless you know at least something of it's people but the author seems to avoid human contact as much as possible to indulge in his intellectual fantasies about the meaning of the most trivial details. I think traveling with him would be a bore. Sorry but in my opinion this is a classic case of missing the forest for the trees."},{"rating":"1","title":"One half interesting, the other half excruciating","review":"I somewhat enjoyed Mr. de Botton's philosophical meanderings of past thinkers, poets, artists, etc on the subject of travel. But I sure as hell would never travel with the guy! What a geek this guy is! Describing his travels to the Bahamas where he gets into a fight with his significant other over dessert was bad enough. But by the time I got to the passage about how he was afraid to dine alone in such an amazing and vibrant city as Madrid, lest he be mocked by the locals, it was too much for me to read on. His credibility as a travel writer is gone. I am now trying to sell my copy on this site.

Nice to see a keen mind at work on his subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't resonate with me","review":"Alain de Botton attempts to describe the emotions and sensations of travel, but his impressions didn't ring true for me. An example: he is in Madrid, and he complains that he feels \\"self-disgust at the contrast between my own indolence and what I imagined would have been the eagerness of more normal travelers.\\" Consequently, he stays in bed, finally leaving his room only because he doesn't want to encounter the maid again, who keeps trying to clean his room.I get the impression that de Botton has problems. An interesting book could have made about this topic - a neurotic traveler coping with the rigors of travel - but as ruminations on \\"the art of travel,\\" the book doesn't work for me, simply because I don't share his reactions to his environment or his seeming inability to enjoy himself.I recently read an interesting article by Alain de Botton on the art of conversation. I do find him a compelling writer, though this book was not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"It all comes down to the bedroom.....","review":"This is a lovely little book that, unlike painstakingly detailed study-guides to foreign parts, gives you just enough to whet your wanderlust. What separates De Botton from others is his lovely, fey sense of humor. There are passages in this book that are, quite simply, a lot of fun...and there's nothing wrong with that. He poses the questions: Why do we travel? Why should we travel? What is wrong with \\"travel\\"?. Travel is awareness, connection, imagination. Great to have a book with illustrations..."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Themes designed to deepen the joy of traveling\\"","review":"A truly remarkable book, loaned to me by a traveler friend. De Botton goes right to the heart of the matter, asking why we travel as opposed to offering more of the same tired and often untrue where to travel advice. He takes a selection of distinguished writers, artists and thinkers and parallels their experiences while traveling with his own in a novel fashion, organizing each chapter around themes designed to help us appreciate travel-and to help deepen the joy of traveling. It is the kind of book that you'll find yourself underlining apt passages and clever sections that capture ideas about the art of traveling you may have held-yet never expressed so well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feeble","review":"If you want your travels informed by head-up-the-wazoo literary pretension, this milquetoast is your man. Excerpt: \\"The result was a rich green foliage in an almost perfect circle, like an archetypal tree drawn by a child.\\" No matter where this guy goes, he harks back only to his library and museum-dwelling. There is a dearth of first-person social interaction described in any locale of which he writes. Read travel books instead by those who can soak up the local color, and interact with real people, and be transformed by the experience.

The Delos release called <Love's Joy and Sorrow> (DE 3249) gives us 16 examples of why violinists turn to his scores not only to show their virtuosity but for a source of \\"crowd pleasers\\"--which is by no means a derogatory description. Moscow-born Julia Krasko, accompanied by pianist Olga Kondratieva, does full justice to such lightweight and sentimental pieces as \\"Caprice Viennois,\\" \\"La Gitana,\\" \\"Syncopation,\\" \\"Liebesfreud,\\" \\"Toy Soldiers' March,\\" and other short pieces, some very familiar, some perhaps less so. All very pleasant and highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't live up to my expectation","review":"The ideas represented in the book is good and may probably work very well in an assembly line environment. But the authors, being from a production/assembly line environment, doesn't make it very obvious how it will work in a service environment or an \\"unusual\\" environment like mining. It therefore has limited application. Having said that though, some good ideas can be taken from the book. I also expected a lot more professional presentation from a book like this. There are huge amounts of typo's and one sometimes need to first figure out what the real numbers of the figures are that the text refers to.

I had figured Tachikara is reputable company and my first flat ball had to be a fluke. Nope. I got the exact same ball with the exact same results.

You will have a high probability of getting a flat ball right out of the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Inflate","review":"The ball comes deflated, so you need a pump to inflate it. I inflated it so that it was semi-hard, but when I tried bouncing it, it didn't bounce well. Also, if you pump up the ball enough so that it doesn't feel flat, and compress quite a lot if you press into it, it is a lot heavier than normal balls. The ball looses air very quickly.

This ball is taught but also has good feel and touch making passing more accurate. The ball does not make your arms red during an intense pepper session or when digging a frontal blast.

This really just compiled information with no finesse. I'm a Black male and numerous articles say Black males suffer disproportionately in bad labor markets or when old skills become obsolete. That is the one way in which this book could have use four decades after its publication: speaking of finding jobs or skills for disempowered bruthas.

Free your mind. You are from the same crop of people that vilified jazz when it first appeared on the music scene. All great artists have surpassed their forebearers and mentors and made something new, something fresh, something that makes you look at the particular medium in a whole new way. RTC has done just that with jazz. Songs from the Smoking Section is an excellent CD, it has more of the groove I have been looking for from the likes of MMW.

You would be much better off comparing RTC to the likes of Lou Donaldson, Donald Byrd and Richard \\"Groove\\" Holmes. These artist started to explore how jazz and funk can interrelate.

We've got your domed cities, your hardscrabble farmers, your barbarians, and all the trappings. Add in a stranded pilot who has to make an uneasy friendship to get back home, and you've got Mad Max in Philadelphia.Luckily, N. Lee Wood is a good enough writer to pull it off. Both the main characters are fairly unpleasant people, but well-fleshed out with motivations that make sense in context. The setting is also well thought out: you're never really left shaking your head in disbelief.A warning: this story has a couple of fairly brutal passages, including several rapes from the perspective of the protagonist. Probably not a good book for a 13-year-old.I'll bump the story up about a half star just because much of it is set in Philadelphia, near where I grew up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good edition","review":"As MW is an established go to reference for more than a century, I won't comment on its content.

After reading several reviews about various editions of this book, I came to a conclusion that I should buy an expensive Oxford edition for its clarity and durability. But, I wanted to try a cheaper version for my student phase before investing on a more expensive edition. Surprisingly, this edition has a very good print clarity.

It did take me quite a while to get into the music but now that I've heard the disc a dozen times or so, I find it to be about as good as I originally expected.There is less of the blues and more of the jazz here but that does not detract. My favorite tracks are the hard-driving Watching Your Every Move which features some searing sax and guitar work and Hidden Agenda which is carried by Jack Bruce's otherworldly vocal style. Spooky But Nice offers some memorable guitar work by the legendary Mick Taylor. And throughout the CD, Heckstall-Smith's sax virtuosity is on display.My only criticisms of the album are that it lacks direction and cohesion and that Mayall, Green, Taylor and Bruce were not more widely featured.

Classic super mario, looks great and plays a little better than the original, and playing the other classics with enhanced graphics is a lot of fun. The only downside to this game is the lost levels selection. This particular part of this game is one of the all time hardest most difficult play in nintendo history, which is ok if you are an experienced gamer and desire the challenge. But if you are just looking for fun, don't even think of trying this selection. Just stick to the other mario adventures and you'll be fine. I will never forget how challenging those levels were.

We get the three original Mario titles here, and the Japan-only \\"lost levels\\" that was actually their Super Mario 2. All games have been spruced up to 16-bit standards, with improved graphics and audio, and an added save feature.There's really a lot of reasons to still own a Super Nintendo, and this cartridge has four of them.

The good thing is you can save your progress because you can't really beat these in one sitting and all of the games are compiled together.

The only parts that were worthwhile were the sections on Julia Child and on the evolution of Betty Crocker. But I thought Shapiro went on WAY too long about Poppy Cannon, with too much biographical data that really didn't have anything to do with Cannon's work or her influence on cooking. Too much of the book just seemed to be laundry lists of yucky-sounding '50s recipes and failed products by the food industry. And I thought her efforts in the final chapter to draw similarities between Betty Friedan and Julia Child were bizarre. That made no sense to me at all, and it seemed to me that she only did that to end the book on a provocative, pseudo-political note.

What appears to start as a tale-based journey back in time quickly degrades into a familiar feminist lament of under-appreciation and under-representation.

THis grill is nicley constructed (in the USA!). The grill has a nice edge or rim to it so that food does not roll off of grill into the fire. It has a heavy, two-piece (with heavy threaded connection)mounting rod and has a heavy bolt that allows grill to be positioned anywhere up and down the mounting rod to adjust height of cooking over fire. The grill comes with a oven mit, a hot pad and all fits in a carry bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lighthouses and lifesaving are not mentioned.","review":"I believe the book I ordered was about lighthouses and not book of pictures of old homes in Maine.Please let me know if I received the book I ordered.Did anyone read my review!!!!

The manual was essentially worthless and skipped many important basic points. The tutorial was un-doable. I eventually tossed it aside in frustration and tried to go it alone with the menus. However, the menus are not intuitive and few buttons have mouseovers to tell you what the icons (some undecipherable) mean. This is an exercise in sheer frustration. Old-fashioned pencil and paper beat this program any day.

If you enter an eighth note and a half note at the same spot, it shows both as an eighth note! The picture on the front is very misleading - the music sample they have shows a half note and quarter notes at the same point and you can't enter it that way. (It plays OK but doesn't look right at all!)Totally useless for entering music for printing.

The fact that this collection was published is the most horrifying thing about this entire book. The great majority of the stories are incoherent and poorly edited (perhaps the editor cared for the material about as much as I did). A fellow reviewer described the tales as vague and that's the perfect adjective to use. The stories are not particularly frightening either, although some were certainly disturbing. Save yourself some ducats and test drive it for yourself at your local library.

Peter Berlin is certainly that. But there is so much more to Peter Berlin. Peter ist kunst. (Peter is art.) And given that fact he warrants all of his self-indulgence and all of his narcissism. I saw the documentary today for the first time and I am still flying high because of it. One critique though - Peter states that he regrets not having done more with his life - I don't agree with this view - when one is art one needn't do more than be. Few of us can justify that. Peter does. Buy this terrific document!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sort of a mediocre mystery / soap opera","review":"Boy, what a disappointment. I was expecting a cool, L.A.-based mystery novel that would be rich in atmosphere and suspense.

As a big fan of Faith's, I'm really sorry I helped pad this guy's pockets by buying this book. He sensationalized episodes in her life to the point that I got totally disgusted with the book. Also, he apparently does not like her husband, Tim McGraw, at all because he certainly spends plenty of time giving a one sided view of the legal troubles for Tim brought about by an overzealous sheriff and his deputies. Keep in mind that this is an unauthorized biography, and Faith was not interviewed for the book. He's trying to sell copies, so therefore, he's bound to stretch the truth repeatedly. In my opinion, he more than stretched it at times, he just made it up as he went along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Proud Contributor!! Thank you James L. Dickerson","review":"Hello:James L.

I am really sorry for the Streisand fans who adore her, but truthfully she stinks. Other than the BROADWAY ALBUM which was a throwback to an earlier style, she sings terrible songs;the worst pap imaginable this side of Tom Jones.I'm sorry but I have Dinah Washington and Ella and Frank on the CD carosel along with Diana Krall and giving this CD to my aunt who adores her, but Aunt Clara please be fowarned put the ear plugs on, the CD transfer is painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"not enough hits","review":"Even as a fan of Barbra, I think there are only on few songs on these two cd's that I look forward to hearing.

One of these is 'Have I stayed too long in the fair?'Streisand sings with drama and with schmaltz.

The beaters don't do all the way to the bottom, and that is what makes the bowl spin. I also have a sunbeam stand mixer and that one works great! This one will be going back to the store and be replaced with something else for sure. I don't want a had mixer that takes up so much space, because that's all I would be able to use it for. The bowl is also 10% smaller then my other stand mixer's bowl. I'm sure this is one of those cases where you get what you paid for......the thought was there, I'm happy my relative tried to help me out as far as my cake business goes, but I wish we could have checked it out of the box before making the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"I received this mixer last Christmas after begging my mother for a mixer. She eventually bought this mixer at a store as a present.When I got it, I was excited to find out what kind of mixer it was, so I came to Amazon and hardly found any good reviews. Needless to say I was worried that my mother wasted her money. Anyway, I read the instruction book thoroughly, and I have been using it very frequently since. It works perfectly, and the bowl is a gem. The only problem is that the bowl is a bit heavy, so I hardly use it. Also, the mixer really cannot handle large amounts of dough as it gets caught between the two whisks. Everything else that persons were complaining about such as burning out the motor because they were trying to mix chocolate chips into a batter is all in the instructions manual. It's a great mixer for the low price, if you read the instructions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"I bought this at Walmart for $17 last week, just wanted to try a mixer before spending $200 for Kitchenaid. I don't recommend for anyone, but it is little better than a hand mixer. Most of the times you need to lift the bowl so that mixer mixes evenly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too weak for bread dough","review":"I have to agree with the review \\"Awful\\". I recently got this as a gift. Since it came with dough hooks I used it to knead my bread dough. The mixer did a fine job for nearly 5 minutes. Then it started to struggle and smoke started coming out of it.It is nice to have an inexpensive stand mixer, but I wouldn't recommend using it for anything but cake batter. Throw away the dough hooks, they will only kill it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"I got this for Christmas a year ago and I was really looking forward to using it because I really like to cook. Wow.. was I ever disappointed. This thing is a piece of junk. The cord gets in the way all the time, you can smell the motor when you've been using it heavily and it's so lightweight, you have to be really careful that it doesn't slide off the counter. Spend the money on a good mixer.. this one just doesn't cut it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be tempted by the lower price!","review":"I seldom write reviews, but I really feel like I should warn people who might be considering this. I wish I had saved my $45.00 dollars and put it toward a Kitchenaid.I can't even mash potatoes with this mixer! There are so many potato chunks that don't get mixed in because the beaters don't reach down into the bowl far enough. Same with cake batter. I can't even imagine trying to do bread dough with this.Please save your money and buy a better mixer! I wish I had researched these machines better. I just saw it for a good price and picked it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"ready to return","review":"I am returning this mixer after using it once. It takes quite a bit of scraping the sides of the bowl with a spatula to get everything mixed in, and the stand is so lightweight, it moves across the counter as you're scraping. Moving the shifting lever does the same thing. The mixer lockdown button is inconveniently placed and awkward to push. Right out of the box, I could not get the mixer to stay on the stand and had to manually push the spring loaded button from the underside of the stand. You can not see the beater release button with the mixer in the up position without turning the mixer around to the side. On any setting other than the lowest, there is a painful to the ears high pitched whine from the motor. For my limited needs, I will probably go back to a Kitchen Aid hand mixer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I loved this thing when I first got it.

It is so light weight and flimsy that it does not do a good job with something as simple as a cake mix.

I read all the other reviews and still bought it against my better judgement."},{"rating":"1","title":"hamilton beach mixer","review":"I do not like this mixer. The bowl does not turn.

I didnn't want to spend a lot on an expensive mixer plus most of the large ones do not have a removeable head which I like. But the last mixer of similar quality I owned the bowl would turn while you mix and to me this is an important feature.

I had this sitting in my cupboard for a long time as a second mixer. I decided to try making bread for the first time today, and I was happy to find that this mixer came with bread hooks. I (wrongly) assumed that this meant that it could handle bread dough. After about 2 minutes, I noticed that the mixer was beginning to smell bad. I looked over and saw a little bit of smoke coming out the side. By the time I walked across the kitchen to the mixer, the motor had died. This mixer is a lot like my cheap HB hand mixer, so I am guessing it would work ok for cakes and other thin batters. But I wish it would not have come with bread hooks. Then maybe I would not have assumed it could handle this kind of a heavy dough, and I might still have a working stand mixer. Dear Hamilton Beach: please do not include bread hooks with your product if the mixer is not made to handle thick doughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfied customer.","review":"I did not rate this product because I am totally dissatisfied with it. When I pushed the button to let the hand mixer down, it flopped and caught my little finger in the hinge and I had 1/4 in. blood blister on my little finger for almost 2 weeks. It was very painful and I had to continue working to make my holiday cookies and cakes. It is no more than a hand mixer on a stand. The hand mixer is too heavy to use alone. The beaters are about an inch from the bottom of the bowl; therefore, you have to continually use a spatula to move the ingredients to make them mix properly. I have a HB hand mixer that is identical to the one that came with the stand mixer but is light weight and I like and use it a lot. The stand mixer did not live up to my expectations. I will return it for a full refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"Do not buy this mixer if you bake in small batches. I added 2 eggs and 1 cup of brown sugar to the bowl but the mixers didn't even touch the ingredients. I had to take the mixer off the stand and use it as a hand mixer. The mixers only come to within 2cm of the bottom of the bowl. I wrote to Hamilton Beach to express my dissatisfaction but did not hear anything from them. STAY AWAY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay Blender","review":"The blender had to be shipped back to Hamilton Beach for repairs. We had the blender expire while making cookies. This was only the third time we had used the blender. The previous complaints were avoid similar models and go with a more powerful blender such as the 64695. I would have preferred just purchasing a kitchenaid to start with. Tech support is good - we are awaiting the replacement model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely horrible.","review":"I bought this mixer on an impulse and I really regret it. The motor burned out and it stopped working not even halfway through mixing my first batch of peanut butter cookies. The burning smell was lovely and so was the 1/4 mixed batter that I had to mix by hand. Absolutely disappointing.Additional problems;-It did a terrible job of mixing when it was on the stand. The \\"agitator\\" at the bottom is useless and doesn't help one bit. I ended up using it as a hand mixer until the motor burned out (which wasn't long at all).-When there was any batter on the mixer it was too top heavy to stand upright next to the bowl and would flop forwards into it.-The \\"quick burst\\" button is also useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your Money","review":"I was like alot of people I fell for the product name and their reputation....

It's fine for simple cake mix, pancake better, but not much else. It has less power than my hand held mixer; the cord does get in the way, and if you try to prop it up, be careful .. it will fall over. If you can get it to stay propped up, the beaters are away from the bowl -- ifthere's anything liquid, will drip outside the bowl. Save your pennies longer and buy something better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy - better to save money for another one","review":"Hamilton Beach Hand and Stand Mixer - 64695I got this because I wanted a stand mixer for all my baking.

Even when it was working, it did not get to the very bottom and I had to constantly scrape the sides to get the mix down. The rotating feature did not do very well.The time that it blew, I was mixing a double batch of sugar cookies. It could not handle even that soft mix, luckily I never tried to make bread with it....I checked the site and it's hard to even get it serviced because you need the receipt and I did not have that still since it's been over 6 months.

The tale is predictable but emotionally engaging enough if you're in the mood for it. The tale centers on a female coach in the 1970s who takes a team of college girls and turns them into basketball pros. At the same time the Catholic college is having financial problems of its own. The neglected husband who at first resents his wife never being around is bland and overdone in the movies but that's another story.At the end you get some black and white clips of what the coach and the college girls went on to do. Interesting that several of them were inspired to become coaches for female teams. There's a very strong working class Catholic setting in this movie so be okay with that or you won't enjoy the film too much.

But when she takes the underdog girls basketball team all the way to the national championships, those who previously doubted her begin to take notice.

And it wasn't because it was really good; it was mostly because I found it horrible. I mean the main character Jan puts herself down because her best friend is named an \\"It Girl\\" in this major magazine but she walks around thinking that she's pretty much irresistible to all guys. When I got to the end, I was pretty much not surprised by the ending. I mean don't get me wrong, some of the stuff in this novel was actually pretty funny but I just couldn't stand how one moment she would be conceited and have these out of the world scenes play in her mind and then the next minute she's thinks she's better than everyone else. Jan's character seems so one dimensional. Her best friend and her love interest seem to have more depth. Personally I didn't really like the novel but maybe it's just me?

It is true that the plot of Confessions of a Not It Girl was based on the fact that Yahn has no love life compared to her best friend, but I found this book to be a disgrace. It made underage drinking and smoking sound o.k. and glamorous, which is by far very untrue. It promoted a lot of things that teenagers should not be tempted to do or try. The media tempts teenagers enough, but this book should have been different. It should not have promoted drinking or smoking, and I would not recommend it to anyone. The book is airy and does not have much of a point to it either.

Gruesome details of an axe murder were part of the lyrics, delivered by Genesis P Orridge in a monotone, deadpan delivery. Scared the hell out of me. I had to pull over at the next well lit convenience store and go inside. True story. What remains on this album is much the same. Anti-pop. Truly scary, intense music, with no regard to traditional song structure or melody. This is one of the few bands that I consider not only radical and alternative, but also incredibly influential. Possibly not the best place to start, if you are new to Throbbing Gristle ( I'd recommend DOA or 20 Jazz Funk Greats, as they are slightly more accesible). But an enjoyable, if unsettling listen, nontheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swiss glass lid","review":"We really like having a square lid.

There is also a few minutes of live footage of the band that simply runs along out of sync with the studio track... it's a dis-satisfying blend.

You got it backwards, Akira Toriyama ripped off Monkey Magic (which is based on the story Journey to the West) and added a bunch of random stuff. Monkey magic is the actual story. So to all the haters, DBZ has way too many games anyway, and this is the reason this game being made was good.As a game, it is a pretty good puzzle game, giving puzzles which are challenging and involve the use of magic and other abilities to proceed. The fun thing about this is that the game effectively gives you \\"cheat modes\\" which get unlocked as you advance in the story. You get infinite mana and infinite lives, for instance.4/5 overall because some of the better abilities (such as the jet cloud and power rod) are difficult to use, and one of the puzzles in the celestial heaven is was so difficult to solve that I got stuck and couldn't finish the game.

In order for a broadway song to be sung, they have to be sung from the heart. Barbra does just that. You need to be able to capture the mood of the scene in which the song does, and Barbra also does that. She excels very well and vocally it is amazing. My favorite is her version of Somewhere, simply wonderful. This album is essential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Barbra Doing Her Simply Best!","review":"As Barbra returns to her roots, one can not help but feel the passion behind each piece on the album. Her delivery is crisp and full of animation. One of the all-around best albums of Barbra's career, indeed. Broadway never sounded so good! All thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Work of Art","review":"This album is no doubt Barbra's best, as some of the most incredible tunes from Broadway are masterfully sung by the most incredible musical artist out there. The first song on the album, Art Isn't Easy/Putting It Together, is a great opener, followed by Barbra's gloriously powerful vocals in such memorable numbers as: Nothin's Gonna Harm You, The King and I Medley, and a mesmorizing Somewhere from The West Side Story. Barbra's Broadway Album is a timeless treasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insipid & Disappointing","review":"This album was especially disappointing since I have been a Streisand fan for many years. I still recall how electrifying her early albums were in the 60s. I played them so much I wore them out. On this album Barbara gives a lackluster performance. She goes through the motions but any emotion is gone. One gets the sense that she is just doing a job to make money and all the passion and love for her work are gone. She just does not get into the songs the way she did when she was younger. This current album is all technique but the spark is gone. It actually sounds more like elevator music than something you would intentionally listen to. The arrangements are insipid and she seems to misunderstand the meaning of the lyrics. The selection from West Side Story comes across like an upbeat children's lullaby. Barbara is just out of synch with the composers' intentions. In this album she blew it and the whole experience is disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"My car cd player never sounded this great","review":"The quality of this cd is stunning.

Clearly, she is at home singing these Broadway tunes. She sounds so fresh and vibrant, I do believe her voice is in full bloom, the pinnacle of perfect singing in this album. Every track is amazing.But the best track in this album is Somewhere, produced by David Foster, engineered by Humberto Gatica. Even after 20 years, it doesn't sound dated or \\"80's\\" and each note is undiminished with each passing year. Her voice is like how Krupp Diamond would sound it could talk. Clear, radiant, luminous, breathtaking.If I Loved You, Not While I'm Around, and Send in the Clowns are all strong and unforgettable tracks.Even if you're not a Streisand fan, it's difficult not to be astonished listening to this album..."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS CD HAS THE RIGHT VOICE, BUT THE WRONG SONGS.....","review":"I have many Barbra cds and have enjoyed them a lot over the years. This particular cd is not one of my favorites. Let me explain! Why in the world artists try to record songs that most people don't rally like or enjoy is a mystery to me. This time Barbra recorded a lot of fairly new hits from broadway, but these songs are not what i would call the \\"back bone\\" of broadway. They don't have the strong melodys that the older songs have. I wish Barbra would record the big hits of thePorters, Berlins, Rodgers', and Kerns.

Is this merely the result of a basically untrained natural talent succumbing to an international career?

The Fat of the Land doesn't hold a light to this one, and I like that album too.This group has been around when the Techno/Undergrounds days were just that, undergrounds. This album reflects all of that. They are a few of the godfathers for this type of music,(ACEN, Moby [When he was good],Altern8, etc.) This album still holds its ground as one of the best calaborations ever laid down on wax.

Before I heard this record, I was familiar with 'Smack My Bit-- Up' off of the Fat of the Land. (Annoying lyrics - Great jam!) So here, we are exposed to a couple of versions of Jerico, Wind Me Up, etc.The music is all from the early 1990's.

Network Marketing is a legitimate business not a get rich quick scheme. Unfortunately too many people sell it as the latter and this time Zig goes along.

The color was as close as I could expect with the age of the vehicle. Once I removed the factory piece, the most difficult part was to re-install the dash vents. As they are spring-loaded, it took a little time to properly install them. The radio cage went in easily, I installed the kit in the dash (it uses the same mounting set-up), ran the wires to the new head unit and slid it into place. It looks factory installed, and didn't take long to put in.

Basically setting her up for an \\"accident\\" Sharon soon discovers that her time is running out so she takes her 5 year old son and stages their death and takes the new identity of a woman who has been long dead but could pass for her twin sister.

Even though they were both suspensful, they were not as well written as this book. This book is so superior in it's writing that it is hard to believe the same author created it. The characters are well developed and the protagonist, Sharon, is so loveable. I found myself rooting for her and almost crying out when I thought her evil husband, Paul, would catch her at something she was not supposed to be doing! This was an intense read and I could not put it down! I never wanted it to end and the characters became as real people to me. That is a sign of a great book.

The protective screen kept coming off of the phone.Now this could be due to poor installation from my part, how would I know, it didn't come with and instructions.Also the Sound quality is poor after applying this sleeve.

It seems as if whomever designed this case completely disregarded the idea that the iphone has a minimalist design. The case makes the phone bulky and inconvenient to carry. Sure the ridiculously large hunk of silicone sticking out of the back does the job of storing your earphones, but it also adds about 3-4 inches in width!

It covers the front-facing camera and makes that unusable. The cutouts are off by too large a margin - either the wrong size cutouts or misaligned with the phone controls. The mold to wrap and hold wired earbuds is just silly. Firstly, only the original Apple ear buds fit properly. Secondly, the wires and buds are not protected from snagging or kinking.

This book, however, was very offensive to our Catholic audience. There is no way in knowing the experience the author has had with the Catholic Church, or where he is getting his facts but it is not a true or favorible translation. His opinions were offensive and incorrect, especially the chapter on Mary. It surpised all of us that such prejudices still exist in the Christian genre, but we quickly found out they do.

John MacArthur's seminary, Master's College in Santa Clarita, CA does not allow women to enroll there.

It will sound too, too, Catholic. Ewwww!I once read a book by an elderly and faithful Evangelical who opined that he cannot ever recall hearing a sermon on the Blessed Virgin in all of his decades of worship.

You will learn so much more both about the women involved and yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"12 Extraordinary Women","review":"I bought this book for a church bible study group. We had also read and discussed 12 Ordinary Men. The group enjoyed this book and had great discussions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I have led numerous Bible studies, and this book has been a real disappointment. The writing lacks balance, is often disorganized, and even has an \\"anti-women\\" tone to it. I find myself having to work all week to plan our study, to supplement what he's written. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"This book is COMPLETELY based on opinion. I would not recommend it to anyone. In the chapter on Mary the author goes into a completely unnecessary rant about Catholicism, which I found incredibly offensive. It seems the author just wishes to push his closed minded agenda with this book, which is really unfortunate as I was looking so forward to reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Decent Start on Women of the Bible","review":"MacArthur's book is suitable for light reading and simple discussion. However, I would not suggest this book if you are looking for a deeper and in-depth study concerning the theology of women. MacArthur is well accepted and intellectual no doubt, but this book failed to reach its potential. Little historical background, cultural context, or word studies of scripture are taken into consideration to support his views. The mere fact that he only lists two sources weakens his liability on such a heavy topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful is the best I can say","review":"I read and enjoyed MacArthur's Twelve Ordinary Men but found this book extremely distasteful on many levels. We used it in a women's bible study group and none of us have enjoyed it. It's extremely sexist in nature (and believe me, I'm not usually sensitive about that sort of thing). The About the Author section in the back pretty much sums up his attitude through the entire book when it writes John is the father of \\"four children (all married)\\" as if being married is the sum of their identity. And as other have said, not only does it not include the Catholic view, it goes so far as to say regarding some Catholic views that they are \\"arrogant presumptions.\\"I'm a fan of MacArthur but cannot recommend this book to ANYONE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good book","review":"I did not care for this book. Some of the content in this book is not only wrong, but insulting! The chapter on Mary is particularly offensive. I could not even read it.

We had wanted to study the women of the Bible. I looked in a variety of places for such a book, and was pleased to find this one, which seemed to take a scholarly view of the topic. Not so. We find this book hopelessly chauvinistic. But worse, the author does no real research into the women he selected; he simply gives us his interpretation of what little information exists in scripture. In the chapter on Mary (mother of Jesus) he totally ignores Mary's development as a true follower of her son, and instead goes into a rant about the Catholic worship of Mary. I will say that the book has provoked a lot of critical thinking on our part, because we are so angered by the author's version that we are forced to scrutinize the scripture for evidence to build our own view of each woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't hesitate to read this book.","review":"Very interesting and well written.

You can pick it up, open it to any page, and understand what Ed & Barry are trying to tell you.Their Ginsuisms are insightful, and their stories are fantastic and often funny. Why learn the hard way?

This is exactly why I so rarely watch a t.v show - the tendency to make Christians look like moronic idiots.

You can't help but fall a little more in love, every time you watch it. And yet, neither does it make you want to vomit from the romantic wit on display, but rather from all of, the more and more, hair raising guts and gore the writers provide the viewers with every week.

And you can sure tell. He is not afraid to give his opinion on anything and everything. Isn't that what you really need from a guidebook? If I want a sanitized version, I can get that for free from the tourist bureau. I like to know if a company is dispreputable or if a hotel is unsafe--especially for a woman traveler.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Short History of One of the Longest Lasting Empire.","review":"This book shows that the Ottoman Empire lasted over 600 years because of their tolerance and idealism that promoted freedom of religion and speech that was unseen in the world during the time. It's important to note that propagandists who do not like the Ottoman Empire and the author's views on certain small subjects dealing with the Ottoman Empire will likely give negative ratings, but these are understandable, since few historians have covered the topic of the Ottoman Empire, since it is the most under-researched empire in history."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely dry","review":"The book moves through so many people so quickly that it is difficult to follow what is being talked about. The names are unfamiliar, the places are unfamiliar; and the maps often don't name the areas being mentioned. The font is extremely small and eye strain is also a problem. This type of material is what makes history unpalatable. I have discovered since leaving school that history is fascinating, but one needs to be able to learn about the times, the people and the places. Just dates and events, with people never being fleshed out is extremely boring. I was very disappointed in these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"To be used with great caution","review":"This, the second of a two-volume work, ought to have been a standard history of the Ottoman Empire; it falls far short of expectations, however, due to the very large number of simple factual errors it contains, as well as the authors' bias toward nationalist Turkish interpreations of the recent past. This imbalance consistently permeates the book, wherein the authors seem to see themselves as having to \\"defend\\" the Ottomans against their critics, and is most extreme in the treatment of the Armenian Genocide. (The vehemence seen in some of the reviews below evidences the strong and partisan passions that beset this issue; while the authors' language is more temperate than that of some of the reviewers, they are not much more objective.)This book, long awaited by Ottomanists, proved to be rather an embarrassment to the field when it appeared. Readers should be aware that it is both unreliable and very partisan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Using the DAN Pocket Guide","review":"I bought the DAN Pocket Guide hoping that I would never have to use it. Unfortunately, I was present when a serious diving accident occurred. The guide was handy, because it was attached to my slate (being able to be taken underwater) and it proved invaluable to the first aid providers. It helped define the type and extent of the DCI and reassured the (non-professional) attendants that they were doing everything they should to help the patient. And the patient survived with no lasting ill-effects (after recompression in a chamber)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money paid.","review":"This is basically a very expensive simple first aid guide. If this book only cost $5.00 or less it would be worth the money. This book goes in depth about assessment, which is great, but it does not tell you what to do about items that are found abnormal in the assessment. The information in this book is very vague.

I thoroughly enjoyed this sequel to Safe Harbor. Radclyffe takes the inexperienced, but faithful, Reese and the jilted Tory down the road of starting their own family. She also explores the relationship of the young lovers Brianna and Carre as they begin to cross over into adulthood. Radclyffe delivers turmoil, mystery, problems with pregnancy, relationship fears, and so much more. This book takes the reader on many emotional highs and lows, and is highly recommended by this reviewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where is Book 2?","review":"You deserve fair warning before starting this book -- there has got to be a book 2 coming. It's a wonderful story written in the expected, beautiful McKillip style -- but it ends with some pretty big unanswered questions!

Now I will have to wait a year or two to find out what the consequences are for playing that bone pipe!"},{"rating":"2","title":"McKillip's prose is her music","review":"While the plot may seem standard (exile comes back to his homeland to reclaim/set right his heritage), McKillip wraps original layers to move the story. Her understanding of music is solid from both sides-both Griffin's, and the teacher, Giulia. Ultimately, the greatest lesson of the book comes not from music, but from the one thing never covered in fantasy-the power of forgivness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Knock-Out","review":"PMK delivers again with amazing prose and riveting characters. This book is more complex in plot, yet more comprehensible, than Winter Rose and Atrix Wolfe. I most appreciate the author's ability to bring characters to vivid life without tedious description of personal habits and appearance or lengthy \\"tell all\\" conversations. Yet another PMK hardback purchase. Having been stirred once again to tremendous literary admiration by SFTB, I have to ask: Ms. McKillip if you read this, are you going to just LEAVE US HANGING in the Cygnet books about whether Nyx and what's-his-name manage to get back together? What about dear old dad and not to mention grandpa? I really can't bear to re-read Cygnet/Firebird because I get too sweaty about What Will Happen Next without knowing if we'll ever find out! sorry for the digression"},{"rating":"2","title":"Started and finished reading on the day I got it","review":"Song for the Basilisk may not be Patricia McKillip's best work, but nothing in this story let me down. I was drawn into the world she created from the first word. Her thrifty use of imagery always takes me by surprise, and this world was full of music all its own. I admit that I was surprised by the ending. While I was pleased to be surprised, some of the characters lacked depth, as if McKillip did not really know what to expect from the characters or she wasn't sure who the hero should be. Of course, I will be waiting for the next McKillip book! I liked this one but not as much as The Sorceress and the Cygnet or The Cygnet and the Firebird, which remain my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was she thinking?","review":"I have been reading fantasy for 50 years, and this was one of the worst.

Kurt plays an atheist sheriff (not that it played into the film) who is attempting to solve murders in a small river town. There really wasn't much acting, not much of a soundtrack and not much of a plot. At first I thought this was an attempt at a Christian slasher movie, but it really failed there too as the heavy religion aspect didn't play any kind of role.As a bad or campy film, it lacks there too. The dialouge was dry. I would say avoid at all costs.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. $3.99 for a rental? They need to pay you to watch it. This should be out on some cheap sci-fi 12 pack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great management book for all, especially if you do business in Hawaii","review":"An excellent managment book that takes traditional Hawai'ian cultural values, and places them into a management framework so that organizational mission and respect and development of individuals can occur simultaneously. Although the book is written from a Hospitality industry standpoint, the concepts can be applied to any industry anywhere. This book has been most helpful in bridging the cultural barrier of my traditional US Mainland experiences with the pan-Asian business culture environment. The book is a relatively short, easy read with many real life examples of how to apply the core concepts. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD Set","review":"I purchased this set for my children, who love the Shrek movies.

Before this I didn't own the first two movies, and thought this was a great deal for all three. I thought it would make me a cool uncle to have all three movies when my nephew visits.The problem is I should have paid close attention to the screen format when ordering. I wrongly took it to mean that it was going to be in a wide screen format since it didn't specify full screen in the title. If I watched DVDs on a standard TV that might not be such a big deal, but I own a HDTV with an up-converting DVD player and prefer watching wide screen formated movies on it. They just look better on the screen.Sadly Amazon does not offer this set in a wide screen format. So I'm either going to make do with the set I just ordered. Or, I'll have to order each movie separately if I want them in the wide screen format."},{"rating":"2","title":"the shrek trilogy","review":"These movies are the kind that one can watch repeatedly and see something new.

Every song on the CD brings back good memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not history, but important","review":"Historically speaking, this book deserves a rating of 1. \\"The God of the Witches\\" basically re-states the theories of \\"Witch Cult in Modern Europe\\" -- in a more extreme and dogmatic form. Murray's theories were conclusively debunked in the 1970's. Scholars demonstrated that she twisted and falsified evidence, that she ignored the vast majority of our data on historical Witchcraft. On the other hand, this book had a profound impact on modern Witchcraft (one might say a profoundly BAD impact, but that's another issue). So this is an important book to read if you want to understand the development of Wicca and modern Paganism. Just don't mistake it for history"},{"rating":"1","title":"wishful thinking and misinformed","review":"Murray, like Gardner and Crowley, was one of those early eclectics about her study of the Old Religion. There is too much supposition and not enough factual basis for her conclusions on the development of the \\"Witch God.\\" The first chapter, however, is a great read following the earliset depictions of the horned god. But the jump to stating that these depictions from all over Europe at varying times are linked to a single cohesive religion is tenuous. This is yet another case in which the author has made the facts fit her conception rather than objectively trying to make connections between the facts. This is the case, unfortunately, for almost all early expositors of witchcraft and the Old Religion. Read the more scholarly \\"Triumph of the Moon\\" by Ronald Hutton if you're looking for objectivity rather than charlatanism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, Miss Murray........","review":"Unlike most of the reviewers here, I come from a different starting place. I knew Margaret Murray. She lived to be a hundred years old and died in 1963.It's a shame that she's known mostly now for her books on witches. She was an Egyptologist and did valuable work back in the late 1890's with Sir Matthew Finders Petrie.This book is not one of her best. She was cantankerous to say the least. She would agree with me, if she were able. Sorry, Margaret....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass this one up completely!","review":"Most of the sources are taken directly from the inquisitors. What other information contained is based more on conjecture than science as we know it. The book is a piece trapped by the historical conditions from which it emerged. While it may be on the reading list of many Wiccan teachers it should be known that this book serves more as a contrast of the ignorance and lack of accurate information available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to believe we're still discussing this","review":"Murray's book actually contains a statement to the effect of \\"What reason would there have been for anyone to be accused of witchcraft other than that they were a witch?\\" and its entire argument is based on testimonies extracted under torture by people who were using the _Malleus Maleficarum_ as a guide, and would not accept any answers except what the book told them to expect.The main reason to own this book today is for its place in the history of ideas about European Paganism."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Kindle edition is incomplete","review":"Chapter 2 ends in the middle of a sentence.The illustrations are not included.A complete version of the book is available free on the Internet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an easy read","review":"At first glance, this reads like a PH dissertation with footnotes and sources. It wanders from subject to subject without any real closure from the last subject, as if the reader should know how it ends. This doesn't make it completely unreadable, though. I found some interesting thought processes.Remote beliefs of an early people included horned stag gods due to a lifestyle of tending animals for food. All new religions degrade the old religions by demonizing them, and in this case, rams with horns indicate the devil these days. From this, the author jumps into fairies, elves, dwarfs as the original people of the old religion, and how these folk were really us, eventually absorbed into the local populace. From this, we go into witchcraft and covens, the Inquisition and persecution.It's hard to follow, and I'm not sure where it will lead. Because of this, it is easy to put down and walk away."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic, but....","review":"Murray's work is one of the first examinations of historical pagan folk practices using techniques of the modern era. This work is one of the roots of the modern neopagan traditions, particularly Wicca, and deserves a spot on the bookshelf as such. Be aware, though, that Murray's academic standards were weak, and that some of this material does not accurately reflect current archaeological and/or neopagan thought"},{"rating":"2","title":"gift","review":"A gift for my son and he is very pleased with it.

The production is awesome, as well as the music and each note. Not even mentioning Phil Lewis voice, magic. Now, I understand they're no more main stream, so the production is tight. And I know that voice is a delicate instrument that loses so much over the years. But here you can really tell that he's not even trying.. many vocal parts are missing, and Ballad of Jane one octave below the original tone.. that's unacceptable to me. Too bad. I used to love them.

Most groups that re-make their own songs should have stuck with the originals. Add this to that list. All of the songs from the original album are re-made. If you loved the original album, Cocked and Loaded, as I did, you will not like this album. The music itself is ok, although the tempo of the songs is slower, as if the entire band's age has caught up with them and they can't play as fast as they used to. The real problem is with Phil Lewis' voice. He simply can't hit the notes anymore, which is most evident in old favorite \\"The Ballad Of Jayne\\". It sounds like a bad country song.

Sure, the story would likely never happen in real life, but it's a movie, and it's fun. Ronald Colman's good-humored charm and Ginger Rogers' peppy cheerfulness -- basically, what we love about each of them (as seen in so many of their roles) -- make the film a delight and the protagonists worthy of affection. And the supporting actors are great: Jack Carson, as the jealous fiancé, and Spring Byington, as the dotty aunt, are particularly memorable, and Harry Davenport makes an appearance, too. So, if you love the charming, witty, sweet, slightly zany films of the 1930s-40s (like \\"Holiday\\", \\"Mr. Deeds Goes to Town\\", \\"The Thin Man\\", etc.), or if you love Colman and/or Rogers, you should enjoy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"recommend against it","review":"You get what you pay for.

Though most have been just that (with mixed results), this release is simply a rehash of old gospel-house grooves that are well past their prime: some have been overplayed, many have already made their appearances on other compilations and mixes, and others still are just downright embarrassing (do we really need a house version of \\"Let The Sun Shine\\" or a note-for-note copycat version of Sting's \\"Set Them Free\\"?). Nothing new here. Not much worthwhile either.Skip this one. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not sure WHAT the other reviewers were listening to...","review":"...but I really enjoyed this CD. In contrast to all the harsh \\"pots and pans\\" of recent years, Julian gives us soaring vocals with a gospel feel. I was dancing while I was drving with this CD in the car.

I had heard wonderful things about it and was excited about all the positive reviews. Boy, were they wrong. This is an overblown, self-indulgent attempt at social commentary. I do not think that it should surprise anyone that there are many racists in this country. I did not find controversy in this film. Trying to exploit an audience is there in abundance.The two stars that I give are for the performances. Ryan Phillipe and Terrence Howard steal the movie. Many of the other performances were very wooden and tired. This movie will no doubt end up on many end of the year top ten lists. But I urge those that are sceptical about this movie to STAY AWAY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"La peor película.","review":"Es una vil copia de Magnolia. Hasta la lluvia de sapos copió. La pequeña diferencia que tienen es que Magnolia esta realizada con talento y una profundidad extrema y esta es una pavada dirigida sin ningún talento. Todo es puro deus ex machina y golpe bajo. Todo esta dicho por los personajes que dicho sea de paso son todos grandes estereotipos. Como puede ser que haya gente que crea que esto es arte. La verdad que esta es la prueba clara de que a Hollywood le queda muy poco tiempo de vida y que la gente y la crítica no saben nada. Otro aspecto lamentable de este film son las actuaciones, pobre Sandra Bullock y Brendan Frazier. Los dos se deben haber querido hacer los Tom Cruise en Magnolia y les sale muy mal. Es que siempre fueron, son y seran dos mediocres al servicio de otro mediocre como este director."},{"rating":"2","title":"IS RACISM THE FAD NOW???!!!","review":"Like most of the reviwers, it suprised me that Crash won the best awards from the Academy.The movie is GREAT but the subject is NOTHING NEW! and NOW MOST OF THE MOVIES HAVE TO INCLUDE THE RACISM SUBJECT!!!

And I wasn't buying it. Everything in this movie bothered me. I never liked the 'connecting' type of movies because they almost never work, and this is no exception.

It really is absurd that this movie got som much recognition to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of trash","review":"I honestly can't believe this movie was nominated for anything. It wasn't a bad movie, but it was so hammed up and goofy that I laughed at this movie more than anything.

Magnolia did it better. Racially-charged script? Spike Lee does it better. Formulaic, heavy-handed and utterly self-indulgent. This movie assumes you don't know that racism exists in America, and then treats you like an idiot for 1+ hours. The fact it won an Oscar goes to show that Hollywood continues to delude itself into believing they care about the parts of L.A. these millionaires would never go into. Crap. If I could give it zero stars, I would.

The dialogue was fake and contrived, and the filmmakers wasted no opportunities to control our emotions. I want movies to TELL their story, not preach it. \\"Crash\\" definitely preaches itself, to the point it beats you over the head with its fake liberal message.

Giving this anything higher than one star proves only one thing: you're stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vastly Overrated","review":"While the message of Crash is important, the film is a steady succession of having anvils dropped on your head.We get the message.

And the \\"coincidences\\" in the movie were laughable.At this point, I really believe that the Golden Globes are much more reputable than the Academy Awards. At least the Golden Globes had the good sense to not even nominate \\"Crash\\" for Best Picture. Instead they nominated much more worthy candidates like \\"Match Point,\\" \\"The Constant Gardener\\" and \\"A History of Violence.\\" If the Academy wasn't going to give the Best Picture award to \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" then it should've gone to one of those films instead.

Like Morgan Freeman states in his recent interview with Mike Wallace, \\"...the reason we have so much racism is that we talk about it too much.\\"Good acting notwithstanding, more anger, more racism, more random violence in the name of \\"art\\" means megabucks for the actors, producers, etc. but no answers for the greater good of society.

Mr. Haggis is trying a cheap mannipulation of the viewers's emotions just as he did in million dollar baby.This director/screenwriter creates highly improbable scenes just to get his silly points accross. For me the worst part of the movie is when a white guy (a cop) that has been previously introduced as a black-friedly character, suddenly kills a black guy, to whom he had voluntarily given a ride, and then just dumps his body somewhere. Mr. Haggis wants to prove the point that there might be a racist in all of us and that human behavior is unpredictable. If you have more than two neurons you know that such unpredictable behaviors are highly improbable, and that the world is not all relative. Haggis just wants to force the situation and induce a cheap emotion on the viewer.Honestly it's just sad that such decadent entertainment has become so popular."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"Crash, the winner of the best picture Oscar is, put quite simply, worthless. Basically some scenes thrown together of car crashes in LA and pretentious moralizing about racism. The characters (read caracatures) intertwine on the freeways of LA over race. A big step down for Don Cheadle whose excellent film Hotel Rwanda allowed his greatness as an actor to shine through. Sandra Bullock is annoying in everything she does and this is no exception. Most of the others here portray throwaway characters in unrealistic situations. Avoid this one like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over rated","review":"The ONLY reason this movie was so big is because of all the controversy surrounding gay marriage. It's what's hip now. Which is also why Tom Hanks' character in the Da Vinci code was gay (which does not go in accordance with the book).Directing was great, and the scenery was beautiful. The acting was okay... Come on, a bunch of B team actors.A waste of money and time. Nothing wrong with the story, but... the movie just wasn't that great."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as great as some people make it sound","review":"I thought CRASH would be a great movie from all the hype I'd heard on it, but while I thought it was ok, it seemed pretty empty to me.CRASH is about racism of all kinds, not limited to just 'black and white', theres lots of cultural differences from all groups explored in this movie. But most of the problems the various characters encounter come from the fact that they're mostly just jackasses. They all act like idiots, and for the most part cause their own problems. Racism appears to get blamed for a lot of the bad events, which to me, seemed to be caused more by a lack of common courtesy/respect.There's a lot of good acting, but this movie is just basically a downer, and I don't know that it accurately represents a large portion of today's society."},{"rating":"1","title":"pure propaganda","review":"This film attempts to convey that America is a cruel, immoral, despicable racist country. The director is too subjective and heavy-handed to be effective.I agree with other reviewers ... the makers of this film should learn that to make an effective propaganda film they need to be more subtle. It is unfathomable that this film won any kind of awards."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best films of the year","review":"This movie is one of the best movies that I've got a chance to watch this year. It was full of stereotypes and misconceptions about people that were sometimes true. This movie had a many instances of prejudice. All in all, this movie helped to better understand that one should not assume things about people based on their physical appearance. If you do, you're in store of a head-on collision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still can't believe this piece of crap won an Oscar","review":"I still want to believe that this movie was made by someone who has never been to the US and is going by what he as heard about it. There is a scene where Ryan Phillippe is driving his car. The radio is playing old fashioned country music! Ya know, because he's white, he MUST listen to country music! Even though he's in his 20s and lives in LA. I think that scene pretty much sums up how ridiculous this movie is. Whoever wrote this movie couldn't have possibly witnessed racism in real life. Every scene feels like they're guessing at what would PROBABLY happen in a situation because of course, EVERYONE is a racist. So if it's a white person and black person, oh the white person is DEFINITELY going to call the black person a N*****. Right? This movie is a joke. Avoid.It got the Oscar so that Hollywood could say they care about racism."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it hadn't won the Oscar, I could gratefully forget about it completely","review":"I'd give the movie itself 2 stars, for being contrived and shallow and ultimately only making one want to roll one's eyes. One star for then being overrated and unbelievably not only being nominated for Best Picture but actually winning (not to mention over 400 5 star ratings on here (?!). makes me ashamed to be an American. I have seen Brokeback Mountain as well, and while being a very heavy and depressing movie, it is far superior. A much more realistic interweaved vignette style film would be \\"Brooklyn's Finest\\". I didn't love that film either, but it isn't a hokey after school special at least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Message - One of My All-Time Favorite Movies","review":"This movie treats the subject of racism in today's America with powerful, raw emotion. It draws you into the characters' lives and reminds you that we all have our prejudices and fears, our trials and tribulations, and our potential for nobility and humanity. There is a lot of ugliness in this film, but then there's a lot of ugliness in this world. Like life, the movie has its opportunities for beauty and redemption, and it's moving to see how these characters come through in the end. I'd recommend this to any thoughtful adult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are they kidding me?","review":"I'm glad I didn't see this in the theater because I probably would have demanded my money back and the hours it took away from my life. The film is filled with so many whining, annoying, and unbelievable characters that I rolled my eyes five minutes into the film. The tv producer lets the guy who tried to hijack him go with just a warning? The lawyer and his wife complaining about ethnic people right there in front of the repairman? I'm sure the director had good intentions with this. I'm just trying to figure out what exactly they were."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"What a yawner.

The screenplay is incredible in the bad sense of the word. People don't talk like this.

Every character sports a gigantic, severly injured ego and seems ready to shoot or be shot at the drop of a hat. Every conversation is simply the prelude to a monumental, highly dramatic confrontation. This director must be on the edge. Maybe this was his stylistic intention, but it comes off as annoying and immature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hidden Racism","review":"Even though the film was well acted , well written etc etc..The film is about racism , but it's presented in it's own form of racism..Here's a question for you ....Who dies in this film and who does the killing...???? The answer to that question is the proof of the hidden racism that is in this film...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and Manipulative","review":"I found the characters to be one dimensional and predictable. I find it hard to take a movie down that really wants to say something and there are individual scenes (Matt Dillon survives this mess of a screenplay) with power. But, it was so manipulative and then at the end - with the pretty, annoying song, it manages to make sure all loose ends are tied up. It wanted to feel immediate and fresh, but it felt very dated. I blame the director (also the screenplay) for taking on more then he could change. He short changes a lot of these characters and takes the air out of his entire movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is how movies should be made","review":"Crash is a classic.

It's so realistic, and illustrates our everyday lives so naturally.Empty, hopeless feelings of people in Los Angeles, typical urban life, conflict in between rich and poor, characteristics of all types of nationalities, and justice and crime, non-stop actions and excitements....all of which are well blended throughout the movie so that kept my attention.If you like the movie \\"Lost in Translation\\" or \\"The Matrix\\", you'll love this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have read the reviews","review":"Let me see.

How contrived is it that the characters in every scene somehow are related to the characters in the next scene, previous scene and in the end, everyone is affected by everyones actions. Yeah, I understand that that is the point of the movie but the coincidences were a little convienient. This thing plays like a made for tv movie.

Just like every other movie she is in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be a sonnet","review":"I suppose one can have a fetish for anything - shoes, wigs, glass eyes, even cars or car crashes. But tell me, how many times would one need to watch glass-eye fetishists engaging in smouldering sex before one appreciated the fetish itself? At best, one would be likely only to appreciate the sex. Sadly, this film didn't even do that - a single moment's worth of Sharon Stone crossing her legs was far more effective.It doesn't work either as a metaphor for our \\"love affair\\" with the automobile. One could perhaps build a sonnet around such an image, but \\"Crash\\" is a one-trick pony that gains nothing from endless swinging of the same sledgehammer to crack the same nut. Out of such material an epic cannot be made. I'd be genuinely interested to see what a more economical version (10 minutes maximum) could achieve.

I think the most significant aspect of this film is how well it has been written by Haggis. The characters are believable, their intentions are often surprising and most importantly we care about them. Crash has been criticized for being unoriginal, ridiculous and many other things but how or why I have no idea. Crash chooses to be very unbiased and as a conservative Republican I was not at all offended by it. There are liberal characters, conservatives, extremists, etc. and yet in the film we find that no one is above reality. I will always recommend this film and I'll tell you right now, I'll bet most of the people who do not like this film, are people who were in support of Brokeback Mountain, which I must say cannot touch Crash. See this film for yourself, and you decide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crash with Sandra Bullock","review":"This DVD had the worst mix of voices from the actors and music background.If you lowered the music so as not to be offensive to your ears then you could not hear the actors speak.Very poorly done.Donot waste you money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over rated movie, Oscar win ??? no competition !!!","review":"Wow , having just watched this movie last night on DVD, I was blown away by the lack of substance in this movie...

It is delivered in a crude, unsubtle, and heavy-handed way.That message is then repeated--crudely, unsubtly--and heavy-handedly--over and over and again.The dialog is unbelievable, the story less so, the coincidences beyond the wildest imagination, and it just goes on and on, playing the one note, over and over. Heavy handedly.There are a few moments that ring true, rather like a broken clock is right twice a day. The acting (barring Matt Dillon) is excrable, and I thought if I heard Sandra Bullock and the woman who appears on early on (the one molested by Matt Dillon) get hysterical one more time, I was going to whack them both on the mouth.Did I say \\"heavy handed\\"?To think this movie was even nominated for best picture is a travesty.

You would have to live in another country or be a politically correct, brainwashed zombie to be able to watch this flick and nod your head.The makers of this film should learn that, in order to make an effective propaganda film, they should be more subtle. It is easier to fool and manipulate people that way.

After it won best picture, I questioned my rush to judgement and rented it again. Much to my dismay, my initial reaction to the flick was not in error. I spent the majority of the time in this move shaking my head in disbelief at occurrences that would never happen.

Well, I was wrong, it isn't, I felt the movie lacked structure and consistency, while also painting a negative view of Los Angeles, and the human race. Yes, we do live in a world filled with hate and ignorance, but this movie does not teach us to be tolerant of others, it teaches us fear. While, I felt Brokeback,was about unconditonal love and people needing people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly not \\"Best Picture\\"...","review":"The overbearing problem with this film is the dialogue - almost ALL lines in the screenplay are packed with a racial slur or over-the-top prejudice - so much so that gone is any identification with the characters whatsoever. Gone also is any sympathy for virtually all characters. I never felt engaged.I see the intent of the structure of this film, but I thought the entire second half was incoherent and, as a result of a sequence of unrelated scenes, I felt like this movie ended 7 times before the credits actually began to roll.The strength of this film is it's ability to highlight chance, karma, fate, etc playing a part in one's life. However, it just didn't quite work for me. I've seen better cinematic explorations of racial issues, most of them without the big-name actors to cameo, distract, and deliver such poor dialogue in this mediocre film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"A thoroughly mediocre film about the prevalence of racism at all levels of modern-day urban society.

I find that it takes a very simplistic and childlike view of race relations. It's extremely melodramatic in all of the wrong ways. It started out as intriguing with the development of plot, but the resolutions were weak and tepid. This has a very TV-movie quality to it, and I am SHOCKED that this movie won the best movie of the year. The only thing I can think of is that the liberal Hollywood elite wants Americans to think that there is still a tremendous amount of civil strive between races.

And considering that the very first two automobiles ever in history to run on roads had the very first traffic accident (true!), it isn't as far-fetched an illustration as it at first might seem.

This contrived social flick is supposed to get people talking about race and social conflict. Forget it.

Brokeback Mountain clearly DESERVED best picture, and every other nominee was an actual better picture than this. I saw this movie and it was a \\"good\\" movie, but was not the BEST PICTURE. Not Best Picture Material at all, it has a good message but the way its told, with the THOUSANDS of characters is confusing and makes no sense. Oh and why is it being released the same day as Brokeback Mountain DVD? Thats hilarious, no one will buy this DVD you realize, no one has even heard this movie existed until its nomination.. so good luck selling DVDs. Meanwhile the true Best Picture as its named by the hundreds of more credible awards like the Golden Globes, BAFTA's etc... will sell millions and Crash, will be forgotten. Three cheers for Trash!

(I don't care if the characters had two-dimensions, people are not one-dimensional or two-dimensional for that matter and this is something that American filmmakers especially tend to forget) To hear this film compared to American classics ranging from \\"Nashville\\" to \\"Mystic River\\"...it just drives me nuts. Crash was a classic example of how a filmmaker can make a \\"statement\\" without ever really saying anything meaningful at all. Perhaps a better title would have been \\"Tony Danza's Character Doesn't Like African Americans\\" because that's about all I could take away from this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived and heavy handed","review":"I can't believe this is up for best picture. The plot is so contrived and the dialogue so heavy handed--there are so many coincidences of characters running into each other at key moments in the story is just wasn't believable. And everyone always happens to be talking ideologically, mostly about race. People don't talk this way. From the first line I just felt like I was listening to a writer's thoughts...not experiencing a story. I know I am in the minority, but this one just didn't work for me. First rule in writing is to make the story \\"do\\" exactly what you, the writer, wants it to do, but make it look like you had nothing to do with it. I could see this story \\"working\\" from the first scene. Disappointed. Thought the Academy had more intelligence than this. Good performances wasted on shoddy writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOLLYWOOD DEALS WITH RACIAL STEREOTYPES","review":"When has Hollywood ever dealt with racism, and all peoples involved? This film, more than any other that comes to mind, showed just how insensitive we really can be towards each other. It seems to have touched on the many stereotypes we've all been guilty of at one-time-or-another. That's why I think this film spoke to so many different people. Whether Black, White, Hispanic or Asian, it gave us something to ponder. Maybe one day we'll finally learn to judge others by the \\"content of their character, and not the color of their skin.\\" Fake? I've seen and heard it all before.

No, in fact it might grow and make you become more racist; which is NOT what this movie's message is about.Also, this movie tries so hard to pull at our heartstrings, but if you're able to defy its attempts, you'll see that Crash is nothing more than a poorly-made film with no redeeming factors whatsoever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't judge the covers","review":"People are so much more complex than they appear, the biggest biggot may have a soft side and this movie was so much better than I had expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crash is the best movie on race ever","review":"I am sick of race movies.

When it was my turn, I watched it, but I was not impressed. Crash is made up of too many different stories and too many different characters. That makes it hard to follow and keep up with, even more so since so many of the characters look alike. I didn't even realize that it was some of the same people in more than one different story till I read some of the other reviews presented here. I also don't think it's very realistic.

NO! Does this movie present a literary value that can value it as a classic? NO! Does this movie deal with a controversial topic? While racism is always an important subject, it is certainly not controversial, in fact, cliche, so NO!

This guy has clearly never really seen the living, breathing, working heart of Los Angeles or else he wouldn't have put in such stupid stereotypes. The presentation of Asians in the film is the worst, and considering the overemphasis on white/black relations in LA, he clearly misses the real diversity that exists in LA, where people of all different types grow up and live together. LA to him is just a backdrop to tell a non-LA story of race relations in a city and outrages us Angelenos with his idiocy. Don't wasts your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must have been written by rich Hollywood folks who live in a bubble...","review":"Truly a terrible film that embraces all the stereotypes and ignorance surrounding racial viewpoints that it is supposed to be fighting against. Best line: \\"Maybe he was shot because he was a black man living in the Valley.\\" Where is this movie supposed to take place? The South in the 50s? Anyone who has been to the Valley (or LA in general) knows there are many African Americans, Armenians, and other races who live there and get along peacefully. Last week, 500,000 imigrants of different races marched in downtown LA...sure racism still exists, but it is not as simplified or rampant as this film would make one believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Crazy to Take Seriously","review":"This movie is really far out.

Or should I say I finished watching about half of it. It was so bad I stopped the film half way through. I have lived in California for many years, moving here from Iran.

Usually good films win the Academy Award so I cannot understand why this film won."},{"rating":"1","title":"NICE TRY BUT ULTIMATELY PHONY","review":"The writers get away with murder in this contrived bit of racial political incorrectness. They use every racial epithet possible in a attempt to show how NON MELTING the pot is in Los Angeles (And America in General). Good acting almost saves this film but the coincidences are unbelieveable and Thandie Newton( A superb actress) can't save a totally riduclous scene in which she is trapped in a burning car and screaming \\"Dont touch me\\",the phoniest scene in an pretentious film that falls far short of its goals. The fact that is lost the Oscar to \\"Brokeback Moutain\\" is something future generations will ponder and probably laugh about."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOOO overrated...","review":"Here's the best way to express my feelings about this ridiculously overrated movie. A quote from LA Weekly film critic Scott Foundas writing for Slate.com:\\"Welcome to the best movie of the year for people who like to say, 'A lot of my best friends are black.'\\"Don't buy this dvd. Buy 13 Conversations About One Thing. It's the same general idea, but with some sense and subtlety. Crash has neither and just delights in racial epithets. Congratulations, Paul Haggis, you know a lot of dirty words. Too bad you can't write above a fifth-grade level."},{"rating":"1","title":"We're All Racists???? Who Knew???!!!","review":"To judge by this movie, everybody but Hollywood. Crash reminded me of nothing so much as American Beauty, a beautiful to look at, urgently made, and ultimately empty piece of work. Yes, the acting is fine; yes, the intercutting between characters works; yes, some of the dialogue is entertaining (e.g. when the hijack duo banter about hockey and the Staples Center) but it's all using a sledgehammer and stock characters and emotions to make the point -- again and again and again -- that racism is alive and well in the 21st century. This is news?Jon Stewart jibed that Hollywood is out of touch. Despite George Clooney's riposte, Crash and its Oscar validates Stewart's point -- the Academy awards itself for bravely discovering what is old news to every other sentient being, implying in the moralizing that Hollywood itself is different. The ugly squabble about who gets producer credit for Crash nicely exposes that conceit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Unreal to be Taken Seriously","review":"This film is perhaps the worst movie ever to win an Academy Award for \\"Best Film.\\" It comes across more like a parody of a politically correct propaganda film, but the problem is that the Canadian film-maker meant this to be taken seriously.

As a moviegoer who has admired Crash for what it was, I have to say that the marketing push has gotten over the top. This DVD is worth it if you didn't purchase the first copy, but let me tell you that this product is a complete waste of money for those unfortunate fans who think they are getting a full-package deal with this new, \\"you-have-to-get-it\\" DVD that they call Director's Cut, but really is just the same DVD case with a few changes wrapped in a new cover. I'm not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing original","review":"This movie is trying way too hard to be controversial by exploiting racial and social issues. The interaction between characters in the movie appears to be forced and fake, the situations are totally unrealistic and the entire plot is dumb. The message that appear to be conveyed by this movie is too obvious and simplistic. I did not care for any character in the movie. All in all, an annoying movie that copies from Magnolia but fail miserably. A total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy Crashing Crappiness Batman.","review":"I can't believe this just won Best Picture. I had the urge to burn it after watching it last fall (since someone left it at my house). It is a maudlin, overbearing beast of a \\"race picture.\\" I couldn't agree more with the review that recommends audiences to \\"Do the Right Thing\\" instead. \\"Crash\\" is overblown, didactic, convoluted, and humorless. Matt Dillon gives a decent performance. Terrance Howard is ok as a frustrated, seething executive. Thandie Newton is his petulant wife. Sorry to be so harsh, but how could that other recent LA movie (albeit from 2004) Michael Mann's \\"Collateral\\" go unawarded next to the burning wreckage that is \\"Crash?\\" I just don't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"At best a made for TV movie","review":"Stereotypical 2-dimensional characters; unbelievable plot line; left me totally cold after I saw it. I forgot it 5 minutes after the movie was over and never even talked about it with friends. It did not touch me or move me at all like BrokeBack Mountain and Capote did. Can't believe it won best picture over the other 4 nominated movies. Walk the Line wasn't even nominated and Crash ended up on many critic's 10 worst movies list. What a joke. I think every unemployed actor and actress in Hollywood was in this movie and that's why it won. The American public and the Academy knows it made an embarrassing mistake naming this the best picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crash and burn","review":"Let me preface this by saying that even though I wasn't moved at all when I first rented this movie, I gave it another chance by renting it again. I'm sorry to say I was even more put off by it the second time around. I read somewhere that if you really want to see an accurate depiction of racism in America, turn your eyes to the footage from the devastation of Katrina. I truly believe that. \\"Crash\\" played it safe, it was riddled with clichés, and quite frankly, it was highly unbelievable by any stretch of the imagination. That it was given an Academy Award for Best Picture is a joke -- every other picture in that category deserved it over \\"Crash,\\" including some that were not even nominated. I think the cinematography was wonderful, and the score was haunting, but Oscar or no Oscar, it is anything but a classic. Ultimately, it's not even a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done movie - a must see","review":"Some of the reviews have turned this movie as racist. If I were to term this movie as racist - I guess we are just another character in the movie - well, thats what the movie is all about.The theme of the movie is all about how our preconceived notions about different races and cultures and how gets reflected in our day to day life.Paul Higgins has a done a wonderful job in directing the movie, it just keeps guessing on what is going to happen next."},{"rating":"1","title":"For rasist people","review":"This was basically a movie about a bunch of racist people being racist to each other and fulfilling sterotypes with their own behavior:The two black teenagers are - surprise! - juvenile delinquents up to no good. The succesful black married couple are portrayed as \\"white\\" blacks. The white police officer is racist and abusive. One black woman is a coke addict.The other races aren't given quite as much face-time, but their portrayal follows the same vein.If you want to wallow in and enjoy the racist attitudes of the 40's, see this movie. If you like to see different races fulfilling the stereotype of \\"their kind\\", see this movie. If you're KKK, you'll love it - your perceptions of people of other races will have been validated by this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"....And the Oscar goes to.........'Crap'!...er....'Crash'!\\"","review":"I think previous (negative) reviews have said it all. While the film is ambitious in scope, well-shot, intricately staged...nicely lit, it ultimately fails to communicate anything except the screenwriter's and director's stilted, unevolved, often sophomoric understanding of race relations.I think I showed remarkable restraint in not walking out of the theater when in one of the opening scenes we were bombarded with the most brain-dead, too-stupid-to-even-be-called-insulting derogatory racial stereotypes I have been exposed to since the 7th grade. Really, a police detective making fun of a Chinese woman's inability to pronounce her \\"L's\\" and \\"R's\\"? Wow, if that passes for deep commentary on 21st Century race relations I guess I had learned all I needed to know about the topic around time I had to get used to a school day without recesses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Movie","review":"I was forced to sit through this movie during my film study class.

The academy got to be blind to pick this film as Best Pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time or Money","review":"This film is, without question, one of the most ridiculously contrived messes ever made. It was carefully populated with a \\"diverse\\" selection of characters in a manner that could be considered quaint if done by a (very) young child but is instead an embarrassment to everyone involved. Regarding the coincidences of the same two people crossing each other's paths in a city as large and populous as LA . . . the filmmakers must be kidding. If you turn on your television and select channels at random, you can bet that the first (and indeed any) movie that you find will be less insulting to one's intelligence than Crash."},{"rating":"1","title":"THROW THIS MOVIE IN THE GARBAGE CAN!","review":"Bought this movie since, supposedly, it is the Oscar winner, and can I just say YUCK!

No one ever want to see it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie","review":"I just saw Crash yesterday and it's a very good movie. I think anyone who is racist should watch this movie. I think after they watch it, they will think twice before they open up their big mouth and say something really dumb or stupid. I'm the most non-racist person you will ever meet.

I definitly recommend this movie to anyone who loves movie gossip, just remember that it is intended for a mature audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"required viewing for cops","review":"I teach in a police academy and I had the new recruits watch this film. Not only is it an outstanding film but delivers a powerful message. All too often we forget how our actions impact other people and how our prejudices guide us.

It should be required viewing for all new police recruits as well as all of soceity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crash - great story, lousy blu ray","review":"The story line of Crash is fantastic and the acting is very good. It takes several viewings to get the intricacies of the story and well worth the repitition. We have this on DVD and love it. I am adding blu rays to my collection for what I consider exceptional movies. I am very disappointed in the quality of this blu ray. The sound is out of synch with the picture - enough to toss it right away. But even more disturbing is it is not 1080p quality - the DVD looks better on my blu ray than this does. Guess they are getting funding from this poor one to produce the true blu ray version - reminds me of the early DVDs that were just remakes from the VHS tapes."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is a Chinaman under the car","review":"This is the best movie i saw in 2005.

I can't even tell you what the difference was.I liked this movie, but this re-release is just plain greedy on the part of the studio.And shame on Antonio Villaraigosa for letting a studio buy our city for a day to promote this rip-off.ONE STAR!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Lost. I don't get it.","review":"Just watched this movie and I am totally lost. I figured all these characters would eventually be connected at some point. But the ending seemed to be thrown together at the last minute.I can't believe this film won the Best Picture Oscar. Had to be guilt on Academy's part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crash is trash!","review":"Reasons why this movie sucks:1) Didn't get Asian accents right - Gave Koreans Chinese accents. This is like depicting French people with Italian accents.2) Horrible, cheesy dialogue.3) Devoid of gay cowboys.4) New age music accompanying slo-mo scenes.5) Condescending and preachy.6) Annoying characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm glad they made it","review":"It's surprising to see Hollywood make a film in which racism is the major theme. That the movie simplifies the topic and relies mostly on insane coincidence and two dimensional characters to tell the story is not surprising. Here's the movie: Character 1 screams a racial epithet. Character 2 screams a racial epithet back. Through some ridiculous happenstance the character is either redeemed or has something terrible happen to them. At the end everything is solved and wrapped up nicely. The only piece of illuminating information in the film is that Los Angeles is the most hateful city on the planet, and everyone there is extremely upfront and confrontational with their prejudices and hatred of the other races around them. I just hope the success of the film leads to more movies that deal with racism in a more realistic way, and that are actually thought provoking and humane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crash Review","review":"I chose this rating because it is not a full screen showing.

For me, there is no better place to shop."},{"rating":"1","title":"What annoying, melodramatic trash","review":"What I found most annoying about the film were some of the characters, especially Sandra Bullock's poor neglected housewife character who takes out her oh-so-grave misfortunes on her servants and the Iranian shop owner, whose over-the-top actions throughout the film conform more to stereotypes of middle-eastern men than challenge them. Both characters are disgusting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah!","review":"I never really knew what the movie was about. I didn't see the movie when it came out, didn't see it before the awards show. We borrowed it to watch and I didn't like it. I guess the story line was good, because of the fact that that is exactly how the world is with people judging others because of their race, where they come from etc..I won't ever watch the movie again. The movie is different stories of different people. Sandra Bullock has hers, Matt Dillon has his etc..Just not a movie to put in and watch over again. Just a one timer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crash","review":"Just not the movie for me. Started watching this for about 10 minutes and could not get interested and shut it off.Thought it was very boring, and Corney. The actors were not the best.Not saying anything bad about the movie really, someone else might like it, but for my taste, it just wasn't for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Work","review":"If you are one of those people that really likes to work hard at trying to follow a movie, then this one is for you. It tracks about a dozen different storylines involving about two or three dozen different characters, back and forth across an impossible to order collection of timelines and all of that is supposed to come together in the end to make a sensible movie with a singular and logical plot. Personally, I don't like those kinds of movies so I gave up on this one after the first half hour. Tedious, boring and exceptionally disordered. Good luck......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame Beyond Belief","review":"A pretty good cast labors in vain to save this lame film. Badly written and directed, the film is so busy telling me that it is a terribly important film about racism, but it never really gets around to being a terribly important film about racism. It moves from one easily predicted big scene to another, giving the actors lots of Big Scenes where they can scream at each other but not much else.The film finally sinks under its own Self-Importance. Avoid it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crash","review":"\`Crash' is a film featuring a series of vignettes in LA that are all based around the issue of race. They are all interconnected in various ways and as each link is uncovered the impact only increases until you finish the film highly affected by what you have watched. This has an outstanding cast and everyone plays their roles excellently, not one actor lets the side down. Coupled with beautifully framed shots and a moving soundtrack, this very nearly offers everything you could want in a film. Some scenes will anger you, some will exasperate you and some will deeply sadden you, but every one will affect you in some way and it is a rare and wonderful film that can offer that the whole way through. This was highly lauded on its release and even after repeated viewing it loses none of its power. Highly recommended and one you really need to check out at some point.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Crash\\" Lands With a Thud","review":"White, liberal guilt at its worse.

I could not believe that Sandra Bullock even played in it. This movie was so stupid it is unreal. A cop trying to rape a woman in front of her husband, and then he had to tell her the next day or two when she was in a wreck that she needs to trust him. Ryan thinking a black boy was trying to kill him, shot the boy who was trying to show him something that they both have. He was a cop in the show and what he should have done was tell the boy he was a cop when he picked the boy up hitching a ride. Brandon was just to high class for my taste. He needs to stick w/ comedies. That is his strong suit. There is quite a few other big names but the bottom line rent it first before you buy it. I really wish I would had done that. I don't think it was worth my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting concepts...","review":"Good movie. I usually don't like when a movie has an overabundance of characters, but when they are somehow related by different stories it turns out to be a great movie. And this is what happened with Crash.There a several mini-stories in the movie. However, they all have to do with racism basically. A white policeman who innapropriately touches a black woman saves her later on. A woman who is married to a man that feels isolated and trapped. A hispanic father who does anything to protect his little girl. A middle-east man who struggles to maintain a store a faces intrusion and destruction of his business. A detective who must decide to protect or do justice to his robber younger brother.Great acting. Great plots. A great way of interrelating all of the stories. Everything seemed to be well thought out. Good directing.I really recommend this movie if you like mini-plots that somehow are linked together by a common theme."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film pissed me off. (and the Academy pisses me off too)","review":"Maybe it's just one of my peeves about movies, but I hate it when plots revolve around random occurences, and we're supposed to be fascinated by the fate of the universe and karma and all that crap. The whole story of this movie is like that, and as a person who lives in LA, I know that I never run in to the same person twice in the same day, much less is it possible that all these people could link up like this in one day. Give me a break. Tell a real story and stop pulling stuff out of your butt to make your points about social class and races. We all know those issues exist and we don't need a pointless exercise in crafty storytelling to beat us over the head with it. I challenge the guy who made this to do a documentary about LA. I think he'd find that we are all a little more adjusted to eachother by now than this film would lead people to believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, one heck of an emotional experience.","review":"Roller coaster ride of emotions that leave you pretty well exhausted at the end. The many lives that are linked together in these mini-stories are fantastic. This is a MOVIE - so don't lose sight of that. If you have an axe to grind or take any of the social/racial issues too seriously; you won't enjoy this movie. If you hate racial stereotypes and racist attitudes and don't want to admit they still exist; don't watch this movie.But if you want to get caught up in the trials of these \\"Everyday people\\" - high and low; you'll never forget this movie. There are absolute gut-wrenching sequences that are played to tear your insides-out. You'll feel tension and release throughout the movie that may leave you emotionally drained and shocked. But the excellent acting and the sometimes seemingly disgusting attitudes of the characters leaves you no doubt that you are watching a very deep and well thought-out production.A monster of an under-rated movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crash -- one of the BEST!!!","review":"CRASH was certainly one of the best films of 2005. The subject matter -- racial prejudice and all its various ramifications in American society today -- is carefully and beautifully handled. Needless to say I was thrilled last night when Roger Ebert named CRASH as his number one choice on his top ten list of best movies of 2005. I couldn't agree more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific premise and performances","review":"What a great movie this almost was. For the first 60 minutes, this movie was riveting, powerful, and believable. The last 50 some minutes, well, it turns a little bit Hollywood. Haggis doesn't completely sell out, but he takes some of the heat off, and as a result the believability factor drops just enough for it to not deserve five stars. Matt Dillon and Don Cheadle are at the top of their games, as is Michael Pena and the young girl who plays his daughter. But Sandra Bullock seems uncomfortable in a supporting role, and Brendan Fraser is a bit invisible as the politically ambitious DA. Definitely worth seeing. Belongs in the Grand Canyon catalog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"I really like this DVD for many reasons. Not only for be choosen the best movie of the Year; one of the reasons is because it was released very quickly in DVD.I'm from South America, and in my country, there is no a release date for this movie in cinema. Maybe in DVD Clubs they will have a release date now because this movie won the Oscar; but here people had to wait a long time until that happend.And concerning this review, the DVD is really really good, the sound and image quality are perfect, had Spanish subtitles (very important to my family & friends because many of they, don't like to read english subtitles or just listen the movie in english with no subtitles); and I really enjoyed the Behind the Scenes material, was very refreshing and complete.I hope allways the movies have a rapid release in DVD like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie not that great, I would rather watch something else!!!","review":"First of all, I thought it was a rip off of something that Quintin Tarintino would do. Some story lines of the characters had closer and some didn't. It was movie on \\"ist\\" showing; Racist, Sexist, etc. In reality it just showed stupidity. The movie showed one side of a character wanting you to hate them, and then later they show a better side. Until you see what I mean in the movie, I don't know what what the director had in mind if he wanted you to like of dislike certain people. This is my opinion on the movie, it wasn't a favorite for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"A highly touted, well-reviewed film that I was looking forward to seeing.

The fear of others and the fear of the unknown show that, although different on the outside, people are more similar than they thought. The steriotypes and racism is not going to go away, but if that is the foundation for someone's actions and beliefs, then it will make for some messy situations. As for how the film was set up, the characters have individual lives and stories that blended together brilliantly. It shows how everyone is self concerned and never thinks or don't care that their actions will affect others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and wondering","review":"The movie is slow and wondering until the last 25 minutes where it is all brought together. Unfortunately, it is so fragmented that there is little character development."},{"rating":"2","title":"Destiny. Compassion. Second chances.","review":"On the surface this movie may seem like it's about racism but on a deeper level, it makes us think about something else. None of us know how or why we came to be here. We could be a cop, a thug, a maid, a smuggled slave, a struggling refugee, or the rich wife of a powerful attorney. While we may not be in control of where we end up in life, we are in control of how we can respond to a situation, regardless of our skin color, race, or position in life. Everyday we get a new chance to make choices and if we choose to have compassion and act out of kindness, perhaps, just maybe perhaps, we can make this world less evil, and know that we have made a difference in someone's life. The character development in this film has been done well. And I really liked Matt Damon's performance. He has done so many great films. I thought he was fantastic in this one too."},{"rating":"2","title":"would recommend","review":"great time killerthe movie was well thought outseries of ironic twist that tie into real life stereotypes and shocking drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great flick","review":"One of the best movies ever made and a lesson for everyone!

So this movie is not bold, or revolutionary at all. In fact, the disturbing scenes this movie is filled with just leaves me want to vomit. This movie is a total disaster, and the Oscar board must be blind to pick this as the Best Pictures winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"There was a good idea in there somewhere.","review":"However the script is such an amateurish mess that the film fails miserably.

Crash was just too slow. Don't see this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crash is a Disappointing Film","review":"Crash tries in too heavy-handed a manner its attempt to interweave various plots with the themes of race relations and stereotype bias.Instead of making a profound statement, the film is a skirting, shallow view of race, actually bringing down the characters in the movie to the level of cut-outs or stereotypes themselves.Insipid and banal. Don't waste your valuable time if you like to think and not be shown."},{"rating":"1","title":"I honestly can't believe this","review":"This movie is as contrived as any I have ever seen. It is definitely not a SERIOUS attempt to explore genuine racial issues. It is the kind of thing I might have found provactive when I was 13 or 14 but not beyond. They try to juggle multiple plots like Magnolia (a good movie) but do so in the most heavy handed and, again, contrived manner possible. An absolute waste of time for anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"No truth whatsoever","review":"This movie tries to come off as if it knows what racism in LA is like. In reality, this movie shows how little the filmmakers really know. I don't deny that racism in LA exists; it still exists every where in some degree. But racism in LA is a *lot* more subtle then this movie would make the average viewer think.Steve Lopez at the LA Times said it best in his recent column (http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-lopez8mar08,1,4678341.column)."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding me...this \\"film\\" deserves NO STAR.","review":"Contrived and heavy handed as this movie is, if you don't like it then you are a racist!This movie blows, I've seen made for TV schlock on the USA Network that was filmed better than this.

It's no wonder that Lion's Gate immediately started casting the TV series soon as they bought the distribution rights. It's a feel good \\"aren't we bad?\\" movie striving for importance with mediocre performances by some of the leads including Sandra Bullock."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried to like this movie","review":"It was recommended to me and I don't like to question the taste or intelligence of friends, but I honestly could not finish it. I saw characters doing things that rang so false that I wondered what the heck Haggis was thinking. Then I remembered his Million Dollar Baby work and it made more sense. He doesn't go for reality - he goes for the message, and twists reality in service of that. It was especially ironic that the carjacker was played by a rapper named \\"ludacris\\". It's an apt description for much of the behavior in this contrived setup. As far as Best Picture Oscars go, Crash might even be a poorer choice than American Beauty."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hackneyed ABC After School Special","review":"I wanted to like this movie. I really did. I had heard good things about it from friends, but in the end, I realized I'd seen every plot line and technique in the movie done before and done much better. \\"Short Cuts\\" meets \\"Do the Right Thing\\" meets \\"House of Sand and Fog\\" meets \\"Magnolia\\".Far from being touched, I was completely irritated that a couple of white guys (Haggis and Moresco) were preaching to me about racism with all the authenticity and subtlety of a hammer (apparently the one referred to in Haggis's acceptance speech).I for one don't appreciate a director insulting my intelligence with hackneyed cliches, laughable stereotypes and morality tales with all the moral complexity of an ABC After School Special."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh...","review":"Having seen \\"Crash\\" when it was first released, I didn't like it. It seemed contrived and obvious - hardly the stuff of life-changing films.However, after the Academy Awards, I decided to give it another shot. And again, I was not impressed.\\"Crash\\" still comes across as a stretch - a movie so concerned with having something to say that it ultimately says nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible...","review":"I definitely agree with the last reviewer - this movie was horrendous. The first time I watched it I barely got through the first 30 minutes. It felt like someone's thesis on race relations in the United States. In an attempt to create the most unlikely of situations to prove that race is not as black and white as it may seem, the writer tried to create scenes that were too artificial and too distilled to be of substance. The ensemble cast was a talented bunch, but poorly used. The performances in general may be the only redeeming thing about a movie that seems like it was written by a college freshman trying to impress his film professor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lot of hype little worth","review":"This movie was an over acted melodramatic exercise in hollywood self stroking. plotlines were predictable, and all but one characters were lacking in humanity. By the middle of the movie I was praying for some on to nuke LA so I wouldn't have to suffer through the rest of this pretentious piece of garbage.

It's like an updated modern version of Grand Canyon (Danny Glover etc). Brendan Fraser and Sandra Bullock play husband and wife (good teaming) and get car jacked by a pair of young black guys (Ludacris is one of them), a black couple get pulled over by a white cop (played by Matt Dillon) who's a racist, etc etc etc. It's a movie where there are a lot of bit stories that merge into the whole movie, depicting the class lines in Los Angeles. It's a great cast with so many recognisable faces. The movie plays along in about a 36 hour time period following all of these stories. It's an eye opener that's well acted and moving. Initially I was apprehensive when I went and saw this, but I'm so glad I did. Again, it's moving and admittedly it's a bit hard to watch but important to see.

In as much as that movie explored following what your heart tells you is the right thing to do and how the smallest things can change our lives, Crash goes deeper than GC did into the spirit of all of us. We all have the dark and the light, the wise and the foolish, the cowardly and the brave sides of ourself. Crash illuminates this and gives a face and story to the complexities of life.

The characters were too flat an unbelievable, the situations too fantastic to seem plausible, and that god-awful music seemed to dictate when I should experience moments of intense emotion.

There is a moral at the end of the story and you just might learn something when it is done. That is, the movie watching public is very hungry for easily digestible TV scripted pabulum. Like a very similar movie Magnolia (with the same contrived, sappy music video ending), the formula of the story is a many short vignettes of intertwined lives. Every story is perfectly crafted to exact a cheap emotional response. Corruption, Racism, Greed, all the hot button topics are touched upon to provoke you. If that was not enough, every character is an easily detected stereotype. Which is confusing when the message of the movie is people are more complex than two-dimensional automatons. With these type of 'message movies\\" all the characters have an epiphany by the end for better or worse. Like an ABC 'After School Special' it doesn't get more complex than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"You have to watch it","review":"This is an amazing movie with a combination of stories that get you into it completely.

I was sadly disappointed by Crash. Just read any of the numerous 1-star reviews for the gory details. I won't repeat them here.However, I can recommend TWO much much better movies that also follow multiple story lines and are based around car crashes. Amores Perros or 21 Grams. You might not need to see both of them, but either one would certainly be worth checking out. Those movies have depth and emotion and REAL characters in them. Not the tired stereotypes of crash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Straigt to the Point","review":"I read a blog regarding this movie in which someone referred to this movie as \\"Racism for Dummies\\"...and it couldn't be closer to the truth...This movies IS simply \\"Racism for Dummies\\"...it's a great movie if you have never met or maybe spoken to a person of another 'race' in your entire life...because that is the only way it would be plausible to believe in these absolutely one-dimensional characters...Oh my God...It's hard to find a movie AS bad as this movie...holy cow...Enjoy!P.S. And I was one of those who had only heard good things about the movie and was fully prepared (and excited) to have a enlightening experience...Nothing could have been more...I really hate to use this word but it is the only way to describe it, but here it is --- stupid ---than this movie and it take on race..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crash","review":"This movie really makes you think about how life interacts, often without us even realizing it. It definitely isn't a \\"feel good\\" movie, but one worth watching!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deserves no stars...though some good actors wasted their time.","review":"This is a remarkably, offensively shallow film. The portrayals, particularly of the Asian-Americans but no one is immune, are so schematic that they barely have any dimension at all, and the events depend exclusively on everyone involved behaving in the most unprovokedly stereotypical manner possible at almost all times. It depends on adorable coincidences and is full of unearned \\"redemption\\" and will only provoke thought in those who have never bothered to think about any human interaction. The performances are good. The direction is ham-handed. The script is an abomination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great .... Dark, Gloomy, Depressive and Joyless,","review":"Be warned: this is a rather dark, gloomy, joyless and almost depressive look at race relations in America or to be accurate mainly LA. It takes a pretentious all knowing perspective but in actual fact has a rather limited view of human nature. The main point this film tries to make is an old one, namely that everybody, white, black or brown harbors and operates with their own set of racial or ethnic prejudices. The film however overstates its case to the limit so that almost no single character in the film except a 5 year old girl comes out unscathed. In its dark treatment of LA street crime and the police force it is mainly derivative, bringing to mind countless other better films: LA Confidential, Training Day, Collateral .. to name a few."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow Starter - great ending!","review":"I kind of bailed on this movie about half way through - my wife kept watching it. I came back and sat down about 3/4 of the way through and it was just getting interesting.Really points out how our stereotypes and preconceptions can get in the way of us living our life as we should."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely TERRIBLE","review":"Beauty Shop is a deep exploration of race relations compared to this over-the-top garbage.If it were a made for TV movie, I could forgive the bad writing and direction.

It made me nauseous then, too.Before I knew it was Haggis I would have bet the writers were two recent Emerson grads. But Haggis is Canadian so I was not far off.Pretentious, predictable, unwatchable. The all-star cast could have been scrapped and replaced with racial stereotypes written in gigantic, flashing neon letters that drifted lazily across the screen.To boot, they ripped off the tricky editing technique from \\"21 Grams\\" of match action cuts from vignette to vignette.The most damning comment is that only a white person would find the movie powerful. Everyone else - insulting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crass...........","review":"According to a friend of mine I missed the whole point of the film.I wish I had missed the whole film instead.An accident not even worth witnessing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Piece of Trash","review":"Yes, I am one of the small but loyal people who absolutely hated Crash.Just to make sure you understand me, I hated Crash....with a vengeance.As I black(and female) young adult who has grown up in an amazingly diverse area, I was completely disgusted by Crash's depiction of race. Not only did it simplify race into the most stereotypical issues, it belittled the audience by being pretentious and self righteous.Crash isn't anything new and it's anything but special. If you enjoy movies that completely miss the point of racial differences (but thinks it hits it right on the mark) watch Crash. When you're ready to see a great movie about discrimination, go watch American History X or another movie that is worthy of its praise."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Academy should be ashamed of itself !","review":"Crash is trash! The Academy should be ashamed of itself for awarding such garbage, I wish I could give it 0 star!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CRASH IS TRASH!!","review":"This is the type of \\"sick\\" movie that has never appealed to me. It is another example of the trash that Hollywood has become. My gosh, every other word in this movie is the \\"F\\" word. Is this what we want to see?? We get enough of this in the real world without having it thrown at us!!!! The only reason I saw this movie was because I was out in fellowship one night with friends and we went to the movies (something I hardly ever do).

An inferior Amorresperros, 21 Grams, Do the Right Thing wannabe is what we have here.The writers of this piece of garbage were obviously trying hard to be gritty and controversial by confronting racial tensions in the USA, but instead came off as unbelievably trite, glossy and overdone.The acting is overdone, the dialougue amateur, the characters exaggerated...the list goes on. How this won the most prestigious film award has me baffeled.If you are willing to look beyond all that, the film can be entertaining, but Oscar-worthy? Please..."},{"rating":"1","title":"too loud","review":"When the background music completely overpowers the dialogue, you may as well turn it off. The background music was piercing and I needed to have the remote in hand to keep adjusting the volume. Not everyone has perfect hearing and shows with overwhelming background music are becoming the norm. A shame because otherwise I could have enjoyed Crash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood tries serious social comment, and Crashes","review":"Not even Quentin Tarantino conspiring with Robert Altman could make this nasty, meretricious, one-note little film about racism in L.A. I could put up with the outrageous string of coincidences presented as plausible if there were some honest point being made, but the film traffics in the very stereotypes that perpetuate racism--the black carjackers, the Mexican maid, the Mideastern would-be assassin. It's also offensive in its blanket indictment--we're all racists, equally guilty--and loads the dice mercilessly to make that altogether false point. But to discuss the point of view of the film is to do it too much credit. The fine cast should all be embarrassed to have served up this swill."},{"rating":"1","title":"A B C Anything But Crash","review":"Wow - this has to down as one, if not the worst Best Picture winners ever. To think that there were far more deserving films last year that deserved the top honors. The four other films nominated along with the non nominated Match Point, Syriana, A History of Violence, The Constant Gardner, Mysterious Skin, Walk the Line. From the opening line \\"No one touches any more - that's why we crash in to each other just so we can feel something\\" - god make me puke to the final sitcom like fender bender scene. If the Academy did want to award Brokeback Mountain there were plenty of other worthy films. Many of the one star reviewers said pretty much what needed to be said about this film. The heavy handiness, silly dialogue, bad acting, etc. It also felt very dated - could have had more impact if would have been released after the Rodney King incident."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"A masterpiece in the telling of everyday racism that goes on around us all the time but so much of it we don't even see anymore. This film will cause self examination as to whether or not we are as innocent of racism as we make think we are.It is a very moving, heartbreaking, but compelling story brought to life by a wonderful, all star cast. The soundtrack by Mark Isham moves the film along perfectly; the music fits the emotion of each particular scene beautifully. Of particular notice is Bird York and \\"In the Deep\\".I highly recommend this film to everyone; it will open your eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like everything else in celebrityhood, this has been done before","review":"Crash might be helpful to all the six-year-olds who might not fully grasp the myriad complexities of race and racism. For the rest of us, however, it's more than a little elementary (racism is more than skin deep, oh my!!). And like all things race in America, it must not, it cannot, receive even a teeny weeny speck of negative criticism. Anyone who does not automatically exclaim, \\"EVERYONE SHOULD SEE THIS MOVIE!!\\" is automatically branded a racist, when in fact this film inadvertently celebrates robot racism (\\"white-people-bad-black-people-bad\\"). It's all so exhausting.I further dump on the movie and most of its reviewers for not giving a big ol' credit to films that were obviously deeply influential: Grand Canyon and Falling Down, to name two. With more subtlety, I see a failed attempt to co-opt the art and rhythm of P.T. Anderson in this reel.Can't we just all generate some new ideas?"},{"rating":"2","title":"lives in change","review":"The film does not allow any character to fall into a sterotype despite the initial appearances. Everyone is redeeming, in greater or lessor degree, in their own world, despite their frailites and prejudices. The writing is crisp and no easy turns are taken. The film has unexpected twists but none of them are contrived. Each character is developed just enough for us to develop our opinions of them and then things change. Those of us familar with LA will recognize the icons of the city and the mix of cultures. Each character has enough prejuice or hate in his/her repertoire of life to demonstrate we had better not be too quick to judge without exploring what might in us be similar to the characters' flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"Typical Hollywood portrayel of racism. The movie is slow and the white people are the bad guys for the most part. This movie is definitely not worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"So many real life story lines that tie together. Excellent acting throughout. Makes you think, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and contrived.","review":"The movie is overrated and it tries to hard to be touching. It plays on the theme that there is good and bad in everyone, and everyone is tied to one another by subplots. The stupid part is in LA the characters have extreme personalities and stereotypes. Yes I know they are trying to talk about racism and be heart warming, but it comes across as very contrived.Example of a dumb scene and epitimizes this movie is the part where the grocery guy uses the gun."},{"rating":"1","title":"makes \\"Do the Right Thing\\" look understated","review":"Unrealistic story and unrealistic dialogue can work in a more stylized or surreal piece. The suspension of reality still works. But Crash, a seemingly more naturalistic film about the malignant effects of racism, such elements become distracting, and ultimately sabotage the effort. Haggis is high-minded here, but his lack of subtlety is self-defeating, making the film predictable in parts and preposterous in others. Good performances by Matt Dillon and Terrence Howard are wasted in this film that wants us to believe that, in a city of 4.5 million, such unrelated stories would happen to intersect so seemlessly. Only in a Seinfeld episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frightfully Disturbing ... and Amazing","review":"This movie is one of the most powerful I have ever seen. It addresses the issue of race in such an amazing way, linking together so many stories and so many people in so many ways. It isn't just a black and white issue- it's black, white, Asian, Hispanic. It's fear, stereotypes, frustration, anger. As soon as you've decided one person is a villain, he does something truly extraordinary. As soon as you've decided one person is a hero, he does something despicable. Everyone walks a thin line, and the movie Crash does a wonderful job of portraying that- the cause-and-effect relationships that impact everyday interactions, and how other people put a slant to those interactions, based on their previous experiences.I highly, highly recommend seeing this movie to everyone- it will make you think. And think. And think."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is obviously the better film.","review":"What self-respecting critic of classic cinema would DARE give this higher than one star? \\"Crash\\" was written and directed by liberals who want to look \\"progressive\\" and \\"hip.\\" Sorry, not convinced. If you really believe this was the best film of 2006 then you need to see a therapist."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Was Bored","review":"I know that this movie has done very well critically and commerically, but I found it both preachy and boring.Racism is ugly and despicable, no question about it. But the last thing I want is some \\"holier than thou\\" Hollywood filmmaker trying to hit me over the head with his politically correct message.On the plus side, the film is shot well, with attention to atmosphere, etc. But please, if you're looking to be entertained or even challenged, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"rip-off","review":"This is a rip-off. Even less put-together than the sloppy released version. Sanitized white people's vision of racial tension."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST movie ever to win a Best Picture Oscar","review":"I was outraged when I heard that \\"Crash\\" beat \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" for Best Picture at the Oscars. I wouldn't mind if \\"Brokeback\\" lost to \\"Capote\\" or \\"Munich,\\" since both are actually great movies. But for \\"Crash\\" to even get nominated shows that the Academy is easily swayed by an emotionally manipulative, shameless, preachy, self important movie to ease white guilt. I predict major protests and social unrest in the coming months. Critics will rage with fury over this loss, and director Haggis may even have to return his Oscar. Skip this garbage and check out Ang Lee's \\"Brokeback Mountain,\\" which is the far superior and more interesting movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crash","review":"\\"Crash\\" is a brilliant story conveyed through excellent acting about race relations set in current-day Los Angeles. The characters in the story don't hold back on racist stereotypes that we've all felt or have felt around us. Everyone is guilty and everyone is innocent. The moral of the story is: while we may have many differences, we're no different at the core of our being. We all fear, judge, and hate. But when we give ourselves the opportunity to shed our ignorance, we can understand, appreciate, and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh, ok, whatever","review":"The movie was interesting to watch, but I think only a small portion of the population is this racist, I mean, seriously. It was also annoying to see how a person's attitude changed unbelievably from the beginning of the movie to the end. There wasn't any real conclusion either. We just get a glimpse into the lives of these people and that's it, no ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was awsome","review":"Im not good at these but i will write, everyone should see this move. it was great plot. So i heard it was up for an oscar award as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple Minded Junk","review":"I just finished watching this film. I find that it takes a very simplistic and childlike view of race relations. It's extremely melodramatic in all of the wrong ways. It started out as intriguing with the development of plot, but the resolutions were weak and tepid. This has a very TV-movie quality to it, and I am SHOCKED that this movie won the best movie of the year. The only thing I can think of is that the liberal Hollywood elite wants Americans to think that there is still a tremendous amount of civil strive between races. This hostility is what fuels the Dem base. There is of course still racism in this country, but there is no way it is this ubiquitous, and this movie constantly veers towards parody unintentionally with its heavy handed \\"everyone's a little bit racist\\" cries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Crash is an overrated and amateurish film about race relations in LA. It is contrived and obvious in its storytelling. If you want a great film about prejudice & race watch \\"In the Heat of the Night\\". Crash is no better than an average tv movie on Lifetime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-made but annoying to watch","review":"This is a very well-made film but what of it? Anyone who has enough free time from the real world of stressful race relations to watch a movie that portrays those same race relations jacked up with plenty of manipulative, adrenaline pumped-up histrionics is welcome to this movie. This was done before (more hysterically) with \\"Do The Right Thing\\" and in the book (more intelligently and cynically), \\"Bonfire of Vanities.\\" Rather than change my views on race, this only confirmed to me that multi-culturalism does not work and that we either are going to have to move toward mono-culturalism or we will quietly move into geographical/economic isolation from each other. This movie showed that it is nothing but a fantasy that hundreds of cultures can co-exist without misunderstandings and suspicions boiling up into violence. Ironically, the movie argues against itself as it shows that the problem is so widespread and profound that tensions are absolutely inevitable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie for the times","review":"This was an excellent movie. There were moments that anyone, no matter what social class a person is from could relate to. The actors did an incredible job with an exceptional story. It is one of the best dramatic movies I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing monumental but entertaining.","review":"With all the buzz I had heard about this movie, coupled with the fairly impressive cast, I must admit that I wasn't overly impressed. The movie was entertaining but I certainly didn't feel that it warrants the credit being attributed to it. I certainly didn't need to see this movie to encompass all it entails. Everyone is racist. Racism, contrary to popular belief, is not a white vs. minorities issue. Further into the movie, I thought the connection that Matt Dillon's character had with the black woman was cheezy and way too predictable. What also didn't impress me is how, in the end, it reverts back to the white man being the \\"bad guy\\" (boy you don't see that in Hollywood do you???). Worthy of a Friday night rental but it's not likely one I'd wish to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll not get away with discrimination","review":"This movie is great. I have never seen any movie with discrimination before. After i finished watch this movie, i was surprise who much it feel to be discriminated by other and they didn't know who you are. In this movie, it showed all kind of discrimination such color skin, nationalities, and stereotype. In the real world, discrimination would never change. I hope that any one who watched this movie could think about discrimination and take it more seriously. I will be very disappointed if i did not watch this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am....","review":"This movie, \\"Crash\\", portrays that reality of America. Like many people know, America a nation of immigrants, but when different points of view crash this is when we see some results. \\"Crash\\" reveals the struggle of different ethnicities to get along and the perception each one has from one another. Minorities group believe the Caucasians are the most racist group in society, but if for once, all the minority groups stop to think about it, we are racist as well. We have different stereotypes of each other and instead of coming together to defeat this gap in society we are isolating each other creating a deeper gap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racial tension overload!","review":"why why why why why why why why why why whyHello, I love multi-culturalism, and this is not it. not Oscar caliber.

When I first saw the previews for it and saw how many big names were in it, I thought it was going to be crap. Boy, was I wrong. If you like feel good movies, or if you are easily offended, this movie is not for you. However, if you like movies that make you think, and that are brutally honest and real, and will make you talk, then see this movie.I would give this movie 5 stars, but if I'm rating the DVD I have to take away a star for the lack of special features. Besides a corny intro, a music video, a bunch of trailers (but none for Crash), and a pretty good behind the scenes feature, its a bare bones dvd. I wouldn't be shocked at all to see a Crash Special Edition come out around Christmas or shortly after. This movie deserves two discs and a whole lot more features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Freedomland going to win next year?","review":"I saw this film when it first came out and was not impressed. I was shocked when it was nominated for \\"best picture,\\" although perhaps it was a sad reflection on the competition.The film is an extremely unrealistic examination of race relations in LA. The dialogue is, at times, so far out that the film is unintentionally funny. Only the most brain-washed, gullible of viewers will be able to stomach this one.I suspect that the positive reviews you see here at Amazon come from those at the Academy who voted for \\"Crash\\" and are trying to justify their bizarre action, as well as from the film-makers friends and relatives."},{"rating":"1","title":"overdone","review":"I understand there is racism in America but this movie kind of overdid it. For example that one black guy that released the chinese prisoners in the bus for most of the movie talked about how bad racism was and how horrible it was being black without drawing breath. It is ok to make a movie about this issue but when that is the only subject that ever comes out of the characters mouths it gets overbearing, unrealistic, and annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, obvious, hackneyed","review":"Everyone good is bad, everyone bad is good. Nothing turns out how you are supposed to expect.I detested it. I have never done drugs and I am British. I couldn't believe how transparently obvious this film was. You are supposed to be judgmental and go along with the characters then you get this big surprise. If that's not your world view then this is an artless tour round a set of bad attitudes.One of my friends loved it, thinks it's the best film ever. She has used coke and is from LA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crash? - More like Bump","review":"I don't think there is anything revolutionary about the social theme in Crash. RACISM IS BAD - how was that a news flash in 2005? Doesn't everybody but the KKK and neo-Nazis already get it? I'm not saying that racism is dead, it clearly is NOT, but I don't think it can stand as a jaw-dropping film theme anymore. We have all been taught the lessons.I want to make it clear that my comments are not intended to minimize the importance of the continuing battle agaist racism - it's VERY important. I just don't think that Crash presents us with anything new.I found the film to be very heavy handed, pedantic and predictable, and there was nothing bold about it. I wouldn't consider it a great artistic achievement - let alone deserving of a Best Picture Oscar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crash ...?","review":"If this was such a worthy movie. So much so, that it won the best picture Oscar for 05.

I'm ******* a white woman.\\" Turns out the woman is hispanic and they fight for 10 minutes.If this sounds ridiculous to you, it only gets worse. Every storyline in this film is outrageously bad and conveys all of the racist stereotypes the film allegedly fights against.One heavy-handed, poorly written scenario after another.The cast screams and yells and hates for two unbearable hours and then it snows.So what?Watch 'Do The Right Thing' instead, a far less flawed exploration of race relations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Picture? -- No Way","review":"This TV-like drama on racism in LA is saved from banality by some fine performances by some of the actors. The problem lies in the contrivances of the plot that makes not entirely credible connections between characters who might not otherwise meet. Another weakness is the way the characters spell everything out--no mystery here about how they feel because what they say out loud is all there is--no underlying mystery or nuance. By supposedly offering a take on the racist tendencies in all of us, the film manages to offer a number of racial stereotypes. A disappointing choice for best picture, a way for Hollywood to congratulate itself. I originally rated this film with 2 stars but now that it was awarded the Oscar, I have given it 1 star for being ludicrously overrated by the Academy. It didn't even deserve screenplay--Good Night and Good Luck, Syriana, The Squid and the Whale were all better films. And editing? The Constant Gardener and Munich were more deserving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Chicken Little was worse in 2005","review":"I hated this movie long before it had any Oscar buzz. It was an embarassing mess of ridiculous, overdone stereotypes about racism. I'll admit the acting was good, and I wasn't horribly bored, but in almost every scene I wanted to yell \\"Oh, come on!\\" at the screen. Everything in it was just preposterous. It struck me as written by a rich white person in Hollywood who probably doesn't actually interact with any non-white people, and oh, guess what, that's the case. It's Oscar win is a perfect example of white-dominated Hollywood saying, \\"see how wonderful and progressive we are, acknowledging how we're all prejudiced.\\" What a joke! At one of the pivotal moments in the movie, when the little girl jumps up and you think she's going to get shot, I burst out laughing. It is the most absurd, contrived movie I have seen in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to Write Home About","review":"This is another one of those \\"it deserves an academy award because of the subject or the actor\\". It does not depend on the quality of the content or the acting. Eastwood got it for Unforgiven because he had been around Hollywood a 100 years and was well liked. Halle Berry got it for Monsterball, a monster flop, and many critics stated it had a lot to do with her race/sex not performance. Crash is another such film. It addresses the politically correct issue of rascism and manages to get most of the key races into the movie Asian, Hispanic, Black, White, etc.. A sure winner, regardless of the quality of content. I'd say you'd have to go way out on a limb to believe that racial interrelations exist as those depicted in this movie but I can't imagine a limb that long."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the best picture of 2005","review":"Well,well,well---the members of the Academy did it again. Awarded best picture to an inferior film over a extremely memorable and poignant one. \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is heads and shoulders above this trite \\"race issue\\" TV movie of the week.I just wish for once the members of the Academy had \\"the balls\\" to reward \\"THE BEST\\" film for a change.

Unfortunately, to my disappointment, it failed miserably. Right from the begining, it presses the whole multi-culutral theme, and tries much too hard to do so. The abundant use of profane racial slurs is repugnant. The acting is in my mind quite sub-par. The only positive about this movie is the good use of floating narrators to tell different stories the blend together. Besides this, the movie is a general disappoinment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hysterical, bombastic garbage that will be forgotten in a year's time.","review":"I am in utter shock at the positive reviews of this film.Crash is full of hysterical caricatures screaming their thoughts and intentions for the entire miserable length of the film. Good films with good acting, good direction and good writing simply do not do this.The film talks down to its audience with such bombastic idiocy, that I am shocked and saddened to see that any person viewing this film was not fully horrified and insulted.Film is an art form. We should aim better within the discipline. If this is the direction that \\"Best Picture\\" caliber films are headed, better to just give up and stop making movies.This film is the comic book version of a study on racism. It is sad that people apparently need or like having their movies diluted to the point of sheer stupidity that this movie presents."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A WASTE!!!!!","review":"Way too many characters and subplots going on in this movie. I found myself asking \\"What the hell is going on?\\" 39 minutes into the movie. And at the ending, I asked \\"What the hell was that?\\". I have never written a review on Amazon before and I've been frequenting this site for 8 years now, but I just couldn't resist this time. This has to be one of THE worst movies I've seen in years. The storyline of the cop and Thandie Newton is so unbelievable, I couldn't help but laugh at it. I bought this movie because of all the Oscar hype, but I just don't get it. Too many things going on all at once and it just seems like none of the storylines ended. I feel really cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whats the big deal?","review":"Was extremely dissapointed. Whats the big deal. I did not need a movie to showcase what racism was in America. It stares at your face everyday. So it was a damper on me.Well done film though i must say, but there was no punch in it for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserved the awards","review":"Assumptions, assumptions. We think we know people, we all have our ideas of 'stereotypes' or judge a person within five minutes of meeting them, and then 'Crash!', those judgements come down in these types of movies. The cast was fantastic and the story-line a wonderful way to say 'it only takes a little twist of fate for a hero to turn villian, or a villian to turn into a hero'. An angry man can turn kind, and a patient man can be pushed to his limits, suddenly appearing to be a madman. A great lesson in how wrong our perceptions of personality are at times. Pay attention to this one, America...human nature is not as easy to dissect as what we often believe.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"As the winner for the award for Best Picture of the Year was uttered from Jack Nicholson's mouth this year, I was silently celebrating. What a wonderful surprise. Caught in the shadow of another socially controversial film Crash was a true diamond in the rough. This stunning depiction of racial predjudice was a testimony of the hardships real people face each and every day of their lives. While the film obviously dealt with the subject of racism, it did not base itself (or its hype) on that topic. Unlike the front-runner for this year's academy award, Crash was a well-made film. If one were to remove the \\"controversial social aspect\\" of the movie, he would find the remains of what would still be an entertaining and clever cinematic concept. I am greatful to have had the chance to see this film, and hope that in the coming months more people will give it a viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks a bit like...","review":"Looks a bit like the American version of the English film \\"Snatch\\"/2000. Nothing new, plot very predictable, I wouldn't advise this to anyone who is looking for a new plot form because it's been done. I'm frankly tired of remakes and this definetly falls in such a category."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Picture? Who's To Say","review":"I won't even bother to jump into the fray in debating whether \\"Crash\\" was a worthy winner of the Best Picture Oscar because I didn't see \\"Brokeback Mountain\\". For me the best films last year were in no particular order \\"Walk the Line\\", \\"Cinderella Man\\", \\"Batman Begins\\", \\"Wedding Crashers\\", \\"Sin City\\", \\"Kung Fu Hustle\\", Wallace and Gromit-Curse of the Wererabbit\\", and \\"Transporter 2\\". There's certainly been worse choices for Best Picture with 2004's Paul Haggis scripted \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" coming to mind. The central premise of \\"Crash\\" which involves the convergence of persons of different socio-economic and ethnic backgrounds is not the most original of concepts. To the film's credit it is crisply directed and expertly plotted. The ensemble cast is uniformly excellent. I saw this film in the theatre and was engaged but not blown away. I will say that after seeing it on DVD it does hold up to repeat viewings. In conclusion I've seen better but you could do worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crashed into a Mountain......","review":"It is high time the Academy took a movie like Crash and put it where it belongs. On top. Of a mountain if you will. I have seen both films, Crash wins. It was nice to see the Academy hit us square between the eyes. Although Brokeback was good, it was a simple love story. Bottom line. If it were a male/female love story rather than a male/male love story it wouldn't have even been nominated for best picture. Way to go Crash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Go with Norelco","review":"After tens of years of blade use, I purchased this Braun. The results were extremely disappointing. Even with time consuming, over and over trips, the shaves were not close. After 2 weeks, I talked my son into trying, and I used his 3-year old Norelco. What a difference! The Norelco's shave was much cleaner, and much faster than the Braun. After a few days, my son was begging for his Norelco back. Even though his beard is significantly lighter than mine, he couldn't get a close shave either.Today I returned the Braun, and just prior to writing this review, I ordered a Norelco."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good shaver","review":"Yep, this shaver works quite good. The battery lasts a good week or two before a recharge is necessary. It cuts close, too. I have tried many different electric shavers as well as razor blades. The only way I can get a closer shaver is by using a Mach 3, going against my beard. But this causes irritation and many nicks. That is why I tried this one. It gets nearly as close, but no irritaion. My skin looks and feels better after I shave, not red and burning. But be sure to give it 2 or 3 weeks so you can get used to it. If you dont like it, Braun has a 30 day money-back policy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome shaver, replacement blades are 'pricey'","review":"Truly a great shaver.

Battery life is excellent- I only have charged it probably 4 times. I trim almost every other day to maintain a shorter beard.The plastic length adjuster is solid and repeatable.

Although intended for academic purposes, this Bible makes a perfect reading, one for people of Faith. You may, at your leisure and without compromising your acceptance of Gospel principles and basic understanding of the Scriptures, read the scholarly articles and summaries all throughout the Book. Only problem is that the binding is really weak, and pages, if not entire sections, may come off of it with extended use.

The KJV Bible was always published with the Jewish Greek books (the Apocrypha) placed between the Jewish Hebrew books and the Christian Greek books. Around the middle of the 19th century, the Apocrypha was removed from most published editions of the KJV Bible, but Oxford has published the KJV Apocrypha as a separate volume, and now the entire KJV Bible is available in this low-cost paperback edition. Want the entire Bible that was authorized by the King of England? This is it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing e-book","review":"Having been impressed with the print edition of this bible, I thought it would be a useful addition to my Kindle library (especially because it includes the KJV Apocrypha). But it is very difficult to navigate this e-book edition since the table of contents is impossibly long: it is just a list of every chapter of every book. The navigation is much better in, for instance, the Kindle edition of the Ignatius Bible (RSV 2CE).The text itself is marred by numerous scanning errors. The chapter headings, customarily printed at the top of the page, are omitted.We must hope that a sound digitally created edition of the KJV (complete with the Apocrypha and, like this edition, the important preface of the Translators) will eventually be ported to Kinde (this seems to have been created from a scan). The New Cambridge Paragraph Bible would be the ideal base text."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bible as Literature","review":"This a splendid edition of the Authorized King James Version! It focusses on the Bible as literature, which makes it somewhat unique among study Bibles. The print is clear, and the paper is thicker and more opaque than that of most Bibles, thus making it very easy to read. The supplementary articles are quite scholarly and objective but not technically difficult. I have been wanting a Bible of this sort for years, but somehow this edition has escaped my notice until recently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad Introduction","review":"I wanted to start reading the Bible and picked this version up. I was very surprised at the Intro which seems to treat this book like just another work of literature. Almost a fairy tale. Were these editors atheists? Don't know and don't care. I just know that I don't want their casual comments on the Holy Bible I choose to read. I will get another Bible. One that is treated with the respect it deserves. I question everything with boldness, don't need them to question it for me.

The old testament was filled with things I don't even want to write about. It was hard enough just reading it. \\"Hey son, time to die! Psych!\\" Or how about what happens to Jobe? Strange way to show your loving side. I also take issue with the marriages that go on in the bible. Apparently God gives a pass to marring your daughter, your sister in law, having sex with your son but two men getting married? Shocker! The new testament was MUCH better. It's about this Jesus guy who seemed really cool. Like some one I'd want to hang with and not be judged. Too bad Jesus had poor choices in friends. Most betrayed him in the end and the Romans nailed him to a cross! Just sad. Then comes the ending, I won't spoil it for you, but just think fire and brimstone and you get the picture.

While it does offer the beautiful KJ text with Apocrypha, plus the seldom-seem \\"Epistle to the Reader,\\" the editors are extremist Biblical minimalists, who regard most of the OT as fictional post-exilic propaganda. Among the many outrageous claims made in their notes: Abraham was an immoral monster; Isaiah and Jeremiah never existed; the Davidic dynasty never existed; St. Paul was a devious sophist who is responsible for centuries of anti-semitic violence; and on and on.

These screws have a tendency to strip out faster and are less resilient. The RAXXESS just seem to be made stronger and can take a bit of cross threading. I used these on a new and used rack, and like any used rack there is a tendency to have some messed up threads.

Covers the aspects of dice control, trouble-shooting and goes further with some wager tactics. It contains not only the words of Frank Scoblete, but also of other great and known shooters.The main objective here (obviously) is dice control. But I was actually happy when I saw several wagering approaches. There are books that cost a lot and are about progression build ups on a hot roll. Well, there's a small 6 step 6-8 press that has become a favorite I committed to memory with no question or doubt. A work of art that puts you in a zone of safety after 2 hits on either number.Not much more to say. It is what it is and you get more than you pay for.

Don't get carried away though. There are studies that refute any influencing of the dice by dice setters. The only studies mentioned are by those who are selling dice setter information. The methods in the book are certainly worth experimenting with, but not with your hard earned money. If you have been to Vegas recently its apparent that many people have read this book and are trying out the theory of dice setting. Does anyone think if dice setting took even a tiny part of the casinos profit that it would be allowed to continue?

I found that the sentence completion questions are decent (not perfect, for no prep book can be exactly like the actual test). It was rather disappointing to see some questions were vague. For instance, it tested idioms which is not commonly seen in the actual test (in fact, I dont think it's seen at all). But the real disaster was the reading comprehension questions. The questions are not like the actual questions at all, and they are very subjective and ambiguous. If you get a few questions wrong using this book, dont worry.

This book is very discouraging to students and made me very anxious and scared about taking the SAT.

Mumps were (along with The Fast) one of the most underrated bands of the New York scene in the 1970s. They knew just a few too many chords and their lyrics were just that bit too arch, at a time when irony and musicianship hadn't come back into fashion yet. Taking their influence from Sparks, Roxy Music, and the glam scene, they rose to a level of sophistication which almost guaranteed they would never find their audience in that doctrinaire place and time.Hopefully this reissue will help them find the audience who need to hear them.Kristian Hoffman's commentary on the DVD is delightful.

This CD is a total waste of money unless you're the kind of person who likes to get wasted and listen to trash. In that case, turn the radio to in-between stations and listen to white noise, there's more musical talent there.

I would have to say that there are a few songs that I can listen to (Cornflake Girl, Winter, Crucify, God; Caught a lite sneeze made me laugh). I love Tori, and I love the idea that people want to do covers of her songs and I understand that when you do a cover you should make it your own, and it shouldn't sound exactly like the original but come on. I'm sure that if I wasn't a fan of Tori,and maybe had never heard the originals that these songs could be great.

When Tori does remakes she takes the song apart and then reassembles it in Tori fashion. That is her art, as well as her original songs. I bought this record thinking it would be fun. I had never heard of any of the other artists. I know lots of people love Tori, but the people involved with this compilation just did remakes of the songs without making the songs their own. Plus, the other problem is that Tori has such a unique sound that it doesn't really lend it's self to remakes. I think that if this record would have been put in more capable hands it could have been pulled off. But, instead, we get a bunch of Tori-wanna-be's doing Tori. And not really doing Tori very well at all..."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"true, it must be very hard to cover any of the songs that Tori Amos has done, but this hasn't done her any justice at all.

As I am writing this I am listening to the Sweet remix, and personally it sounds more like hip hop than goth, and it's the same story with dollhouse. Athough Sweet does cause me to headbang rather violently, in terms of being named under a gothic band and having the unrelated name of 'Sinister Nostalgia' (as nothing is sinister about this album), this album is a miserable failure. The only real success (I didn't listen to the whole album for the saftey of my gothic air) is Clown, mother's mix. But in truth it is really just Mother (drool) and Clown combined, with Clown the prelimanary song.... This album has failed my expectations and has sorely dissapointed me. I would reccomend simply downloading the songs off of KaZaA or something rather than wasting your money, unless you like a strange mix of hip hop with a tinge of goth."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few gems, but mostly uninspired techno remixes","review":"This album serves as a reminder of the importance of arrangement, and specifically, of Susan Wallace.I might be coming from a slightly biased perspective. I really enjoy Switchblade Symphony, so I might be somewhat less receptive. Also, I am not generally fond of dance/electronica. I'm sorry, but the same 4/4 drum pattern and two-measure synth loop gets old after five minutes.There are a few songs which I can stand on this album (Rampid and Clown), but my affection ends there. The rest seem horribly disjointed; we're not talking about a little forgivable mixplay, but rather an attrocity. Most of these songs sound like some raverboy added Tina's vocals to whatever bouncy-... electronica happened to be in his Casio's memory at the time. Not everything needs or warrents a full-blast drum machine assault, and not everything can be a dance song (at least not without some serious work).Granted it's hard as ... to match Susan's style, but this is a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply awesome remix album!","review":"If you like Switchblade Symphony there is no excuse not to own this album as well!

It seemed to be low on motor power and had a tough time on a thick beard. This was unlike most of the other Brauns that I had owned. I am afraid they had cheapened this low end model to the point it was made in China. I decided to replace it with aBraun 5414. A nice German made shaver with a pivoting head.

I don't have any kind of problem skin but the shaver painfully tugs at my beard stubble, leading to a lot of \\"ouch!\\"s. The shaver irritates my skin and my skin develops red blotches. After about 50 shaves, the foil developed a large hole. The usefulness of the long-hair trimmer is very limited because when deployed it extends only about half an inch from the shaver at a 90 degree angle, which means you have to hold the shaver so close to the face that you can barely see what you are shaving. The only positive quality of this shaver is its light weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a poorly designed razor!","review":"Ever since Gillete bought out Braun, their razors have gone downhill.

As said in other reviews, I like the fact that it doesn't irritate like a rotary shaver, but you have to go over each spot several times (quadruple that for under the chin) to get a patch-free shave. After 1/2 year I've had to shave with it plugged in since the battery loses power very quickly, and consequently, loses shaving effectiveness (which was bad enough already).

People focus on his hard-drinking, his 'bum-like' persona, but what makes him remarkable is how his fiction and poetry reflects REALITY: the 'failure' and humiliation of being an artist (and essentially voiceless) in America.

This is an essential book for anyone interested in sampling different facets of Bukowski's writing without spending a lot of money. I've had it for a few years, and always end up re-reading parts of it. Lots of poetry, short stories, and quite a few novel excerpts. The only complaint I have is that they do not always tell the reader which book the excerpt/poem comes from.

It's more a history of the diamond fields during the early years than a study of the diamond industry as a whole, but it offers many captivating stories of those times and Kanfer's writing brings them alive. I won't use the usual \\"I couldn't put it down\\" cliche (it's a bit big to read at one sitting) but I couldn't wait to start reading it again.It explains in great detail the convoluted shenanigans of those early \\"pioneers\\", how greed made South Africa into a land of woe and strife, and how one man managed to gain a diamond monopoly and turn it into a huge industry.

Tips - Read Professional Engineers Act, Professional Land Surveyors Act carefully. If you can, read Subdivision Map too. As I remember, there were about 9 to 14 questions relating to those Acts in both times I took the survey. If you do know these Acts, you can solve each problem in within 30s to 1 min, which means that you can save 10 mins to 20 mins for other questions.

The author is doing alot of wishfull thinking. Hex signs are not in any way christian in origin. They were adopted by one sect of christians whose bloodline held to dutch norse. They are in fact heathen in origin and the rosette(six pointed star) symbolizes the nine worlds of norse cosmoligy are it is in no way connected to ritual magick of solomon or freemassonry. Although they have been adopted for use in these systems. This book wasnt well researched and is mearly seems to be trying to steal cultural and Heathen religious symbols to promote christianity.

The outline and paper quality of \\"A Thousand Days of Magic\\" are also much better than this one, which is poorly presented by surrounding the pictures with lots of words.

However, in this book there are enough photographs both in black and white and in color to satisfy any fashion junkie or Jackie O fan. No matter what the situation, Jackie O was always appropriately and fashionably attired. This book does an excellent job of showing this by portraying her clothing choices through the years and in a variety of categories. This book does not go into great detail about Jackie O as a person or historical figure, I don't think it was written with those objectives in mind, but it should satisfy the fashion cravings of most people. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A life-saver, even a marriage-saver","review":"Wow! It's tough to imagine how marriages couldn't be strengthened if couples were to read at least one John Gottman book. By now, much of Gottman's wisdom have seeped into popular culture, but the power of his writing continues to be the case studies he describes. Reading the words of couples who say the \\"right\\" and \\"wrong\\" things to one another really helps a reader develop a store of scripts, to know how to respond when similar situations arise in real life.The examples alone make this book worth reading and re-reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy!","review":"After reading this book, I feel that it was worth it. Although no book is going to make a marriage perfect, this is very informative on different relationship styles and pitfalls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very typical...

Some of the quizzes to assess your marriage were interesting (for example, I didn't think I would be comfortable in an avoidance style marriage, but a quiz proved me wrong), but for the most part this book didn't offer me any new insight. I don't feel like any information in this book will be able to applied to help my marriage last. My husband and I also have a very good marriage, so I felt like a lot of the points presented do not apply to me.

I will most likely always order my books from this site, it's just that good! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The science is new, but not the conclusions","review":"Gottman's research integrity is impeccable and his data and conclusions deserve attention. One thing that irks me however is his disdain for his predecessors. The fact that many in the marriage field reached the same exact conclusions intuitively that Gottman verified empirically tells me that the intuitive method is not so bad in this arena. More than he admits, he is standing on the shoulders of others. That said, his warmth and humor is evident, and impartiality to any type of agenda is evident. In our present cultural environment, he is bringing an apparatus of credibility to the marriage and family field"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"This is one of my favorite relationship books. It really focuses on communication, and gives you real guidance on what to do, and what to watch out for, in your communication with your spouse.

Once he started reading it, however, he was quite impressed, and had many highlighters and sticky notes on his favorite parts. I highly recommend.

The book is very poorly organized. Examples are given in pieces of JavaScript code, without much explanation about how the code can be used in a HTML document.

He seems impatient with his readers, and this one is left feeling very confused. Many of the examples lack cross browser compatability; one even includes a visual basic script which seems laughable, given the title of the book. The text accompanying the examples is irritating because it is often not clear which words are javascript syntax and which are not.

They give you code in green boxes and most of the time its supposed to work. Well..when you try it 1/2 the times it doesn't because you needed to add all of this other code that they don't tell you about. They tend to say \\"if you look at this simple code...its all you need\\" and like I said more often than not it isn't.The ONLY people i would recommend this to are people who have a fare amount of JavaScripting behind them, because they will be able to recognize where they have presented the info in a confusing way, and hopefully they won't have to spend time browsing the CD for code examples."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book for diving into javascript.","review":"This book did a nice job of helping me get my feet wet using javascript.

It starts to cover things right off that bat without much gibber jabber that most books have. The css/layers chapter was very nice too and I enjoyed that. Best of all, it covers javascript much swifter than some books like \\"JavaScript Unleashed\\" does. Of course, JS Unleashed is a good book too, but a little bit too long to read(about 800-1000) pages.

The service rep did not know about this issue and seemed to assume it was unique to me... So I have a suspicion the replacement will not fit, either. Maybe if enough people call Braun and complain, somebody will notice and fix the underlying problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Um, it shaves!","review":"I swap in a new one every year, and the difference is very noticeable... if you aren't getting a good shave without pressing it hard, you need a new foil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing redesign of foil","review":"This should have been a very simple purchase of replacement parts. However, Braun has seen fit to redesign the screen pattern on the foil. This provided a noticeably less close shave in combination with the new cutter block as soon as I used it. I put the old foil back on (but kept the new cutter block), and the closeness of the shaver improved immediately.So, looks like I'm using the old foil until it gives up the ghost."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's like buying a new Razor","review":"I bought this replacement cutting head for my 3.5 year-old Braun syncro and it was like buying a new razor. The head is the new \\"octagonal\\" surface holes that was added to the newer design so, in essence, it can be viewed as an upgrade. It's worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"always handy to have an extra in your packing case for trips","review":"unpleasant shaving experiences come from dinted/ripped foils.thanks for the shipment and we will hopefully not need them too frequently as is usually the case.well engineered braun. pat yourself on the back"},{"rating":"2","title":"works great","review":"To keep my Braun shaver, and my face - happy - having these parfts available and replaced every 18months is essential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braun replacement shaver","review":"This made my braun like new. After 3 years of faithful service the blades were dull. I should not have waited that long to change them."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is out of stock and they are sending 30Bs, but that may not be a bad thing","review":"I bought this for my 8595 after reading multiple reviews about the new replacement models and how they were not as good as the older style. I purposely bought this 7000-series replacement for my 8000-series razor because I wanted to get the older style.Well, seems like they have run out of the old style and are now sending the 30Bs without any warning. So buy at your own risk, this product is not being sold as advertised.For what it's worth, it fits my 8595, and the initial shaves are ok. We'll see how it is after 6 months, I guess.UPDATE: 2 years later and I'm still getting good shaves out of this. Wow. I'm getting close to replacing, but will be doing so with another 30b when I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied customer","review":"Very pleased with the product and the delivery.

It came very quickly after I ordered too ... thankfully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braun Razor products.","review":"Braun razor replacement parts for this particular model are difficult to find. Amazon is one source that I rely on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wowsers... shaving is expensive.","review":"Lucky for me I have a thin beard.But wow; first time I've had to buy a replacement for my Braun shaver and boy it's pricey. Recommended to replace every 6 months? yikes.Anyways; best price I've seen so far is this amazon deal. I bought a new blade because my old one was starting to pull at my hairs. So far so good on this replacement. I didn't really need a new netting though... wish they had just the blade for sale. I didn't see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got it fixed.","review":"Thought I was going to be up for quite a few bucks when the button refused to stay down to start the cleaning process.I must have had the shaver about 8 years and I like it.The replacement top shell was very finicky to re-attach.After some delicate alignment I was able to put it all together again.Definitely worth the effort.A shame there is no instruction guide somewhere on line to make the assembly easier.Maybe Braun should help out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Braun Shaver replacement blades","review":"This bladed replacement adds new life to a wonderful product. You can't go wrong with Braun.Keeping it going like new is just a sound strategy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great substitute for Activator 8595 shavers!!!","review":"I was looking for cutter and foil replacement for my Activator 8595 and could not find the original one any more. Braun has replaced that with a foil & cutter from series 5 shavers and as you read the reviews the shape of the cutter is different from the original series 8 cutters. Somebody suggested to use series 7000 foil and cutter instead, which is this item. The cutter is exactly looking the same as the original 8595 cutter but the foil BODY is colored BLACK (for 7000 series) instead of SILVER (for 8000 series) which was not an issue for me.Now my 8595 shaver is back to its original performance and I'm really happy with my purchase.Thanks to all who put useful reviews on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Syncro Screen and Cutter","review":"Great price, and the only place online that would ship these to an APO.

The connectors on the head would not fit my razor and I had to return an opened package. Without opening the blister pack, there was no way of knowing whether or not it would fit.
