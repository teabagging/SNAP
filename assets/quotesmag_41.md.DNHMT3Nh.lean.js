That should have told what I was getting into. This is an Art Film, not a regular movie.I found the movie to be only somewhat amusing and very confusing. This movie is based on a great idea: tell the background story of two minor characters from Hamlet. While it is filled with some great dialogue (most lifted from Hamlet) and a few great scenes (I particularly liked the one at the beginning with Richard Dreyfuss as the Player King and his troupe of slightly mad actors), it also overly complex and, for the most part, almost incomprehensible.The extra DVD with additional material and interviews of the cast and director interviews was even worse than the film. This is not really worth your time and energy. Comedies are supposed to be funny, or at least entertaining, and this was not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not gripping","review":"Admittedly the film is clever and the acting is good and it has it's moments of entertainment, BUT overall it's long and pretty boring. It seems it would have been better suited as a play, which apparently it was originally. I had just finished re-reading Romeo and Juliet when I rented this, thinking I was still in a Shakespeare mood, but this didn't do it for me. I suppose if I had just finished reading or watching Hamlet, it would have been better. My favorite parts are Oldman's silent scientific discoveries, completely amusing. Couldn't wait for the movie to end, honestly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting premise, boring execution","review":"My wife is a huge Shakespeare fan and didn't know about this movie. I had seen it before but wasn't too up to date on Hamlet to really appreciate. Well we just saw the Branagh version (a must see) and rented this. Unfortunately it is still boring, which is really too bad since I think the premise is very interesting. As I read all the reviews I wonder if I have seen the same video these other people have. Roth, Oldman and Dreyfuss are good, but the people who are playing the other \\"minor\\" characters from Hamlet seemed like they were sleepwalking through their parts. I liked the verbal tennis match, but for the most part it seemed like Stoppard was trying to out-Shakespeare Shakespeare. I bet this works better on the stage, but it certainly does not work on the movie screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that bad","review":"In my opinion, Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead, was an okay film. There were slight alterations from the true Hamlet as well as from the play itself when the movie was created. In this movie, Hamlet's \\"to be or not to be\\" speech appears before the \\"get the to a nunnary\\" speach. I could not see any signifigance as to why those two scenes were altered. Another differance bewteen the two was the form of comedy. In the play, the humor comes from what the characters say. In the movie Stoppard descided to make the actions more funny than the words behind them. The casting was very good, and I enjoyed watching them act in this film. I would not recomend anyone buy this movie, however, if you have nothing better to do, it's not that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor condition","review":"What I saw of the movie was enjoyable but the DVD was scratched and in very poor condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"canal + had this video programmed","review":"The fact that the coin kept on falling on his head everytime, said it al:This movie is timeless and NOT availableI saw this film for four aor five years ago on the filmchannel in Holland, now called Canal+,Please I want to sea the film again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Profoundly unfunny and completely unwatchable film.","review":"Completey and utterly unfunny performances by Oldman and Roth. Stoppard may be a brilliant playwright but a filmmaker he is not, having botched a great potential for his play on the big screen. We get instead a literal and utterly uncinematic treatment of his much-touted play. Watching the first fifteen minutes of \\"heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads, heads,\\" is colossal torture, like status elipticus. It's suited to the stage maybe but can never play well on the big screen. Having hopes it might pick up, that was dashed as the entire film seem to lack any momentum or any type of cinematic sensibility whatsoever. A classic blunder of failing to recognize two different mediums. Don't take my word for it, watch it yourself and see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too difficult","review":"I am an educated person, but I have not read much Shakespeare and unless you have an English major this movie is NOT for you.

Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead undoubtedly worked on the stage with it's verbal athlectics and cheeky trope of Hamlet. On the screen, it's a miserable, deathly bore. I kept watching, hoping for the laughs that undoubtedly were heard in the theater. Nothing! Nada! Zip!Roth and Oldman, frankly, are not very good. They're both very one dimensional and start to get on your nerves which adds to the boredom. You don't care about them. Roth is impatient and sour; Oldman is dim and vacuous. Spending a whole movie with these two is punishing. Stoppard's direction is even worse. The verbal lines go quickly, but it all seems sooo slow. That's incompetent direction.There are alot of good reviews of this by other watchers. In fact some \\"best movie I've ever seen\\" comments.

I stumbled across it one evening when I was working on my bike in the living room. It just happened to be on PBS. I thought it looked like your usual Medieval setting drama, so I watched it. I was soooo wrong.Within minutes I was laughing uncontrollably. It is incredible how well thought out the plot, the interplay, and the relation to hamlet is. This film will give you plenty to think about, as well as simply knock you over with it's humor. Tom Stoppard has written several plays, including Arcadia, The Real Inspector Hound, and others. He's a phenominal writer and this film was expertly played out by Tim Roth and Gary Oldman.

However, understand going into this movie that you are expected to know Hamlet inside and out. In fact if you don't recognize the title you may already be in trouble. The plot involves scenes from the play that aren't in the play but exist outside the play. I don't want to ruin it too much for you. It is a meditation on the world of fictional characters. It is very stagy, which is totally approiate to the material, but will certainly put off people who don't enjoy plays versus movies.

If you read world history in much detail, you will find all sorts of invective heaped on Clausewitz, who properly stands next to Sun Tzu as an appraiser of war. The section by Clausewitz is a good introduction to his work. Jomini is one of the sources of the \\"war by formula\\" pattern, as is du Picq.

A very sacred, Cathedral-sounding mantra (with tuning forks in the background)that cuts to the soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Took this to my class and played it and then had them join in with the chant...

No variation of the 'theme' that is 9 repeated chords.

It is wonderful. It intensifies my meditation time, making it much easier and quicker to get into the zone. By the way, it is a meditation in and of itself. I would encourage everyone to study the gematria, the meanings and the usages of this power name to catapult your meditations and empower the healing you will discover within yourself here. Open yourself to spirit and find yourself in-spirit (inspired) after using this tool to elevate your consciousness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"Really appreciate Jonathan's gift of sound healing.

Let's face it...if you like nutty, unreal animals, you'll enjoy DinoCroc. It is in the same realm as huge snakes/boas/anacondas, sharks, octopi, lizards/komodo dragons, etc. & is simply an escape from the real world that lets you watch all the destruction/carnage that these animals cause. If you are a true fan of these type of movies, you'll enjoy it (even when you're picking apart how the things that are happening are not possible)! I love these type of movies & I know they are not for everyone but if you like them, you'll like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"As far as Sci-Fi movies go....","review":"I'd have to say this is one of the better Sci-Fi films.

But I love these horrible B movies with ridiculously outrageous creatures and even worse acting. They're fun and you don't have to ponder into meaning very much.

If you like the Roger Corman stuff, this won't disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"Why such films like this get good reviews is beyond me.

It gets lose and begins to eat people and the local nut decides to stop it while trying to prove it exists to the sheriff.I baught the movie for $19.99 when it came out and i was greatly diappointed. Roger Corman is famous because he's a genious? Yeah right and im am Tom Cruise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joe D.","review":"I just finished listening to the 3rd CD in this set. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the set contained some tunes and artists of whom I was not familiar. Therefore, my complete enjoyment was slightly less than I anticipated. But I emphasize this it a personal note and may not be a factor for other buyers. That said the package provides over 2 1/2 hours of big band music from the glory days of the late thirties and early and mid forties. Any lover of big band music will thoroughly enjoy this set. The CD quality of the tunes is good to very good. The sound quality does vary from selection to selection, but this is to be expected given the age of the tunes. I was not disappointed that I bought this, and again, if you like big bands you will enjoy these CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Collection","review":"For us old timers, this is a nice collection of the music way back when music had a melody.

The rest of the tracks, however, show a steady slog through unvarying takes on XTC's tribal rhythms, Magazine's claustrophobic ennui, and the Talking Heads' lighter global-light tunes with nods to reggaeish and funky beats. None of this has worn particularly well.The album seems to never end, and the similar sludgy pace of most of the songs weighs down whatever clever insights the lyrics might contain. The band is accomplished at what they do, and the vocal and bass-playing abilities sound confident, but there's nothing that makes this band stand out from any other group elsewhere in the early 80s, unfortunately. For completists of NZ rock only, alas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This series are great, love the characters.

I have a large Waterford collection and ordered two wine glasses to replace recently broken glasses through Amazon. The glasses came on time securely packaged in Waterford boxes. They were trademarked \\"Waterford\\" and were marked \\"made in the Czech Republic.\\" On first glance they look the same, but when you \\"ping\\" them you notice that it doesn't \\"ring\\" like the old stuff. It is also a bit thicker and a bit heavier. I researched it and some say that the Irish made glass was hand blown while the new product is machine made. It looks ok, but it is not as thin or as light as the original Waterford and doesn't have that same delightful crystal sound when you toast with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Suff To Have","review":"This 256MB DataTraveler II USB is slim, looks beautiful, and is physically strong.

These 11 songs, many orchestrated, show their maturing pop sense and always evocative sense of drama. Years down the road now, they sound less like the Smiths than ever, and all the better for it. Martin Rossiter is in beautiful voice, and his bandmates match his commitment verse for verse. Welcome back, boys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated and not worth the price","review":"Echoing what a number of other reviewers have noted, the reality in Taiwan is substantially different than what is portrayed in this book. It may have been more accurate 30-40 years ago, but Taiwan has changed substantially (politically, economically, and socially) in the interim and either the authors have not bothered to update their experiences or they themselves are stuck in the past. I found little of value in it and my wife, a native of Taiwan, found it cartoonish, laughable and occasionally offensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book if you want to learn about Taiwan and its culture!","review":"This book was a great introduction to Taiwanese culture and what to expect when visiting Taiwan. I have read other books related to traveling and a lot of them lack the cultural depth and understanding. Culture Shock Taiwan gives a lot of information without being boring by adding a lot of personal touches. I really enjoyed reading about the culture and etiquette of Taiwan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"I was disapointed by this edition of the Culture Shock series. Taiwan, as exotic a place as you can imagine, must be full of specific cultural behaviors. And the entire book only said to be alert and aware of them. There were no specifics. For those of us who are looking for specific do's and don'ts when traveling, this book was largely useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taiwan Culture Shock","review":"This book provides an excellent introduction to the different culture in Taiwan.

A lot coke snorting during the late seventies and early eighties made for uninspired performances and this is not an exception. Virtually no highlights to speak of throughout this show from Dublin. The recording isn't especially good either. Strange because just three years later I saw Glen do a show in Caesar's at Lake Tahoe that was a ripsnorter, seemingly minus the coke. Of this Dublin show, it was not particularly well sung, the songs were played too fast and there was none, I repeat none, of Glen's usual flashy guitar work. Also, the disc didn't play on my regular machine and I had to play it on my DVD recorder. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable holster","review":"Very comfortable and good looking holster. Made for a Glock 22, but holds my Glock 27 very well.

It breaks no new ground and wasn't much different from Swanberg's treatment. But still very much worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed and understandable","review":"The start of a war is always interesting; we cannot read to many books on Bunker Hill or Ft. Sumter. Mr. Detzer treats us to a very readable beginning of the American Civil War and the city that started it. 1861 Charleston is well drawn, very understandable and engaging as a city on the brink of war. Major Robert Anderson determined to do his duty with little guidance from above and constant criticism from below, takes center stage. Washington, distant and unsure is as much of a problem for him as the Rebel guns in the harbor. Presenting the position of the Confederate Government and the \\"fire eaters\\" in Charleston as they see events helps the reader understand the decisions made. While not agreeing or disagreeing, the author informs and guides the reader through this complex time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for understanding the events of Fort Sumter","review":"To tell you how good this book is, I picked this book up almost as a lark. I only had planned to glance through the first few pages before setting it down to read later and the next thing I knew I'd read 50 pages. That's how good a writer David Detzer is.The book itself follows the events of 1861 in Charleston South Carolina as a small garrison of Union soldiers try to hold out against the growing tide of secessionism. These men and more specificly the fort they hold becomes an important symbol for both sides as events begin to boil. The man in the center of all this is Maj. Robert Anderson, commander of the Union garrison. Raised in the south, Anderson tries desperately to prevent the war he knows is fast approaching.Allegiance isn't just a good Civil War book but a good book in general. It will be the standard for many years to come on the subject of Fort Sumter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Demo, but just say NO to walkthru's","review":"I managed to download the full version of the game. I was pleased to learn from the opening cinema scene that good 'ol Guybrush is still as incompetent as ever. I was disappointed that I wasn't allowed to visit Meathook or the Vodoo lady, and was told that I had to wait for the retail version. I also would have liked one or two more puzzles in the demo. Instead, the only thing I could do is stop the catapult. I already have a pre-order of the game, but will refuse to buy any sort of walkthru guide. Buying a guide for a game removes the teensiest bit of challenge, and might even prevent you from discovering hidden jokes in the game. You also get a much better sense of satisfaction knowing that YOU beat the game, not the game guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be awful nice if I could play it","review":"I have been a fan of the Monkey Island series for the longest time, and I sincerely love all their games. But the latest is a big disappointment. B/c it requires a 3D card, I can't play it--it's awfully hard to install a 3D card on a laptop.

The software is very, very buggy and prone to freezing and locking up your system. You'll spend many, many hours of your time in futile efforts to make the game work. And, believe me, those efforts will be futile. Shame on LucasArts for putting such a shoddy piece of programming out in the market place. Maybe that's why there is NO moneyback guarantee with the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"I bought this game on suggestion from an email prompt for my kids and it's not at all like a video game. My family found it very repetative and slow.

Why it had to be 3D? The drawing stile from Curse of Monkey Island (third game) was great, very funny.

If you never played a Monkey Island game, it's a good title to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game!","review":"It's a very fun and cool game. Sometimes you want to destroy it and sometimes you love it.

Great graphics (just right for The Monkey Island), decent controls you can get used to (point'n'click would definitely be better though), puzzles and humour in line with those in the previous installments of the seriers.Some aspects of gameplay the storyline are disappointing though. For example, \\"insult fencing\\" is limited and usless, and \\"functional\\" replacement for it is downright boring.The ending, and, most importantly, the epilogue sequneces were really disappointing.Despite its shortcoming, it's still a good game, and I recommend it to everyone who enjoyed other LucasArt's quests."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Gr-rrr-rrr-eat!","review":"This game is great, mind you I've only made it to the second island. It's especially good for all you people who have trouble figuring out the more time consuming problems because it comes with a \\"starter\\" clue book that can help you through the first couple secrets. I think that people who purchased and loved the other Lucas Arts great Grim fandango would also fancy Escape from Monkey Island 4. It features the same killer graphics, cool problems, hilarious jokes, and best of all ... an accompanying clue book. Now bare in mind that the clue book only takes you so far, I am wondering where to find the complete clues (Yes, I do want to cheat...), and am hoping that Amazon will pick it up soon.

It features the stories of the generals themselves. Absolutely a great source for understanding the decisive battles. And the fact that both allied and axis commanders are represented is a clear bonus. Ie, Adolf Galland of the Luftwaffe tells the story the Battle of Britain as seen from the German side. Oh, and in that account lies a great little gem; how one single German Pilot involuntarely changed the battle by dropping bombs over London, not even knowing where he was. Excellent. I recommend this to to anyone with the slightest interest of WWII - it's also a good read to get an overview."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hip music from a Louisiana legend","review":"\\"Dealin' With the Feelin'\\" is the first nationally available CD from Lil' Alfred since his days with Cookie and the Cupcakes, and it's long overdue. From the opening trumpet blasts of the title tune, the CD perks and hops. Alfred's soulfull crooning of songs like \\"She's Looking Good\\" covers Wilson Pickett well, but it's the newer tunes like the title cut and the exceptionally grooving \\"I've Got the Wrong Somebody\\" that really make the album shine. Highly recommended for r&b fans who are looking for the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Get Hot, quickly or otherwise","review":"The package states that this iron heats up in less than a minute. I waited over 5 minutes, then ten and it did not heat up to a hot temperature at all.

I could hold the metal rods IN MY HAND and they weren't hot enough for me to remove my hand. Maybe I have a defective curling iron or maybe it's junk.As to the question if the triple barrels give a good wave, I have no idea since the rods never did heat up enough to put a curl to my hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 bads don't make a good","review":"The specs look great, and the features it has work great. Sound quality is amazing. But many parts of the device are cheaply made, such as the main navigaion/controll device, and the headphone jack, both things needed for operation of the player. Also if you're buying this for OGG or FLAC playback be warned it doesn't play many of these properly. Within two weeks the screen broke, I tried to get it repaired with Cowon but they where of no help, so I returned it to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"I wanted to like this product.I really wanted to like this product.But I am severely disappointed.When I purchased the iAudio this past summer, I quickly learned that my unit had problems. When I moved an mp3 file onto the player, about 85% of the time there would be these weird skips and electronic noise associated with it. Sometimes deleting and reinstalling the file helped. Often it didn't.So I contacted their customer service, and updated the firmware as instructed. The problem was still there. So I returned it to Cowon, and they insisted that the player was fine.I sincerely doubt that random electronic noise is a feature, but once they say that there isn't a problem I don't know what else to do. So they sent it back to me. I've tried it out again, and the problems remain.On a lark tonight, I looked them up on the Better Business Bureau website. Their rating is an F. Go figure.I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Customer Centres are no good","review":"It was a nice little thing for a couple of months.

Turn on your system, put the record on and play the first piece, the Grand Hotel, and you will see what I mean. In this concert everything else is also great: Gary at his best, charming and immortal, the conductor with his top-notch musicians (do notice the outstanding violinist in Grand Hotel!) and the unbelievable quality of sound recording that equals the studio one.

You get versions of the hits of course and even a great 1974 tv special featuring songs mainly from that era of the band's history. It's in color thankfully too. And it's good that it even exists as much of the stuff from that era got erased. This footage looks perfect even and you can step back into the fantastic music scene of the 70's with those songs , including the terrible hairstyles people had back then, but at least their clothes weren't baggy.The rest is the concert filmed during the day and I agree with the three star reviewer; that it should have been filmed at night, but to rate this a three star because of that is beyond me. This is progressive rock at it's finest with a fine orchestra and choir to boot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too good","review":"My husband is a Clarence White fan.

It is quite possibly the best of its breed.This album has been in my regular rotation (ie. once a week at least) for over a year now, and will probably never leave. It has entered my personal Top Ten of All Time list... which is not a trivial designation.I think anyone who is a fan of Maceo, James Brown, John Scofield, G.

This CD has been in constant weekly rotation for the past four years. These guys really have it together on this one. To be able to make those perfect combinations that produce magic on impact is a wonderful thing. These songs move forward as a whole. Every player shares the spotlight and syncs into the song to make it a living thing. If any of that made sense to you you'll love this album.I've been a Charlie Hunter fan for quite awhile now and I've since become quite a fan of Skerik's wacked out horn.Green Chimney's is my personal favorite. It's a great take on a Monk classic. A chill still goes up my spine when Skerik hits some of the notes after the intro."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first record","review":"Stanton Moore pulled together regular pals Charlie Hunter and Skerik for most of the songs on All Kooked Out. Some songs have additional horn players, and two have neither Charlie Hunter nor Skerik. This is a fairly consistantly funky jaunt through the Stanton Moore/Skerik/Robert Walter/Charlie Hunter style. \\"Green Chimneys\\" is a slight disappointment, and the last three songs seem stuck on the end. Highlights includes the opener, \\"Kooks on Parade\\", \\"Blues For Ben\\" (with mile-wide swinging horns), \\"Nalgas\\" (which is one way of saying rear end in Spanish), and \\"Stanton Hits The Bottle\\" (silly but fun).

It is small enough that it dosen't present any sort of physical challenge when carrying it around, the nozzle sprays in a decent pattern and it is durable (survived temperatures in excess of 100 degrees on a daily basis, thrown around etc..).

But, as I said, we strapped it to the roof with a few bungee cords and a carabiner on the handle. When it was time to shower, we attached the shower to the roof rack of the Suburban and hung it over the side. We used a tarp attached to the Suburban for privacy. The shower was nice and warm for two people after being in the October sun of Lake Meade/Las Vegas for about 8 hours.

In these ways, I think he reflects the experience of a lot of twenty to thirty something educated men in our modern world.

Imagine my disgust when I finally was able to hear the recordings and thought Amazon should have better described the item. Next step is deleting them from my IPOD library. Re-recordings, Re-productions, or Re-done should have been on the item cover. However, I should have read the other reviews before I bought it.

And I've seen another company get just as much motivation and appreciation mileage out of a Friday afternoon barbeque in the office.This book, written by two experts in organizational culture, discusses several different types of celebration.

As soon as I started to cut through the pumpkin, the juice, created from carving, quickly saturated the \\"non water proof\\" stencils and they just shredded to the point that you couldn't tell where the lines were anymore.I gave up after the first stencil and just threw the rest of them out.

Third and final, in spite of all that I did find it to be fun and feel that I will stay with it. I think I will enjoy it even more as I become more fit. Some of the exercises were tough for me (because of my size and arthritis in my knees)but I feel I got a good workout in the 40 minute tape session. Were I thinner I could have done more. Best advice, be realistic and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The video is fine","review":"Clearly, this video is intended to promote the other videos in the series that work the abs, upperbody and lowerbody. I'm sticking with this \\"sampler\\" because 1) I just don't have the time to spend 30 minutes on my abs, lowerbody or upperbody separately and 2) this tape does a good job of providing the toning I need.Interestingly, the weakest section on this tape is the lowerbody section, and everything I've read about the full-blown version says that it's the weakest of the series as well. So if you're strapped for time, stick with this sampler tape and save your money on the rest of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"ball good, pump is junk","review":"The ball seems fine, but the pump broke the second day I used it.Now it looks like I will have to pay another $20 or so to get another (? better) pump shipped, and have not been able to really use my underinflated ball. It was a bad choice"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to get introduce to a balance ball","review":"This is a really good introduction to the balance ball. You have to blow up the ball with a hand pump which is hard work but its a great exercise tool to have. The video shows you the basics of using a balance ball and includes an exercise routine. The exercise routine uses three excerpts from the Suzanne Deason's lower body, upper body, and ab videos. I bought two of the three full length routines because I liked the this video that much. If you are into yoga and you want to try the balance ball, I definately recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-toxic vinyl?","review":"I didn't purchase this but am wondering how this product could be \\"non-toxic\\" if it is made out of vinyl (PVC)? Vinyl is known for having pthalates, lead, dioxin, chlorine, plasticizers and other chemicals. The vinyl stability ball I recently received as a gift says the chemicals in it are known to cause birth defects and reproductive issues. I am pregnant and definitely don't want to be inhaling these or getting them on my skin; but even if I wasn't, I'd look for other products - maybe those made with rubber instead of vinyl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome ball ; Ok video","review":"The balance ball was easy to blow up (with some help). It took me a while to get used to it without falling off, but that's expected I guess.The VHS tape was extremely slow, as in it took forever for the tape to teach you the exercises. It really put me to sleep. But once I learned the exercises, I had no use for the tape. It was good in learning some basic exercises with the ball, but it definitely was a pain to sit through.Anyway, the balance ball is great for any exercise routine and this one is no difference. I've had the ball for a few months now and it hasn't deflated that much, even with kids jumping all over it at family parties. It's held up great and I'll continue to use it whenever I exercise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Off Buying JUST The Ball!","review":"Yes, the fitness ball is an absolutely wonderful idea. But I must say- don't waste your time with the video. The lower body workout was a joke- it felt more like just a series of stretches. The ab workout was better- I at least felt a little burn. The upper body workout does work out the back, though. Please keep in mind this video is more of a promotional montage of their other workout videos and is primarily designed to give you a sample preview so that you will buy the other videos. It is not a suitable substitute for even a beginner's workout. My recommendation would be to buy the ball and the body-part specific videos separately and don't waste your money on this so-called \\"kit.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Balance ball fitness has other uses too!","review":"After using similar items with special needs students, preschoolers, and for myself to releave tension, I am grateful for this product.

The company was good enough to send more, which I appreciated, but these, too, were fragile. The same thing happened, but this time after I had the whole thing assembled and staked down. A gust of wind came along, the structure tipped over, and three of the connectors shattered. Perhaps if the stakes that come with the product were longer (they're only 5 inches or so) they would stand up to a little wind better. Bottom line for me is I will never again buy such a product unless it has metal connectors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke. Crumbled. Unusable.","review":"I was SOOO excited to get this camp shower.

It literally just crumbled. :(We thought we'd make it work with a few of the other pieces.

I did.","review":"The product I received was different from the picture on Amazon and from the picture on the product storage bag. The sides stopped 4\\" above the ground and the floor was unattached to the rest of the shower/shelter combo. The manufacturer's warrantee covers only the shower/shelter, not the poles. One 2-part pole finally fitted together, but a second pole was damaged (the part inside the pole holding the folding pieces together) and would become unusable and unwarranteed with subsequent use. The assembly instructions refer to parts not included. A step is left out saying to put the 'ceiling' assembly on top of the lower retangular assembly before assembling the vertical poles. The product documentation says the shower/shelter combo is intended to collapse in high winds to cause the least damage. Yet I was unable to use stakes on the four vertical polls, since the polls were 4\\" longer than the ring to be staked in the ground."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Privy!","review":"I've purchased a couple of other Shower/shelters over the last few years to use as a privy when camping. They ended up in the local charity box because they just didn't do what they said they would. I can't tell you how many times I've been in one \`doing my business' when a light breeze came up and toppled the darn things, even when they were staked down (if they had that option)!!!! This one, finally, will be the last one I need to buy. For one thing, its size is perfect and easy to set up, now granted I use it only as a privy shelter, I mean really who showers when they go camping? But it's large enough for two people to shower in. That said, as a privy its perfect, and combine it with the Reliance Products Fold-To-Go Collapsible Portable Toilet and you've got one hell of a bathroom! I like the added pockets as well, more than enough room for shower items as well as a place to store toilet paper.

The instructions are really lame, but then most of the Chinese stuff now a days doesn't do a good job... so if you put it up once before you go camping, it will help.Not all the spring loaded clips in the poles line up with, or meet the slots they are supposed to, but it still holds up well in windy conditions. I do wish the cool towel racks were on the inside of the structure instead of on the outside. Or at least one of them. You need space inside to hang your clothes on if you are using this as a shower.

The next day when I went to use it for the first time we hung the shower bag (it's quite heavy and I'm short so my husband had to help) in the shelter and then went back to the tent to grab a towel and my bath products. As I was gathering my things we then heard a crash - the weight of the shower bag broke 1/2 the poles and the fasteners. I think my husband can rig up a sturdier design to use next year but of course that's more money, time and we weren't able to use the shelter for our whole vacation.

Since this purchase my Grandson has been able to play this unit perhaps 4 times. I just received my 3rd replacement from Sony and it failed to work right out of the box. The units have not been mistreated, dropped or otherwise abused. I am disgusted with the pitiful quality of Sony's products. The first 2 units were returned for the \\"does not read disk\\" error.

It has sold more than 110 million units worldwide since its launch, making it the most widely sold gaming system to date. It is completely reverse compatible with the original playstation. This means it has a library of thousands of games. With countless numbers of hits such as Metal Gear Solid 2 and 3, Final Fantasy X, Gran Turismo series, and the newly released God of War, and many others, the PS2 is the premiere system to own. Even after so many years after its release, it still retains its shines. In addition, the newly redesigned slim PS2 is aesthetically pleasing, being very small and quiet. If you are contemplating on purchasing this system, this system has a wide array of strengths, and honestly, barely any weaknesses. A job well done to Sony Computer Entertainment on the success of the Playstation 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great system, but addition info is needed.","review":"As far as how the PS2 Slim works, no problems at all.

Go to the UK site to check out the reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"12 Memories, quickly forgotten!","review":"This is the worst album by a band full of potential, yet unable to crack out of their shell! No way, is this better than their last album (which wasn't very good either). The only 2 good albums released by this band was their very first one \\"Good Feeling\\" and \\"The Man Who,\\" both are absolutely must hears. Especially the latter, for that is without a doubt one of the greatest British pop/alternative albums ever composed by any band! It was considered by many critics as the British album of the year, and the band gained some recognition. However, their failure to take their following album to greater heights killed their potential. But Fran is a great lyricist and the band still has some hope of breaking out. They just need to keep their heads up and go back to their original style, of their 2 first albums, and add another ingredient which was missing. One which will propel them to prominence--one in which is up to the band to discover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get it out of my head.","review":"This is the first Travis CD I bought. I thought I would only like the single Re-Offender, but was plesantly surprised at the beautiful song arrangements and amazing sounds. I was listening to this in my personal CD player and the batteries ran out at track 10, Happy to Hang Around. I was so impressed with the music that I ran to get more batteries to finish listening to the CD the first time. I have not been able to stop listening to the CD (at home, in the car). It makes me want to get the remaining CD's for a good listen. My favorite tracks are Quicksand, Re-Offender, Somewhere Else, Love Will Come Through, & Walking Down the Hill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let it grow on you","review":"If this were the first release by any band it would be heralded as a benchmark. Unfortunately, this CD has to follow in the wake of The Man Who and Invisible Band and it's only natural to attempt comparisons.Previous release from Travis were instantly accessible pop music. The songs appealed to you right away and usually just as quickly wore thin. Hey, that's what pop music is supposed to do, right? Provide three minutes of bliss and then move on.12 Memories will take a little more time to reveal itself to you but once it does it will be with you for quite a while. It's one of the few recent releases I've bought that establishes and maintains a mood from start to finish.

This is truly the most passionate of their 4 albums. I completely fell in love with the melancholic tunes. Fran Healy, singer of the group has got a soft, harmonic voice, with a wonderful tune in it! Listen, and you\`ll hear how emotional it sounds! The other bandmembers also does a great job, making the album a masterpiece. \\"Re - Offender\\", their first single from this album is a strong, emotional song, which tells us about a miserable relationship, and the sadness which follows. \\"Happy to hang around\\" expresses how you feel inside when you\`re addicted to someone, you know you never can get. It\`s about the longing for love. And it\`s love this album really is about! It\`s a brilliant CD, expresses so much. Travis are underrated, but don\`t let them be!

I guess it's just easier to write about how everything is wrong rather than actualy doing something about it.But this truly is a beautifuly unahamed record and Travis should be rightly proud of it.

In the past, they've produced some beautiful Brit pop, laden with monstrous hooks, reaching their peak with the previous \\"The Invisible Band.\\" \\"12 Memories,\\" however, lacks any stand-out tracks, and is so slow, sad, and hookless, that it's practically comatose. Every now and again, a snippet of a song, an intro, a chorus, or a bridge, may differentiate itself from the self-consciously morose mess, may even prove to be quite beautiful, but never does the rest of the song warrant a repeat. This makes for a very frustrating listen and an unfortunate record. If often joke with friends that I like boring music, but \\"12 Memories\\" may prove me wrong.

He is therefore worth getting to know. Rather then wade through several hundred pages of the deliberately (imo) opaque text in Being and Time, as I mistakenly did, this would be a nice start.Truth is, Heidegger's ideas are not all that complex, it is his language that gives the appearence of difficult thought. Inwood clarifies but succeeds in avoiding over simplification. Still, I believe someone could do an even better job of presenting Heidegger's thought to the average reader.Definitely recommended over any of those cartoon books on Heidegger which are not only too simple, but extremely dishonest and innacurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise, clear, fascinating","review":"While any introduction to Heidegger has to gloss over the finer details, Micheal Inwood minimized his simplification while simultaneously capturing the profoundness of Heidegger's thought.

Not only does it celebrate what DASW did right like building an alliance with longshore workers and successfully shutting down buisness as usual in San Francisco on the first day of the war, it more importantly reflects on what it did wrong like not dealing effectively with internal problems of racism, classism, and patriarchy and allowing an informal, unaccountable leadership to evolve. For peace and justice activists interested in building a diverse, sustainable movement for global liberation, this is a must-see documentary.

It helped confirm that pregnant women are not overly fragile!If you are a hard core yogi, this may be too basic and simple for you.Shiva does have an annoying way of saying 'exhale', but I have gotten past it. What I think GAIAM, the producers of the DVD, could have done to make this better, is segment out Shivas intro.

It is great that there are three people to follow depending on how far along you are (1st, 2nd, or 3rd trimester).

I didn't care for the new age spiritual buzz this video workout put out, i'd rather do a MBC Yoga workout any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much talk, very annoying instructor","review":"i did not like this workout at all, the yoga i do in clubs and with other tapes is so much better...Shiva is annoying with the voiceover, I mean, it is tooooo strange to do a video while the instructor does not talk to cmaera, that is sooooo weak and unprofessional, she should at least rehearsed her lines then shoot the video. This is terrible~!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not much to say other than this is a poor prenatal video","review":"it's hard to put into words how i feel about pregnancy, but if i'm going to workout, i don't want annoying, boring, snooty, dorky woman leading my workout....i have already traded this video to another, hope it's better"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pre Natal Yoga","review":"I bought this yoga tape and followed it to the letter and followed its instruction to the letter, first off I'm not new to yoga and have been doing it on and off for years. however after doing the modified prose at 3 months I miscarried my child a 3 days later. I remember going back and listening to Shiva Rea in her interview and saying yoga is safe during pregnancy, I could not help but feel she was lying through her teeth she did not seem convinced of the argument she put forth. I'm a mother of 4 and had never exercised in any of my pregnancy and really should not have even bothered with this tape. I would caution pregnant women that their is a real danger with yoga during pregnancy and I'm also a former nurse so health for me was an important part of my pregnancy. I just feel this tape is not safe for everyone and certainly not while pregnant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prenatal Yoga Video","review":"This is a great video, it caters to every stage of pregnancy, and gives you some useful information. The workout is not too strenous, yet effective, and will help with labor as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"great prenatal yoga","review":"Found this DVD to be perfect for the beginning/tried it a couple times yoga person. Tried some other DVDs which were so challenging, I amost hurt myself and the baby. This one was great in that there are 3 levels/versions of each move, so you can use it after pregnancy as well. It really helped my aches and pains. Highly recommend this DVD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Saver!","review":"I agree with other reviewers that this tape is great used throughout your pregnancy. I am not new to yoga, and when I tried it at 3 months I despaired at my wasted money. However, I tried it again at 4 months and was surprised at how much more challenging it had become! By the 5th month I was having a lot of back pain, and this video became my link to sleep, sanity and mobility. I am now in my 7th month and do this video every morning without fail.I would highly recommend this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very relaxing","review":"This really is a great video for expecting woman. My doctor okayed it and I gave it a try for the first time last night. It really is relaxing and the stretches just seem to help work out some of the aches and pains. I was sick in bed for almost 2 months with morning sickness so it feels really good to get up and stretch! The woman in the video are each in a trimester and you follow the one whose trimester you fall in. The only problem I saw with it is that it takes an hour to complete but the video is broken into 3 segments so I plan on doing one 20 minute segment each day. The poses are simple and pretty easy to pick up one. I am one of the least coordinated people ever and I managed to get through this video just fine. You do need to have a chair and a \\"yoga band\\". Other than that you got everything you need. This is a great video and I am going to continue to use it thoughout my pregnancy and beyond!"},{"rating":"1","title":"way off the beaten path","review":"Shiva, the instructor on this video, is terribly obsessed with the gentle flow of the body but lacks the strenght to lead with motivation. This yoga is good for different stages of pregnancy for some people, but it would bring my emotions too far down with her lame and impersonal messages. I did not care for her style of teaching and do not recommend this video to any one who is pregnant and looking for a yoga workout...there is so much better info out there, this is no good."},{"rating":"2","title":"I feel SOOOOO much better!","review":"Oh wow I feel great after doing this video. I am out of shape, six months pregnant and was starting to feel extreme back pain. I never work out... After doing this workout, my backpain has substantially decreased. I can even feel the baby kick more.. I really think the baby loves the work out too!I had to work up to doing the full video as I am out of shape, but even 20 minutes of it made me feel wonderful! I would definitely recomend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay","review":"It's perfectly fine and safe to use during pregnancy. I'm a person who exercised 3-4 times a week prior to getting pregnant however and it was far too easy for an intermediate exercise enthusiast. I by no means am a \\"power\\" exerciser, but this seemed to not push me even in the slightest bit - maybe that's its intent - I was wishing for a little more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mind-numbing","review":"I love Shiva Rea, but this DVD is mind-numbingly slow. I practice yoga about once a week and have had the good fortune of feeling good through my pregnancy. Now at 39 weeks, I still find the DVD too slow and mellow to keep me interested. For anyone experiencing alot of discomfort in their pregnancy, this might be nice to stretch and relax, but anyone looking for a slight physical challenge will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very basic - for beginners only","review":"While the pace of the dvd was very relaxing and non-invasive, I found the moves to be superficial and basic at best. Having the third trimester mommy on a chair for the majority of the workout was kind of ridiculous in my opinion. There is no reason she could not have done those moves and it should have been offered as an extreme modification for those experiencing any difficulty in their pregnancy rather than 'this is what you should do in your 3rd trimester'. Just because you have a big belly, it does not instantly preclude you from being able to execute many yoga poses.I was much more impressed with the Jennifer Wolfe's Prenatal Vinyasa - faster paced, much more challenging and you really felt like you got a significant workout/stretch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful DVD!","review":"I've only done yoga a few times before and I found this DVD extremely easy to follow. It leaves me feeling really great and energised, which is something every pregnant woman wants to feel! I also really like the way it is split into 3 segments, each of which can be done on its own or altogether for a really relaxing experience. I highly recommend this exercise tape for anyone looking for a good and sensible workout during pregnancy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I really enjoyed this video. When I finish, I always feel refreshed and energized. The stretches are good and very appropriate for pregnancy. Before becoming pregnant, I attained a fairly advanced level. I stopped practicing around 9 wks because of \\"all day sickness\\". I'm just picking up again in the third trimester. I had no trouble following the video and getting back into it. I liked the 3 different models showing different modifications. I didn't like that each model was specifically for a trimester. I wish it took more of a \\"do what feels right\\" approach. Many of us can still do most of the postures with no or small modifications. The tape assumes in trimester 3, all you can do is sit in a chair and put your arm or leg out. The relaxation at the end is fantastic. The modifications here are completely appropriate to enhance circulation for each trimester. All in all, it's a good pregnancy workout. It's great for anyone who wants to continue yoga practice through pregnancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"great workout for all three trimesters","review":"This is the best prenatal yoga video I have found! The modifications for the different stages of pregnancy are very helpful, and the voice over and camera work are well done. I highly recommend this video!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great for first time yoga-ers","review":"I'm sure this would be good if you were into yoga before your pregnancy, but it was terrible for me. I had read that this was easy and definitely feasible in pregnancy for us non-yoga folks. I only did this DVD twice, and both times was violently ill afterward (not even making it through the whole workout). My pregnant body just did not want to be doing yoga. I really wanted to stick it out, hearing the benefits of yoga in pregnancy, but found that other prenatal aerobics worked much better for me. The prenatal yoga section in Leisa Hart's FitMama was a lot more on my level as a beginner in yoga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good mellow prenatal video","review":"This was just what I was looking for - a prenatal specific workout that I have been able to use throughout pregnancy no matter how I am feeling. I am at 39 weeks and am still using it and plan to use it as an aid during early labor. I feel relaxed, well stretched and less achy when I am done. I like that there are several modifications demonstrated. I much prefer this over Jennifer Wolfe's Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga & Short Forms, which I also purchased, and Tantric Yoga for Blissful Pregnancy, which I rented from Netflix. When I want a more rigorous workout I apply modifications learned in this and other places to my Rodney Yee Power Yoga series (which I love). I feel I will continue to use this workout after pregnancy as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait til you 3rd Trimester!","review":"So I am at the beginning of my 2nd trimester and love Shiva Rea but I was so board by this DVD. This would be good for someone very new to yoga or much further along in their pregnancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for mom and baby","review":"I am an exercise physiologist, and I find this video to be very good for both mom and baby. It is great when combined with other pregnancy exercises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I consider myself pretty fit, and I love this during pregnancy. Kept me flexible and helped me to relax before bed. My 5 year old did it with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"too yoga'ish for me, can't stand the instructor","review":"i've done many videos with many instructors, and Shiva has to be one of the worst, very impersonal. This entire workout is too much, it may relax some, but it would make me want to nap instead of working out since i got so bored with her, i suggest something else, like MBC Yoga by Leisa Hart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really solid workout","review":"I really enjoy this video. I find it to be as challenging (in terms of toning) and relaxing as you make it. The more I do it- the more I am able to deepen my streching and my breathing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best for the unitiated","review":"I had a fairly regular bikram and ashtanga yoga practice before I got pregnant--so I was reasonably fit and flexible to start with. I got scared away from exercising for several weeks, and I lost several pounds during my first trimester, so when I got back in I was a little worried over how much muscle atrophy I had suffered. That being said, this DVD was still way too easy for me. I could only recommend this to someone who has never or rarely exercised and needs something very gentle to get into the exercise habit. If you are an experienced yogi or other athlete, you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Relaxing","review":"I wouldn't really consider this exercising, but it is very relaxing and offers a great stretch to stiff muscles. I love how the poses are broken into the three trimesters! It's also great that you don't have to do all the sessions at once - you can just hit \\"next\\" to do a few if you're short on time. Afterwards, I always feel really refreshed! I would definitely recommend it as an accompaniment to walking or another form of (pregnancy-approved) cardio, but on its own you won't get much aerobic benefit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend","review":"I attribute my continued flexibility, good circulation and general physical comfort in part to doing this program a few times a week. I'm at 39 weeks and still do it.The program is broken up in such a way that you can do just one of the 20 minute segments or all three for a more complete workout. My apartment is small, and I can still do each posture. My only slight criticism is the length of the whole work-out, as I work full time and am quite tired when I get home. I would like to have a \\"full\\" workout in 20 minutes, but I'm not sure that's possible. Regardless, this is a great program and the instructor is not too alienatingly \\"new-age.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This DVD has 3 different women who all represent the different trimesters, so it's very easy to follow. One thing I didn't like is that you need certain equipment to do the workout, a yoga block, a chair, etc...not a big deal, but I was just ready to pop it in and go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended by a yoga instructor","review":"I'm a yoga instructor and I teach vinyasa -- yes, the vigorous flowing type. While this video will NOT give you an aerobic workout, it is not designed to. It is extremely appropriate for pregnancy, for 2nd and 3rd trimesters in particular. It is safe and wonderful for helping those aches and pains. In my 8th month, i'm finding it is about all I can do and I appreciate the modifications. Yep, Shiva can be annoying, but you do forget about it -- I highly recommend this DVD for all preggos!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful throughout my pregnancy","review":"I bought this video at about 18 weeks when I was having a lot of shoulder tension. Still using it at 38 weeks, and it still helps me relax and improves my ability to sleep at night or get energized for work in the morning. Unlike some other reviewers, I've found this DVD loads more quickly, and is easier to skip to the segment I want, than some others. The narration was detailed enough that I could learn the routines quickly, but still allowed the motions to flow relatively continuously (no waiting). Shiva Rea's voice didn't get on my nerves, even after several months (although I did occasionally discover the cloying music stuck in my head hours after using the video). I never did get the hang of the Floor Work segment but I found the first two segments very effective in relieving my aches, pains and stress. Any video can get annoying if overused, and I recommend buying \\"Yoga for your Pregnancy\\" in addition to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"First shot at Yoga","review":"This was my first time with doing Yoga and I was very happy with it. I started having trouble catching my breathe at about 20 weeks of pregnancy and this has helped. I would also say it has helped me sleep through the night since the stretching and resistance has strengthened my back and has eliminated leg cramps. Like I said, I have no prior yoga experience so maybe someone who is into it would have a different opinion but I think it has been great. I also appreciate that the poses are modified depending on what trimester you are in. I would definitely recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN. Slow moving and easy.","review":"I like yoga as a way to stretch and feel invigorated. I don't like yoga that's sappy (\\"imagine your baby is enjoying this practice as much as you are\\") or too slow. I really didn't like this dvd.It's just... easy. I'm sure this is fine for ladies coming to yoga for their first time, but as someone who's pretty active, this practice just didn't challenge me at all. I also found the inward-looking sappy new age stuff got old fast. The one strong point, though, was that it does demonstrate three separate ways to do the poses, so less flexible people could look at the 3rd trimester version for help. But I'm in my 3rd tri and had no trouble doing almost all of it with the 1st trimester version. It's just that easy.A great alternative that I later purchased and LOVE is theComplete Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga & Short Forms 2 DVD Set. It's the exact opposite- fast moving, keeps your attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed the DVD but looking for more prenatal workouts","review":"I enjoy this DVD but while this workout provides great stretching I don't feel it's doing enough to strengthen me. So, I'm going to look into other prenatal workouts."},{"rating":"1","title":"no thanks","review":"i did not like this dvd. it moved far too quickly through the posses for me to get anything out of them and required too much work for the modified posses. i was having to constantly move the chair. i also didnt know when purchasing the dvd that i needed props for it. i do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, easy \\"workout\\"","review":"They really have geared this video toward those in the third trimester. It is not challenging at all for women in earlier stages of pregnancy. If you are looking for a workout this is not the video for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good set up","review":"I am a beginner from the yoga point of view, I have attended some sessions on my own and generally i think the exercises are OK.My review is not positive as i think the meditation is not good/long enough, besides there is no clear split between it and the next session.Overall the DVD is not organized, it is like homemade! You cannnot select what you want from a main screen you need to press forward and CHASE the moment....The pity thing is a read comments like that and I still bought it, dont understimate the importance of it more if you are not exactly a patient person and you are looking for relax, this doesnt help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan","review":"This DVD was a letdown. She starts out with a speech which I had to fast-forward through. I'm just not interested in hearing this person's take on yoga/pregnancy - I bought it to workout. The yoga seemed so lame. The woman in her third trimester was actually sitting on a chair for some it barely moving. To the point that I had to wonder why she was even bothering. I would spend the money on another yoga DVD. This one left me feeling like I wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps ok if you've never done yoga","review":"This DVD seems to be designed for those new to yoga. If you are experienced with yoga and/or are looking for any sort of a workout, I'd find something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Too Easy","review":"I personally thought this dvd was very dull and boring. I understand I am only in my first trimester and may not be as restricted as others, but I felt like I was barely doing anything. This didn't seem like a \\"workout\\" to me at all- just 50 minutes of slow stretching. I wasn't challenged at all either. If you are looking for something that will keep you in shape I would look elsewhere. If you are looking for some VERY easy stretching then this might be the video for you. I do love yoga, but this one is just not for me- way too easy and boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relaxing Prenatal Yoga","review":"This is a nice, relaxing prenatal yoga routine. It doesn't feel too straining while still leaving you feeling like you've gotten a good workout. I find it a little bit harder to follow than my other prenatal exercise routines because it's not filmed in a 'mirrored' style (when you move your left leg she moves her right so it's like you're looking in a mirror) and that throws me off some. But that's not a big deal. Over all I'm really happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is too high of a rating for this junk!","review":"I am puzzled by all the good reviews on this DVD; I would have given it zero stars if the option was available. It was really slow and boring, basically a very gentle stretching routine. I did not like the instructor either. She is just very bland, lacks personality and OMG the voice - I guess she was going for the calm and soothing tone, but to me it sounded just fake and borderline creepy. I highly recommend Cathy Louise Broda's Pregnancy Yoga: A Practice for Each Trimester instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Video","review":"This video was great during my whole pregnancy. I used the video postpartum when I wanted to get moving again but couldn't over do it. I do have experience with yoga but I am not at expert by any means. The video has a person doing a version of the workout for each trimester but I used which ever version felt right at the time. The video is mostly stretching with just the right amount of strength building. The video has 3 main sections. When I didn't have time I would use the first two sections alone. During my last trimester I couldn't live without the daily stretching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy ZenMama instead","review":"I really disliked this video and it was a waste of my money. I tried it a few times but it did not flow well and often times felt uncomfortable. I am a regular exerciser, so it's not that I am out of shape, it is the poses and they routine. I also did not enjoy Shiva Rhea. She was pretty bland. On the other hand, I bought ZenMama and use it all the time. I would buy that instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"GAIAM DVD'S LACK LUSTER FOR MOMMIES","review":"These Gaiam DVD are all the same: boring and uninspiring. Try the Crunch Mama which has better content and pacing. I'm 21 weeks and bought all the Pre-natal tapes and DVDs I could find including Gurmuhks, Kathy Smith's and Gaiams. By far Crunch is the best produced and straight forward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pregnancy Workout","review":"I was worried about doing my standard yoga workout and talked to my ob-gyn. She recommended I pick one up specifically for pregnancy, and I'm familiar with the GAIAM name, so I looked for one done by them. It's great! I feel stretched out without feeling trembly, my energy is increasing, and I'm comfortable knowing that the poses I'm doing are no danger to either myself or my child. I look forward to returning to my standard workout, but during my pregnancy - this is the one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great prenatal workout","review":"Although the yoga on this tape is more suited for beginners, I found myself using this tape over and over again- especially as my pregnancy progressed. I did not do the modifications for the second and third trimester even late in pregnancy- just too easy. The stretching helped eliminate back pain, and I felt refreshed and re-energized after finishing. As far as workouts to stay in shape, there are others more suited to that, but just for feeling good when pregnant- this tape did it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Second time around","review":"This is my favorite pregnancy workout video. It is well cued. It gives the modified versions depending on trimesters and it really gets the kinks out. I used this with my first pregnancy in the VHS version. Somehow the tape got tangled, but this was a must-have \\"repeat\\" purchase for my second pregnancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pregnancy Yoga DVD","review":"The DVD is good and the exercises are appropriate - My only critisism is that they take too long - but if you only do one section you don't feel stretched enough. Very good for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good basic yoga workout","review":"This DVD is a good yoga workout. It features three women at each of the three trimesters so it's easy to do modifications based on your current ability. Shiva Rea repeats side stretches a little too often (she does them three or four times in different variations) and doesn't do any balance poses. I get a little more challenge and variety out of my yoga class but that's to be expected. The workout is an hour, broken into three parts (warmup, standing poses, and floor work) and is a nice way to get a workout in at home. Recommended props are a yoga blanket, block, and strap, as well as a chair but it's easy to make do with stuff found around the home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Mother Earth, movements are too fast","review":"My husband got me this DVD for Christmas t and I tried it for the first time the other day at 17.5 weeks. Firstly, the woman is highly annoying. The first part is some hippie, pregnancy is wonderful and magical and blah blah blah. So I just fast forwarded through that part. After getting into it a bit, all the moves are okay but she goes through them like she's trying to get it done with so she can go off to the rest of her evening. This video should easily be 2 hours long, but it feels soooooo rushed. And lastly she for some reason says \\"exale\\" instead of \\"exhale\\" which gets fairly distracting.I may use this after 36 weeks but I can't see using it again before then. I'll be looking for a new yoga DVD for the time being."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something else.","review":"This yoga session was boring and awkward. The leader is not even pregnant and they wear these horrible unitards. I know that has little to do with the actual workout but I found it distracting. Each woman did a different move to show modifications for different trimesters of pregnancy, which is helpful in theory, but I found that it was harder to follow along. I did it once and won't do it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gift for a Friend","review":"Happy when I got the Prenatal Yoga. It was a Gift for a friend. When I talk to my friend she side it help her and she love it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really liked it","review":"I really enjoyed this video, I usually have a really hard time with Yoga videos, the host usually seems really airy, and I usually start laughing at them. In this video she is soft spoken but I could take her seriously. It was really enjoyable to do the video, I didn't feel like I was straining to keep up with her. I particularly liked the different levels you could follow, and options she gives for any one move. Perfect from beginning to even after your pregnancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice at home yoga...","review":"I live in an area without at lot of prenatal yoga classes and wanted something I could do at home. I would recommend this gentle yoga for any pregnant woman who needs that extra stretch (isn't that all of us??) and those who are having back pain during pregnancy.The only reason that I didn't rate it a five is that it's a little slow for those of us who already know the basic yoga postures. I'm no yogi, but I've been doing yoga on and off for years and although it wasn't strength workout, it was a nice mellow practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"unnerving setting, not relaxing at all","review":"i thought this might be a good relaxation type workout as advertised, but the instructor was so unnerving to me that i could not settle down and get into it....the whole experience was bad for me, as i tried to do this tape 4 times, and each time i felt like i was lost, the moves were like those in my yoga classes, but the teacher bugged me and i felt stressed watching her do stuff without seeing her mouth moved, i can't stand this video"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good exercise video","review":"This video shows exercises which are performed at a comfortable pace.

It did not include the massage section that was mentioned. & the video came scratched"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really for beginners...","review":"Someone loaned this dvd to me about half way through my first pregnancy and the first time I tried it, I injured myself. I thought I was being careful and modifying things when I needed to, but alas. I had bursitis in my hip for about the next 6-8 weeks and was in a lot of pain and saw a chiropractor weekly. It finally went away, but this really turned me off to prenatal yoga. I'm about 5 weeks into my second pregnancy and am in a little better shape this time around. Going to try out the 10 Minute Solution Prenatal Pilates... we'll see how it goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Hard and Annoying","review":"I've been doing Yoga and Pilates for years (well before I was pregnant) but I found this workout kept changing from sitting to standing to laying to using a chair and that wore me out before the workout really got going. I've used other work outs where you spend time on the floor doing the appropiate exercises, then a chair or blocks, then standing, etc. But not consently switching back and forth. I also have a Pilates video by someone else and it is much more taylored to pregnant woman. I thought that this one expected too much and easily wore me out. I thought the way the instructor talked was very annoying. It did not make me relax but irratated me."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible audio, instructor is HORRIBLE","review":"this is a terrible prenatal video, period. i cannot stand the voice of the instructor, she sounded sooo fake. and the audio, why did she have to do a voice over, it made moves feel uncomfortable and out of sync. i thought this would be better, considering some of the good reviews, but i thought it was horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"would rather do this video, other yoga tapes are better","review":"this is a very poor prenatal video, i did not like the discipline of shiva rhea and did not like her on camera teaching style, the workout left me wanting something else, and i would much rather do a prenatal video like leisa hart's fitmama any day of the week compared to this, don't bother!"},{"rating":"1","title":"FitMama is so much better for you, overall this is not good","review":"I would highly suggest you try Leisa Hart's FITMAMA video, it is so much better than this, you would be much better off working out with a certified fitness expert like Leisa who knows how to train people before, during and after pregnancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible production, bad voiceover, not for new yoggies","review":"this could be the most overrated video I have ever tried. THe instructor attempts to give a voice over to her routine(WHY? could she not talk and do the workout at the same time? that is such BAD!). The music and the voiceover was pathetic! THe only way anyone could enjoythis is if they have a supreme knowledge of yoga, and that still would not be enough. I thought this was the most overrated, most pathetic video for prenatal women. It was not effective for me, and the other 6 women I work out with. They all hated it as well...don't bother with this, try something more mainstream, your new baby will appreciate it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying","review":"typical southern california yoga space lady teaching this video, i would rather she talk to camera instead of doing a weird voice over; anyone in the tv/production knows that this is done only by unconfident tv pitchpersons, and shiva is a bit strange.

The first two are a bit intense:Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga ~ Jennifer WolfeandThe Perfect Pregnancy Workout.

I found it to be very comfortable, while effectively stretching and working my body. She uses very few props (though you should have a bolster if you are doing any prenatal yoga past the first trimester.) When she does recommend props, like a blanket or a block, they are constructive uses. I feel like I could do this every day.I will still use the other two videos, but they will be reserved for the days I feel particularly strong and ambitious. (They are each full length sessions with out the program divisions that Shiva's routine offers.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Prenatal Video","review":"I love this DVD! This is my second pregnancy and I was introduced to prenatal yoga with my first... I have never taken a prenatal yoga class but this is just as good- being able to do this at home is awesome! I would recommend this to all of my friends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginners and first time mother's to be.","review":"I love Gaiam products. I have never done Yoga before and this DVD was excellent. I highly recommend it to mother's to be. It has a great pace and is tailored to all moms no matter what trimester you are in."},{"rating":"2","title":"great prenatal yoga video","review":"yoga really helps aleviate back pain and helps with stiff jointsI thought this video was a great product for every stage of pregnancy. I did this workout throughout my pregnancy"},{"rating":"1","title":"not good for this pregnant woman","review":"I did yoga during my last pregnancy, it really helped with stretching and \\"making room\\" for the baby so that I had a fantastic pregnancy and birth. This DVD makes me dizzy, cramped and bored. It definitely does not allow for stretching properly. No muscle building, or anything. Breathing was okay, and so was relaxation at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you feel great during pregnancy!","review":"I began using Shiva Rea's Prenatal Yoga DVD in the beginning of my second trimester and have used it regularly throughout my pregnancy. I love how great Yoga makes me feel while pregnant! This DVD helps me to feel centered and energized even now into my 7th month. I really like how there is a model for each trimester and the exercises are modified to fit the needs of each trimester. This makes me feel confident that the movements I am doing are safe for me and my baby as my pregnancy progresses. The only reason I could not give this product 5 stars is because the voice-over does not always match exactly with the exercises the women are doing, so you have to pay attention to their movements rather than listening to the instructor."},{"rating":"2","title":"You should get it IF ...","review":"... you like yoga ... I apparently am not into it. At least not when I'm preggo. But for those who like yoga I say GET IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"If you have taken yoga in the past, or have a decent level of fitness, this dvd is pretty basic. I am only in the second trimester ans ended up doing the regular poses from my classes (regular practice) so I could actually feel like I was working a bit. Pretty disappointed as this item was highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"love shiva hate this dvd","review":"Love her other videos but this was lame and only 15 minutes long. Meant to return it and have it in an box in my car. Waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Awesome!","review":"I was a little skeptical buying this video at first because of the negative comments...even though there were so many more positive comments...and once I did the video I came to the realization that some people are just going to be complainers regardless. This video was AWESOME. I've been doing yoga for about a year and thought it was just fantastic. She's NOT annoying, it's how people SHOULD talk in a yoga video. She gives ample time to get in the poses and ample time for being in the poses so I guess some people are just slow getting in and out of them and then want to b1tch. So, for anyone that is reading the negative comments, do notice the positive ratings far outrank the negative ones and there's a reason why the rating is so high. People just have to complain... Get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD, exercises a bit easy","review":"I wanted to take pre-natal yoga classes, but those were too expensive, so I end up buying this DVD. I think of it more as a good relaxation/stretching dvd than exercise one. May be I will enjoy it more at later stage of the pregnancy, but for now it is not challenging at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend - very disappointed","review":"I have been doing yoga for years and I was excited about trying this DVD to do yoga at home before I went back to the studio where I regularly practice yoga (and to supplement my practice). I was very disappointed, however. 2 main reasons: 1) Not enough time is spent/focused on breathing (one of the main tenets of yoga); I definitely thought she moved through the poses too fast and 2) In a related vein, the DVD was narrated in \\"voice-over\\" format so the instructions were not coordinated well with the poses. If you engage in other types of more intensive physical activity and want a less intense \\"workout\\" during pregnancy, this DVD may be for you. If you are someone who regularly (and mostly) practices yoga as your main form of physical activity, however, you may be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relaxing, but not much of a workout","review":"I purchased this video and began using it in my second trimester. I have been practicing yoga for a few years and consider myself to be 'intermediate' in skill, knowledge, etc. I like that this video has an actual person in each trimester working out along with Shiva so you know who to follow for modifications. It is a nice, relaxing practice; however not challenging at all if you are already familiar with yoga. That being said, it is very relaxing and provides a nice full body stretch. It is divided into sections, with the entire video lasting just under an hour. I would recommend this video for someone just getting into yoga or just to keep your body somewhat flexible during pregnancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I'd Had More Time to Use This DVD","review":"I had this DVD recommended from a friend. I was in the middle of my third trimester and was very uncomfortable, so I thought I'd give Prenatal Yoga a try. Once I got the DVD I was only able to use it a couple of times before I ended up having the baby. It was very relaxing and really helped my sore body the few times I was able to use it. I will definitely be using it earlier on the next time I am pregnant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Light Yoga","review":"Each persons experience will be different based on your experience with yoga and your personal flexibility but I have enjoyed this DVD. At the beginning of my 2nd trimester I was feeling very tight and stiff....doing this DVD will help loosen your aches and pains and overall make you feel better. If you are looking for an intense yogic workout then you might want something else. This DVD is a \\"light\\" yoga workout...mainly based on stretching."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as expected","review":"This DVD disappointed me for several reasons. I am an experienced yogini in good shape and a big fan of Shiva's Yoga Sanctuary CD. She is a great teacher in many ways. However, these poses were too easy, focused on gentle stretching, not heart rate raising at all. Without heart rate raising, it's hard to warm up. The stretches moved too quickly from one to the next, so just when I get into the stretch, it moves on. Also, I find in my third trimester, I still do the adaptations for 1st or 2nd trimester because I am not new to yoga, am open, and strong. Basically, this DVD brings peace to the mind, a little stretching, no exercise, good chest/side opening, and a feeling that after it's done I need to go back and stretch my hips and legs more deeply. I wish there were more prenatal yoga classes and videos geared toward people who already have established yoga practices, rather than beginners, which is what this video seems to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't understand the popularity","review":"I brought this DVD based on the MANY recommendations and was very disappointed. It is slow, boring and unchallenging. The instructor is sooooo annoying and talks in an over-the-top soft \\"earth mother\\" voice.Instead try the Sarah Hollidays prenatal series, Perfect Pregnancy Workout Vol 2. Yoga or Christine Andersons prenatal yoga DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST Have","review":"This video was probably one of the best purchases I made when I was pregnant (besides a body pillow). It was soo relaxing and made me feel so good when I did it. It helped improve my flexibility and the baby seemed to become more active when I did it.I started during my first trimester and used it up until my third. It is easy to follow and very beneficial mentally and physically. It was my stress reliever!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Prenatal yoga","review":"I borrowed \\"Yoga Zone\\" from a friend before buying this video. I like this video better because it shows all the poses in three stages of pregnancy, and how they can be adapted. However, I thought they moved through the moves very quickly, you really have to be ready with all of your props (chair, pillows, etc) to keep up. They spend a lot of time on Kegels, which is good for pregnancy, but I don't need a video for that (there's nothing to show in a demonstration!). Although the people in Yoga Zone are a little goofy, I think \\"Yoga Zone\\" does a better job of explaining the proper way the body should be aligned in the poses. So I do both tapes for variety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh. Did nothing for me. Waste of money.","review":"Let me preface this by saying that I HAVE seen the inside of a gym before getting pregnant. Maybe that's why I was so disappointed in this video. I've taken a couple of yoga classes (but am still very much a beginner), and this video neither got my blood flowing nor really stretched me even close to the level of an actual class.The video has three models for you to follow: Shiva, who is in her first trimester and doesn't look pregnant at all; a woman in her second trimester who uses bricks to do the positions (I don't have bricks, but even going all the way down to the floor during my 2nd trimester didn't really do anything for me); and a woman in her third trimester who basically stands around and raises her arms occasionally.If you know a few basic yoga poses, save yourself the cash. That's really all there is in this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the yoga expert who happens to be pregnant","review":"I picked up this DVD for my partner who is carrying our child. She had not done yoga before, and told me she really couldn't follow it. I (who have done some yoga, not an expert by any means) couldn't follow it either. The poses are just called out by name, which was useless to my partner. The constant voice over, made breathing correctly with the postures very difficult, and the voice over doesn't match up with the action.On a trivial note, we kept just cracking up. The 3 women's have odd names, and the voice over is like a mock yoga instructors voice (\\"You are getting very sleepy\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very relaxing, good for lower back pain","review":"Shiva has a relaxed style that makes this video very enjoyable. I have been having lower back pain with my pregnancy and the poses here really work well to alleviate this pain. The greatest thing is the modifications shown so you can do the practice all through your pregnancy. I find myself refreshed after doing this video, especially if I happen to fall asleep at the relaxation part at the end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout","review":"This is a good workout! For someone who has zero experience with yoga or any prenatal specific exercise, I was able to follow along and get a good workout! More than I thought I would from yoga. I also LOVE the relaxation piece at the end. What a great way to end a workout!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I really like this video! Just make sure you have a yoga block, strap, a blanket, and a chair near by! I had no idea so I had to improvise (since I'm well into the second trimester) until I was able to buy the items I needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps with every ache!","review":"I love this yoga DVD. I not that good at yoga, so I was not expecting to be able to do this DVD that well. The modifications for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimester are PERFECT! This DVD has helped me to strengthen my back and keep my legs from looking prego too. I feel so much healthier for doing this DVD. I highly recommend this one. (Just ignore the some of the lame spa-like background music.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"low-impact","review":"this yoga routine is entirely too short and entirely too easy. i didn't feel like i got anything out of it at all. it wasn't even very relaxing. i realize a strenuous workout isn't the point of yoga, but it was barely more movement than lying on a couch..."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING - BORING - BORING","review":"I bought two prenatal yoga videos and tried this one first. I followed the program all the way through and and fount it to be so completely boring and non-challenging. If you exercise moderately, or are at all familiar with yoga practice, I think this video completely missed the mark. It's too slow and not interesting enough to keep you engaged. I finally tried the other video (Sara Holliday) a few weeks later and now I'm back on track!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Experienced Yoga Mamas!","review":"I would definitely not recommend this workout to ANYONE who has previously practiced yoga. It is not challenging in the least bit. There is a whole lot of fluff in it. Shiva Rea taks too much in the beginning and you can't ffwd through it. I just want to exericse! I don't want to listen to her ramble on! She spends much too much time on kegels which if you are in your first pregnancy are irrelevant bc those muscles are already fit! If you have done yoga alot pre-pregnancy, stick with a regular yoga dvd until you are so big you cant move, and just do some modifications, such as not doing corpse pose during relaxation bc you should not be on your back after 4 mos. I have this dvd and now I don't know what to do w/ it. I am considering sending it to one of my pregnant girlfriends who is less fit and has never done yoga. Honestly, heed my advice, don't waste your money if you want to be remotely challenged."},{"rating":"1","title":"uninspiring, instructor bugged me","review":"read the reviews and gave it a chance, but the instructor grated on my nerves, and the fact she didn't talk to the camera made it very impersonal, i would never ever want to do a workout like this when not pregnant, let alone pregnant, i couldn't stand this uninspiring video"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahhhh!","review":"Even without much previous yoga experience, I found this tape easy to follow. There are three instructors - one for each trimester of pregnancy - so I felt comfortable during both my second and third trimesters.I was pleasantly surprised at the immediate relief of my back pain during my second trimester. The exercises are not extreme, and are well within the abilities of a pregnant woman (even this \\"old\\" 37-year-old first-time mom!). In my third trimester, I am most grateful for the gentle stretching of the poses - which eases the general aches caused by my ever-expanding uterus.I anticipate that I'll continue to use this video during my post-partum period, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent prenatal yoga video","review":"This is a great video for those experienced or inexperienced with yoga. The poses are modified for each trimester of your pregnancy so that nothing feels uncomfortable. It is very relaxing with equal attention to breathing, flexibility, and balance. I also purchased The Method Baby & Mom Prenatal Yoga and Shiva Rea eclipses that instructor. I choose this video every single time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Prenatal Yoga","review":"Boring! I'm pregnant...not ninety! I found this dvd to be slow and unmotivating. I never even finished watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poory organized and way too easy!","review":"I haven't been doing yoga for years. But I am in pretty good shape. This video is neither challenging (strength) nor satisfying (stretch). In fact, it's a bit boring. It's also poorly organized with no \\"flow\\" between movements. If you want a prenatal yoga video that is actually challenging but still completely safe, try Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga with Jennifer Wolfe. She offers three workouts, 15, 30 and 45 minutes long. All workouts are modified for the three trimesters. It's an enjoyable workout as apposed to this video which is complete drudgery..."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for relaxation, not for yoga","review":"This is a great DVD for relaxing stretches but I wouldn't quite call it yoga. Good for beginners but if you're more experienced and looking for a good yoga workout, Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga, Short Forms with Jennifer Wolfe is a good alternative. Both DVDs feature women in all 3 trimesters so you can see the modifications and both offer 15, 30 and 45 minute workouts. I'm glad that I own both but find myself doing Prenatal Vinyasa Yoga more often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prenatal Yoga with Shiva Rea","review":"I did not like this video! I go to a prenatal yoga class and this was nothing like the class, so I was disappointed. I feel like it's too gentle...and I'm not an avid athlete. They make you use a chair a lot, which is a pain, and not really necessary if you have yoga blocks. I asked my yoga instructor what she would recommend and she said Yoga for Pregnancy, Labor & Birth (2002) by Crawford, Colette. I just ordered this, but hopefully it will be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginners","review":"This program is fantastic for beginners in providing a well-structured workout with good explanations for each pose. Another plus is that useful modifications of poses for the 2nd and 3rd trimester are provided. For those who are more practiced in yoga, this workout is almost too simple. Additionally, the long running time (~55 min) is disadvantageous for those looking to add yoga to other exercise programs (i.e., running or walking). All in all though, this is a useful yoga program that can be utilized through all three trimesters to provide a safe, gentle workout for the expecting mother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prenatal Yoga with Shiva Rea","review":"I was immediatly annoyed when the instructor who is pregant on the cover of the exercise tape, is decidedly not pregnant in the workout routine. The routine was very boring, I kept waiting for the end of this slow moving, non challenging tape. I did it once and never again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"It is nice that they have women in 3 different stages of pregnancy showing modifications for the poses BUT... It is so incredibly BORING. I couldn't wait for it to be over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!","review":"This product was perfect for me in my pregnancy. I included Yoga as part of my regular workout before pregnancy and this helped me continue. The instructions are clear and I loved having a guide for each trimester. It helps with form and to make sure you are not pushing yourself too far. I would suggest this as a great gift for any expectant mother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but granola-y","review":"Good prenatal yoga with all trimester exercises shown. Too granola for me, but still good."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of s-t-r-e-t-c-h-i-n-g","review":"I'll keep this review simple since there are already so many reviews for this DVD: 1) Most poses consist of a lot of stretching, which were not satisfying. 2) The entire dvd is very long, almost an hour. After following this video once, I never want to do it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for insomnia","review":"I know yoga is supposed to be a relaxing exercise, but this just put me straight to sleep. I'm 5 1/2 months pregnant and Ive managed to get through the video twice, both times waking up 15 minutes or so after finishing the video. Also the narrator says \\"Exale\\" (instead of pronouncing the whole word \\"EXHALE\\". Didn't think it would be a big deal as other reviews mentioned this, but it is quite distracting. I would not recommend this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the $","review":"I am very happy with this yoga video. Shiva Rea is calm, soothing and extremely knowlegable. I like that there are three women representing each trimester showing modifications as needed. Shiva Rea also does an excellent job explaining poses and giving gentle reminders of appropriate extension, etc. This is a perfect video to end my day."},{"rating":"2","title":"A complete workout for strengthening your body","review":"One of the excellent yoga video I have come across!! It's a complete body workout in combination with any cardio exercise during pregnancy. The best part is -- like every exercise, one needs motivation to continue, this one surely gives lot motivation. You can immediately feel how good your body feels after each session."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good Yoga for this growing mom","review":"While Shiva could certainly explain in more detail how to hold some of the poses, even for me, a rather inexperienced yoga practitioner, this dvd does the trick and provides a lot of relief in this physically demanding time. I really appreciate her modifications for each trimester, and having used this dvd in my 1st and second tri, think the modifications are good. I also like that the video is broken up into floor poses, standing poses, etc., so i can squeeze in some yoga when i can, essential for the mom of a 3 year old. She goes a little slow at times for a time pressed mom, but thank god for the fast forward button! Highly recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"It's the best YOGA DVD I have used so far. The steps are easy to follow and instructions are clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"New to Yoga","review":"I enjoy this prenatal yoga routine. It is a bit long at 55 minutes, but at the end I feel relaxed. I question whether I am doing some of the poses correctly as I am a novice. It is helpful that the video showcases three woman in each trimester of pregnancy with appropriate modifications for certain exercises. Overall I would recommend the video even for a beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helped immensely with back aches and leg cramps!","review":"Well I can't praise enough Shiva Rea and her program. It is really great. Especially for MOMS-TO-BE who suffer from pelvic discomfort, lower and mid-back pains and a host of other pregnancy aches and discomforts.I STRONGLY recommend it. Don't expect miracles, because it's not a one-time thing. But if you follow it faithfully and regularly your stamina will improve, you will feel great and all of your discomforts will be GONE. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"um..","review":"My wife watched this once- and hasn't put it into the DVD player again.I'm not sure why, but she'll do yoga every other night, and stretch the others- but wasn't very impressed with this DVD.Possibly because she already had been doing yoga for a while, and was comfortable doing it on her own without the walkthrough- so this may be a nice DVD for beginners.I personally thought it was very neat how they showed three different examples of how to do the moves, each for a different stage of pregnancy-"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent, relaxing prenatal workout","review":"My main gripe with this video is the way narrator Shiva Rea pronounces the word \\"exhale.\\" But after hearing her say \\"ex-ayle\\" so many times, I might be somewhat immune to it now.That said, there are some great stretching exercises here, complete with modifications for each trimester (although I really don't think all modifications are necessary if you're in decent shape. Yoga, to me, is just a great way to feel good in your growing body and connect with your baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok yoga DVD","review":"I practiced yoga before becoming pregnant, and was hoping to continue my yoga practice, getting the benefits of relaxation and strengthening. This DVD does provide both relaxation and strengthening. However, I found it to be best for beginners. The instructor moves very slowly which can be frustrating at times. The DVD is also very long, so those of you who are still working may find it difficult to squeeze this workout in. It is possible to stop at any point, but then it feels like you are missing something from your workout. This DVD is helpful with relaxation, but I have not felt the benefits of gaining strength and toning as I have in some other DVD's (which is also an important part of having a healthy and easy pregnancy!). I would recommend this video for a beginner who has lots of time on their hands!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heard about it","review":"I purchased this dvd for my friend who is pregnant. She reported to me that it is easy to follow and a \\"good, all-round\\" prenatal dvd. There are not many prenatal yoga classes in our area and the only one had an incompitable time. So for the second, going into third trimester, this dvd has proven to be not only useful, but also enjoyable for my friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD for the Preggo","review":"This is a great video for anyone expecting. She has herself represented as the 1st trimester, then 2 others in their 2nd and 3rd for viewers to follow. I will say that it is helpful if you have a general idea of a flowing practice, because that is the style she teaches. That way you don't have to keep looking at the screen but she does explain transitions very clearly. She doesn't hold poses for too long but that is what the pause button or back button is for, or just hold a pose longer before catching up with her. I also like that it is almost an hour and there are three different segments, so if you don't have time for the whole thing you can have a good stopping point. I tried the Crunch Yoga Mama dvd and I thought this was much better specifically for pregnancy. The yoga mama dvd was more of a basic yoga session in my opinion, and only 30 mins long."},{"rating":"2","title":"relaxing workout","review":"I enjoyed this \\"workout\\", I've been feeling pretty lazy and tired since becoming pregnant, and doing this isn't strenuous and makes me feel less lazy. It's great to stretch all my tired bones and joints and to prepare my thighs and other muscles for labor and delivery. I definitely recommend this to other pregnant women if you aren't used to working out much! If you normally workout, you may need something different..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, simple workout","review":"I was very disappointed in this workout. I am in my second trimester and felt that modifications were a bit ridiculous. I went through the workout once, but really felt that it was a waste of time. I wanted to do yoga and not slow, boring stretches. I found a better prenatal yoga series for free on youtube. I think I might enjoy this at the very end of my pregnancy, hopefully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sort of blah","review":"I bought this one and Dr. Laurie Anderson (which is very good). I thought Shiva Rea was not that challenging. I have seen the same moves on other pregnancy DVDs. But it is a good one if you do not do a lot of yoga. Anderson's was just better and you can still do Anderson's even if you do not regularly practice yoga."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too easy","review":"I have gone to yoga classes off and on for the past few years and have always enjoyed it and considered it a good work out as well. Now that I am pregnant (15 weeks) I was excited to try the prenatal yoga. I was very disappointed when I tried this video. The instruction is slow and very easy. I also found the props required cumbersome and unnecessary. I will try it again when I get further along and see if it is more beneficial as one reviewer suggested. I would not recommend this video to anyone who is early in pregnancy, familiar with yoga and looking for a good workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea.","review":"I generally don't enjoy yoga but bought some dvd's for pregancy so I could retain my flexibility and build my stamina.I didn't make it all the way thru this yoga video. This dvd was just too boring for me to continue but I can't pinpoint what exactly about it I didn't like about it. One good thing is that the one workout does cover each trimester of pregnancy. There are modified yoga poses for the second and third trimester which is nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shiva is not my role rodel, too dull","review":"Dull, that's about all I can say about this workout. Shiva Rea was so flat and dull, the workout was even worse. Not sure how this made it to the stores, as she is pitiful. Time to try another pregnancy video, and this didn't do it for me at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"find another video","review":"this video lacks many things-consistency, meditation, and comfort. the poses are not held for a long enough period of time-unless you breathe at half the pace of most people. the final relaxation consists mostly of the music with the credits-nothing guided about that! shiva rea is so impersonal it is hard to believe she is a mother herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"why does this instructor not talk to camera","review":"the audio on this video drives me crazy, i tried this video three times and have now donated it to my library. I would recommend Leisa Hart's FitMama video, it's not Yoga, but it's so much better for you than this womans weird video."},{"rating":"1","title":"voiceover of instructors voice is so ANNOYING","review":"I find this video to be totally ANNOYING...how can an instroctor do a video and not be able to talk to camera?

This is not a good prenatal video."},{"rating":"1","title":"boringly slow pace, annoying instructor, not worth it","review":"Hard for me to add more to this than the title saying that this video is boringly slow pace, annoying instructor, not worth it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for stretching, not to get a workout.","review":"I've been to yoga classes where you get more of a workout than this one. This is more like a stretching exercise. My complaint is a lot of the stretches seemed to repeat many times. The equipment required for use to follow the exercise like the block, straps are kinda specialised items you'd have to buy. I tried to substitue with items I can find at home like a step stool, and rope.For a real workout, I prefer the Perfect Pregnancy workout dvd with Karyne Steben."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prenatal Yoga","review":"Great video, my wife is now in her second trimester, and the way they have it done they show you the examples for the first, second, and third trimester all at the same time. my wife definately reccommends this DVD for future mom's. I did the work outs with her and they were fun and enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"too slow and boring","review":"I have practiced yoga for several years, yet don't consider myself an expert. I do workout 4-5 times a week. I found this DVD to be very (painfully) slow, and barely effective as a workout or for the yoga/stretching. I am disappointed in the 3 levels of this DVD as all three are very simple. Shiva does most poses only once and only holds them for a few seconds. I would rather the poses be repeated, held longer and have less over all pauses during the DVD when you are basically doing nothing. I am going to try the Perfect Pregnancy workout next and hope for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prenatal Yoga With Shiva Rea","review":"Found video to be good for beginners, like myself, but also could be used by experienced people as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor production, annoying instruction","review":"i have used many fitness tapes throughout my three pregnancies and this one ranks as one of the worst...t though the living arts films were ok in the past, but this is dreadful...the instructor doesn't talk, she does a voiceover, the moves are designed for advanced yoggies, not someone with mild knowledge of the trait...i highly suggest something else other than this to help stretch and tone during pregnancy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't really care for this","review":"I didn't care for this tape at all. The host wasn't very good and I didn't care for all of the \\"new age\\" stuff that was part of the tape. It didn't really keep my interest at all. I bought the Yoga Mama tape and I liked it a lot more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes me feel great!","review":"I've always liked Shiva Rea's DVD's, so when I was pregnant I knew I would like this. I tried some regular yoga DVD's (at 6 months pregnant) and found that I couldn't do hardly anything, except maybe stand and flap my arms! This was so relaxing and I could feel my body liven and fill with oxygen. I believe it when she says that baby likes the rocking motion for some of the asanas. I have had some coughing and breathing problems lately and I think this has helped to open my lungs too. It's not a fat burning workout, it's more for well being and tranquility. I highly recommend this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great video","review":"I really wish that I purchased this at the beginning of my 1st trimester. This is a great video. It makes me feel great. I will definitely seek out non prenatal videos from this instructor for post pregnancy. The only negatives are she includes a lot of objects...you'll need a standard chair, brick, blanket, and elastic work out band (not sure what its really called) The only one of those I had was a blanket(I live in a small NYC apt). The video is relatively short as well. But the exercises leave me feeling invigorating and I love that you can choose a person to watch based on what trimester you are in. Her instructions are very easy to follow.Edit: I just want to add that its really obvious that my baby was invigorated by the stretches as well. He got really active from the increased oxygen flow and stretches."},{"rating":"2","title":"great yoga video","review":"I purchased this video in my third trimester of pregnancy and really enjoy it. The entire workout lasts about 50 minutes and offers many strengthening and relaxation techniques. I like that I can follow one of three women, each in a different trimester of pregnancy and each modifying the program in different ways to suit their (and my) abilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not yoga just stretching","review":"This isn't really yoga as I've experienced it. When I leave my prenatal yoga class I am sweating and I get a good workout. There wasn't any sun salutations or \\"flow\\". It was just 70 minutes of gentle stretching. If you are looking for a work out this isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like this workout","review":"I have bought and enjoyed several yoga dvds in the past. When I got pregnant I wanted to buy a good prenatal yoga dvd. I've been pretty disappointed in the workout that this dvd provides. Mostly I don't like anything relating to the chair workouts (which there are many). Also there is no way to directly jump right into the workout when you start playing the dvd (lack of menu options). I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this dvd. I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great video","review":"I was reviewing several pregnancy yoga videos before deciding on this one. It starts out with a deep breathing exercise, keeping the focus on providing oxygen for your baby. It sections poses off by standing, seated, and laying positions, and you'll need a chair, pillow or blanket, and a strap for some poses. The stretches are gentle, there are modifications for each trimester of pregnancy, and at the end you're left feeling more open and relaxed. The instructor is a mother who organized this exercise based on what she needed during her pregnancy. Overall, it's a great find and well worth the investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for stretching","review":"I use this prenatal DVD when I want a good stretch. To me, it doesn't feel like a yoga session, but more a series of gentle stretches. I am currently 37weeks and do not follow the 3rd trimester model as I wouldn't find it challenging enough (a lot of chair sitting).. But overall the DVD is well adapted for the different levels of prenatal exercise, and you still get the joy of movement, relaxation and stretching, so I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relaxing!","review":"I really enjoy this yoga workout. Shiva Rea is very calming and walks you through the DVD step by step. It is not very challenging at all, but I still feel and see the benefits of the workout. I would highly recommend it if you are looking for a relaxing, but still effective workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"New to Yoga","review":"I have done a little yoga in the past during other types of workout videos & also prenatal videos and was looking for something to keep the tone and relieve stress of joints, spine, etc. This video is easy to follow as Shiva Rea narrates all details of the poses including breathing and also discusses the modifications for each trimester of pregnancy. This video provides a challenge even in pregnancy, which I like, and makes me feel great afterwards. It is also aesthetically pleasing as they are in a nice atmoshphere with candles and soft music. You need several items for the session, such as a blanket, chair, band for stretches, yoga ball, and block but you can improvise with nearby items although I would suggest purchasing a yoga ball for some of the stretches as a pillow just doesn't do the trick for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A relaxing session","review":"I am 5 months along in my pregnancy. I am reasonably fit and was looking not just for relaxation and stretching, but for some challenging postures as well.This video delivers the realxation and stretching, but did not offer a challenge. Although it shows women in various stages of pregnancy, I feel that it is better suited for someone further along with limited mobility.If you are looking for a challenge, I recommend purchasing one of Gaiam's regular yoga DVD's and modifying to suite your prenatal needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"So SLOOOOOWWWWWW","review":"I have a sporadic yoga practice, having held a very strong practice within the past few years, but falling in and out of it depending on the studio's schedule and price changes. I'm not able to spend $15 per class on my studio's classes, and thought the reviews for this were pretty good.In general the DVD is extremely slow moving. It's hard for me to even emphasize HOW SLOW this practice moves. It's broken up into three parts, which makes maintaining a flow very difficult. She explains every single move in detail, and speaks faster than she actually does the moves, so you're left WAITING for her to finish. Overall, I was not satisfied. It was nice to see the adjustments for those in each trimester, but she moves so slowly, that I don't even think it's necessary. For reference, I'm 4 months pregnant and started the dvd in my second trimester."},{"rating":"1","title":"wanted to fall asleep","review":"This was by far the most boring yoga workout I've ever done.

I have the Shiva Rea Vinyasa Flow DVD and I like it. But this DVD is a disappointment. If you are a fit pregnant woman who practiced yoga before your pregnancy, don't buy this DVD. It is probably good for a pregnant woman new to yoga - but is very elementary. Your time could be much better spent. For new yoga students, keep looking. Shiva Rea does not explain the poses very well. There must be a better DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The finest business text ever written!!!!!","review":"Dr. Kuratko's book is positively OUTSTANDING and a MUST read for anyone who is even CONSIDERING starting his or her own business.

The puzzles are fun and there is a pretty good variety of Lionel trains to choose from. Even the music is surprisingly well done. However, it's all wasted because the graphics are so poor and the detail non-existent when it counts. One camera angle only and most of the game is in 2-D, especially when the trains are running. After you make your choice of trains to run, the detail degrades so badly you realize it never mattered which train you chose anyway. Everything looks about the same and very unrealistic at that. Don't be fooled by the Lionel name. This game is a dud..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected...","review":"I bought Lionel Trains: On Track for my son.

He loves to play in the \\"sandbox mode\\" because nothing costs. I'm not sure that he knows exactly what he's doing, but he loves it. This game isn't very easy to play, but my son absolutely loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complex - But in a good way","review":"While the graphics aren't much to look at and the learning curve for how to play is a bit steep, I found this game to be a much deeper strategy/simulation than it first appears. The simulation not only includes researching higher tech trains, but also upgrading cities, choosing city specialties, and planning specific train routes with multiple steps of cargo chains (ie. trees into lumber into furniture). Multiple maps playable in a large-scale freeplay as well as a sandbox mode make the replayability very high. An excellent buy for any train enthusiast who enjoys the DS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are any of these for real?","review":"Hi. Is this a real movie?

This is a highly entertaining as well as educational chess book.It is important to note that the errors in analysis are NOWHERE near as numerous or egregious as other reviews would lead you to believe. I have studied the annotations in detail, many of them with my computer, and found only a small number of (for the most part inconsequential) oversights.

Furthermore, the pages are affixed with a very stiff glue, and the first few pages are already coming loose, after opening it just a few times. The paper is also lower grade, with higher pulp content--certain to curl in high humidity.I'm quite exercised that this volume's binding and paper do not match the quality of the rest of my set.

Sat down to watch this for the first time with my son figuring that it would be good ole' Frosty with a new storyline. Wrong. We got about 5 minutes into it and I realized that someone had hi-jacked a kids character and storyline and replaced it with greeny, pagan propaganda. First, one of the little boys says \\"Let's go outside and make a fertility goddess\\". I'm like.....what the.....what the ....what is this doing in a kids Christmas time animated classic? Then the fact that Frosty doesn't need his magic hat anymore. Then the obvious corporate knocking message about a snow eliminating spray. That was it. Turned it off and instead put in the original Rankin-Bass classic. This one is going to get hung in the window as a sun catcher, that is all it is good for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to have to say that I was disappointed!","review":"Frosty the Snowman was awesome but Frosty Returns is a shameful mess!

Frosty is completely sarcastic and obnoxious, nothing like the friendly folksy Frosty we all grew to love. Even sadder is that CBS keeps airing this back-to-back with the original Frosty. There are so many other great Christmas specials which aren't aired on the major networks (Little Drummer Boy, George C. Scott's A Christmas Carol) because of cable and VCRs. So it's all the more sad that this one receives yearly attention by a major network. Couldn't they at least air the true sequel - Frosty's Winter Wonderland? ABC used to run that one, so I don't know who owns the rights nowadays. But either way, that would make much sense for a second half hour of Frosty rather than this dreadful piece of unwatchable junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is pathetic!","review":"I loved the Frosty movies I used to watch when I was a child - Frosty the Snowman and Frosty's Winter Wonderland.

I cringed when I watched this with my son. I admit I grew up with the original show with Jimmy Durante narrating and the title song a well written classic, rather than a lame paean to 1990's PC themes. This is probably inevitable in that you unfortunately can't re-make something from that era with the same innocence and feel: not in an era where Christmas has become lifeless. Oops! I said Christmas, I meant Happy Holidays!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad!!!","review":"I'm this username's wife, and I don't think I've ever reviewed anything here. But this is so bad, I just had to. Jon Goodman, who's been a really popular voice over actor for kids' movies lately, is just AWFUL in this. In all fairness, he didn't have much to work with -- the writing is terrible. I think it tries to be hip and modern with trendy references to microwave pancakes and fertility goddesses, but it totally misses. And the music? I can't even find the words. Bad music with bad lyrics sung by actors who CANNOT SING (Goodman, stick to acting, please!) Unfortunately, my kids love this dvd and watch it back to back with the original Frosty all year long. I can't wait till they outgrow this phase because it just grates on me! I just don't get what they see in it.

Although Jonathan Winters does a respectable job as narrator, the story suffers from \\"politically correct\\" environmentalism and de-Christianization of Christmas. None of it was necessary and detracts the story.Furthermore, there is no artistic continuity with the original \\"Frosty\\". None of the characters are depicted in their original form and the computer-aided animation doesn't really add anything, either.I was disappointed that this episode was included with the Frosty DVD. The true and worthy sequel to the original Frosty is \\"Frosty's Winter Wonderland\\". Watch that instead as it is MUCH better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run for the erase button!","review":"This horrible mess should have never been made...terrible story, awful music, dreadful animation (I use the term lightly), nasty characters, devoid of any warmth or charm...just awful, awful, awful. This has nothing to do with Christmas or any other holiday for that matter. Stick to the charming \\"Frosty the Snowman\\" and it's sequel, \\"Frosty's Winter Wonderland\\" where Frosty gets a wife. Shame on Golden Books for including this with the original Frosty. Wish I could rate this a ZERO but I wasn't given that option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Christmas special ever!","review":"This is so lame! The songs are terrible! The villan is a ripoff of Mr. Burns from The Simpsons while the kids look like they're on loan from a Charlie Brown show. But the biggest lowpoint is the Politically Correct ranting!

My daughter liked it because it had a snowman in it, but that's the only reason. The movie is filled with overdone, unrealistic, trite political issues of the 90's. It was too complicated for a small child to follow and there was barely even a plot. Only get this if your child is in love with snowmen and you've exhausted all other viewing avenues. There was nothing original in this movie that wasn't absurd.

The adults in the movie are arguing idiots and it makes the children seem smarter. (just like every nickelodeon cartoon now...) They don't even say the word \\"Christmas\\" once.

The worlds of those other books were the product of an active imagination.\\"As She Climbed Across the Table\\" manages to annoy where his earlier works captivated. The characters aren't interesting or likable and the setting is a modern-day American University.

I was privileged to be there when she made her great return. After the mad scene, she received an extended standing ovation, right in the middle of the act. This was deja vu .. she received such an incredible reception many years earlier in her debut at the Met. Her performance in this CD captures this brilliant, bel canto artistry. In contratst to Maria Callas, who portrayed a dark, ominous side to Lucia, Sutherland's performanc is replete with coloratura trills and flutters. Rather than being dark and brooding in the mad scene, as was Callas, Sutherland is beautifully pitiful. I recommend this recording of one of the great Lucias of the 20th century and I recommend also getting one by Callas, another great, as an interesting contrast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sutherland is magnificent.","review":"This is a live 1975 recording from Chicago with some bonus tracks from a 1959 recording, which allows you to compare a younger Joan to her more mature performance.

You are basically pulling the collar... the leash only comes out four inches and by then your dog is dangling off the ground because that is how much resistance is needed to make the dang thing pull away from the collar.

The only way to check the date is to go into the setup menu and view it along with the time. I can't believe this phone was actually designed like this. Other issues, the picture quality is horrible. I wouldn't expect great pictures from a camera phone, but the pictures this thing takes are useless. Also, the volume control on the side of the phone stopped working after two months.

Hurt is such a masterpiece that Personal Jesus at first, pales in comparison.I just listened to Depeche Mode's version followed by Cash's (O.K. maybe 20 times back and forth..). Cash has shown true genius in adapting this song. If you don't like the original, I think you will like the cover. If you loved the original, prepare to be stunned....

A true legend, performing in legendary fashion...and we are lucky to have an elder statesmen of music that recognizes great music (regardless of original idiom) and that is willing to bring his truly unique take to it.

I am a fan of Nine Inch Nails and can say that Cash has captured the organic nature of the song and has sung it as if his own. It is sad and beautiful and a masterwork.Personal Jesus makes me laugh. I do not mean this in a bad way..I'm sure that it wasn't intended to be a humorous tune...it just comes across that way for me.

I bought this soundtrack for one specific song (and it would've been worth every penny if only it was included): the song near the end when Alexander marches through the desert to return home to Babylon after his recovery. Such a disappointment that wasn't included.In the other hand, I'm satisfied with some of the tracks that were included. I particularly liked \\"Roxane's Veil\\" even though I don't recall hearing it in the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Desafortunada","review":"Una de las cosas que me impactó al saber sobre el rodaje de Alexander fue que la música le fuera encomendada a Vangelis, la explicación era obvia: el vínculo del macedonio conquistador con Grecia, y la experiencia de Vangelis en música de películas que tratan sobre conquistadores. Sin embargo, al escuchar la banda sonora, sentí que le falta fuerza y que es un poco estática, destaco que no se escucha la dinámica de una banda sonora de una pelicula sobre un guerrero, es repetitiva y aunque tiene pasajes brillantes, mi opinión es que debio haber sido encomendada esta misión musical a alquien como Hanz Zimmer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moaning, Groaning, and Synthesizers","review":"This is just godawful! Sadly, the days when composers actually developed powerful themes has been replaced by synthesizers, echo chambers, drums, and constipated-sounding choruses of wailing females. There isn't an original note in this score. Even more disheartening, much of it is ripped right out of the Chariots of Fire Score. Listen to the second cut. They apparently just ran the bass line from the opening theme to Chariots and added a couple of different notes in the melody (but not many). I listened to half and then gave up. Hopefully the movie is better than this horrible score."},{"rating":"1","title":"The score is as bad as the movie","review":"This score, with its relentless choral doublings and lack of any counterpoint whatsoever, is added to mismatched spoken accents to make this one of the absolute worst films of all time.The music is uninspired, insipid, amateurish and deserving of its fate...to be heard very little in the future.Best avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Compared to Troy","review":"Teyo is SO much better as a soundtrack because...They have fighting (no way!!!) that lasts as long as the songs, it isnt two minutes of fighting(cool!!!)and then he looks at his boy friend for ten minutes(cool???) while music plays making it even wierder since man love is wrong and evil.

Too bad Oliver Stone could not impart to the movie the same soul Vangelis could to the score."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great soundtrack, mediocre film","review":"I love the swords & sandles epics: Gladiator, Troy, Kingdom of Heaven, 300. And I love Vangelis' music. So, I thought I'd give it a chance. While the film falls well short of expectations (more talking than fighting) the soundtrack blew me away. Right up there with Blade Runner and 1492, Vangelis' Alexander depicts the epic expanses pefectly (as usual) and develops some invigorating themes. Keeping the soundtrack from 5 stars was the lack of variation in the album, however, much of that was dictated by the film. Worth the buy to any Vangelis fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vangelis","review":"My god, this soundtrack sucks. Big time. I constantly thoughd Gerard Depardieu would pop up from behind the Phalanx. This score is no-more of a remix of 1492: Conquest of Paradise. As a special feature on the game Alexander you get a very disapointing interview with Vangelis. The bottomline is: \\"i did the previous movies well, so people will like watever crap I trow at them too\\".As a Alexander fan, I am ashamed. Unless you want a nicelooking frisbee, dont buy this.

I disagree with reviewer G.M.Stathis who said, \\"...no one has any accurate idea of what music in Alexander's tent may have sounded like...\\" Alex Kharlamov, the creator of the music album \\"Alexander the Great: Posa Somata, Posa Pneumata\\" seemed to have a very good idea, or educated speculation that is shown very well on his album (highly recommended, by the way, as a non-commercial alternative to Vangelis' CD)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb music","review":"It is a sad fact that the last 2 movies Vangelis has worked on have not received much popular and critical praise. And yet, his Alexander is nearly as great as his magnificent 1492: Conquest of Paradise. This unequalled composer continues to astound his fans and those who discover his music for the first time. Most of the tracks on that soundtrack are epic, dramatic, chilling and some are intimate, soothing and just beautiful. I have to mention The Drums of Gaugamela which literally gives you goose bumps with its sheer grandeur. That track should have been used in The Return of the King. Other highlights are Young Alexander, Titans, Roxane's Veil, The Charge, Preparation, Across the Mountains, Eternal Alexander and especially Tender Memories which is very reminiscent of Chariots of Fire. I have found everything I am looking for in a Vangelis album and it is comforting to know that this composer still has the magic and the genius he's always had."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Vangelis","review":"Vangelis was the perfect choice to compose this score.

Even if we haven't seen the film, we'll be able to imagine many moments in the Alexander's odissey just closing our eyes and leaving our mind being driven by Vangelis. Only a Greek could have written a music for the most famous Greek of all times :) Obviously, depending on your own expectations about the music for a film like this, you may like or dislike this soundtrack, but I think it clearly makes a not so good film more enjoyable, and contributes to create the epic and intimate atmosphere that Oliver Stone's film has tried (with different results) to transmit to spectators."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alexander review","review":"If you want to chill out and relax this CD can make you relax as it takes you back in time to 2400 B.C. when Alexander the Great lived.

It's about as bad as Scarecrow and Tinman's \\"My Son\\". In terms how the music was mixed, the bass and low-end tone of the song is non-present. As far as the lyrics and message? Here it is: \\"We are two flamboyant christian chicks trying to preach a message of inner beauty over outer beauty, yet we have outrageous hair-dos, leather pants, skin tight shirts, and 2 lbs of make-up. All the guys want us ['all the boys in the band want a valentine from a barlow girl']\\" So basically this sounds like sorority girl music, with a more christianized theme, from a garage band who sound like they recorded their cd on an 8-track in a 2-bit studio."},{"rating":"2","title":"You don't have to be Christian to enjoy this album!","review":"I heard the song \\"One Girl Revolution\\" in a movie and immediately got this album, not knowing that Superchic[k] was a Christian band.

I have downloaded a majority of the songs from the internet, and I love them!

But this is what great singing is all about. Sutherland is heard as she would sound as if you were there. Without a doubt the \\"Voice of the Century\\".Beatrice di Tenda has the highest notes of all Donizetti's operas. That's why even Dame Joan stop singing it after 1961. At one scene she holds a rocket of a high E natural for what seem like 12 seconds.This is one of the most underrated recording of a legendary performance I've ever heard. Listen to it once, and you'll be overwhelmed by its beauty and bravura. Bravissima, diva."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality recording","review":"The quality of this recording is just terrible. Muffled sound as if singing is done in a room next door.

After the first 200 pages the story begins to transpire into a modern day Shakespearean tragedy. One after another marriages ends in divorce.In regard to his personal life, family members are only mentioned if they are employees at his local \\"Hee Haw\\" show or at Clayton Mobile Homes. Each businessman or major employee that Mr. Clayton came into contact with over a forty year period in his professional career is painstakingly described in depth.After nearly 350 pages of in depth descriptions of \\"Joe the Mechanic\\" and \\"Dave the Banker\\" ther reader is given the opportunity to find out about the people that were truely behind the success of Jim Clayton, his family. Unfortunately, each of his children is provided with only a 3-4 line paragraph on the last two pages of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Escape","review":"I truly enjoyed Janice Graham's first novel, \\"Firebird\\" and eagerly awaited her second. \\"Sarah's Window\\" was well worth the wait. I started this last night and couldn't stop till the last page. It is the story of Sarah Bryden, an artist forced to give up on college and come home to the Flint Hills and care for her grandparents. She waitress's by day and paints in her room at night. A physicist, his wife and adopted son move to the area and Sarah is drawn to the family as a caretaker for the child. Sarah can get close to this child whereas the adopted parents have never been able to. John the husband is drawn to Sarah her beauty and talent. The story that unfolds is captivating in wanting to know how these people will come to find true love and their innerselves. \\"Sarah's Window\\" is the perfect love story to warm your heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointed kansan","review":"I've just read Janice Graham's \\"Sarah's Window,\\" which I find to be a disappointing portrait of the Flint Hills, where I happen to live. I'm familiar with many of the places mentioned in the book -- I've visited the house where Susan and John supposedly live and I've eaten at the Cassoday Cafe. Graham is inconsistent in her depiction of the people of the Flint Hills. When we first meet Billy, for example, he speaks like a cowpoke; within two pages, his vocabulary has shifted to that of an intellectual. You'll find both types in the Flint Hills, but you likely won't find such drastic shifts in the same person. I know a university professor who's an expert on Flint Hills cowboy folklore, but his vocabulary and demeanor are consistent, unless he's in character to tell a story. For those of us who know the places -- and some of the people -- Graham is presenting, I think she's done a disservice to her readers who think she has captured this unique part of the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bridges of Chase County","review":"Other reviewers mentioned the intriguing cover. Yes, it is (both versions I've seen), which proves the adage you can't judge a book by its cover. This novel started with a promise but soon grew stale, soap opera, unlikeable characters, a throw-away child, and by midway through, simply boring. The author used a distracting and annoying mixed point-of-view, even within the same paragraph, and a poor use of dialogue structure. Characters smiled, grinned, laughed their lines. One can't smile, grin, laugh a sentence.Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good story","review":"Althought I preferred her first book Firestarter, this is a good book, with a good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!!!!","review":"The plot has been told many times already so I'm just going to tell you my feeling about this book.When I read the back of this book I thought it sounded like a good read. Boy, was I wrong! The bleak landscape of the Flint Hills sets the tone for this book. The writing style was flowery beyond belief. The story line jumps from character to character without really telling us anything about them. The characters were dry, dreary, and dull. I got 200 pages in and I realized that not only didn't I care about Sarah, John, or Susan I actively disliked them! At that time I stopped reading this dud.This was my first and my last Janice Graham book. Blahhhh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Design","review":"This item, produced and marketed exclusively for the iAudio X5, is entirely useless.

Proprioception = standing on one leg eyes open or closed.Quadriceps = isometric lifing of the leg in a laying down position. And suggestions for slowly building up endurance again through walking, biking etc.For someone already active looking to recover from a slight injury that has not totally debilitated you, hire a personal trainer to work with you in training all your muscles back to good form while using proper positioning to reduce further injury.

I can't complain because its relatively inexpensive otherwise would be 3 stars. Still, I don't find anything truly great about the book. The one nugget of information I did get from the book was that your knee actually rotates your lower leg (we all know it extends and flexes, but the book actually proves to you that your own knees rotate the lower leg as well). Due to the price, I don't mind the purchase. I wouldn't recommend this to any younger readers, I myself am 30 and don't find the 'treatments' all that relevant. I sometimes have mild knee pain that for me seems to be better treated by doing full depth squats (yes, full depth squats, performed properly are good for you and do not hurt your knees)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty amazing!","review":"Was concerned that I would need surgery...again on my knee.

I followed each and every exercise and stretch. My knee is significantly better!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"liked this book","review":"I liked this book. At about 100 pages it was fairly simple. It's a good source for someone who wants to take shot at improving his knee situation short of going to a specialist. The the methods advocatedare not for everyone.

This book tells you what you need to know in order to put together a basic workout routine to strengthen your knee no matter what your issue is. This book explains to you what Physical Therapists won't take the time to explain and allows you to ask intelligent questions of your therapist and surgeon. Note, this book was what turned me on to massage techniques which have sped my recovery immensely. Most insurance plans won't cover massage, and physical therapists and surgeons don't recommend it unless you ask.

I bought the edited version to play it safe. I have to say that many of the thrills that at one time intrigued me, have worn off over the few weeks I have had this. The problem being is that every song is great. Not one bad track on the whole thing. This isn't so much the problem as the fact that the album never really switches gears. It has the same theme throughout. You will find that THE RUFF RYDERS ANTHEM wears off and there are other great songs. It is true, as one other reviewer said, this is very disturbing. At the end of the second track, there is a whole strings of gunshots. On the eighth track, DMX talks in graphic prose. Though edited, it still has a sppoky feel that will linger like the stench of a dead skunk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keepin' it real! Keepin' it rough like a true Ruff Ryder!","review":"Keepin' it real is what DMX does! He takes you along on a ride thru the streets. Showing you how it goes down. Hit the streets with D and learn from the Top Dog! He puts the streets aside and concentrates on the inner struggle. The struggle between good and evil. He contemplates the spiritual side of life. People might hear gunshots and foul language, but try and see past all of that. Have you never been so angry that you curse and scream and if anyone were to hand you a weapon, you swear you would do something to someone!? Love, Hate, Joy, Pain. He tells it how he knows it! Don't judge a book by its cover! With 4 albums all gone to nr1, he has earned respect only few rappers have and this with not as many albums. But who's standing in the spotlight? Keepin' it real!

Phillis Wheatley endures great pain in her young life first being sold as a slave and then spending most of her life proving herself - simply because she is black. At first her goal is to please Nathanial Wheatley whom she adores, but later she comes to terms with learning about herself and where she fits in a world where being black affords very few opportunities.

It's a bit like trying to paint a cloud.For those interested in the actual hiking itself, Curran comes off as a bit too harsh in his judgments of people and businesses he encounters along the way.

They could have shipped the book using regular USPS rates; it would have cost the same or less, and I would have received it much sooner. Also, this book was supposed to be NEW, the cover has a gooey, sticky substance on it, and it has major creases and folds (like someone tried to fold the book and then sat on it). Needless to say, I am extremely disappointed in the shipping time and in the condition of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling recording!","review":"I was at the San Francisco Memorial Opera House at the time of this recording. And let me tell you the audience went wild for Sutherland and Pavorotti. This recording was done in 1975, with the two great singers at or near their miraculous prime. To hear a real Elvira, you must hear Sutherland, because she can deal with the coloratura as well as the vocal line. Wow! A coloratura soprano capable of singing Verdi! Pavorotti is spectacular in the difficult tenor role, matching the memory of Franco Corelli. I love this cd, a thrill a minute! If you love high notes, you will be very happy with this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, cheap hardware","review":"I'm satisfied with these wind deflectors -- they fit fine on my Royal Enfield Bullet, look good, and perform as advertised.

The other, \\"Move of the Century\\", ASIN B0002RQOUG, although very professionally produced, is a DVD-R rather than a commercially pressed DVD, a fact that may pose viewing problems for some older DVD players.This DVD tends to provide a broad overview of the whole project. Much footage is given to the alternative plans that were proposed and residents' objections to the relocation before the move actually occurred. Nonetheless, the move itself is thoroughly covered in a way that would be of interest to everyone, not just a lighthouse devotee.The video and audio quality is very good and the documentary's narration (by Stockard Channing) is informative and interesting. An added bonus is the opening and closing comments by the inimitable Walter Cronkite, a sailor of the waters off Hatteras for many years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Update this book!","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book.

As a dedicated fly fisher and coldwater conservationist, I count it a privilege to know the author, Frank Weissbarth. He's a man of many facets and many talents. On the one hand, Frank can write lyrical prose about the joys of the outdoor life of Northern New Mexico and Southern Colorado, and can illustrate the book with exquisitely rendered photographs of the trout he treasures. On the other hand, in his professional role as an assistant attorney general for the state of New Mexico, he has made himself an expert on the biology of these trout and the fisheries practices that can protect or re-introduce them, and has then advocated for these practices in the public arena. As I told Frank when I first read Holy Ghost Creek, it is so good and so poignant that I limited myself to only one essay a day, for fear I would finish it too fast to fully savor it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kept it, but wouldn't buy it again.","review":"I found the picture light to be of poor quality, or maybe I just got a bad one.

Adsorption calorimetry gets more attention than before (not surprising given the Rouquerols' affiliation), as do \\"new\\" materials such as MCM's and \\"new\\" calculation models like DFT (Density Functional Theory) and Monte Carlo simulation. Importantly, there is a great deal of coverage given to adsorptives other than nitrogen (the most common but not necessarily the most appropriate in all cases).

I also observed the same thing on other brand of washers. All these consumer electric pressure washer uses very cheap material for the pump head.

I was hoping for some advice on what cars to start with, most effective modifications per dollar, and a suggested order to proceed through the races.

I certainly would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars for Utter Nonsense","review":"All reviewers are correct -- Michael Savage HAS done it again; that is, he's proven himself to be exactly what America should fear rather than admire. Once one reads this book, they should feel like either a stiff drink or reading something of higher quality, like Archie comics. Anyone who could possibly take this dolt seriously needs to come to grips with reality, and understand that humans shouldn't operate out of fear and anger --especially when your leader is the worst kind of coward, one who hides behind a tough voice on the radio or on the page, then turns tail and runs when the opportunity presents itself.I highly recommend that everyone read this book -- after all, the best way to defeat one's enemy is to know them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Counter productive in the 21st century","review":"I would have given this book no stars, but sadly '0' isn't one of the options.Savage is an attention-getter and shameless self-promoter. Anyone who reads this book with their critical-thinking skills intact, will see what nonsense this is, regardless of political beliefs. He's got his facts wrong in a lot of cases, and doesn't offer workable solutions to his various rants.Ironically, he reminds me of one major thing wrong with America--the rise of the 'pundit class.' All these people who just rant and rave with likeminded people on their shows and on the phones patting each other on the back.

Savage plays into the culture of fear like magician Ricky Jay plays poker, straight faced and with a couple of aces up his sleeve. His rants and tirades in the book are to be taken with a grain of salt. Savage seems to be the latest in the \\"flavor of the week\\" radio hosts, in syndication.

Somehow, it is even less excusable when you see it in print. His diatribes against women, minorities, homeless, liberals, gays, etc. are nothing new: these are the standard victims of talk radio. But Savage takes his bitterness and hate to new levels, apparantly to elevate himself above the standard right-wing AM fare. The book is not funny, as his radio show unintentionally sometimes is, and it could have been written by anyone with a mean streak and a passing familiarity with his radio show.

Although some of his claims are ridiculous, like hippies and Pot being directly responsible for the Taliban, his writing definitely provokes thought. Savage uses great stories that make for great reading. Basically the jist of this book is he gives his backgrounds, warns against the radical liberal agenda especially the ACLU. He also complains about what they have already done. He than gives his ideas for immigration, countering terrorism, abortion, etc. However his views are not moderately conservative. A good example of this is his attempt to compare Barbara Boxer with Dr. Mendela."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Rant, no substance","review":"Michael Savage is a very poor excuse for a conservative commentator. This book contains virtually no useful factual data to support his stream of rants. As a \\"right-winger\\" myself, I expect to see some substance to right wing arguments. Books like this only give ammunition to liberals who complain about far right conservatives who lack intellectual substance. To be honest, I felt ripped off after spending money on this book.

As for the reviewer who wrote that conservatives are to blame for all of today's problems, last time I checked these were the aftershocks of the Clinton Administration's policies on both international relations and the economy. I think all Americans should buy into Savage's ideas about immigration and affirmative action. These are not \\"angry white man\\" rants. Instead, Savage only wants to bring justice and a strong belief in America to the forefront of his ideas. Close our borders to immigration now, especially from Mexico and the middle east.

I recommend this book to anyone who still loves theircountry and is worried about unchecked illegal Immigration andthe problems it is causing. This book is number one on NY Timesbest seller list for a reason. Don't listen to those who undermine decency at every turn, even on a forum like this.

What is wrong with that?I have been told that Fairfax county Virginia teaches \\"English as a second language\\" in over 70 languages. Yes, many are students of diplomats.

But there's nothing here that would enlighten anyone desiring a serious look at current events. This is only red meat for the converted who like Savage's name-calling. If you want to know this guy's views on any issue, think of the most extreme right wing position and that's Michael Savage. If you want to hear these diatribes for free, stop by a mental institution and speak with the patients.This book and his radio show reveal a man who is consumed with hatred and anger.

However, it was next to impossible to unearth these nuggets from the heaping debris of rhetoric.I had a hard time believing that his book, filled with name-calling and childish rants, was written by someone with multiple advanced degrees. Perhaps if I listened to his radio show I would know who \\"Rat Boy\\" or \\"Larry Seltzer\\" were off the bat, but it took me a while to figure it out. Rather than letting his facts speak for themselves, he chooses to call people childish names. Rather than saying \\"Johnnie Walker Lindh is a traitor,\\" he basically says \\"Rat Boy smells like poop.\\" Its sad.While he claims to be discussing \\"facts,\\" the book is devoid of any referencing or foot/endnotes. Which is a shame because some of his \\"stories,\\" if true, would be worth reading additional information on. Unfortunately, I have to, as Mr. Savage suggests, take his word for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have one word to share with you","review":"....about Michael Savage, and about this book:FILTH.I glanced through this at a brick & mortar book store and felt dirty just handling the book full of ignorance, lies, and hate.Any person who would lower themselves to the level of Savage by reading or buying this book needs to seriously re-examine their intellect, their morality and their mental health. People who find this rubbish appealling probably like snuff porn or torturing small animals.This nauseating man and his spewed out filth is entirely what's wrong with America these days.

I don't like this book any more than I like the writer -- it's just the latest poorly written, poorly edited version of Angry White Man radio spinning off into publishing, which means it was outdated the day it appeared in stores. But it could just as easily be a book-length liberal rant as conservative -- ultimately, it's the book, people, the book that counts. And this book is bad.

Michael Savage is not a good example of an American. He is a high-strung, hate filled individual that makes money off talking about views that he hasn't done anything to help accept YELL!

If the weak elements of the world won't climb on board with us, they should feel our strength, and be ruled without mercy.

Just reading the first ten pages of Mr. Savage exhibiting absurdities about how disturb the liberals or anyone who's not a 100% hard core conservative is just plain comical and not to mention insanity. Worst of all, just reading between the lines of this hate-filled book seems to advocate animosity and aggressiveness toward anyone whos is none-white or is intelligent enough to refute his garbage.

A classic of what....who knows.

I consider myself conservative, but the idea that there actually a few Neanderthals out there nodding their heads in agreement with this sensationalist is frightening indeed.

His accusations and theories are so preposterous as to be beneath comment. Savage is a non-player and this book is about as credible as the latest ravings of the UFO abduction crowd. It may have been good for a laugh if not for the fact that a sizable portion of people mistake this drek for cogent thought.

Yet, when liberals express an opinion, they demand EVERYONE accept it without reservation.

Any thought that deviates from their own is branded HATEFUL. Amazing! Truly AMAZING! The \\"Thought Police\\" would be next if we didn't have people like Dr. Savage. He is a brave person willing to stand up and challenge the contemporary PC quagmire we are bound up in.

We have now found out that the shooter in the sniper case was illegal alien & Jamacian John Malvo.Sadly, the Republican Party (RNC) is almost as bad as the evil Democrats in allowing the borders to remain wide open.

I consider myself a left-leaning independent, but I like to read a wide range of political literature. I wouldn't reccomend this to anyone, however. It's just one long rant by an angry man who seems to feel that we should return to the days when women, gays and immigrants were oppressed.

Whats left to say, if you are to the right, Savage's book will just make you angrier; if you are from the left, this book will predict the future. What the baby boomers dont realize is that the new generation (Born past 1980) is much more conservative than they are willing to believe.

Every issue you turn to, there the left is, occupying the opposite position. Family values? The left pushed diversity and two mother homes. Patriotism? The left sneers that its a dirty word. A foreign policy which advocates our national interests? The left stridently proclaims that Amerika is oppressing the world. In fact, although Michael Savage has not said so, if you want to know the correct position regarding any issue, listen to the left and do the opposite. They always get it wrong.

Those of us leaning in the opposite direction might well agree with many of Savage's views and appreciate his biting and witty insights, but that does not make this doorstop of a book worth reading. Nothing written in these pages hasn't been hashed and rehashed on \\"The Savage Nation\\" a hundred times, and all of it loses a great deal in the translation from the radio to print.

In this incoherent tirade, Savage writes purely for the benefit of those who will blindly nod their heads at the evils of liberals, commies, and especially... the Clintons. It's truly amazing the venom that conservatives still hold for the man. This book is no different from any other Hannity or Colter conservative tirade, in that it provides no proof for any of its various rants and exists solely to make the author money because he knows that ditto heads who need to feed and justify their hatred will lap it up.

Savage resorts to name calling far more often than he provides any facts to back up his arguments. Example: Tony Blair is \\"Third Way Führer Blair\\". Why? Because he is in the wrong party. Of course, Savage now thinks Blair is a prince (check his web site)... Liberals? As much a threat as Al Quada.Savage misquotes scientific research from the University of Tokyo (claiming it pertains to global warming, when it doesn't). He tells us that the divorce rate doubled in 30 years, when in fact it increased 30%. He attacks ritalin, as a way to slam Hillary Clinton, while ignoring the children who ritalin helps.Now, I suppose this book is primarily intended to outrage, as such it is a success. Perhaps Mr. Savage really believes intolerance will solve the problems he is presenting, I don't and therefore can not recommend his book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The rantings of a sick demagogue...","review":"The hate that's expressed in this book is embarassing.Take a shower after you read this."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugg","review":"Leave aside the inanity.

Regardless of one's view on liberalism or conservatism, we need to be responsible for our own actions and their consequences. My parents were immigrants from the Philippines.

What I find especially disturbing is people out there actually think this bile belching Quack speaks the Gospel. This book is for the new conservatives who have to remind themselves that they are mental Pygmies.

However given the immature rhetoric and childish finger pointing, if you're conservative, you ought to be ashame there's other conservatives like this guy.His real name is Micheal Wiener.

I am a conservative, but even I was outraged with author's ideas.

It's sort of entertaining, and I agree with him on maybe thirty to forty percent of the issues, but he's not a scholarly figure or even clever. As I saw on an anti-Savage website once: \\"Calling the New York Times the Old York Times? LOL.\\" Alright...I've read this book a few times, they're mostly just columns he wrote for World Net Daily. He'll never convince you to join his side.His book summed up for you:1) Gay people suck2) Al Gore is a Communist3) Family values as he defines them and Fundamentalist Christianity are goodTo quote Savage in his book, \\"That's it. It's over. You're done.\\"Typical stuff. For good analysis, read Ann Coulter, Phyllis Schlafly, Thomas Sowell, and Michelle Malkin.

Before he 'became' a radio talk show host he wrote herbal medicine books and was a darling of the San Fransico left wing crowd. His claim to fame was swiming naked with left wing poet Alan Ginsburg in Fiji. I am not certain this guy is serious - my fear is he is putting on an act to make the 'right' look like a bunch of crazies. I've listened to his show and read his book, and I don't know if he is being serious. If you look at his past, you would might agree."},{"rating":"1","title":"A worthless waste of paper and ink.

I seriously doubt if even he can believe half of the slanderous lies that spew from his mouth. Unfortunately, there are those feeble minded automatons who, for whatever reason, will accept what he says as gospel. For the rest of us freethinkers, the book holds no value whatsoever.

After all, this book is by a person who asserts that women should not be permitted to vote- they're \\"too emotional\\". This screed is simply more hate, more bias, and more bigotry from the same folks who bring us Liddy, Hannity, O'Reilly, Coulter, Rushbo, Fox \\"news\\", and the rest of the right wing raving crowd. Sadly, they cannot help but try to out do each other. Apparently there are enough loonies like the fans who write 5 star reviews for this garbage to make publishing these poor excuses for books profitable. It makes one worry about our future as a nation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another manifesto","review":"Savage is the latest opportunist to turn the right wing mantra into money for himself: by writing a book that says every problem in America is the fault of liberals, foreigners, women, intellectuals, homosexuals, poor people, and people of color. Savage (how ironic--a name that suits the person perfectly) tells us that hate is indeed a family value, while appealing to the most base (and baseless) fears of conservatives. He gives simple answers to difficult questions, ala Rush, Ann Coulter, and Sean Hannity. So, if you're looking for someone to blame because your life isn't what you want it to be, this would be a good book with which to start your collection. It'll give you so many different people to hate you won't know where to begin.

After a year of very light use, the unit lost 1200 pixels - \\"stuck\\" on purple all the time. Manufacturing problems can occur to an otherwise good product, but the true test of a company, in my opinion, is it willingness to stand behind their product and resolve their customer's issue. This is especially true with a new brand which has not yet established a track record. To date they have been unwilling to work with me, but I am hopeful we can work it out - I'll undate my review then.Techically, the contrast range of this LCD is not capable of showing both deep blacks and highlight detail at the same time. This makes movie watching a poor experience, but I've found it suitable for general viewing, children's cartoons, etc.Of course, once you loose 1200 pixels, the picture quality doesn't matter that much and you can only hope the company will support you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mad Scientist Affair( A Man From UNCLE book).","review":"I received the book in a pretty descent condition.Some yellowing of the pages(But look how old the book is!).Strong storyline with alot of ACTION."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of old","review":"the movie story, picture even the audio are kind of old.for collectors it is kind if nice to copmlete all deniros movies by having this movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, but not expected","review":"A good modern coctail-lounge-style rendition of music associated with the Civil War.

The performers are fine. The orchestra is only passible. The technical recording itself is atrocious! The microphones must have been placed over the front rows of the audience who were asthmatic or recovering from bronchitis. If you dare to listen to this wreck of a recording you will hear more hacking, coughing, nose blowing and sneezing than you should have heard in your life time. On top of that, the first rows must have been peopled by those who are enchanted by their own voices. I couldn't believe that an audience could be so crude.DO NOT waste your money on this recording.

Thirdly, it was ordered from India. If I had known that, I never would have ordered it. Amazon should tell people when a foreign product is being ordered. I threw it out. Be prepared, this is not what one expects in a tooth powder. I googled all the ingredients (foreign language) and every English translation was an herb, spice or plant. However, even though it supposedly had all natural products, I just could not brush my white teeth with this brown stuff. A total waste of money and I threw it in the garbage.

The medium nib is very smooth and never skips while the barrel diameter and weight seems to be just right for a casual pen.

But my traveling companion for 300 or so pages needs to be likeable, or at least insightful. Queenan is neither. He relishes being a jerk, which is fine, if at least he was funny.

This one is just...tired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, awful book","review":"Is there anything Joe Queenan actually likes other than the sound of his own voice.

I couldn't even finish his book while on a trip to England last year. On this year's trip, I brought along \\"Queenan Country\\" and loved it. I was a big fan of \\"Red Lobster, Blue Lagoon, and White Trash,\\" and while some of the Amazon reviews for this one had me on my guard, my worries were unfounded.

It's no wonder his wife stayed home. Queenan learned little or nothing about the REAL Britain. He is egotistical and pretentious, and his prose leans toward the turgid, repetitive and flatulent.

Stick with Theroux and Bryson if you want to enjoy your travels."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit dull","review":"Unlike most of the reviews I've read of this author and book (except the two here), I did not find much humor in this book and I didn't catch myself laughing out loud once.Queenan does a good job covering a lot of what makes the UK great: general British history, culture and tourist attractions. However, this book reads more like a dry tour guide than a humorously endearing account of all quirks British, which is what I was hoping for and expecting after reading reviews.I've given up after about 100 pages because I'm not interested in Queenan's bland retelling of his trip to the home of the Beatle's or his snide, unoriginal comments about Fergie, Madonna and other famous (infamous) British inhabitants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amusing Read","review":"I'm not familiar with anything else that Queenan has written, and I've never been to England. But hey, I like the country's musicians and authors, and I'll even eat their food. But as an American, I'll never understand the love of \\"football\\" or many other eccentric customs of the locals. Which maybe is why I enjoyed this book so much. As an equally perplexed outsider, I found Queenan's observations both entertaining and enlightening. I can understand why many would dislike this book, and also why many would find his style of written rants a bit over the top.

And who can't identify with Sorrel, Mark and Holly's when they yearn for an attache case, not wanting to be different from other children at school?

Furthermore, the remote control for the switch doesn't work. I live and work in the state of Sao Paulo Brazil so I will not take the device back to the US to return......

When I had everything all hooked up, and plugged in the switcher, the power light came on and the light for switch 1 turned on, but I was only getting audio from port switch 1. I tried port 2. The switcher would not switch to port 2. I could press the switch 2 button, but nothing would happen. Then I tried switch 3. This switch's button would not even work. It would not budge. It was stuck somehow. The switch doesn't switch manaully or with the remote.I suspect I got the same unit John Hopper returned December 2009.I am returning the switch to Amazon for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solves a problem","review":"Solves a problem with older A/V system with only one optical input.

Until they actually are married and living together for a month the book was 5-star. It lost a star to become only a very-good-read because it slowed down terribly about 2/3 of the way through. I still loved the hero and heroine and plodded through to the predictable end. It did have a deliciously slow building romance that was not consummated until after the wedding.

I found the section on when and how to tell the first child about the new baby was totally inadequate. It doesn't address different ages at all - yet there must be a difference in when and how you present the information to an 18 month old, a three year old, or a four year old. The book was packed with anxiety-provoking scenarios of resentful and frustrated children and parents, unhelpful observations (some parents do this random thing, some parents do that random thing), and ridiculously obvious advice (have two children to lug around? Consider a double stroller - wow, I wouldn't have thought of that on my own!). I found it to be a waste of time. I'm reading Siblings without Rivalry, now.

However, the interesting historical tidbits occur randomly with little clear context or relationship to the rest of the book. In fact, this volume reads not like a book but rather like so many unrelated paragraphs. Most paragraphs make some degree of sense by themselves but there is little if any connection from one paragraph to another. The book is a context-free mish-mash of history, scientific classifications of experience and art, rants against modern society, scholarly analysis of the history of science and philosophy, and personal resentments.Perhaps I haven't re-imprinted my brain sufficiently, or perhaps I've not re-imprinted it closely enough to Leary's own re-imprinting, or perhaps I'm just dumb.

The phone had constant static and had no range. Now I know that this phone is not a true 2.4 GHZ. This means that it is 2.4 GHZ to the handset and 900mhz from the handset to the base. I thought the styling of the phone was great and I loved the illuminated antenna. Oh, that brings me to my next point, the keypad is not illuminated just the screen. You can at least check the numbers you are dialing. The answering machine leaves much to be desired as well.

The trainees found that all the options books were either too advanced, too theoretical, or poorly written. I finally got fed up and wrote my own.This book has sold well because it supplies a demand.

If you don't know much about computers, and you're looking to get a friend a gift, or trying to buy a cheap video card, listen to this. There is no such thing as a good cheap video card. The hardware demands for modern games are so high, they require constant upgrading of hardware. So, if you're looking to keep up with PC games, you're waisting your money unless you invest in the best video card you can (can get pricey though, $500+). It is well worth the investment.

I purchased a 24 inch Dell LCD Monitor and my graphics with this card are fair. I have now purchased a 6800 GS to replace this one. I have seen friends using the 6800 on their older machines and the images are worth the extra U$150 dollars - especially if you are gaming with COD2 or UT2004. The other players continually whack you with this card because you can't respond as quickly as they can. Bottom-line - this card is adequate for a CRT monitor (I tested it on my 19inch and it looked great), but can't push enough pixels to satisfy a bigger LCD Monitor.

This, to me, is the series' greatest strength.Though this volume did contain a story by Cherryh and one by solid writer George Foy, it also contained a story--the first one, by Chris Morris--which offended me so utterly that rather than sell this book to the used book store, I will be tossing it in the recycling bin. Morris has chosen to represent historical characters by substituting insulting, juvenile, false, repulsive slander for actual research.

The difference is that about 85% of SciAm's articles are by real scientists & technologists reporting on their work.

It has turned into a brochure with 2-page ads disguised as articles for computer equipment (external hard drives).

Thus, it was with great anticipation that I read this collection.Sadly, my anticipation was far exceeding the enjoyment I got out of reading the stories.That isn't to say that the stories presented were really bad - just not particularly engrossing, memorable or filled with wonder. Some of them seemed particularly dated; those were the ones that were presented as happening in \\"the present\\" of the early 90's (when they were written). This seemed quite odd as some of Bradbury's older works - which one would imagine being even more out of date - don't seem to suffer from this in the slightest.Unless you're a completist, I'd recommend finding his earlier short story collections; they're much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Good Stuff","review":"Bradbury has once again written a very good collection. As compared with everybody else is is still the best collection out there. as compared against his own work, is still good but not a classic. This may not be fair to him, but \\"Quicker Than the Eye\\" just does not rise up to his historic standards. This collection seems to about death in its various forms, but told through the eye of a romantic. Some of the stories are about true horror \\"The Finnegan\\" and some of the stories are about time travel \\"The Witch Door\\". My personal favorites are \\"If MGM is Killed, Who Gets the Lion?\\" and \\"Free Dirt\\". The first leaves a smile on your face and the second is a macabre tale about getting free dirt from a graveyard. This is still good stuff and is a very enjoyable way to pass the time, just not up to the legendary standards of the past. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The old master still at it.....","review":"This compilation of stories is outstanding by normal standards and so-so by Bradbury's. There are some highlights, inculding \\"The Finnegan,\\" \\"Once More, Legato\\" and \\"Exchange,\\" but \\"Quicker than the Eye\\" does not quite measure up to previous Bradbury works such as \\"The October Country.\\" One cannot help but notice the recurring theme of death in this book. Nary a story is written without Grim Reaperish-like sentiment. Nevertheless, Bradbury remains a foremost romantic in the world of fiction. You could do worse than picking up \\"Quicker than the Eye\\" and reading it. One gets an enriched view of life, especailly after reading the Afterword."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old but Beautiful","review":"My mother had this book for as long as I can remember in paperback.

But it is full of fallacy that animals are in heaven. If you read a bible you will find out that animals do not go to heaven, only humans who have accepted Jesus Christ as Saviour go to heaven. ALso young children who have reached accountabilty in their lives also do not go to heaven. This is when children know right from wrong and choose to do the wrong, then they are accountable for their souls. Overall, I was disappointed in the book due to the things that are not true in the book, The bible says that when an animals life is over, it is over but for humans this is not the case. If you would like a fictional account of heaven, I guess you would like this book but I needed something more and that is why I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING!","review":"This must be a joke -- This book is nothing but imagination at best or pure spiritism and necromancy at worst. The Bible forbids this activity. It does not matter who endorsed it it violates all kinds of Scriptures. In the Old Testment a medium like Rebecca Springer would have brought the death penalty on herself. People want more than the Bible and go off into fantasy and imagination hoping to communicate with the dead. It is much safer to stay with the living biblical text. Why seek dreams, vision and the dead when you have the clear light of God's word. All I need to know about heaven is there -- I just need to get to know it.

The only drawback is that you have to use the book along side the tape to work with the tape. But the book is great by itsself and will take you where you want to go. The tape is also of great help so that you can be better understood by the Gaelic public. It's terrible to take all the time to learn a language and then having the people in the countries your in, not being able to understand you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a very good introduction to Gaelic","review":"The text of the teach yourself book is a little spartan as the author attempts to cover a lot of subject matter in a very short time. The basic usage and forms of the language are covered clearly but, I found myself repeating a lot of the lessons as new questions arose. The tapes are invaluable to anyone learning to speak gaelic due to the very difficult pronunciation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, what I've been waiting for!","review":"This book was a very good book in some ways, and yet, laking in others. I liked the pronunciation guide (the tapes really helped with pronunciation too), the cultural and linguistic tidbits about the language, and the dictionary in the back. I would have like to seen the dictionary to have more content, and I personally think that instead of jumping right in the middle of Gaelic conversation, the book should have given a little more basic short word phrases and need to know info like, numbers, greetings, time, names, etc. Overall I think it was a very informative work, and if you consentrate on the language hard enough, this book will give you a good working conversational grasp of the language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dedication will pay off","review":"While the older version by Roderick MacKinnon may be better for all the fine points of grammar, this is the version you want for learning conversational Gaelic.

In this book, he offers an insider's look at life in the league, both before the arrival of Pele and after. Messing does not pull punches, whether he is criticizing the bias against Americans in the league, the bias against the sport by the American media, or the complete mishandling of the Cosmos. Along the way, there are also funny moments. All in all, an essential part of any American soccer fan's library."},{"rating":"2","title":"education is entertainment when reading about soccer in the seventies","review":"This was one of my favorite books as a teenager. It's still a good read today. The book relates Shep Messing's story -- that of a pro soccer player (and goalkeeper) with the NY Cosmos, playing on the same team as Pele. Messing tells about his antics at establishment schools and his growth as a player. There's more to it - and for those wishing to revisit their soccer fan pasts of the seventies and eighties with the NASL, or those who just have an interest in athletes, athletics or soccer, this is a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poirot movies","review":"Keep them coming.

These, taken together, may be the best television mysteries ever made, but this most recent and (probably) final bit is way, way below the par of the series. Here's why:- Screenplay far below the standards. Just not a lot to it. The writer clearly thought that mysteries without any mystery was fun.- Settings and scenery and photography below the standards. Prior entries always provided a lot of beauty and atmosphere in the settings, which recreated the 1930-1950 era. These two fall flat.- Even David Suchet seems a bit wornout by doing the same old stuff in the same old way.- $35 bucks for just TWO movies? Who are you kidding? We English mystery fans are CHEAPOS!

Wait for the inevitable 4-disc set that will come out once the other 2 films have been shown in the U.S. Or, conversely, wait until the price drops on this one owing to lack of interest at that ridiculous price ... the resellers will certainly be offering much more reasonable prices.

It is a cliche found in too many reviews, but in this case it is true: Greene tells a story with the skills of a great novelist and without realizing it we are being told an awful lot of very important history and information here.

Banks ends up retracting his statement to the cops. Big deal. Mike shows up at Banks' college. I thought things would pick up from there. It got even more boring. Rich kids drinking, smoking, partying, talking...zzzzzzzz.

Despite how very elementary those buttons are, this film succeeds in pushing them through Charlie's primary and secondary education, into young adulthood. The storyline leans toward redemption at times, though never really spills into it. In that light the pace flags a bit and feels like pertinent bits of the story have been left out. The acting was well done, it just felt like the story itself couldn't decide where it was going. By the time it meandered to the end I found I didn't really care how things turned out. Its messages on bullying, self-esteem and karma are clear, it just doesn't do a very good job of showing them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't stand the Mick character.","review":"I started watching this movie with friends, but we never finished as I found the tension from the Mick character disturbing and decided to watch something else on this evening.Mick is a slimy bad school kid that reappears in Charlie's life years later in college.

I found this movie to be terribly uneven and uneventful. What you would expect is a darkly tinged coming of age tale, what you receive is a director trying too hard to make this into a classic, which it just could not be. The film is overly long and perhaps if more time was spent in the editing room it may run a bit smoother and not lag in so many places. It's not particularly well acted, the script is linear and flat, and the direction is mediocre at best. I really wanted to like this because it sounds great, but let's face it; it's been done before and done much better.

The storyline of a boy growing up and getting over his fear of the local bully seems almost too elaborate for this film. The actors are decent (Jason Ritter and Jesse Eisenberg) to mediocre (the female leads - Eva Amurri and Gloria Votsis), with no standout performances.It's impossible to say how much Fred Durst (yes, the lead singer of Limp Bizkit) is at fault for the final execution of the film and how much is the screenwriter's fault. Generally, it seems that the storyline, while being cohesive, manges to feel disjointed and some items alluded to throughout the movie wind up not being crucial at its end (perhaps that's the editor's mistake, less than the director's)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Shoe","review":"Have worn Reebok since I parked my Penny Loafers and never been disapointed.

Maybe their \\"style\\" of playing just isn't appealing to me, or maybe it is the vocalist trying to impersonate Burton C. Bell from Fear Factory with his singing.

Every single song on here is good, even the intro. I went on a car trip from Denver to Vegas, I listened to the whole thing at least 4 times. If you don't like the Ruff Ryders Anthem don't be fooled.

His lyrics are so real and so raw that you can't help but feel him. He is his owns person and speaks his mind, much like Shakur. That is why they are both feared and admired as the true stars that they are; and they will both continue to shine throughout the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Album Of The Decade!!!!","review":"DMX is the realist rapper in the game. I like his hard lyrics. I don't see how anyone can dislike his music. What he raps about is real. He is different from any other rappers out there. He has his own style. All of these other rappers out there are trying to be like someone else. X is himself.

He got one star because zero stars isn't available."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS ALBUM IS JUST AN EXAMPLE OF STYLE OVER SUBSTANCE!!","review":"Much like his Money, Cash Hoes partner, Jay-Z, DMX is asubstanceless pop-rapper who survives on the fact that he is a Tupacclone. Once his angry black man novelty wears off, people will see that his music is quaint dribble at best. Like one of my good friends said, he is a decent rapper who just doesn't rap about anything worthwhile. I am sure that he has more on his mind than being angry and killing people.DMX's career will be buried along the rest of dominant rappers' of the late 90's in the end. He is surviving on the present hardcore wave that fuels the adreline of young white kids, but little else. My brother wants this album, but I love him too much for him to think that DMX is an artist worth remembering. His hip-hop sensitivity is already warped by Jay-Z and Redman, I don't want to escalate the damage."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste ya $","review":"some of the beats was o k , but his lyrics are pretty sad. and to make matters worse he has mase and the lox on the c d some of the most commercial mc's you can get."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just love Dmx and his album \\"Its dark and hell is hot\\"","review":"i love his songs.

His lyrical ability is that of a fourth-grader. Does he have anything interesting to say at all? The production is nice though, but can't save the album. Save your money for the new Tribe album coming out - or better yet, go out and buy some older classic hiphop that you probably have missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great artist","review":"This album beats every album out there. He's my favorite rapper, and he defitinly should make a third album soon. For all you people out there who think DMX isn't any good, you have bad taste.

If you don't relate to this kind of stuff try Ruff Ryder's Anthem, that should get you going. If you like rap, this CD is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best CD's ever made","review":"DMX attacks the listener with such raw intensity that you can't help but get into it.

Peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"DMX, KEEP MAKIN THOSE ALBUMS","review":"This is X's best album so far. The whole cd tells about his tough life. The best songs are Ruff Ryders Anthem, Look Through My Eyes, X-Is Coming, Damien, Stop Being Greedy, and ATF. I have all of X's cd's, and they are da bomb. It's Dark and Hell It's Hot is in my top 5 favorite cd's."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's dark and DMX is hot","review":"This album is tight; it's dark and poetic, and the lyrics are touching and actually meaningful. My absolute favorites are Da Convo, Damien, and of course Rough Rider's Antheme. Go out and buy this album, then buy the new one too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is the best album that DMX has done. Sad, that it is his first album, but it is definitley a classic one. From the intro to Niggaz Done Started Something, X will keep your ears at attention and hungry for more. He almost forces you to put it on repeat. \\"Ruff Ryders Anthem\\" - Need I say more. Don't lie, when this came out you couldn't help but sing everytime you heard or somebody rap it in class or at work. Though the chorus is addicting, don't overlook the context of the song, let alone the ablum. \\"Get at Me Dog\\" is the track letting everyone know he is not to be messed with. He even goes back to diss K-Solo (who he battled while locked up). The album itself is a story. Like a day in the life of DMX. At sunrise it's the anthem to get em hyped up, and at night he prays before bed....but Niggaz Done Started Something."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"Someone said he was like 2PAC, ummmmm no.

He is the wackest MC ever, probabaly. And he has no talent at all. Have you ever heard him rap when he dosen't scream? He sounds wac as hell in 14 of the songs. The only good song is Ruff Ryders' Anthem. If you think DMX is the best east coast rapper, then You don't know nothing about rap. The only good rapper in Ruff Ryders in Drag-On."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't care who you are, you are gonna love this.","review":"Well, to start it off, I'm 14, white (if it matters) and I live on the south side, about 5 miles from downtown. Anyways... I dsaw the Ruff Ryders' Anthem on MTV once, and thought \\"Oh great, ANOTHER mc coming on the scene...\\" but let me tell you I was WRONG. My best friend, we'll call him Willie Dee, turned me onto this album. It's dark and gritty, but it's honesty is a thing of beauty, and his rhytym is dead on, and you can't normally find that in recent rap music. DMX kicks the masses so much, he's completely irresistable. And I'm not even that much into rap, just for the record.And if you play football, listen to this before every game. Your adrenaline will burst and your bloodlust will go through the roof. No joke, my team beat those other guys to bad..."},{"rating":"2","title":"DMX's best Album, No Doubt About It","review":"When DMX first album \\"It's Dark and Hell Is Hot\\" first landed, no one knew what to expect. They only head Dark Man X on \\"24 Hours To Live\\" feat Mase, and \\"Money, Power Respect\\" feat The Lox and Lil Kim. When the album actually released. Everyone who blown out of their shoes, even me. Any who's a rap fan cant' say that DMX is one of the top 10 greatest rappers of all time. The best songs on the album are:\\"Ruff Ryders Anthem\\", \\"Get At Me Dog\\", \\"X-Is Coming\\", \\"Damien\\", \\"How's It Goin Down\\", \\"Crime Story\\", \\"Stop Being Greedy\\", \\"ATF\\"(a little short but still good), \\"The Convo\\" and the two underrated tracks \\"For My Dogs\\" and \\"Niggaz Done Started Something\\"So outta the 19 tracks (16 full length tracks), 12 are excellent.

They were fantastic for reviewing the basics of the PMBOK, but didn't cover some necessary topics such as the different types of power and risk techniques and when to use them, etc. I'd like to see this updated with questions that apply to WHEN you actually use the different formulas, types of power, processes, etc, instead of just focusing on WHAT the different knowledge areas and processes are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Resource","review":"This book was helpful for studying for the PMP exam. It helped me get a much better handle on the material than the PMBOK. But it was not as good as the Tony Johnson Crosswind book.

It should proivde other professional project management viewpoints to enhance the value of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful in passing the CAPM exam","review":"The book combined with computer based test simulations are a very good preparation regiment. The book is very terse but cuts through to the case on what you need to know to pass the test.The writing is not particularly great but is effective. It would be helpful to a bit more graphic representation of the various phases and processes. The practice tests at the end of the characters are helpful but they are not very representative of the actual questions in the CAPM test. I am not sure if the questions are representative of the PMP test.Overall, a web-based practice test should accompany the book.

The CD is also very convenient. However, it is very unreliable. The list of errata at sybex.com will give you an idea of the type and number of mistakes. There are mistakes in questions and answers on exams, including basic arithmetic errors. There are also more substantive conceptual errors that go beyond one-word typos (confusing \\"qualitative\\" with \\"quantitative\\" and incorrectly describing types of contracts, for example). I haven't yet taken the exam, but am planning to buy another book (Mulcahy), because I can't trust the content of this one. I don't know how many errors I may be learning as facts. Good price, but not a good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many errors to be used alone","review":"Don't be fooled into thinking that this book alone will get you ready for passing the PMP Cert exam. The PMP exam is much harder than any other cert. Don't expect this book's into to PM style is enough to pass the exam.Kim's book is lacking in many ways; too many errors and ommisions for my taste. For example, Kim got it wrong - the five process groups are not phases! Controlling is not a phase. It's this lack of critical thinking that will lull you into thinking you're ready to take the exam when you're not.I prefer PMP Cert For Dummies - and so do all those in my study group. Between us, we have all the books. Our recommendation is to buy several books - this one along with PMP cert is a good combo. By the way, Rita's is too overpriced and omits too many things for self-study. If you like Rita's re-cycled class workbook take her $1,100 course instead and get it for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't use it alone, but a GREAT reference!","review":"First off, don't think you can get away with passing the PMP exam by just reading this review book.

Highly recommended","review":"Start PMP preparation with this book, as it takes through each phase in sequence as in real projects so you can relate to whats going on (instead of studying each knowledge management area as in PMBOK). Questions in the book and the CD extremely useful...I scored 80-85% in the exercise exams and my final score was 83.5% (167/200). Use this book along with PMBOK and Rita's book, you ae guaranteed to score above 80%"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exelent Approach","review":"I found this book very good in preparing for the PMP. Heldman has an exelent approach by decribing the normal processes/information/actionsflow used in an actual project. It is really easy to understand how processes, inputs, t/t, outputs, relate during the life cycle of a project. I also found really relevant the Example Case developed from beginning to end of the book. The CD is good with its multiple questions and the flascards to help memorizing important things. For its relatively low cost the benefit is high.This book + PMBok must be used in a very close way.

William Adler did a superb job of investigative reporting. This book not only chronicles the rise and fall of the Chamber Brothers, it details the socioeconomic conditions that help create them. Although their actions should never be accepted, this book adequately explains why such a horrible decision was feasible to someone in that situation. Adler investigates not only the Chambers, but the economies of the Mississippi Delta and Detroit during Reagonomics. In one of the most enlightening moments in the book, the true nature of the war on drugs is established when he discusses the sentencing of Chambers and associates, including their suppliers. This book is a must read for all who believe the war on drugs will be won with tougher sentencing and mandatory minimums."},{"rating":"2","title":"A study of a family's rise and fall in the crack trade.","review":"I haven't finished the book yet, but basically, I think they are going to get arrested and hide all of their money in Arkansas with the Clinton family.

That said, the set's unintroduced, unannotated texts, reproduced in _very_ small type defeat the compilers' purpose. And, but for Adler's introductory essays (available from Amazon vendors in a popular edition) the Syntopicon is a boondoggle.

I tested the discs in my computer and with a 35 dollar magnavox player. Everything works fine in the other machines, but not in this DVD player. Upgrading the firmware, and using different brands of discs did not help either. Unless you are buying this one at a really steep discount, with no intention of playing Divx/Avi files please avoid.

Mine got stuck this way. I cannot get the top lid to screw on correctly and now it is stuck and won't unscrew so I cannot return it. In attempting to unscrew the lid the entire assembly of the lid fell apart. I would HIGHLY recommend spending a few more bucks and purchasing something that assembles without falling apart.

The best thing about the novel is its treatment of the Armenian genocide (a freighted term, which if you are already informed about this historical period you will know). The early sections dealing with this are terrific and memorable. Once the action is transferred to Connecticut it starts to deflate.

The program didn't ask me if that's what I meant to do--it simply ended! All tech support would say is they'd pass it to their programmers to consider in the future. Very shoddy design in my opinion. I tried to rebuild the catalog so I didn't have to redo hours of backup and after asking me to insert all 15 disks, it couldn't read the 16th--the one it shut down earlier, and so quit again. Tech support didn't even respond. I cannot get it to rename a DVD without reformatting and it insists on defaulting to its own naming system (though you can override it).

The graphics are ok, and the 360 deg scroll thing is nice, but in my opinion the Journyman #3 did a better job there. The one area that I'd give 4 stars to is the movie clips, pretty good. My main complaint though is that the story line sort of sucks... I'm a gammer not a soap junkie. The whole storyline smells of a really, really bad soap opra chliche.

It jumps from one barely related topic to another without really explaining any of them. The \\"Stocks for Dummies\\" format interjects enough distracting trivia to keep the reader from focusing. Why would you throw a paragraph on triple witching days into a beginner's book?Deeper into the book there is a pretty good section on financial statements, but all in all I don't think it's a good choice for anyone.

It is not a work of original scholarship but a very scholarly synthesis of all of the literature combined with judicious analysis. There is a major thesis; that Black leadership has been largely the product of a middle class elite that has invariably short changed the black masses. Nelson pulls no punches, he can be wonderfully acerbic in his criticism but always fair and balanced. I know of no work that is as comprehensive and useful. It is perfect for courses in contemporary African American history. It will also be of interest to scholars in the field, because of its rich interpretive and analytical qualities. I highly recommend this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read for those who like near future conflicts","review":"I completely enjoyed this read.

The rear shell mount where it rests on the stand is deformed and at two different levels at the mating. One of the slotted shafts is spread open at the slot. The gear train is so sloppy that you can turn the output shaft and the gears will slip and grind; I don't know if it will drive the motor when I get that far. The kit was missing an eyelet for the timing plate. The instructions show attaching the plug wires to the timing plate but later you have to pass the leads through several things like the distributor caps, wire sleeves, etc. so you would have to take it apart again.

I hadn't touched the tool before and thought that this book would be a help, but I found it to be little use. The topics that would have been of most use to a business user, including formulas and other advanced topics were poorly organized and written.

In reality, there's 1/3 of empty space and the thing is so thick you can't put it in any pocket (so much for \\"pocket PC\\").For women who have large purses, it's a good space saving solution though, because you could put your regular wallet stuff in there in addition to the PDA.For guys trying to use the beltclip (held by velcro) is cumbersome. It attaches vertically and creates an enormous budge on your hip, making it look like you have something way more dangerous in this \\"holster\\" than your PDA (that's particularly funny when you have a suit jacket on).The leather is okay (it's no Fossil though) and the padding is adequate.

So if you are getting the DVD of the series, don't get this.Also be warned that these two episodes or pilot movie has some serious problems with how they are formatted and it appears to be on purpose.

At times, it was really good! Sure, it wasn't the movies. But if you went into the TV show thinking that it was going to be the movies, then you deserve whatever disappointment you got. What Blade the TV Series did was take the world created in the movies and go into further details. The whole warring factions, the houses, the characters were really good! Sticky was a great Blade.

It looks great and there's so much quantity here and not always in the expected formats; For instance you can go bowling or play pool. Do not let the \\"return to Liberty City\\" statement scare you. This is not the liberty city we remember from GTA3 but a whole new much larger much better version of the same city (New York). The story mode is equally impressive as it sucks you right in to a life of an illegal alien fresh of the boat from Russia.Some elements that were present in GTA San Andreas are gone. You no longer have to work up the skills you need to play the game. Unlocking the other islands no longer seems like such a task because each is so huge. There is also an interesting \\"hide behind cover\\" mechanism which is very useful in gun battles (think gears of war).This is without a doubt the greatest game on the PS3 to date both in graphics and gameplay as well as the best in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"good value and open ended free play.","review":"This game has very good value and the play is done freely.

However after about 30 minutes into it I was completely bored and detached. Yes, there are some new innovations like dating girls, etc. but as a game it didn't make the experience any more compelling than San Andreas. Graphics are of course better but it doesn't change the fact that there is low replay value and a really gullible/lame protagonist. Why anyone would want to run around carjacking and shooting people with this awful character is beyond me. Save yourself the trouble and buy a better game."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've had nightmares that resembled this game","review":"Walking around a city full of people who are all the same person, react the same way, tons of buildings and stores but they're actually just cardboard sets.I cannot believe such an unfinished game was put out at such a high price on two new great high end gaming systems. Did they fire the people that worked on San Andreas? This game is empty and depressing to play, the characters are annoying morons, the controls and physics are AWFUL, the shooting is boring after 5 minutes and NOTHING HAPPENS IN THIS GAME AT ALL.I have about 13 hours playing time clocked and a good handful of missions completed and its THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER, its pitifully dull. I was really shocked at the lack of content and wish I bought something else. Speaking of such past being able to play PS1&2 games and MGS4 there isn't anything worth looking at on the PS3, should've gotten an Xbox360, or a Wii."},{"rating":"2","title":"GTA IV more REALISTIC than EVER","review":"The game is more realistic than ever. You can build relationships with the other characters. Date other women and even sleep with them. Compared to San Andreas though its not as fun nor as big.

I have been playing it for the past week, and it is just so god damn awesome. For less than thirty bucks this is really really cheap... I would honestly pay $150 for this as the only game I will need for ps3.*I do not recommend this game for minors however. Stuff happens in the game can really affect how you think in real life. Unless you are sure that your kid can control him/herself and know what's right or wrong, i wouldn't give them gta4 for xmas. It is rated M for mature for a reason.
