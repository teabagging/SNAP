I can shut my door when I go to the laundry room without worring that I may forget my key to get back in.

How misleading can you get ?Schlage and Amazon should note that this lock is NOT suitable for exterior applications.

It is much easier than fumbling for a key to get into the garage and it works reliably. Just a turn of the inside knob unlocks and locks the door handle for easy passthru if you are home and are working outdoors.

[...]This book is unequivocally unintelligible. I am not trying to say the writer's ability to convey a story is terrible, what I am trying to say, it is not in any comprehensible form that is able to keep the reader's attention. This book is written (purposely) in irregular English that has been1) translated from the original Japanese by a computer (as a Japanese to English translator, I know when a document has been translated by a machine, and this book clearly has been), and2) written with a mixture of the English language and HMTL markup language.These elements are confusing, making it extremely hard to follow any kind of story that may be hidden in the text.Yes, this may sound like an extremely interesting premise.

Other like-minded work include Mellik's Satanburger, Thacker's Hard_Code anthology, any of the Black Ice books, Noon's Cobralingus, etc. As a 'reader' you should be unsure whether you're reading meaningful prose or just data, and indeed wondering what the difference is between them. Plus, Siratori's own context adds the layer of Japanese high-tech with the cultural stereotype of broken English.

If you are a fan of their first album, this one will make you sick. Before I bought it, I hadn't heard any tracks off of it, but I figured, since it was Flaw, it was going to be good. Wrong. I took it back the next day (Sold it back to Record Connection). Anyone who gives this more than 3 stars has obviously not heard Flaw's first album, or they would be pissed at this album as well.Apparently, though, the lead singer from Flaw (not sure if it's the lead singer) Made a different band called five.bolt.main ...

The guy has a horrible voice and it's only good when he yells, which is maybe in 2 songs on this cd, both of which fall apart after the heavy point.

It was aggressive yet haunting and very poetic. This album is basically a huge letdown. I waited patiently for this album thinking it was going to be just as amazing if not more than their first.

However what is left isn't as bad as these clowns with no appreciation for softer music say. Flaw is a great band and the softer direction works much better with the voice. I thought their better songs were the softer ones off their first disc anyway. As a person who likes many types of music I think it's great. If you are a Heavy music listener only Avoid this disc like that two teethed trainwreck you picked up at the bar last night. Only buy this if you like softer rock.

In fact, many of them were right behind his ears, and he would actually scratch around the collar where the fleas were biting him. Also, there is a lot of white dust on the collar when you get it.

Second, it has a fast pace and never lingers on one subject for very long. The author throws in twists when you are not expecting them.

No post-production of any kind was used; it is more or less live music). The more familiar these tunes become, the more I grow to love them.

Now anyone who gives dogs a bone, they want to knaw and eat it, it's just natural.Imagine swallowing something like that.....they sit and hack and yack their brains out trying to get it down their throat or out. After the 4th time I ended up just throwing the bone out. Got sick of watching my male hacking his brains out trying to clear the piece.So even though it's really nearly indestructible, it's also not very safe for very large powerful dogs.

You always want to be careful with dogs who can chew endlessly since you don't want any pieces to be ingested, etc.This nylabone has been and still is working perfectly for these two. Both enjoy playing with it and it can serve as a keep away toy from the other dog and after there is a winner, it can withstand the ensuing gnawing. So after 6 weeks of being their only toy, it is still very much intact and has much more life in it AND the dogs still show interest in it.

But, if the dog loved it, and it lasted as long as the reviews claimed, it would be well worth it.The nylabone arrived... I gave it to my dog... and she was not interested. AT ALL. She is a doberman, and a big chewer. She loves all types of rawhides and bones, she will gnaw on them all day until there is only a slobbery stub remaining. Maybe this was too expensive for her tastes...? I thought maybe if I gave it some time, she would decide she really DOES like the nylabone, and all would be right with the world... After about a week and a half of trying to get her to see things my way, we have decided that no, she really does not like it at all...Before you spend all the money on this bone, you might want to start with a smaller nylabone product to see if your dog will like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily destroyed","review":"We have a 52 lbs Boxer who had done serious damage to this on the same night he recieved it. 2 days later with other bones/toys to play with the bone was nearly unsafe to continue to give him.

The reason for this being that its designers has ensured that it does not contain any DVD authoring accessory.Although that its video-effects commands, as well as superimposing menu are really impressive, its overall cons simply outweighed its pros.Know that this software would have been wonderful, had Adobe not deliberately limited both its capabilities and compatibilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the Price","review":"This is a very complex interface...not for anyone less then a Professional.

I wouldn't recommend one of these to bring a fully discharged battery back to life since the charging output is so low, I'd use a regular battery charger instead. But these units are great for their designed purpose and that is to \\"maintain\\" a battery during periods of inactivity. I've had no problems with any of my 4 units.

Assuming it was the battery and to give the charger the beneift of doubt, the charger was again used only to return to a battery with a very low charge that could not start the vehicle had to be charged with a full service Die Hard charger. Once fully charged, no issue with starting the vehicle - so no other issues.

Kelly, spent ten years researching the personal and professional characteristics of star performers.If you want to do more than just succeed at work, this is the book for you! It's full of vitally information on how to reach beyond your skills at work. About ten to fifteen percent of all people will out perform their peers by a wide margin and rise above to the star ranks. How to be a Star at Work tells us how to be our own star and to be able to outshine everyone else, no matter who you are. This book has nine strategies to getting ahead, but don't think you can muddle through with a few pointers; you need to read the entire book to be able to realize how everything works and fits together. It's worth the time and effort! Remember stars are made not born.I found this to be a helpful, informative, simplistic read. It's very well written and the fact that the author spent so much time 'in the trenches' is apparent, he knows what he is talking about. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical. Solid Examples. Useful.","review":"Kelley offers a very practical guide to success in workplace with many excellent examples of the model behavior. Quite impressive for an academic!

His lessions are those that are hard won from years of work place environment for most of us. When taking care of the boss, your employees, and customers doesn't give you what you need, want, and expcet from your employeer, you need a new approach. Kelly provides this in clear and concise terms for even the average reader. I attended a lecture in new business trends to make yourself a success in the work place and Kelly's book was one of the top ten mentioned as well as the new behavior modification software, Neurosync. I'm glad I bought both. I have reread Kelly's book three times and make a practice of applying the lessions. Even though I'm considered a great business success, I'm always looking for new ideas and methods to apply.

His audience was a small group of HR managers and Training consultants. He provided us with a no nonsense, credible approach to coaching managers and leaders. The title of his presentation was quite true to that title, providing us with a clear vision of the state of the art and insights into the state of the practice.David and Mary Dee's book, Leader as Coach, is the foundation for one of the clearest and most well-reasoned approaches to Coaching I have seen after a decade in this business.

Some of it's ideas would also be applicable for one-on-one coaching.The book centers around the FIRST acronym. Focus on Priorities, Impliment something every day, Reflect on what happens, Seek feedback and support, and Transfer to the next steps. Each letter of the acronym is then given a \\"Strategy\\" which amounts more or less to a chapter.The book is very good quality and also is spattered with a variety of usable quotes readers are sure to enjoy. The book would have benefited from further development of each strategy, but what is here is the basis for developing a plan of your own.

However, it is wider than an ordinary computer desk and with the hutch it holds a lot of components. The natural finish is very attractive. I would recommend this desk for any room that has limited space. The only drawback is the directions for putting it together are very unclear. There are no words to explain, just incomplete drawings and hand lettering of parts. There is no way to really tell which side any wood part of the desk should face. Assembling Step 1 took forever to figure out. But once I did that, the rest went faster. But a few times, I had a part in wrong and had to correct it.

I would say that only one fifth of this book is actually about Diamond Jim Brady. Everything else is about a particular time, a certain person, or happening. I wanted to read about the person and life of Diamond Jim Brady and I guess he just didn't have that interesting of a life to warrant a book about him. I was not interested in reading about all the things going on during the period he lived. And it also drove me crazy that Jeffers would always refer to him as James Buchanan Brady. I've never read a bio where the author is always referring to the subject by their full name. I found this extremely irritating.

No other writer even comes close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grrrrreat!","review":"This book is great and Judy Blume should write adult novels more often.

It's also a book about second chances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid Book","review":"I also had read her original book - \\"Margaret\\". I was extremely disappointed in this book. It is one of the few books I have not finished reading. It was just simply common trash in my estimation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Smart Women","review":"The title \\"Smart Women\\" is a falsehood. While the women in the book may have been smart in the business sense, they displayed absolutely no intelligence in the choices they made in their personal lives. I am disheartened to find a book titled \\"Smart Women\\" depicting divorced women as dependent and self-absorbed, placing their own needs above responsibilities as role models in the raising of children. The children seemed to have more maturity and insight than the women in the book. This was the first Judy Blume book I have read, and it will be the last. Many women of divorce exhibit much more maturity and intellect than those depicted in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid Women!","review":"The title of this book is all wrong. Rather than make the women in this book appear smart, Judy Blume has done an excellent job of making the women weak and stupid.Why must Margo's self esteem be associated with having a man in her life? And to allow her friend's ex-husband move in with her? Is there no honor among women? Oh, but, she justifies it by saying that \\"he makes her feel good\\".B.B. has a nervous breakdown - more like post-traumatic stress disorder, but not before she marries a dude old enough to be her kid's Grandpa. (She can't stand to be alone!)Claire takes back the jerk who left her for a fling with another women. And he still doesn't seem very sincere about being with her.Can't these women see that their children should come first? Second should be their own self-dependence. Take care of the children and then make a stable home life before you start trolling around for a man.These women are not Smart Women, they are just plain S-T-U-P-I-D!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If these are smart women...","review":"If these women are what Judy Blume considers smart, I'd hate to see her idea of stupid women. Like many others here have pointed out, the women are vapid, make stupid decisions, and base their worth on the man in their lives.

Otherwise skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A kid's idol, and adult's letdown","review":"I wondered why there were 8 copies of this book at the used bookstore. As soon as I read it, though, I knew, becuase mine went right back there to be traded in for something good.Blume tried too hard with this book. I understand that in some cases, things like mothers turning abusive and going insane do occur, but the book didn't seem to capture my sympathies for the characters. I didn't care if the family got along, if the couple wound up together, I just wanted the book to be over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not care for the book","review":"I did not care for this book. Having read a lot of Judy Blume, I had high hopes and this was a failure for me. I did not like the character's and I was bored with the storyline a few pages in. I did not finish the book.

Let me put it this way; say the world wide whine scale is 0 - 10, 10 being OMG whiney. Well this book is verging on 12.A few years ago I promised myself, no matter how awful a book, never to throw it away in the middle, or anywhere else. But this one was like pulling teeth from it's roots without novacaine.In one of the chapters there's a statement, \\"... what an intensely ridiculous mess ...\\" That pretty much sums up Judy Blume's Smart Women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pick up another Blume with better women in it","review":"I am a huge Judy Blume fan, especially of Summer Sisters. This work doesn't compare to what Blume is capable of. I found myself just finishing it because I had already invested time in the beginning. I didn't connect with any of the characters, and I found myself feeling as if I had walked in at the end of the story because no time was spent developing the characters. The subject of love was very 2-dimensional in this book...this is no Wifey or Forever. Pick up something else by Blume instead of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"It was a little hard to follow in the beginning but once I got into the book I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Blume's Finest Novels","review":"Although I enjoyed Summer Sisters, I was completely disappointed in this particular book by Ms. Blume. All the characters were disfunctional and not very appealing. If you must read this book, save your money and check it out from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if You're Bored","review":"This is not a good book; it's rather boring, actually. Though one is supposed to feel immense sympathy for the protagonists, it is almost impossible to do. The characters are not likeable, at all. B.B. is too cruel, self-centered, and deluded; Margo cannot stand up for herself, even when her happiness could depend on it. That a mother would not lock her 15-year old daughter in the attic to stop her from having an affair with a grown man is laughable at best, morally skewed at worst. Read, \\"Wifey\\", Bloom's far superior adult novel. With this: read it only if you're a big fan of Judy Blume, can afford to waste money, and are bored out of your mind with everything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smart Women","review":"This book is so boring. I read Wifey first and just loved it. fast and exciting. So I got Smart Women next. What a waste of money.I had to force myself to finish it.Come on Judy, we want the spicey stuff like \\"Wifey\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better...","review":"After getting over my distress from reading Wifey, which creeped me out more than any other book ever, this helped me feel more sane again. This book was much better than Wifey in my opinion. It's fast moving and the characters are well developed and the story seems realistic. There's no second guessing as to whether the story could possible occur. You can accept what is written at face value."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Page Turner","review":"I am only 14 years old and I totally understood this book. It was such a page turner. The relationship between all of these women is fanominal and I would request this book to anyone over the age of 12 or 13. The way that the whole book is from different women's perspectives was kind of confusing but it all came together in the end. This is one of the best books and I am looking forward to reading \\"Wifey\\" and \\"Forever\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Writer, Bad Story","review":"I have been huge fan of Judy Blume ever since the second grade (that makes it about 21 years). However, this is not one of her better books. Blume is an excellent writer, but there's really no story to tell here. I almost got the impression that she was making this up as she went along. This book does not do justice to Blume's true talents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smart Women","review":"After reading Summer Sisters I expected this book to be as good because I fel in love with Summer Sisters, however it wasn't as good. It was a bit long and dragged on. Although not horrible its not one of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"The name of this book should be Women Who Are NOT Smart.

His brothers are mean to him. He thinks the only way of getting over all of this is by joining a gang. The only problem is that Manny doesn't know if that is what he wants to do. He doesn't know if he wants to get into that kind of life. If you want to know what happens to Manny you should read this book. I really enjoyed this book because the author really gets into detail about how gangs really are and how they steal and kill. He goes into detail about all the hardships Manny goes through, you can really feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Parrot in the Oven","review":"Parrot in the Oven was a good book to read. It was a growing up tale of a young Mexican boy going through many different situations. Manny the main charater in the book was talking about his life and the things he went through. Manny talks about his experiences through his childhood. It was a good read because it was a book that you could relate to. This book deals with some of the situations many Mexican kids go through in the United States. Manny talks about what he should be doing with his life and why he should do it. Manny is a young boy that dose not have too much confedence, but then starts to gain it up in the book. He understands what kind of person he should be in life, because he knows what other kind of person he could be and he dose not like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parrot In the Oven","review":"To me i thought this book was great for the six weeks i read in my English class . when i read this book first i was like i don't think i will like it at all but i did ya there was boring chapters but there was a couple of main chapters that i like the most there was one that the mom wanted him to transfer schools but for some reason it couldn't happen. So he never transfer schools not only that but transfering schools is not that good because you have to start all over again. Then there was a other chapter that i thought was good when the dad goes crazy because he's drunk and he has a gun but he is looking for the bullets and he finds them and they are in the ladys dresser.She's not home shes getting her hair done . So she doesn't know .

This book, though it has rich characters and relationships, lacks the most important aspect of a novel: a plot. Victor Martinez fails to set out a definitive goal for the main character, and rather writes with \\"train of thought.\\" The entire book is a jumble of situations the main character encounters that don't revolve around a central goal or conflict. Besides using unoriginal and sterotypical Mexican names such as \\"Hernandez\\" and \\"Garcia,\\" the author writes with an overused and overly metaphorical style which doesn't pull the reader in until the last 15 pages or so.

Conservatives do in fact have some good ideas, but they are not well-served by spite-filled \\"allies\\" like cartoonist Tinsley.Maybe if he'd take a hiatus from the concept side of the cartoon and let Dennis Miller do the writing... naah, I doubt Tinsley's smart enough to consider the idea..."},{"rating":"1","title":"We should change the American symbol from the Bald Eagle to the Lame Duck","review":"Mallard Fillmore is an embarrassingly excrementitious example of so-called Conservative humor.

This DVD seemed like the perfect way to do it.This is a low quality copy of the reunion television show from the seventies. The show included all of the members of the trio throughout the years along with Tommy Smothers as host and Mary Travers (from Peter Paul & Mary) as guest. It did not have nearly enough Trio music for my tastes and when it was over, I had lost my interest in seeing the modern version of the group.I think true Kingston Trio fans will be disappointed that it does not include the kind of lively performance I saw in the 60s and is missing many of the songs we've known them for. I probably expected too much, but will keep looking for a video that delivers the true Kingston Trio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD has FULL concert","review":"After reading the other reviews of the TAPE of this program, it is great to report that all the things that they complained about being left out are on the DVD - \\"Chilly Winds\\" and the comments between songs.

Bob Shane is the glue of the Trio and what has kept it going through the years and he is GREAT on the DVD.

I had to call Harbinger myself and was told they dont cover normal wear and tear but i dont even know if u would call the little use i put on them normal (no other users).

The D rings are just ordinary quality and other materials will fray over time. Seams okey for now.BUT. Being a regular at the gym and home, you expect home equipment (which these are - they would NEVER be in a gym) to be this level of construction.The price matches the quality but I give 4 stars because they do the job.

The padded sling is comfortable and the large carabiners attach to all of the bars in the gym. I don't even bother with the locking mechanism on the carabiners. The ab straps are great.

How can you possibly mess this classic up?Among the other differences are a terrible screen and different sound effects than the original on touchdowns, field goals and safeties, which I can live with.The only thing I can think that caused Mattel to mess this up is cost.

My taste in music up to this point was rock from the 60's and 70's but lately I've been branching out and Mika is my new favorite.When I first listened to Grace Kelly, my first thought was \\"Freddie Mercury?\\" but as I listened on I realized that Mika had a whole different vocal range and he delves into places that other musicians hadn't gone into before.Hopefully Mika will come to the U.S. for his next tour!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy and Fun from beginning to end","review":"Mika's second album has taken the world by storm and its not difficult to hear why. He is extremely talented with a great song-writing ability and he also possesses a unique voice. Many people have compared him to the late Freddie Mercury in both voice and song-writing, which is a great compliment. I have enjoyed this album immensely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is Mika really Miss Piggy?","review":"Wow, where do I start? First off, the Scissor Sisters is one of my favorite bands, and I feel like Mika is blatantly ripping them off, but has far less skills than they do. His voice is so shrill and high-pitched it gets hard to listen to, and musically, I just can't find many interesting things about his music. But that is after hearing the Scissor Sisters. If you like Mika, be SURE to check them out!!!After a while, I actually start thinking it's Miss Piggy singing - if you own this CD, listen to it and you'll see!!! The song where he keeps repeating \\"Love me, love me\\" I always hear \\"Kermie, Kermie\\" Sorry, this is probably rude, and I'm sure many people disagree with me, but I can't stand this CD. It makes me want to kick my stereo in. If you value your electronics and don't want to kick them in in a panic-induced rage, then don't buy this CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This makes being Rickrolled seem like a pleasure","review":"I walked into a restaurant today and \\"Love Today\\" off this album was auto-playing on the jukebox. Ordinarily I don't pay much attention to jukeboxes, but this song is pretty hard to ignore. Sensing a Rickroll opportunity that was also a win for the audience, I put a hard-earned 50 cents into the jukebox and fired up \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\" by Rick Astley. Normally the first few notes of this are all that's needed to rile up an angry mob, but in this case after having been prepped by Mika they were really into it. That pretty much sums up how bad this song is, buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mika","review":"His voice is so annoying and high. I don't understand why he is getting talked about. This album is horrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Delicious!","review":"I hate it when people say that the lovely Mika resembles other past singers. To us Mika is himself and is his own person. We just saw him on Feb. 5th at the House of Blues in Chicago and were blown away. After months and months of listening to his cd and youtube videos, we were blown away by how flamboyent he puts on a show. He is one in a million and our favorite singer and person. We love him! And with Mika's words of the House of Blues, we'll say that his album is \\"Absolutely Delicious\\"!The Meyer TwinsHaley and Megan"},{"rating":"2","title":"The come back of 60s,70s,80s and modern days!","review":"i borrowed this cd actually from my girlfriend - was previewing it in her car- and i became instantly hooked on it when i listened to Lollipop :PAfter much exploration during these 2 days , i fell in love with him!He's a mix cross of The Beatles ( Billy Brown ), Beegees ( Relax - Take it easy) - thats what i thought...Somehow, i loved his song which is Lollipop, Love Today, Relax (Take It Easy) ,Billy Brown, Big Girl (You are beautiful) - which is the tribute to all plus size big girls like me :PMy super super favourite is Stuck in The Middle - the music - the lyrics, the piano - even though its just simple chords but its so bold!!OUtstanding!!Really loved this album. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"mika's music is diverse, rich and just rocks!","review":"first heard and seen grace kelly on mtv and this song reminded me of the theme song from sigmund and the sea monsters which i watched when i was a kid. it went: you better run you better hide we gotta keep you out of sight we care for sigmund... which is almost the same way grace kelly sounds.anyway bought mika's cd and been listening to it constantly."},{"rating":"2","title":"ORIGINAL, CREATIVE AND GOOD QUALITY MUSIC...","review":"After listening just one time to this album I can say it is one of the best albums I have ever heard.

Great songs and catchy beats...the bonus song is great...RING RING. Enjoy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Instant Sunshine","review":"How do I count the ways I love this cd? It's pure bubblegum at it's finest. It's just so much fun! I can't help feeling good as I listen to it. There are so many good tracks I just can't pick a favorite (although \\"Love Today\\" and \\"Any Other World\\" are high up there). To me it's a very joyful cd that is an instant pick-me-up for those ho-hum days. In other words, pure bliss!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mika is simply the best to have arrived in years...","review":"Mika's lyrics are beautiful, his voice is unbelievable, his style is unequalled. And to top it off he is charming and beautiful. I'm 52 and I've joined a fan club for the first time. My neighbors must be crazy given how many times I have played it from beginning to end. There is not a weak song on the whole CD. In addition it is less expensive than almost anyone else.There is simply no one like Mika."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grace Kelly and the Lollipop Girl Jive at the Butterfly Lounge","review":"Mika's Life in Cartoon Motion shows a signature use of Mika's fun vocal range. The music also delights the ears with a rhythmic blending of clever instrumental juxtapositions. Just enough candy for the soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catchy pop music","review":"I'd only heard one song from Mika before, very recently. Liked it, so listened to a few snippets and bought it. It's got a couple of irritating tunes, like \\"Lollipop,\\" but overall like it very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect pop","review":"I dismissed this at first because I thought it was too close in content and feel to the Scissor Sisters new release, which was equally bright and poppy, but ultimately disappointing. Mika however avoids the same pifalls of SS. The falsetto is soul-souring rather than annoying, the silly little pop-songs are actually more complex and have more staying power than initial listen would suggest. In short this is perfect pop. 'Grace Kelly' is the obvious knock-out, but there are strong followups in 'Love Today', the very Freddy Mercuryesque 'Big Girl' and my favourite 'Take It Easy'. The influences of Robby Williams, Queen and Scissor Sisters, (even a bit of George Michael on 'Happy Ending') are maybe too close for comfort, but Mika ultimately transcends these and soars into a stratosphere of his own. Play it now, and play it hard, before you hate it next year..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mika is Rockin my world big time.","review":"This is one of the most original, creative and musically gifted vocal CD's of its genre I have found in a very long time - I first tracked down the CD even before its US release and since then have bought over ten copies to share with friends! Everyone I have introduced Mika to loves the music! Mika is rockin my world right now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the total novice who has no musical training, nor vocal training","review":"Seriously disappointed in this book cd combo. I am a total novice singer. I have no musical training. From the description it seemed this would be good for the beginner as well as others. I had hoped this book and cd would help me grasp how to control my voice, how to sing in the proper key. Sadly, it doesn't explain things in a way that I, as a complete blank slate to learning about using my voice, can understand. If you have had any training in music or voice already, I bet this book would make sense to you. However, I think they're wrong in advertising that it is appropriate for the beginner. Don't waste your money and time on this one. Also, both the narrator and vocalists sounded way too hokey - even if I could understand what the book was trying to teach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Books Out There","review":"This will help you learn how to sing. It contains info on how to breathe, how to sing vowels clearly, etc. But the info it gives are all too short, sometimes only half a page on a subject.I'd suggestSinging for Dummiesinstead. It has a lot more information, lots more details, lots and lots more practice and it also comes with a CD that will warm-up your vocal cords and make it stronger.Why am I giving this book 2 stars instead of just 1? Because at least it contains some sheet music, like Scarborough Fair, etc.If you do get the other book instead of this one, you can always purchase your own sheet musicThe Best Broadway Songs Ever (The Best Ever Series)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharply written version of a great murder story","review":"Bocca was one of the first to commit the famous Sir Harry Oakes murder mystery to book form (this was first published in 1959), and it remains one of the most breezily written accounts of the 1943 slaying in Nassau, Bahamas. The former Daily Express writer tells the story in crisp, staccato style, catching the humid summer atmosphere of colonial Nassau brilliantly. Better books have been written about the case but this is a good one to begin with if you really want to immerse yourself in this ever-fascinating crime tale. The great thing about the Oakes murder mystery is that, 67 years on, it remains just that - a mystery. Exploring the many conflicting theories never loses its appeal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection of Munsch stories","review":"My son is only three and he love all of the Munsch stories in this book.

Okay, I love drama. It's not that bad, but it is better to learn things quickly with these guys. However, this DVD, is really short. You are better off to buy the 2 pack. It shaves about $5 or so off it. Remember this is Accounting. The humor, yes the last poster was right, is a little much, but it does help to remember some of the material. Though, I like their Algebra and Astronomy ones the best. There was a lot more content, even on the first tape. Otherwise, if wish to put a little humor in learning this stuff called Accounting, go for it. Don't buy them individually if you can though. Honestly, the Standard Deviants are a great way to review much material in short blips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Accounting 1 The Standard Deviants","review":"I am taking Accounting II this spring semester and bought this CD as a refresher of Accounting 1, which I took a few years ago. The material covered is relevant and informative and the narrators would have been sufficient to present the material.

I even spent the time listening to many of the sample tracks. I sprung for it - unfortuantely. The problem is the heavy programmed disco beat that permeates most of the non Kascade tracks. Boring and everything starts sounding similar as it all wilts under a too heavy hand. This is far fron Meigs' Naked Music so be forwarned.

Did they think that Basie didn't know their tunes!--and Benson was irrelevant. Good introduction of historic Basie photographs and informal before-the-show interviews. Standard, well-done, video recording of concert: Low-key, nothing fancy, no calling attention to itself. Carnegie Hall wasn't a topic.

Most people have yellow undertones to their skin which works well with self tanners, but I have very fair skin with pink undertones and most of them come out orange and uneven which is very obvious on my fair skin. I am sooooo impressed with the light brown color - it looks very natural, sunkissed, and glowy. I just stocked up!Also, I think it smelled nice - kind of like a light grapefruit scent. I'm not sure what offended the other reviewer unless she dislikes the smell of citrus or the way the product reacts to her body chemistry. Most of them smell bad when they react to the bacteria on your skin's surface, but that washes off in the shower in the morning when you wash with a good antibacterial soap (I use Dial)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loreal Sublime Glow for Fair Skin","review":"This is a great product and it gives my pasty white skin just the right amount of a light brown glow. It doesnt smell nearly as bad as Jergens Natural Glow, though it is a bit more expensive.

This book has been especially helpful in giving a clear, fresh understanding of the CMMI Project, its goals, architecture, and models.Especially valuable are the new sets of tools developed by the CMMI project along with the sections on how to use those tools to the best advantage. Here is where the book really shines: sound, clear advice based on the experience of organizations and software engineering professionals, passed on to the reader in readable language.The authors distill all this into a manageable 335 pages, filled with pithy examples, engineering humor, even poetry. Most importantly, it is as jargon-free as a book of its nature can be, written in clear, direct prose that will be appreciated by those who are trying to wrap their hands around the evolving CMMI enterprise.Highly recommended.

The author was very explicit and provided examples. He also stated in the Foreword that, though the book contained a great deal of excellent and useful information, if you tried to do everything in the book, you would fail.

My Victorinox Swisstool Spirit doesn't have a clip on it and I'm not one to carry a pouch on my belt just to carry my tool. I have to dress professional at work and having a tool clipped inside my pocket is a little more subtle in my opinion.It has a different feel than my Swiss but I can already see how amazing it will be. The Swiss is beautiful, well layed out, smooth, and shiny where the Leatherman Charge TTi just looks mean. The blades on the Leatherman are wicked and the best they offer.

Such a bummer. I also have a wave that I used every day for 4 years at the same job untill the charge tti came in the mail. I'm very unpleased to say the least. Considering paying 110$.Good thing is leatherman's customer service is excellent. Hopefully i will have a replacement soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product except for the sheath","review":"I received my Leatherman Charge TTi Multi-tool 2 days ago. I must say that I am impressed with the quality and workmanship of this product. It is just as what I imagined. It's cutting tools are very sharp and strong. The other tools are sturdy as well and look like they can do the job that they are supposed to do.However, I find the sheath that came along with the multi-tool a put-off. While the combination of leather and nylon blends well (with nice finishing), I find great difficulty in closing the sheath. It takes a lot of effort to close the button of the sheath. I don't know whether it is purposely designed in such a way or it is a flaw. The sheath is important as this multi-tool is a bit hefty to be in your pocket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leatherman 830684 Charge TTi","review":"Nice, well made product. Everything appeared fine except for scissors - somewhat flimsy due to insufficiently swaged pivot. Suggestion for Leatherman QA - a few more wall posters \\"Quality is job #1\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"8 lessons only","review":"One good quality of this book is that all the lessons are actually dialogues. Furthermore, each dialog has a complete English translation given on the facing page, making it easy to follow. Each dialog is followed by the basic vocabulary, though without pronunciation: the pronunciations, if at all necessary because of the standardized pronunciation rules that exist in the language, are only given within the \\"Useful phrases\\" sections.The book seems to be pretty heavy on grammar stuff (yeah, we know S/C has difficult grammar), being actually a good reference text. On the other hand, it is not so rich on conversation situations (8 lessons totally).All in all, I would recommend this book. I especially liked the language style used in dialogs (contemporary and colloquial, e.g., \\"Stvarno nema smisla\\"), with all the mistakes the native speakers would also make (e.g., \\"Imam PUNO stvari\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"In The Bag: Selling in the Salon","review":"This is a great book which gives invaluable, practical advice on increasing salon revenues.The book concentrates on increasing revenue through retail sales looking at salon design, layout, product, staffing, sales tips, objections, follow up etc.Carol Phillips really understands customer service, and makes you think about the whole client experience. At every stage she makes suggestions to improve your customer service to build customer loyalty and repeat sales. There is also advice on staff issues, marketing and other management issues.The book has been carefully structured and the chapter overviews and summaries are useful. It is also well indexed.

I enjoy them as much as the kids. These are the keeper books that I will hold onto dearly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great children's book!","review":"This is truly a great children's book. The language flows and the illustrations keep little readers interested in the goings on of Slinky Malinki.I'm so glad to have found it!

I will cherish this book long after my daughter grows up."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son's favorite","review":"I came across Slinky Malinki while in London about 10 years ago. As the proud owner of a very Slinky Malinki-like cat, I fell in love with it. When I was pregnant with my son, I HAD to buy it for his book collection. Now at 16 months, he absolutely loves it! He's fascinated by the illustrations and the rhythm of the book keeps him interested. We now have the whole series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Work of Fiction","review":"If it wasn't for the fact that I was a subject of the UNABOM investigation for 20 years this book would be extremely humorous. Almost every fact about the UNABOM case in this book is materially wrong down to the room in which the Dungeons and Dragons group convened. Anything in regards to Ms. Delong's participation are outright lies. (She did manage to quote me correctly, however). Thus, I cannot believe anything else she writes. It is my understanding that Ms. Delong was almost fired from the FBI because she would clock in and then leave to work at another job. She was also described as a 'worthless agent' by one of the better agents I had dealt with over the years. Please keep your hard earned money and do not encourage self-aggrandizing garbage like this. In 20 years of being investigated I discovered that there are FBI agents who actually care about the truth - Ms. Delong is not one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good book","review":"Candice Delong wrote a great book, but more than that she is a great person. I enjoyed everything I read, her style was entertaining, and her accounts of her life in the FBI were thrilling. She made the FBI seem real and amazing. I would love to follow in her foot steps, become a FBI Agent and write a book that is as good as this one!P.S. Candice, I just want to say that your book is an inspiration to me. It would be my honour if you would email me someday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money unless you want pure fiction","review":"This book should be listed under \\"fiction,\\" because that's what it is. Ms. DeLong is a legend in her mind and her mind only. Anyone who reads this and believes Ms. DeLong actually did the things she claimed to do is living in a dream, just like Ms. DeLong. Don't waste your money. Ms. DeLong is as much a real life Clarice Starling as Barney Fife is Elliot Ness. I would recommend the book if you are looking for a good laugh. I rated this garbage one star because I wasn't given the choice of zero or negative stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book on inner workings of FBI in a time of turmoil","review":"Candice DeLong is the sister to one of my best friend's fathers, and the Rosing Family is extremely talented. My interest level in this book was high and I was glad I read it and will reccommend it to many people. It's great for women who can understand the inner workings of what goes on in sex offenders' minds, how to avoid danger and problematic situations. It was also nice to hear how this one FBI Agent was able to excel while the FBI is certainly facing difficult times from an image standpoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful details about a powerful agency","review":"The author presents a riveting account of her experience with the world's most powerful law enforcement agency. Readers get a rare peek into the inner workings of the agency and the challenges that FBI special agents must overcome to carry out their important and exciting work."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed...","review":"In every chapter Ms. DeLong talks about all the evil white males that she is pursuing and working besides. A personality conflict with a boss is turned into a sexist hate campaign by Ms. DeLong. One of the reasons I bought this book was to read about the UNABOM case and instead we find out all she did was watch a bus stop. Then the reader is treated with her lover spats that she had with her FBI lover during her four month stake out of the bus stop.However, this book does go into the politics of government law enforcement and shows the black and white thinking that most government law enforcement agents have. Ms DeLong was not a model FBI agent and was forced into retirement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid story-telling with humor","review":"This isn't the best book I've ever read but it's a fun and interesting read about her career in the FBI. She wisely chose stories from her career (which must have been difficult with so many years of experience) and always included down-to-earth humor and humility when appropriate. When she entered, the FBI was still adjusting to having women agents but she remained strong, taking the high road on many occasions when she was not treated fairly. As a result, her career flourished and her life is a story worth hearing. She is truly a trailblazer. Just nobody call her Candy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read on an interesting subject","review":"This book was simply captivating, plus it reminded me how hard it was to be treated with respect in the early 80's as a working woman. Not that Special Agent DeLong whines about it at all - she merely states it like it was, and sometimes still is. The cases on which she worked were of such interest and variety that I couldn't put this book down. Even those with a passing interest in law enforcement would do well to read this book. Ms. DeLong is the kind of lady you'd like to have as a friend and a neighbor. She is a great example of a courageous single mom and working woman. This would be a great book for young women, late high school to college age, who are trying to figure out what they want to do professionally."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible profile of dedication and compassion","review":"Candice Delong tells it like it is. This book held me riveted and page turning. I could not put it down. Ms. Delong exemplifies a woman who is dedicated to justice and the right thing to do. At great personal expense Delong did her job. However, as a mother, she had her priorities clearly defined. Delong's son was her greatest priority. The part about the Unibomber wearing her son's coat touched me deeply. This lady is indeed a national hero. In all the turmoil that America is involved in, it is wonderful to read about a woman who has made a difference in so many lives. Courage, integrity, and ethics all apply to this amazing woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good P-Clamp","review":"Quality and fit very good, perfect for mounting extra horn to bike frame. I would buy this brand again very sturdy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent but not what you would expect from Kuryakyn","review":"Bought this clamp for a drink holder for my 1.5\\" handle bars, great option because there are no drink holders for 1.5\\" bars. Does not have the best in surface finish. The chrome will probably hold up fine as it looks well done but the polishing and buffing prior to the surface being chromed shows lack of quality and craftmanship. The hinge looks pretty decent as well but not the finish around the edges, photo looks like a pro item, not so impressive in person. At the end of the day I would still recommend this clamp, mainly because it is very fuctional and cruising down the road with your cold beverage you will not notice any problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent children'sbook at a value price","review":"I think this book is really great at such a great price.In fact, I am a busy mom that I don't even want to go to a bookstore. Even though I find Curious George series books at a bookstore(which usually cannot find them at every store in Southern California),they charge at an outrangous price. Plus my kids from ages 3-8 went crazy for this book. Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is a great LOOOOONG book.. 8 stories, and they are a little too long to keep my little guys attention, but in a couple months it will be perfect.

Painful.","review":"There are some books that you can read and reread, over and over again, and they never lose their freshness and fun. Then there are derivative books, written by committee seventy years after the original, that give you a funny feeling in the inside of the back of your neck when you read them, and make you want to go in through your eye sockets with a grapefruit spoon to scratch that feeling. Guess which type this is?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can that be fabric?","review":"Ever think that you'd like depart from traditional patchwork and make an art quilt that will make people gasp? Open this book. The quilts photographed in this book are amazing. And the idea seems so simple, once it's broken down for you in painstaking detail. You'll learn about selecting a collection of fabrics for kaleidoscope quilts, and how to look at them and create patterns for your own kaleidoscopes. No two need ever be alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not what I expected","review":"This is not what I expected at all. I love kaleidoscope quilts but this was not complete and it was not as pretty as I expected"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I thought I was getting a quilt book about gorgeous quilts;instead I received a book containing 12 folded & detachable sheets of gift wrap paper - no writing, instructions or templates. The book description and other reviewers do not mention this, leading me to believe that they were reviewing a companion book with the actual quilt information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad.","review":"The color is sort of a camel/tan/bordering slightly on mustard color. Not an olive/green khaki. The twill is nice and soft. The fit is as expected--not like a glove but about like most slip covers. We have two cushions on the bottom of the couch instead of just one, and after a couple years this slip cover got a rip in the line between the two cushions. But then again, the two kids were always jumping on it, so I can't say it's weak. We put a lot of wear and tear on it. Now we have a new cotton twill (more expensive) slip cover by a different company, given to us as a gift, and I think really the quality is about the same. If you want a good value on a cotton twill slip cover then go with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"returned sofa cover","review":"Liked the material, however, had to send it back. It's a guessing game when ordering, because even though we have a queen sized sofa, no measurements were provided in the ad. Sure enough, the cover was way too big for our standard size queen sofa."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too stiff","review":"This slip cover was really big for my 80\\" sofa and just too stiff. Seemed more like a burlap material than twill."},{"rating":"1","title":"thinner and darker than expected","review":"I ordered the khaki color and it was more of a camel color. Darker than expected. I was also hoping for a thicker, durable fabric (almost like a denim). But this fabric is thinner. It won't be as durable as I'd hoped.On the plus side, it is soft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, Top[ Quality Cane","review":"It's hard to find this kind of quality without searching forever and paying fortune. It's sad, but today most everything is made cheap and made to break and be replaced quickly, so the manufacturer can make money. But in an item that you rely on for safety as well as convenience, you want it made solid, and this cane is it. Nice job and thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly marked","review":"Fel-Pro usually has a great product. I am certain these seals would also carry the same quality. The only problem, but a major one, is that the set contains 16 seals and does not differentiate between the intake and exhaust. I had to buy a set from Acura to make sure everything worked ok. Not Amazons fault, but Fel-Pro's for not labeling correctly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Minor Latin Master","review":"I bought this CD because I love the Guarnieri Symphonies performed and recorded by the same team. I'd never heard of Mignone before.Imagine if Respighi had lived in Brazil. (Respighi did, in fact, write a Brazilian piece after touring there). The Italian-born Mignone wrote in a similar vein. He was a deft orchestrator, the music is bright and enjoyable, not rhythmically or harmonically complex but orchestrally very sophisticated. The notes claim an African influence in the music, but this is true only in a Hollywood sense; it's far from the essence of Africa heard in the music of Kevin Volans, for example. Still, Hollywood has its place, and this record is good fun. If you enjoy the Criolla Cantata by Antonio Estevez (recorded by Mata on the Dorian label) you'll adore Mignone's choral ballet Maracatu de Chico Rei.This CD is well played and brilliantly recorded, as you'd expect from a BIS production.

However, it is now one of my top 5 FAVORITES!! His voice is even better than before and he is still one of the most beautiful men I've ever laid my eyes on. I've since purchased several more of his compositions because of my renewed interest. I can't think of too many GV songs I don't like. The title track, \\"Canto\\" is beautiful, intense, and emotional. Its a shame that such a wonderful artist is so unappreciated in the United States. We could definately use more of his artistry in today's music world."},{"rating":"2","title":"CANTO is beautiful - every track exceptional - I love it","review":"The tracks in Gino Vannelli's CANTO are, each and every one, wonderful - heart wrenchingly beautiful. I cannot fully articulate how much I enjoy this CD. I've listened to, and loved, all of Gino Vannelli's albums / CDs / music / over the years. If you are expecting the same synthesized pop/rock/jazz that you liked (and I loved!) in his \\"Powerful People\\" album (which was co-produced by Herb Alpert) you may be disappointed by CANTO - which is more in the \\"Classical\\" music genre. I feel - enriched - each and every time I listen to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite album","review":"Love the album, Gino's voice is strong and the slection of the songs are great too.

What delayed musical highs.I've listened to Gino since his first album, like many here. Powerful People was a marker of my high school years, some 30 years ago.None of his previous albums beat this one. It's simply rich ectasy to hear.You'll find you like it on the first listen, picking out a few songs that seem pure joy. By the third listen you'll notice the whole cd is rapture. You'll be melting in joy at the beauty and peace that music can bring the soul when superbly performed, mixed and recorded.

Having seen him in concert twice, one in Toronto and once in Greece, his nearly 4 1/2 octave range has long been his mainstay. This album should push him over the top and his recognition which has been long overdue will finally reach the stars. His voice should be placed next to Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford, and inactuality, if they were ever looking for a person to surpass Crawford's performance as the Phantom, they should give it to Gino. As for the person who wanted to give his cd away, send it to me. There is always room for two cd's of the best performer to ever sing from his heart on my shelf.

Along with my own musical and psychological development, I have enjoyed watching and listening to his changes (and growth). My musical tastes have shifted over the years and I have liked some of his albums/CD's more than others.Now comes \\"Canto.\\" I am stunned. This music grows the backdrop that Pauper tried to be and \\"Yonder Tree\\" began to hint clearly at. The combination of his lyrical poetry, magnificent orchestrations, and a voice that has matured into the phenomenal produces a series of pieces that prods the listener to be careful, to relax, to dream, and to attend to the melodic intensity. *THIS* is a great work. Is it for everyone? No, of course not. But, then again, neither is Eminem's work . . .and his efforts will sell millions more without being 1 ml as musically deep as that found in \\"Canto.\\"If you read this, Gino Vanelli, congratulations on a tremendous result.

Great, if you're a female looking for love and longing for romance, but please Gino, return to the \\"Brother to Brother\\" days or \\"Storm at Sunup\\". This sleepy stuff kinda bores me.

Thank God there is no female Sergeant helping our Gourmet Detective in his investigation. The chauvinistic remarks linger on however, but they are not so overwhelming as in the other two previous mysteries.I loved the descriptions of life in Provence, as well as the food and the wines, which for me are the best in the world. It wets my appetite every time I read about this sumptuous food.The ending is quite surprising and full of action. I was expecting to be just carried lightly through, but instead, is quite gripping and I definitely had to keep reading through the last chapters without stopping.Visit Provence and its vineyards. You'll encounter lots of intrigue, excellent food and high class people."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to make Provence dull","review":"I wish I'd read the customer reviews of \\"Gourmet Detective\\": if I had, I might have thought twice about buying -- and reading -- \\"Dying on the Vine.\\" The good thing is, the book's so thin on plot and characterization, it takes very little time to get through it. Unfortunately, it's time you could spend on a better read. Besides the typos (which increase toward the end, as if the proofreader became too bored to bother reading it carefully), the book consists of a flat narrative, pale characterizations, awkward dialog and, perhaps oddest of all, lifeless action scenes. Can it be possible to write a story set in Provence and make it dull? While Peter Mayle (the reigning king of Provence-writing) may have thin plots and a feather-weight style, at the very least he's entertaining, something I can't say about Peter King."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passive Splitter","review":"Passive splitter for structured wiring panel.

I have wondered since I was a kid how Jewish people protect themselves from vampires. What a great story. The best stories, IMHO, were the novellas at the end, \\"Midnight Mass,\\" \\"Yellow Fog,\\" and, \\"Red Reign.\\" There are shorter stories that are great, but the novellas made the book for me. There were only two stories that didn't interest me and I skipped.

I do not think the section on the building of pipes would be practical to most hobbyists, but the information on the building of the chests, framework, tracker action, and cabinet is fantastic.

These themes, expressed by numerous characters, are so repetitive that I finally just gave up and skipped to the end - which I personally did not find redeeming.

Basically, Gob Woodhull, fictional son of the real Victoria Woodhull, an early feminist, tries to bring back his dead brother, who died at 11 in war. The prose in this book usually borders on ridicious. I mean, really, did anybody really see an eleven year old as a proper solider? Anyway, Gob and a cast of other characters build a weird machine, bring a weird boy named Pickie to life. Then Pickie helps to build a large weird machine, and they use that to bring Tomo back.

Great conductors like Karajan and Bernstein can apply broad and slow tempi and yet manage to sustain the listener's interest. Barenboim is not in their class. This is such a plodding take on this great symphony it made me regret that I will never recover that hour of my time spent listening. For the first time, I was bored by Bruckner's Fourth!

With the iMac mouse, the mouse does not need to be flat on the surface for the tracking to still work - with the Kensington, if the mouse is even slightly off the surface on one edge, there's a good chance the tracking will stop. The power does not stay charged as long as it should. I have a wireless mouse at work that can go months on standard AA batteries.

My advice to him would be \\"Try a song or two out before you go all out and do an entire album in a new style like this.\\" I bought this album blindly at a record store, expecting much from this young, talented man.

I also couldn't wait to see what would happen with John Brandermill! (You'll have to read it to see what I mean!) If you want to know what it was like in Chicago during the fire in 1971, read this because it was very real.

I do not know if this product works well with a cartridge style razor such as a Mach 3, but I can tell you that it clogged up my razor on the first stroke. I had to take my razor apart and clean it out before starting again with a different shaving cream.I realize from all of the 5 star reviews that most people are generally happy with this product, but I have noticed that the majority of the reviewers are women. Perhaps this product does a better job on the legs than the face. The reason I gave it one star is that it falsely claims to be shaving cream. It in no way resembles shaving cream at all, it has the consistency of Vaseline and does nothing to provide a smooth shave (for a safety razor at least). It does have a very pleasing scent, but that is all I can say for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Displeased","review":"My husband usually uses Kiss My Face cool mint shave cream (which he has used for 15 years)!

By selective use of quotes from writers of the first 5 centuries, he arrives at his fore-ordained goal. There is no attempt to help the reader understand how the writers of the first 5 centuries differed from the Judaizers Paul condemns in Galatians. There are no quotes relating the views of Augustine, Chrysostom, etc., on how baptism, communion, being a catechumen relate to their teaching on justification. This is not an objective view of the early professing Christians' teaching on justification, but a biased, selective collection of quotes chosen to force the reader to the author's predetermined ecumenical position."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please do not waste your money","review":"I have been an Amazon customer for more years than I care to count and until now I have NEVER returned a book! The prompts in this book (e.g., \\"Our family drives\\" \\"God and I talk when\\" \\"When I'm older I want to live\\") are in no way thought provoking and as a result do not elict any level of self-discovery. Most people, even children, already know what bugs them, or about their favorite holiday.Because this book is written for, in addition to children, adolescents and adults I certainly would have expected prompts that require the reader to really look within. If this is what you are looking to do, this is not the book for you.As a psychotherapist, I purchased it for my patients but had even hoped I would personally enjoy a few of the chapters but needless to say this was not the case.One might use this book to learn more about the person responding to the prompts, but the reader is unlikely to discover anything new about him or herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"fancy feet review","review":"I thought this book was pretty good.

This warmer needs to be plugged in to stay warm and when unplugged does not stay warm for long.

He's 8 months old now and has gotten better with them, but this really would have come in handy then!! I'm currently pregnant with my second (a baby girl!), and I know she will appreciate having warm wipes as well. Unlike other warmers I've looked into, this one does not need pillows.

After we put it in the warmer she didn't scream, so I think it was actually soothing to her to have her butt wiped when the wipe was warm. The only problem is, is that the case is pretty heavy to carry in a diaper bag. It does it's job well though, keeps em' warm. It works in the car too which is good bc we take a lot of road trips out of state.

There are a few awesome tracks on this CD that make it worth owning: Walking On the Milky Way of course is an excellent song, the Black Sea and Too Late are both great ballady tunes, and The Boy From the Chemist is Here to See You is one of the best songs OMD ever did. The rest of the songs are not really that memorable or exciting--average OMD tunes which are by no means bad, but nothing revolutionary. If you are a fan of McCluskey's solo outings as OMD, then you will probably like this, it's like a combination of Sugar Tax and Liberator.

This CD, however, is just downright awful. Aside from *VERY* choice cuts, the whole album just reeks of formulated pop crap. Walking on the Milky Way and Too Late are the two standouts, the rest of the stuff leaves you wondering if Sting ended up joining the band or if Michael Bolton decided on creating a \\"hard edged\\" easy listening album. I was surprised to find the album was not going to be released in the states, but after obtaining an import copy and giving it a listen... it's not too hard to understand why.

While there is an obvious Pink Floyd influence here, it only adds to sustain the mood, to lift the songs high into the cold sky. \\"Emotional Winter\\" is both beautiful and saddening, while \\"Judgement\\" builds to a grand crescendo and ends abruptly, magnificently.

This, along with a usb DVD drive and 2 1/2\\" SSD allowed me to do away with the internal drive cage and mount a large, highly effective heatsink/fan on the cpu (Athlon 64 X2). Just a personal thing, but I also disconnected the blue LEDs behind the front panel. Why does everyone want to put blue lights on everything? Looks better to me without them. Makes a great HTPC or good just for general use as a compact machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOT! HOT! HOT! As in OVERHEAT!!","review":"Everything about the Cube is great... except for one very important, vital, and absolutely necessary thing - Cooling. This box runs very hot, very quickly. That's because of two issues: poor venting and a cramped interior where the DVD drive sits right on top of the cpu fan. A bigger cpu fan won't work because the space won't allow it. Cranking the fan speed to max only help slightly. Installed extra fan, but didn't help. CPU temp at 40c after about 30 mins and keeps going up. If ever there is a case that needs side and back venting, lots of it, this is it. But the only opening is a small area at the top of the case where the airflow is blocked by the DVD drive. I run a dual-core E2180, I'm sure an older CPU would not generate as much heat, but what's the point? On the plus side, the Cube can double as a heater if you run it long enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its not that great.","review":"I have owned this cassette player for 3 months now. For the price , it is decent if you also believe the short durability of all cassette players. MY rants: 1. Biggest complaint is that mega bass is more like puny bass. Liked my old Panasonic better. 2. The power button on the front easily turns on by accidental contact. Unless you pull out the batteries after every use, expect to waste alot of $ on batteries. 3. Although it hasn't broken for me YET, the battery door is cheap and looks very breakable; esp in light of pulling out batteries when not in use. 4. For some reason, my cassette player keeps shuttling forward to reverse playback when it is cold. When it warms up, it resumes its normal function. Must be averse to cold.Rave: 1.Price. Besides I had to use my Xmas certificate from last year before it expired."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Worth it for the rare songs!\\"","review":"Even though this album contains familiar songs on 1980's collection CD's like Chris DeBurgh's \\"Lady In Red\\" and Starship's \\"Sara\\", it does contain rare ones. One is \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\" by Rick Astley. What a voice! Other great rarities are \\"Just As I Am\\" from Air Supply and \\"Never Take Us Apart\\" from INXS. Also included on this collaboration is \\"I Just Died in Your Arms Tonight\\", and who can reject that! The rariest bonus is Sheila E.'s \\"A Love Bizarre\\", written by Prince and Sheila. Even though this is the single version, it is still worth it. This song is rarely on 1980's collections, while the album it came from, Sheila E.'s \\"Romance 1600\\" is out of print in the U.S. A reasonable price for rarities. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good 80s but.....","review":"I thought this was a good compilation album but focuses a little too much on the uptempo songs and not enough of the slow, love ballads, it does contain some songs that rarely appears on 80s compilation albums like Foreigner's \\"I Don't Want To Live Without You\\", Mr Mister's \\"Is It Love\\" and Crystal Gayle's \\"Making Up For Lost Time\\", overall a good compilation album for those who likes good 80s love songs and wants something a little out of the ordinary."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this CD!","review":"This is a great CD which has 20 songs on it!

I am a very experienced cook, and I like the way the book has all the basic information presented, the table of equivalents, measures, that kind of stuff. It has some very good information for beginners in general, too, such as very basic instructions. That being said, having looked at most of the recipes, I don't think that they are that appetizing.

The orchestra plays with wit and taste, which is almost a given when they are conducted by Hugh Wolf. If you love Christmas music sung by a lower male voice, then this album is a must. Does anyone know if Erich Kunz's marvelous carols album is available yet on CD? For anyone who likes Thomas Hampson, Erich Kunz should be tried. His voice is similar to Hampson's voice and his affection for the music shines through. Hampson's vocals are clean and well-focused.

Thankfully, it doesn't taste like soybeans (nothing against them but that isnt' what I think of when I'm craving the old peanut-butter!) Also, even though it's a \\"natural\\" product, we've only noticed quite a bit of seperation in just one jar. All the others (we buy these in packs of 6) are perfectly blended and stay that way. I've also used it in desserts and made some soybutter cups (think of the peanut-butter cups you can buy) using nothing but real chocolate and this soybutter and they turn out amazing!

Tried this for lack of any other available soy butter locally, and I am impressed. The taste is one the best soy butters I've had, the price is competitive, and the separation factor is not so bad that it requires constant restirring like some soy butters.NOTE: Those who are critical of the taste of any brand of soy butter and were duped into thinking the product is a \\"substitute\\" for peanut butter need to change their perspective.

At least I could inflate my tires, for what that's worth.Note: this is a follow up on the above review.

But to *ME*, the book simply did not deliver.The book is chock-full of information but the style of writing, organization or presentation render it useless, and it's a very boring read to boot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Root Vegetable!!!","review":"I was intrigued by the title of this book, but my interest dwindledonce I actually opened it and began to peruse the chapters. In myopinion, the author's motivations are correct, but he fails to offerany new insights/perspectives on the braod topics that haven't alreadybeen beat to death by every other hot-shot litigator fresh out of somestarched-collar university.Don't get me wrong, there are some very interesting sections of thebook--woth taking a look at if you are truly interested in the topic,however, as a whole, the book can't seem to break it's myopic approachto persuasion--and that isn't very convincing.I think the cover should be re-drawn to include a radish on astring---it is still a root vegetable, but unlike the carrot, no oneever eats them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Remedial Rhetoric","review":"I enjoyed the book so much that I signed up to received regular emails illustrating \\"figures\\" of speech, as they are used popular media. Jay Heinrichs presents the fundamentals of rhetorics in an unpretentious and transparent manner. A lot of information is presented, and I have come to regret, like Heinrichs, that rhetoric is not taught in schools. I would have benefited from having learned these concepts in grade school. Having been persuaded the power of these techniques, I did get a little bored with the ending, where he makes a case that a rhetorically-trained society would be a more democratic one. While I enjoyed the book tremendously, I didn't give it a \\"5\\" because I felt the production of the book was poor. I had to send back my first one because it was defective (missing 30 pages), and the layout of the pages looks like it was done by a high-schooler. Also, I thought the conclusion a bit anticlimactic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too simplistic","review":"I thought this book would be something really interesting to read, and provide more stimulus for inspiration and deeper thinking. After reading the Kindle sample, I was really disappointed with how it seemed to really simplify things down to just tricks you can use to win arguments (even though the author specifically says that arguments should not be about winning). Not really worth my time, and in my opinion only mildly useful even in business situations. It also had a tone of promoting a disingenuous attitude towards confrontation, which I whole heartedly do not believe is a good long term way to build respect and lasting relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from AT&T!","review":"I will never go back to AT&T.

If you already know and love them as I do, then you certainly won't be disappointed. This has some great tracks. I only wish it was a bit longer with some more pronounced bagpipes (cuz that's the best part) or I'd have given it a 5. The studio production with help from Fat Mike (NOFX) and some backing vocals by Spike Slawson (Swingin' Utters) provide for a more polished product.If you're new to this band but love Flogging Molly, Dropkick Murphy's, and the Swingin' Utters, BUY THIS NOW...and go back and buy their first two if you can find them!!

Volume 3 contains some of my favorite episodes that I remember when I was a kid in the 90's. The episode titled Nightcrawler is incredibly well done and introduces one of the X-mens most popular characters (even though I feel he should have been introduced earlier and had more episodes where he appeared). With that being said, all of the episodes are fun and enjoyable to watch, even the Morlock Little X-mas episode which is incredibly corny. Face it, if you're a fan of the X-men series in the 90's you're gonna want to have the entire collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"X-Men Series","review":"Very little of this series was anything like the comics at the time. The voices fit the characters very well with a few excetions... some accents were just PAINFULL!The stories were VERY good... all my favorite characters were shown, even if they were guest stars. They got the ages correct (unlike the current X-Men programs).. I have been EAGERLY waiting for them to complete this series on DVD!

See, during X-men run, they had alot of prduction problems, animation etc. So some episodes were airing in random order. So when it comes time to release the dvd volumes 3 & 4 they just slap the episodes on dvd (with great art work btw) and ship it to retailers. Disney could have taken 30 minutes out of their day and given us proper episode order of this marvel classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memories!","review":"I remember watching X-Men all the time with my older brother!

This was a great volume an also a definite 4 stars. This volume, however, had greater storylines & short-comings. The Dark Phoenix Saga was both a huge triumph & an over dramatic short-coming. This saga had one of the most powerful creatures in Marvel history as well as X-men history, key battles between the X-men & Shiiar SF, but the drama took away from all of that probably because it is hard to make an animation as good as a comic. This volume did succeed in the Weapon X project & Apocalypse shorts with their only draw back being they were too short. Great overall volume with much more to offer than my current remarks but I rather leave some for the purchaser."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show","review":"Love the show, it was the end of adult cartoon shows which makes me upset.

But even with the large bottles we never refrigerated it. Maybe some little loss from evaporation but no problem. I don't notice any taste loss as some say.

It is redundant, condecending, and very poorly edited.Duarte's explanations of scientific/ medical concepts are painfully dumbed down.

If you are into technical analysis, you may derive some use from the text. However, I don't see why you need a book devoted to biotech for investing on this basis.There's a weak chapter on the science (high school level at a stretch); a discussion on investment basics which misses the mark. The markets chapter is fine, but the review of major drug companies is weak. I just found the analysis of the biotech industry to be too weak. There's simply too little analysis and too much opinion.I have no idea why there's a discussion on mutual funds. Unless the particular vehicle is a sector fund, the manager won't start investing in biotech until the price has appreciated. By then, it's too late.The MD and CNBC credentials lead me to believe that this book would provide some dynamic insight or a systematic way for cutting through they hype. Sadly, it did neither."},{"rating":"2","title":"homework for Evolutionists","review":"This book contains most of the arguments which Duane Gish used in his debates for the next 20 years. As early as 1973, he started his notorious quote-mining operation, his ad hominem attacks on the Piltdown Man and the Nebraska Man, his exposure of the Haeckel drawings, his misrepresention of the Cambrian explosion, and his confusion between evolution and abiogenesis.Sure enough, these arguments are important. This encompasses many of the favorite Creationist arguments.It seems, however, that he contains all of this information in his later books, but with a few details and a few updates added. In other words, he pretended to publish several books while really publishing several editions of the same book.If you want it all in the same place, you might prefer a more recent book by Duane Gish."},{"rating":"1","title":"It protects the bracket more than than the light.","review":"I used this on my PIAA 410 that is mounted on a grill guard.

It does have some good, basic descriptions or discussions about US coins and their history, but if you are looking for what to pay for that next coin purchase you make, I would caution against relying only on this \\"guide\\".When I purchased this book, I was most interested in reading the \\"Value Trends\\", but was disappointed to find little in that area that was helpful. The back cover in part reads: \\"It is the only book that gives you: (among several items) 'Price-performance graphs visually tracking a 12-year history of every series of US coins'.\\" No such graphs were in the edition I received.I would send the book back for a refund if it was worth my time.

The Rake is an excellent example. A Regency rake decides to stop the hard drinking that men of his class habitually indulge in--and finds it almost impossible in a time before alcoholism was understood. This unusual romance hero and the equally unexpected heroine, who holds down a man's job, inhabit a novel that is a definite keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Very Best","review":"The is a story of redemption. Reggie is the worst sort of rake. He drinks, gambles and uses people with no thought for their feelings. He is on a downward spiral with only two outcomes, death or resurrection. His cousin, the Earl, who has been funding his life style decides to give Reggie an estate and let him sink or swim. Reggie has a problem with alcohol, which at the time of this story is considered a weakness of character not a disease. Reggie is determined to make a better life. The story evolves with the struggle to be redemeed and in the process he falls for his steward. It is one of the best books I have read. Definitely a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"Don't be put off by the somewhat depressing central subject matter of this book (alcoholism). I was, and put off reading it until I'd run out of Putney's other excellent books. I'm sorry I left it for last - it is one of the best romances ever written. You can skip the book in this series that comes before it though (\\"The Diabolical Baron\\", which is a real \\"Regency\\" ie - a bit of a snooze). One does not require reading the other, first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very best of the best","review":"This book touched me so deeply. I had really started to tire of the average romance novel. But I knew within the first few pages that this book was going to be great.

If you have never read a romance novel, this one will get you hooked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great favorite!","review":"I was very pleased to see this wonderful novel reissued (in a slightly revised version). It remains my favorite Putney book, and I've read it more than once. A fascinating and charismatic hero, a smart and strong heroine, a sensitive and intelligent story which is nonetheless full of wit, and a lovely 18th century English countryside setting. What more could a reader want?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite possibly the best romance I've ever read","review":"I read The Rake and the Reformer for the first time back in 1992, and I was immediately caught up in the story. The hero and heroine are real people, not idealized models. They aren't perfect, and their world involves much more than their romantic entanglements. I've read it many times since then, and have given away my old copy only to replace it with this newer release of the same story. It's one of the few romances I can read repeatedly and never become impatient. It's one of the few that's stayed on my keeper shelf for nearly a decade."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!

In fact I doubt it was 28 or 36 months old because it was semi-hard, like a common swiss cheese, and had very little of the crystals that grow on it as it ages.The taste was ok, but nothing to jump up and down about, and certainly not worth what I paid for it.

It seems people either really like this book and ignore its glaring flaws or really dislike it and point out those flaws. I definitely side with the latter. Having minored in Women's Studies in college, I have to say I've never read anything so poorly conceived and executed (pun intended? perhaps). The author really murders her subject matter when she crams it into her idealized notion of what an \\"uppity woman\\" is. Who cares whether or not a woman is uppity? And why should we care who the author considers to be uppity? She's no scholar, that much is clear in her lack of a page of resources and/or choice to not refer the reader to a list of books for further reading.

Second, not all woman were from the mideival period, some were from the ancient times and others in the Elizabethan Era. Third, the author is almost insulting when she dumbs things down. I was put off by her writing technique and her attitude. I would have liked more facts and more insight about these \\"uppity\\" women. Even the title is insulting. Uppity insinuates that these were rich girls with nothing better to do than stick their noses in the air. I'm sorry, but if a woman is struggling to support her and her family, I would not call uppity unless I wanted to get punched.

It is, in the final analysis, proof that any book that purports to be about \\"strong\\" or \\"outrageous\\" women will immediately sell thousands of copies, regardless of the piffle between the covers, and is thus a triumph of marketing over everything. Probably best for teenaged girls who don't read much.

The Phillips I purchased sends better image quality than the Microsoft 6000 webcam, and my brother even commented on the better quality to me while speaking over webcam. I highly recommend this webcam for those wanting to try them out. It is the first I have ever owned, and I'm so happy with it, I'm thinking of buying my mother one just like it so we can webcam.There is one problem with it, the software it comes with.

I enjoyed it very much because Tim has always been one of my favorite comedians. It tells quite a few things in detail about his life, what he has done in the past, and how he is living today. I would recommend this book to people who like comedy and stories that include flashbacks.This is a very interesting, and I enjoyed it very much.

They are fine. But the show is pretty horrible so far. I will say this: I have not watched all of it yet. Just most of the first season and I really have struggles to push myself to watch further. The story has so many bad nuances in it, that it makes me think what kind of a person wrote this. Was he delusional, does he know anything about life and society. At least half of all the decisions the main characters make do not make sense (that fact that they are lost and cut off the rest of the world does not justify them). Anyway, I can see that a lot of people like this show here and will probably disagree with me. But this is my honest opinion. If I decide to watch further and somehow the show will change my mind, I will follow up. The problem is I kind of have no interest to watch it anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"lost the complete series","review":"We were completely disappointed with our purchase due to the fact that when we went watch it we received the wrong disk's.

Just watch the first season (the strongest, anyway) and the finale. The rest is just tons and tons of questions of things that Carlton Cuse & Damon Lindelof thought would be cool and then never bothered to answer. The list of open questions and plotholes after watching the finale is mind-numbing. So, avoid watching hundreds of hours of TV for nothing. First season + Finale will tell you all you need to know, and all they managed to tell us.What a disappointment this was, after all these years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strung Along","review":"I watched this show for six years expecting to get answers to all of the ridiculous questions raised during the run of the show, so when I saw the two and a half hour finale wind down to nothing with pretty much nothing explained, I was pissed. I never would have watched this show had I known the ending would be such a cop out. The writers string you along with strange things, hinting at explanations, but really they had no idea how to explain all of the nonsense that they wrote. A truly great show would have ended with a finale that is complete, makes sense, and makes you see things in a whole new light every time you rewatch the earlier episodes. This entire show was a gamble - a dare to see how far out on the ledge could they go without falling down or tripping over themselves. They failed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Content great, box stinks, literaly","review":"On nearly all accounts, the Lost Box Set does not disappoint.

I remember when I started to see commercials airing before the first season played on TV. I hardly thought twice about the show. Here I am more than 6 years later, and I am a die hard fan. This series gripped on to me and still won't let go after I watched the series in it's entirety twice. Every episode leaves you wanting more and more. I found it almost impossible to only watch one episode in a day. On to the review of the Blu-ray themselves: they are awesome. The first thing you notice is the menu screens of the disc. They look great! The show should only be watched in HD - standard definition does not do it justice. I found the Blu-rays to lag in just a couple spots throughout the entire set. I can't say enough about the quality of this show and Blu-ray set. Do yourself a favor and pick it up today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have","review":"Classic, that all you can say really. Say what you want about the ending, This was one of my favorite shows of all time. If you have never watched before just watch the first episode and try not to finsih the whole series.

Open the ankh and find somethig, read the piece of paper from the Black Rock and you\`ll know a little backstory and try to find out the purpose of the blue-light lantern (check the black side of one of the pieces)... and of course, there\`s the whole series and its extras to watch over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"I am a huge LOST fan and this set is perfect.

Well, that's not true. I watched the first five episodes of the first season, then gave up on it. This was largely because (a) each character was a modern drama archetype, (b) no character behaved believably, (c) the story was needlessly strung out, strung out only for the sake of making the serial draw people to watch the next episode. Really not much interesting here, just typical American tv junk. Some of the scenery is pretty, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"What you see is not what you get","review":"From the description and the photos, it looked like I would get all kinds of cool things with this.

The only way this show worked was by stringing it out over such a long period of time that you forget almost 75% of the things you hear over the seasons.This show had so much magic, character development, mystery, and epic battles that it was such a shame to end it the way it did.If you watch this show from beginning to end you will feel very let down by the ending. Not to say it isn't a good ending, but it's an ending of a SEASON not of a SERIES. This show left absolutely way too much unanswered.In the middle of Season 6 I ordered this set. After the show ended, I canceled my order. Why rewatch the entire show only to know it ends without answering all the things you wanted to know about?"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!","review":"This is a very cool set!

It's solid, packed with features and somewhere in there is one of the greatest television shows of all time. The island really shines on Blu-Ray, the perfect format for all that green. The one thing I'm disappointed about, is they're all region-free except for season 4 (and possibly season 3, I haven't checked those disks yet). So be warned, if you don't have a player that plays all regions, you'll miss out on much of season 4's greatness. Pretty annoyed since this wasn't written about at all on the product description."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost Complete Seasons 1-6 Blu-ray.","review":"I am confining my review to the Lost Complete Seasons 1-6 Blu-ray set. I'll leave comments regarding season six and the ending to others. Those are matters of personal likes and dislike.The biggest positive is that the blu-ray discs were well done, although I haven't had time to watch them all, as of yet. Nor have I had time to view the extras. The Senet game looks interesting. The white and black rocks are a nice touch, and the ankh isn't as bad as another review stated. The appearance and texture of the set is quite nice and you can tell a lot of thought went into it.That brings me to the biggest negative. The way the discs are packed is the worst I've seen since getting the complete West Wing set. These discs are far too valuable to be packaged in slide-in cardboard sleeves. What were they thinking? Having spent almost $200 on this set, I now have to spend another $25 for proper plastic cases. The one aspect of this set reduced my rating from 5 to 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really?","review":"Really? Are people just having a conniption fit on the show's finale, or the fact that there's a final box set when they purchased previous season sets?Well get over it. If you were dumb enough to buy any of the previous seasons and not wait until the end to buy the box set, who is at fault? The company whose business it is to make a profit or yours? Take responsibility for your own actions.Season six is available as a standalone product if you want it. Otherwise, if you were intelligent enough to have held out for this box set, it is a great memento of one of the greatest television shows of all time.

I think not. Studios should consider giving discounts for previously purchased seasons. I have already paid for the royalties and other rights of the 5 seasons and paying an extra 150 usd (Complete BR set price minus 6th season BR price) for a fancy box which will occupy extra space on my movie rack is illogical.

For those who have not seen it before, I strongly recommend it though it will not appeal to all. It is best to be watched with other friends who haven't seen it so you can share in your thoughts and theories over the course of the show. This show will be thoroughly missed and this set, complete with the entire series, great featurettes and commentaries, a lew of other extras, and some of the coolest packaging in a box set ever make it well worth the higher price point.

The last season is not very good at all. Not sure what happened to the writers on the last season but what a complete waste on some of the directions they took and how they tried to pull it off. Just doesn't work. They needed to focus more on the mythology and giving answers and less time on squirrel Claire. How they explained the whispers felt like a 6 year let down. Also, the last season needed more of Desmond! The series is worth it for the first 4 seasons alone though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible series end(ad season 6) makes the whole series horrible.","review":"YUP.

The finale even had a cork that was popped and put back in the island to keep evil in check.(im assuming it was a devil) Half of season 6 was filled with flash sideways that didnt mean a damn thing. The show really failed to deliver and was so ambiguous that theres no sense in ever watching it again. For those silly enough to purchase this over bloated dvd set that is filled with so many stupid gimmicks, I doubt you will ever pull it out more than once.

I was going to pre-order, but thank God I read the description to see what seasons were included (the Amazon \\"Customers who purchased this also purchased Lost: The Final Season\\" thing threw me off and concerned me).I realize companies want to double-dip, and I can accept that, but dont' advertise a \\"Complete Collection\\" without it actually being complete.

I would highly recommend this to those who love the show, like me or for those who have not gotten one of the most breathtaking TV series to hit Blu-ray. For those who have already bought the seasons separately, I don't think this is worth the price of readmission unless you are a die-hard fan. Nothing here is new in terms of content as each season's set contain the same discs and features as those which have already been released. However, there is a hidden extra disc that has a lot of new extras that you may find interesting - though still not worth buying this entire set for.If you still do not have any of the previous seasons, or have a few missing seasons - I would highly recommend that you check this out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value - Great Set - Great Experience","review":"I personally loved this series from start to finish, unlike 50% of the lost viewers that fell off this show because they had attention deficit disorder.Being patient and enjoying the mystery, despite the long wait for answers, was very well worth it. The final 2 seasons make up for many of the side-way stories that took place over seasons 2-3 that many people seemed to hate, though i personally felt they delved nicely into the character development for a lot of our characters.For the black friday price of $125, this set is undeniably one of the best steals of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you would want for a LOST fan ...","review":"Great full package with DVD's and extras for the true LOST fan.

The music, character development, beginnings and endings, separations and reunification reeled me in. The characters' emotional experiences of deep love and hate, battling good and evil within themselves and clinging to or letting go of their pasts and future mirrors the complexity of real-life relationships. Lost contains a little something from all genres: romance, espionage, mystery, sci-fiction, suspense, drama, etc. It brings to life issues of trust, betrayal, friendship, loyalty, abandonment, avoidance, worthiness, sacrifice, etc.There was a problem with the first box set that I received, which I returned and Amazon kindly sent me a new one immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Series","review":"I love the series.

I have always compared them in quality and novelty to Pink Floyd, Emerson-Lake-and-Palmer, and others. The thing is they really never made big. In order of preferance I would put Illusions on a Double Dimple, Spartacus and Old Loves Die Hard. These three albuns were made by the original Triumvirat group. The main caracteristics is the white little mouse in the albun's cover. There is other albuns' by Triumvirat. However, they are not the original and they do not use the white little mouse as simbol. Also, they lack the music quality of the first three albuns'. Also, I have searched for these albuns for quite some time, I only could find them here. Very nice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS FIRST TWO RELEASES","review":"The ILLUSIONS album was a masterpiece. SPARTACUS was very very good as well. This , the third, has some moments equal to the earlier releases, but overall it falls short in music complexities and depth. Some of the cuts are bad. I bought this one a few years back and have rarely played it. But OLD LOVES is much better than its followup, POMPEII , which was almost a total disgrace. Get OLD LOVES for the 3 or 4 really good tracks. Play POMPEII by NEW TRIUMVARAT to get rid of unwanted dinner guests."},{"rating":"2","title":"winter socks","review":"Love the socks!

This book and its predecessor are two of the greatest sci-fi books I have ever read and read and read. I have re-read them at least 5 times since I first read them as a teenager. In fact I still have the books I bought as a teenager!This story is a slight let-off from the first book, but extremely enjoyable. Even when re-reading it I still find myself hoping to find a resident alien around the corner.It's a monumental epic struggle to save the human race and the trials and tribulations of the last remaining humans after the world is destroyed. It's a little predictable, but you have to put the book in to perspective to the time it was written.

Guess I should have found out if all the players were back. Let's be honest, it was Lil G voice that made Silk stand out from all the others and with him gone, unfortunately, with him gone, the group is no different from any other struggling the light band. I tried several times to give the album a good listening; but, I couldn't get past the lead singers voice. He comes across a whiny, irritating, and grating. Once I realize that Lil G wasn't on the album, the first thing I thought was that the current lead singer, finally got his wish to be out in the front.I'm sorry; I just can't get with it and am very upset that I spent $12."},{"rating":"1","title":"Straight Booty!!! Where is Lil' G?","review":"I want my money back!!!! For you definite Silk fans from back in the day, this cd, much like the last one, will surely disappoint! I was curious as to why there was no photo of the group on the cover. Well, there is no photo because it appears that the main voice, Lil' G (think his name was Gary Jenkins)appears to no longer be with them.....and boy are they missing homie's vocal chords!!!! The only song remotely decent is the Blue Magic remake of \\"Side Show\\", produced by Keith Sweat, and even that could have been stronger.

It's over.","review":"Silk - Silktime (Liquid 8, 2003)Perhaps Lil' G was right in leaving. I think I was the only person who bought their last album, Love Session, and for that, the group was dropped from Elektra Records. Now the remaining four (who ARE good singers, by the way) are on an indie label. But you have to look at the elements here. First, the album cover looks strikingly similar to their 1994 self-titled album cover, almost as if it was photocopied. Also, the song titles are generic (\\"Silktime\\", \\"Silklove\\"). And don't think I haven't listened to this album: all of the songs, though sung well, have subpar lyrics that are at times even profane. Finally, Lil' G was the best singer in the group and was the glue that held it together. It's time for the group to gracefully bow out and let the 112's and Jagged Edges have their turn. This album isn't even Shareaza-worthy. You're better off listening to Musiqtime or Beyoncetime. -EJR"},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty average","review":"Silk was a Group that could never get between Jodeci&Boyz11Men but somehow they are the link to 112&Jagged Edge of today.Silk has good vocals&Talent there.they started out as a Portege of Keith Sweat&Like Keith they found a way to stay in the game but unlike Keith they were more on the single tip than a whole album or even a whole set.Vocally&some of the music is on point but they never grew as Artists&just went through the motions as a Group.but to there credit they are still going on."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Disappointed GREATLY!!!","review":"I agree with the first reviewer.

If the \\"interludes\\" were made into songs this would be an amazing album!!OK-enough complainin...on the whole this is a good album. Even though they are 1 less member..their vocals and songs are still incredible. They tackle the issues of being in love, and getting hurt by the one you love. My favs are \\"My Girl\\", \\"Alibi\\", \\"More\\", \\"Silktime\\", and \\"Incredible\\".I recommend this album because in essence it is good. Silk has yet to make a bad album.

She has also mentioned a Vaudois (French) bible, Luther's German bible, and a spanish bible as being in the line of pure preserved translations. The point is that God can and does preserve His Word even through copies of copies of copies for each generation.Don't take Gail's word for it. Do your own research.

A comic relief plot element which was not funny to me in the first place is apparently going to be the springboard for future adventures.

Unfortunately, as for the book itself, it's just STL (slower than lame) as opposed to FTL (favorite title listing). They story could have been good but Stross spends sooo much time playing with his technical writing that the story gets subsumed along the way.Rachel and Martin are little more than tangential characters, and the girl who the story relies on (Victoria Strowger aka Wednesday Shadowmist) is just not that interesting. The bad guys/gals called the 'ReMastered' (notice the second capital, real cool, huh?) do everything but hiss like snakes when they talk. They are soooo bad that they kill off each other for not being bad enough (no not Boris Badinov).The plot is so thin as to be translucent and it never captured your imagination or emotions.

The professional reviews of this book led me to expect a fairly standard space opera, and the Hugo nomination made me hope for something above the ordinary. I was sorely disappointed on both counts.The book started slowly with entirely too much description and technical background. In excess of the first quarter of the book is devoted to setting the scene and getting the central plot moving. But those are minor flaws compared to the other ones.Stross managed to thoroughly alienate me with the unpleasant characters, violence, and sick sex. I wanted to wash out my mouth and take a shower after one particularly graphic description.The cover of the paperback edition says the book is a \\"Hollywood thriller with a cyberpunk heart.\\" I would reverse the emphasis and say it embodies all the worst of cyberpunk with no apparent redeeming social value.

The only issue is that the ball gets dirty regularly and I need to clean it often (sometimes as much as once a day, but using only a kleenex is usually enough). But then this is true of any track ball and I don't think that this is some thing that is particularly wrong with this product.I have also noticed that Amazon has reduced the price of this product and so I think these days (at around 20 bucks) it is a great buy.

So trackballs are a real necessity for me. I was looking for a bluetooth trackball to use with my Apple Macbook Pro, but finally gave up. In the interim I had been using a Trackman Marble Mouse, but found it a little uncomfortable, so I decided to give the Kensington Orbit a try. What a mistake. Who thought it was a good idea to save a couple of cents by eliminating any sort of retention mechanism for the ball ? Even if I weren't planning to use this device with a laptop, I don't want to go chasing under the desk for the ball every time the device gets bumped, jostled, or otherwise upset. Maybe some keep their desk more pristine than I, but since one of the great uses for trackballs is a cluttered desk, this is one design shortcut that just doesn't pass muster. I'm returning this beast tomorrow, there has got to be a better solution than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item has not shipped after 7 weeks!","review":"Even though the site said \\"Usually Ships in 1-2 Business Days\\", the item has not shipped after 7 weeks!

It's very light, so moves around alot, The buttons are placed a little odd for easy use if your hand is placed so that the fingers can use the trackball properly. The design has tried to make the buttons look good instead of making them more useful. They are also a little hard to press for quick use because the shape gets small where my thumb would normally rest so I have to hit it just right to get it to work. It's really not big enough to hold your hand properly so you don't get any repetitive motion problems. Unless you've got really small hands, you're probably going to find yourself holding your finger joints UP so your fingertips can work the ball. My hand doesn't rest easy in that position. After several days of trying to make it work for me, I'm sending it back actually. I was replacing a well used Kensington Turbo Mouse, and find that I just need to bite the price bullet and get the Expert Mouse"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unconfotable and possible wrist injury","review":"The trackball jumps a spot every now and then and after a while, the position of your wrist makes it painful to continue.I went back to my ergonomic Logitech."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"This mouse in my opinion sucks.

To save time, I'll get right to the pros:-Extremely good build quality-Very comfortable to use, but it may be because my hands are really big-Very good looking with gray ball-Very simple, has no extra buttons and gizmos, like other trackballsThe one con I can say is that it can be difficult to get the dirt out of the space for the ball. But it only becomes an issue after days of use, not a huge problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has Problems","review":"I have two problems with this trackball that might not bother others. First, the left button cannot be programmed for a double click (which I am used to)and keep the right button as the usual right click. Kensington says one of the buttons must be \\"click\\" (single click). I have verified this with Kensington tech support. Secondly, and less of an issue, as others have reported the hand position over the mouse makes it very easy to accidentaly right click with your little finger.

Picking the thing up off the desktop by about an inch and dropping it can shock the button lose, but it's only a matter of time - just a few clicks - until it happens again. Sad, because overall it's a nice device but as with so many manufacturers, poor quality to save a buck has doomed their product to be merely mediocre at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more RSI with this trackball","review":"I've been using the Kensington Orbit Optical for several months, and find it very comfortable and responsive. Had to clean the inside only once since I bought it. This trackball has right/left symmetry, making it ambidextrous: I can use it with either right or left hand. I switch occasionally, to avoid repetitive stress injury (carpal tunnel syndrome in this case).If it had a scroll wheel, the Orbit Optical would get five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent trackball","review":"This trackball is comfortable and offers fluid-like movements of the cursor.

I use my computer all day long for graphics, editing, web browsing, etc, and I just do not like the way this trackball feels under my hand. I do not find it at ALL easy to use both the buttons and the ball without moving my hand around, and thus my wrist gets quite fatigued, which was exactly what I was trying to avoid.

Unfortunately, the tiny ball, odd shape, lack of a scroll wheel, etc. made this mouse a bad purchase. Most importantly, my wrist pain from using a standard mouse didn't clear up and the shape of the mouse required me to arc my wrist in a strange way to use it.

A trackball is perfect for me. The ball is loose for easy cleaning and practically floats. The buttons are large and easy to operate. The only downside is no scrolling wheel.

I love the feel and touch of this trackball. My only disappointment is that it doesn't have a scroll feature. Apparently, to get that feature, you have to move up to the much more expensive model. The picture is deceiving. I thought it would be much larger and appear more of a gamer's gadget. No. The shape is thoughtfully engineered for the contour of my hand.

I never knew how many times I left click in a hour until, with this trackball, I could count them by the noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best mouse.","review":"I just bought my third Kensington trackball mouse. This is a really great mouse. Unlike the Logitech trackball (which I bought and subsequently replaced), the sensitivity and \\"feel\\" are just right.The biggest advantage of a trackball is the ability to get your cursor in exactly the right place, and then release the ball (i.e. the positioning mechanism) prior to clicking. In this manner, the cursor won't move as you make the click. This has real advantages for the graphic artist.Another advantage is not running out of mouse pad or cord, since the mouse itself stays stationary. It takes up less room on your desk.I don't believe it would be a good mouse for gamers, though I do not use my computer for games and perhaps there are some settings changes that would allow it to be used for such.

The track ball moves over 3 tiny white balls to help it glide over the laser, but the tiny white balls are not held in very well. I had my mouse for less than 6 months when I noticed that the ball felt like it was dragging. I pulled the track ball off to clean it when I noticed one of those tiny balls was missing. Without one of those balls the mouse had become difficult to use, feeling like it was made of lead rather than plastic, so I have thrown it out.

It took a little getting used to after years of moving a mouse around, but the finial disappointment was when it quit working and then I remembered many years ago before I had a laser mouse that dirt would couse the ball to not work. That was the last straw and I pulled it out and went back to a laser type."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient","review":"You wouldn't think that the amount of exposed ball would make such a difference, but it does. I can fly from one end of the screen to the other so fast that a typical mouse seems unbearably slow anymore. The only complaint I have with this is that the ball is not secured. (And how would you, and still keep this much ball exposed? Logistical catch-22. Can't have everything.) I sometimes have to carry this around to avoid the painful hand-contortions caused from having to use my pathetic laptop track-pad.

But after playing my games with it for a couple of hours the socket wore in and the ball moves so smoothly its insane. The button design i was also skeptical i'd get used to but after only a few minutes my hands adjusted straight to a perfect position to play with the mouse. If it's your first or your 100th trackball mouse you need to give your hand time to adjust, the way these things are used is very counterintuitive for most people.

The quality was also amazing, but the \\"Deleted Scenes\\" for Scream 3 was pretty poor but I'm sure that is how it was supposed to look seeing as it wasn't a clip to be produced.Scream Triple Pack (Scream | Scream 2 | Scream 3)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movies but don't order through Supermart","review":"Scream Triple Pack (Scream | Scream 2 | Scream 3)I love all of these movies, but I ordered from a place called Supermart. Two weeks went buy and I finally received the package, it wasn't even close to what I ordered. Contacted them and they said there was a problem and the correct order was sent out and should be here soon. Two more weeks and I contacted them again stating that they needed to overnight the movies to me, or give me a full refund including my S/H. They haven't contacted me back, and a month of dealing with these people I have no refund or movies. I help off on giving them feedback in order to give them the benifit of the doubt but after a month of no results I had to file and claim and leave negative feedback.

The first one of these I received had a cracked base. To Amazon's credit they overnighted me a replacement. The burner unit on the replacement was not assembled. By that I mean that none of the tabs were in the slots needed to hold it together. They were bent as if they had been, but obviously hadn't actually been inserted, so the upper and bottom halves of the burner were not connected at all.I ended up spending about 15 minutes repairing the incompetent assembly job. In the process I noted that all the brass colored metal pieces were very flimsy and thin.Once together the lamp functioned ok, but it's still a flimsy knockoff and you have to handle it very carefully. Time will tell if this thing holds up to actual use or not. If you want a real oil lamp that can be used then skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little People's Very Annoying Ballet","review":"This video was the most ridiculous attempt to teach young children ballet.

I couldn't. It's not about ballet, or even pre-ballet, it's about Anita La Grassa feeling good about herself, and undeservedly so. The segue where she praises herself through the use of a rabbit puppet pretty much speaks for itself. The children are there throughout, though primarily as foils whose collective clumsiness serves to emphasize the perfection that is Miss Anita. If a gateway to hell were to open for just a few seconds, this would make my short list of things to cast back from whence it came.Naturally, my toddler loved this video, and she still makes reference to the tutu-clad rabbit a month after we sent this video back.

The fourth morning, though, I awoke feeling rested and pain free. I'm now sleeping better than I have in years; my neck and shoulders are much better.

It, among other measures, helped reduce some radiated pain due to some cervical issues.It was great while it lasted! After the first few weeks, I noticed that the roll was more compressed than when first purchased, and it remained that way as if in a permanent state. After about 3-4 months of use, it is now permanently compressed enough as to barely be noticeable, and barely makes a difference.

Eventually the odor dissipated and I was able to use the roll. I like this firmer roll even better than the previous ones.I keep one in my suitcase for travel. With this roll I am able to sleep on any pillow without creating severe neck issues. My neck is very tricky, a result of two front end collisions and a rear end collision and other accidents.The cover is easy to remove and launders well without shrinking.I would rate it five stars except for the odor when it arrived.

Mind you, this piece of foam will be against the back part of your neck for about 7 - 8 hours. What will be transferred from the foam to your neck is left to be seen.

Both of us own knives from Henckels 4 star line, which for him, the knives have held up over twenty years, including time working as a chef. The quality of these knives makes them the type you own for life. This particular knife is excellent for cutting vegetables. The scalloping breaks the vacuum between knife and vegetable, making it easier to make multiple cuts in a row. The steel is a high quality, that retains an edge for an extended period of time. The handle is ergonomic, and the knife itself is well balanced."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like \\"The Throw this movie away\\"","review":"My husband and I have played professionally in bands (and no, not EVERY musician drank or used drugs back then. We behaved more like professionals. Many bands from that time did too)so we rented this movie based on that and great reputation Dakota Fanning had in her previous films. This was nothing but \\"sex-ploytation\\" and we turned it off. I will NEVER again watch a movie based on Dakota Fanning again unless I have thouroughly check the movie again.Look out....I see another Lindsay Lohan or Brittany Spears in the future unless Miss Fanning's manager finds her more parts that are suitable to her talents. In other words, this movie was a huge waste of what COULD have been a great story, and, in my opinion, and I'm allowed to have an opinion without being called a bunch of names from those who write abusive or rude posts to those who disagree with them. Those that run out of intelligent ideas can only name call, so play nice in the sandbox, kiddies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash!","review":"I was looking forward to watching this movie. I had it on for 10 minutes and I turned it off. It was plane trash!! No plot. Nothing. No acting. This was the worse acting I have ever seen when it comes to Dakota and Kristen. I will think twice before I watch anymore movies from those two. Very dissapointed. I lived through the 70's. But they really messed up making this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The runaways","review":"Was really looking forward to this, and was disappointed. I felt like there wasn't really a story there.

Dakota Fanning does an awesome job on playing her role. Karen Stewart's face is the same on every movie she comes on! However, she also does great playing Joan Jett. I watch this movie at least once a month. 5 stars and 2 thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cherie Curry story","review":"Just seen the Runaways movie, it seems Lita Ford was pushed into the background, she's just there in the background rehearsing all of a suden with no story on how they found her. There's not even a mention of her on the credits about what she went on to do, like there is with Cherie Currie and Joan Jett. Lita Ford did have a reasonable successful solo career. I remember the Runaways as a foursome after Cherie Currie, they had an album released and I remember the gigs they did in the UK playing the Hammersmith Appolo London and appearing on The Old Grey Whistle Test on BBC 2 tv.Still a very interesting film to watch, I enjoyed it; it reminded me of the Japanese edtion the vinyl album I bought in 1977 of the Runaways Live In Japan it cost me a whole 8 which was a lot in the seventies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointedly, Not Good","review":"I missed the The Runaways movie in the theatre last spring when it opened because it came and went in one weekend (now I know why). But I like Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning as actresses so I figured it was worth buying. But i was greatly disappointed in that the story was poorly written and directed, and just was not interesting, and I never felt for the characters as people.There seemed to be gaps in the story, and it was never clear why Joan Jet and Cherie Currie split up, and what happen to Cherie Currie in the years that followed.But then, I never thought they had any real talent when they were performing back in the day, and the movie helped support this. This was a movie that did not need to be made.If you think you have to see it, don't buy it, just rent it at the Supermarket for $1."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Runaways\\" (2010)","review":"Kristen Stewart is one of my favorite actress, but her acting is dull inThe Twilight Saga: New Moon (Two-Disc Special Edition)and okay inTwilight (Two-Disc Special Edition), but this movie makes up for her poor acting. I wasn't a fan of Stewart when I first saw her in the Twilight movies, I started to like her afterAdventureland, which is a really good movie. When I saw this I knew it was going to be good anyways, it starred Dakota Fanning (War of the Worlds (Widescreen Edition)) and Scout Taylor-Compton (Halloween - Unrated Director's Cut (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)&Halloween II (Unrated Director's Cut)). When the movie ended, I was amazed, the movie is now #1 on my top 3 favorite movies. I saw the movie three times and I am urging to see it for a 4th, it is that good.

One of those films that you watch and realize that you just wasted over an hour of your time, and you'll never get it back! It was not good. It was not even mediocre. It could have been a good movie, it had good enough actors, but the storyline and director appeared to work overtime to make this one a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rolling Over in Her Grave","review":"Joan Jett would be rolling over in her grave if she were dead. This is not art. It is just a tired hack job of old themes. Vampire girl has absolutely zero stage presence. Dakota Fanning can't carry this lifeless film either. I liked Kristen Stewart better in her Porsche ad. This is one of the few films that I stopped watching half way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This movie was a wasted 2 hours of my life. The acting was a disappointment. The plot--was there one? The pacing was so slow. If you're looking for a good movie to watch, don't waste your time on this one. It's basically just about teenagers doing drugs, having sex, and ruining their lives. I was really excited to see Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning in it (I'm a Twilight fan), but I wish I'd checked more reviews before renting it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now what was this movie about????","review":"I was hoping to get some insight, even a little into the early beginnings of Joan Jett and those who first played with her, she is still hot today as ever. What I got was Kristen Stewart with her perpetual Sigourney Weaver Ripley lips, a girl pissing on a guitar, a girl using a hand held shower spray to get off on thoughts of Fara Fawcett.Gee its easy to see a lot of time effort and money were invested to bring this story to the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE \\"WE BE BOOKS\\".

Now I wrote them again and they are still ignoring my mails."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vulgarity and Obscenity Rule","review":"What on earth are Kristen Stewart and once-baby-face Dakota Fanning soiling themselves like whores in this movie? Is this what sick Hollywood producers do to actresses these days? Oh yes, maybe that's what today's twisted mass consumer \\"market\\" wants to see: the degradation of the young. You're just making another movie to capture market share, thinking that there are no consequence to your actions.If you like watching girls turn really bad by swearing their mouths with endless expletives and behaving like cocaine-snorting whores, this is one classic example of the loose, evil culture that reigns in Hollywood and Gomorrah-city California. Guess the Rebellion hasn't ended in the Garden of Eden, in ancient Babylon or in the 1970s.What you'll learn in this movie: Whore, swear, sing and Get Rich!Are we supposed to pity those whoring junkies and have kids turn to them as role-models?!This is one memorable Dakota Fanning classic:I am Sam (New Line Platinum Series)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing and worth your money","review":"This movie was very raw, very real and my only complaint is that it was not long enough. Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning are amazing as Joan and Cherrie. Kim F is absolutely funny and entertaining. The story could have gone on and on but i guess they had to cut some scenes. Its worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Run to watch it!","review":"Kristen Stewart rocks the shag hairstyle (KStew declined loads of dough from Summit to NOT cut Bella's hairstyle), learned to play Joan's guitar playing style (Jett is a lefty, KStew isn't), donned the leather pants, sex pistols t-shirt and overall black 70's wardrobe perfectly, KStew sang the songs herself! IF that is not dedication to your craft I don't know what is! Kristen becomes the character she plays (in all her films) to the point of stuberness perfection.Dakota has grown up and plays her character (Cherie Currie) true to life. Michael Shannon shines and steals every scene he is in!I recommend watching this movie, drinking a beer and smoking something, LOL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly executed telling of a truly interesting and inspiring story.","review":"If you have any interest in this subject pick up \\"EDGEPLAY\\" on DVD....the documentary on the Runaways that blows the theatrical release away. We just saw the movie and its amazing how the writer/director (blame twice) can take an interesting and inspiring and heart breaking story about this group of 5 girls..reduce it to a story about only 2 of them and still in the course of an hour and forty five minutes tell so little story. On top of that Dakota Fanning is terrible , she has none of the sex appeal or charisma of a lead singer and isn't in Cherie Curries league...bad casting. Interestingly enough Kristen Stewart does a wonderful job as Joan Jett.....commendable and really sadly wasted next to Dakota Fanning who was criminally and woefully miss cast. This movie is a joke, Joan Jett, Currie, Lita Ford, Sandy West and Jackie Fox weren't and to wait this long to do such a bad job stinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bio-pic","review":"Kristen Stewart does an amazing job of transforming herself into Joan Jett here. She really looks and acts like Jett. Dakota Fanning makes a nice foil as the 15-year-old lead singer. No one remembers anyone from the Runaways except Joan Jett, but she is not given any face time at all in the extras. I wonder why? Cherie Curry appears, but no Joan. HHmmmm. I didn't really know the story behind the band, and this accurate bio-pic does a neat job putting it all together, showing southern California as it likely was back in 1975 when the teen band was put together. They look quite authentic when they perform, no mean feat. How many fake musical performances have we seen in similar movies by non-musician actors? Great job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as expected...","review":"Music was good...movie kinda sucked. It was slow and choppy at times and I never really got into any of the characters except Cherie. Dakota did a great job, Kristen was ok, but she's the same in every movie. To be honest I wouldn't pay the $3.99 to rent it, I would just wait for tv. Don't let the kids watch it, there is ALOT OF SEX AND DRUGS..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film","review":"As a long time fan of the Runaways and having read the book, Neon Angels, I give this film 5 stars. I wish I could give it more. The characters are played so perfect I felt like I was watching the real Runawaays."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Chilling and Honest Biopic","review":"Say what you will about Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning, but they put up AMAZING performances as Joan Jett and Cherie Currie. Incredibly well-done, this movie is a fantastic bio-pic and haunting look into the short-lived career and stolen childhoods of The Runaways. It's a fantastic character piece and and definitely an engaging film. Michael Shannon, who plays Producer Kim Fowley, does so with the right amount of sleaze and art. Brilliant biopic. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deck box!","review":"This deck box is really great. What you can't see in the picture is the naruto promo card that comes with it, as well as a deck separater.

I would much rather have a single disk system that works well, instead of this 5 disk system that gets 'lost in space'... It's extremely s.l.o.w and frustrating to use. I've owned this unit for over a year and my wife still won't touch it, as she see's the frustration I go through everytime I use the CD/DVD player (or try to anyway).

Christmas Eve this year, it swallowed a rented DVD and wouldn't let it go until I attacked it with screwdrivers. Now it seems to work again, but I'm going to dump it in the trash anyway.Basically, it's a piece of junk:1. The sound is like it's coming up from a pool of mud.2. The DVD player is slo-o-o-ow, and the control over DVD playing poor. My $69 Toshiba DVD player is worlds better mechanically.3. The whole system is made up of proprietary components, so if you decide on a new amp/receiver/DVD player, you're out of luck. The speakers have to go too.

I think if you get this for your child, as soon as they start reading it they won't be able to put it down because it is funny. It's the funniest book I have ever read. Children might ask you how to say a couple of words, but not that many. Most of these words are plain, childish words. This book has a lot of weird creations and Calvin sometimes thinks he's a superhero called SpaceMan Spiff and runs around pretending he's killing aliens (but don't worry parents, the killing isn't bloody).

The scenes have nothing to do really with the game and it gets annoying after awhile. Second, I got totally frustrated at how I'd finish a battle then move on and then if I wanted to backtrack I'd have to fight the SAME BATTLE all over again - it can't be avoided! Other games, if you defeat and win in a battle it's done. You can go back over that same area and not have to fight the exact same battle over and over and over again. You can't choose the character you want to be which sucks and there's not really many treasures to find and they are mostly lame anyway. As a fan of LOTR, I found this game boring, frustrating and totally lacking in creativity.

I only played for about 30 minutes and found that I was forced to just follow the pre-determined path set by the developers. The game is really just 109 video clips from the movie, with a non-interesting path for you to follow to \\"unlock them\\". Someone called this Japanese RPG, I call it \\"10 year old RPG\\". If you are under 14 you'll love it. I would have given it 1 star, but I felt that the video clips were sort of fun. However, the Video clips don't even match the story!

They have orcs. one time they'll have spears, and then they have drums. Hey, can a drum really be a weapon? Plus, it's boring and REALLY DAMN HARD. Don't buy, and don't rent.

Now that I've been \\"playing\\" it I have some major gripes...This game is beyond what I would call linear, you are confined to a set path, unlike KOTOR where you ran around zones, here you run down paths. Dreadful.Combat looks stupid. All the fights seem predetermined. When you enter combat a large loud annoying \\"start of combat\\" screen pops up. You decide your attack, you execute your attack, then you run back to where you were to stand like an idiot waiting on the enemy to attack you. I just can't get over how bad that looks.What it boils down to is that there is little to no exploration and all the game is is a series of battles you run too.

At 1200 pages, you're probably not going to read this from cover to cover. Instead, you'll want to have this on your shelf whenever you need information on production and inventory management. The book is actually a compilation of chapters by various authors. On the plus side, this results in having each topic covered by an expert on that specific topic. On the minus side, it results in some redundancy from chapter to chapter and inconsistency in the quality of each chapter.What's great about this book is that if you need information on a topic related to production and inventory management, you are almost certain to find the topic covered in this book.

There is only one good song on this album and its pass that dutch. That song has a cool beat and rythm all the others suck. Missy you could have done alot better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Missy's CD is tight","review":"I think overall she put herself at a disadvantage by releasing UNDER CONSTRUCTION first. I think UC was her best CD and had a lot of emotion with it. This is not a test follows in that same direction but it's almost as if TINAT was made up of some of the songs that didn't make the cut for UC. Having said that, though, MIssy still represents the way she has since day 1. Her passion for Hip Hop is overwelming. Most people don't care this much, and it shows in their terrible beats and lyrics. You can't be serious about hating on Missy. She is the best out HANDS DOWN!

I must say that with Missy latest effort \\"This is not a test\\" and her prior\\"Under Construction\\" were horrible. It seems Missy is really relaxed and feels that a fall off cannot happen to her.Please don't get me wrong she has a few tracks on this disc but overall it really seem thrown together and rushed. Her lyrics are really outdated and her tone in her voice really drags around the whole disc. This is sad because Missy has true talent but on this and her prior CD overall the Album are trash. I really feel I wasted my money. She has 2 may feature artist on the Cd and Missy cannot Col with just any artist.I hope she can give me another CD like So addictive or She's a B@#4h ,or I will find myself buying her Cd BOOTLEGG..........."},{"rating":"1","title":"A RUSHED MESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"this album was rushed and is a mess.... take your time next time missy....

I also LOVE the \\"Ragtime Interlude,\\" - it seems to hint at a wealth of possibilities. Missy, you should chill from making un-melodic \\"Work It\\" re-writes (like \\"Pass That Dutch\\"--yes, it's fun, but it's hardly anything new, and it flopped on the charts).

This is a horrible CD. Missy should have waited a while longer to make a new CD and maybe it would have been of better quality. The song \\"Dats What I'm Talkin' About\\" with R. Kelly is the most wrong thing I have ever heard. ISH! It sound like an old Prince song...they're both singing SO high pitched that it is just painful! Besides \\"Pass That Dutch\\" there are only 2 other songs I like on this CD......\\"I'm Really Hot\\" and \\"Let It Bump\\".

Her music is for the club scene to make you dance and have a good time. It is not intended to make a big political or moral statement. I have heard plenty of rock and hard rock songs that I can only describe as noise at best. You sound as if you have something personal against our culture not just the music.

I listen to it constantly. Her diss of fat people is rather laughable, though, considering the fact that she used to be a tub 'o lard herself (she's still kind of pudgy). That aside, though, the club-friendly beat of \\"Dutch\\" will get anyone out on the dancefloor. \\"I'm Really Hot\\" is so-so but kinda weird, \\"Wake Up\\" and \\"I'm Not Perfect\\" have messages to send, and \\"Toyz\\" is funny. But other than that....this is all filler. The lyrics also sort of tick me off, Missy has been getting irritatingly cocky ever since she lost all that weight. She doesn't seem like the kind of person I'd want to meet anymore. But maybe I'm just talking about the songs that got radio airplay, cuz they're always the b!tchy ones. \\"Pass That Dutch\\" is awesome, but she has far better albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd Time Around","review":"Missy came back again with another knockout album. This Is Not A Test is a true testament that life doesn't revolve around material things, but having a good time, and having God in your life and making sure you are still grounded and having family and friends is important. The tracks are not stellar by any means, but they are funny and danceable. Some of the songs that she sings are mediocre- due to the limitness of her alto, but she can sing with as much conviction as a dead cocateau. Overall, I like the whole album, not one of her best, but it's better than the first 3!

It seemed that I wasn't the only one that was fooled. Since I bought it, I stuck with it. Taking it for about a month I realized that my pain had decreased slightly. I had expected the effect to kick in sooner. Since I don't always take glucosamine supplements everyday of the year, I would prefer a product that takes less than a month to take effect. On top of that, I found an article about coated tablets vs. capsules. It seems that much of the contents in a coated tablet aren't even absorbed into the body whereas capsules have a much higher absorbency rate and are quicker to take effect. After I ran out, I didn't buy anymore Schiff Glucosamine. I use another brand after searching google called Vitamin Boat Movexa.

You get a fantastic CD and a DVD of Static-X in concert, making Shadow Zone and just goofing off. 5 Stars!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wisconsin death trip it's not...","review":"static-x has gone downhill since wisconsin death trip. that album was simply amazing, machine was so-so, and this is crap. it sounds as if they are trying to make more mainstream friendly, less rockin' music...and it fails miserably. generally, i like their blend of industrial and metal...but they seem to be moving towards more industrial, and less metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"i'm sorry... feel asleep listening to this cd....what the hell happened to the band?OHHHH - They decided ot try and make money instead of being creative?"},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"long time coming. they picked up, in my opinion, one of the better drummers in the biz. and wayne did something he hasn't done before, SING! and he is damn good at it! i love it. how can you bash so? it is the best song on the cd! on this cd, they try. the only reason i can see why people don't like it is because they aren't open to slower music. this cd shows that static-x can rock as well as be serious. love it"},{"rating":"2","title":"enough whining","review":"people have been complaining about this album since the week it came out... seems most their arguments are based on \\"wayne sings too much\\"... they're also upset the album is a far strech from wisconsin death trip's sound, which is mostly due to the change in the band's lineup over the years... from an industrial/metal standpoint, this album isnt that bad at all... too many people are whining cause wayne is actually trying to work melody into his music, though it appears that fanbase is composed mostly of retard modern metalheads that listen to slipknot... as to rest of you real static-x fans, i bet your relieved to hear this after machine... shadow zone has a much more complete sound, better lyrics, and feels it has more effort put into it... forget the mainstream... buy what you like, i like this..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly Static's best release to date","review":"Upon first hearing about Static X's new album, I feared that they may have turned alternative like so many other metal bands have recently. I had no reason to doubt, Shadow Zone is still every bit as fast and violent as their previous releases. Contrary to the general fan-feedback I've heard, I think this could be their best and most refined album they've put out. There are some different approaches to the vocals here and there that wander outside of Static's usual style, but it's not so bold to cause any concern. The annoying samples are gone thankfully, and each track seems to have a little bit more personality this time around. Sure, the lyrics are still dull and non-cerebral, but that's not what hardcore metal is about anyway. It's about hard thrashing riffs that threaten to blow your speakers out...and that's exactly what Shadow Zone succeeds in doing. So if your CD player is starving for some good metal, definitely pick this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BAND HAS COMPLETELY SOLD OUT, THEY NOW SUCK","review":"SHADOW ZONE- What the hell happened to STATIC X? When WISCONSIN DEATH TRIP came out it was awesome. The songs were heavy and the beats were tight and all was great in the world. Then MACHINE came out and I started to see a change in their musical direction, in other words they were trying to go \\"mainstream\\". Now on SHADOW ZONE they have completely sold their souls to try to get on mainstream radio. If you listen to WISCONSIN DEATH TRIP then this album you would never have guessed the same band produced those albums.This album is watered down radio friendly cheese and must be avoided like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoa...","review":"This CD is just terrible. It's really boring, and the vocals are painful to listen to. I would pay a hefty sum to know that I would never have to hear that hideous scream(I call it that for lack of a better word...most of the \\"screams\\" are just inane barking) of \\"Shadow Zone!\\" on the chorus of that song.I used to like Nu-metal, but I'm glad I'm getting over that, otherwise this release would really have pained me because I really like WDT and Machine. I just mark it off as another nu-metal band turning into watered-down worthlessness.And that's what this CD is. Just a (VERY) watered-down mix of their previous releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Bad","review":"There is really nothing good about this CD. In fact, when i put it in my CD player I had to look at the cover to make sure that I had not accidently bought the wrong CD. While Static X is known for their repetative riffs, this CD has extremely generic repeats. It just doesn't seem to have any energy or the intensity that made Static X good. Not to mention that Wayne Static seemed to try a new vocal style that sounds something like Jon Davis (Korn) run through a vocal effects processor. While I wouldnt go as far as to call it generic NuMetal, it comes VERY VERY close. Buy this CD if you like that kind of thing but personally, I would save your money. Buy Wisconsin Death Trip or Machine if you dont have them already."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely atrocious release...","review":"As a big fan of Static-X (and all metal in general), I cannot believe they've released this pile of crap. I've heard garage bands do better.Wisconsin Death Trip was a masterpiece (i've listened to that thousands of times), Machine was fair (i'd give that about a 4 or 5 out of 10), and now this....I was worried when i had heard \\"the only\\". That has to be the worst 'rock' song that i've ever heard. I figured the CD would have to at least have some good songs on it. Not the case...No hooks, no good melodies, nothing kicks ass, and the patented Wayne \\"growl\\" is about gone.As for other reviews saying this is great.....trust me, it's not.This release goes down in the books as the worst rock, metal, or alternative CD easily in the last 5 years.Awful, just atrocious....i can't stress this enough. If i could give it a \\"0\\" or a minus rating, i would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Static-X? Nah.. can't be","review":"Oh man, when I heard that Static-x put out a new cd, I instantly went out and bought on the spot, because WISCONSIN DEATH TRIP and MACHINE were great albums (more so death trip), I mean, those two cd a amazing! so I popped this baby in my cd player! and pushed play! and..! and.. and was horrible dissapointed. this whole cd sounds entirely the same. The only stand out song at all is \\"Destroy all\\", the rest sounds like \\"messy metal\\" where all it is, is DISTORTION DISTORTION DISTORTION, much like slipknots horrible \\"Iowa\\". I call it 'messy metal' because thats what it is! a big mess if heavy metal. Save your money. Dont buy this. I was so apauled by this, i threw it out in my apartment parking lot, and ran it over, numerous times with my car, listening to a VERY satisfying CRUNCH, along with Slipknots 'Iowa'. 2 stars, one for Destroy All, and two for my respect for Static-x's previous material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money","review":"Being a fan of Static X since \\"Wisconsin\\" this album was a huge disappointment. On the first track I thought Jonathan Davis was guest vocalling. The Ballad is so ... I found myself wondering if I was listening to a Yanni album or something. This is Static X's lame attempt to sell out. Some songs sound like Korn... some like Disturbed.. But they all lack the originality that the first two albums had. Static X used to have something. Like when you heard Godflesh... or Fear Factory for the first time. You knew you had something creative and ass kicking at the same time. Static X started off like that, but crashed and burned like an Iraqi Scud. But If you like ... vocals, you'll love the Shadow Zone"},{"rating":"2","title":"a great 3rd effort","review":"when i first went out to buy this cd, like i usually do, i checked the reviews on amazon first. when doing so, i hardly saw a positive comment about the cd, which is great by the way. i don't understand why people are bad mouthing static-x, and wayne static to be more spacific, just for experimenting with thier sound a little bit. the thing is here people, a band has to change a little now and then to keep things interesting. if they don't, then they will be thrown into the bleak dumping ground of failed bands. also, in no way, shape, or form have static-x \\"sold out\\" as quite a few people claim. just because a band is popular all of a sudden people label them as sellouts, maybe if you stop and think about it for a second, you'll realize that they aren't selling out, but are getting some of that recognition they deserve for all the hard work they've put into writing, and recording their music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Static-X's best album yet","review":"Shadow Zone is Static-X's best album yet. Their sound has evolved from their previous two albums. This album has a more fluid, organic feel, in contrast to the highly mechanical feel of their earlier work. In several places, that older rhythmic style still comes through, but it is more subdued on this album. While I liked their old stuff, this new sound works better and is a little more accessible. Several songs on this album really stand out. The intro track \\"Destroy All\\" is quite heavy and could have easily come from \\"Wisconsin Death Trip\\". The track \\"The Only\\" is getting some airplay right now, and it shows off some of the best song writing on the album. It's quite a catchy tune. The final track \\"Invincible\\" is probably the best song Static-X has written, and is very melodic, in the vein of Spineshank. Overall, this is a great album, if a bit different from Static-X's earlier work. Buy it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Throwing my 3 cents in!","review":"I swear, when I read the reviews I was shocked at how bad this band had become. Then thru truth, I listen to it. This CD is excellent. Ridiculous to even think this CD is a step backward instead of forward. Listen to \\"The Only,\\" \\"Kill In Wait,\\" and \\"Invincible\\" at least 3 times. And dont give me that crap that 3 times is too many to like a song, that is life. Give up the instant grat. and give it a couple of listens. If you think I am biased here are some more bands I listen to: Devildriver, Mushroomhead, Chimaira, Lamb of God, Messhugah, Hatebreed, Mudvayne, Ill Nino, Soilwork, and Spineshank."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done X-Men, Well done","review":"i must say, at first i didnt think as much of this album befor reading more into it, and seeing it live (THE BAND RULED A** IN MONTREAL!) i found, at first, it didnt seem to have the Evil Disco vibe that Static-X had me used to, but after giving it time and reading up on it, i realized that it was a real masterpeice. Wayne and Tripp put alot of time and effort into this album, theyre both perfectionists so you can see why. If you own the DVD this stuff wont be foreign to you. Looking back on when Static-X started out as Deep Blue Dream, and now with the Shadow Zone album, theyve come along way. They still manage to satisfy my Static-X needs, and i expect to see alot from them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shadow Zone","review":"this CD is amazing, and after listening to it i was only left with one question:why are people giving this album a bad review?static x does not sound like korn, or disturbed, or anything else, and i am glad that their music has evolved since their last album."},{"rating":"1","title":"static-x is losein its touch","review":"this cd wasent that great.it was really short only 39mins long. the songs were pretty good but short they had a relatively short intro and no outro. the lyrics aint bad some of em u can read teh the lyrics and still not know wut static is saying.all n all i thought the cd was lackin wut static-x usually has but thats jsut my opinion"},{"rating":"1","title":"?????HUH!","review":"ok wat happend koichi left and static-x just became a little spark i dont get it...this is not good not good at all i am dissapointed.......half this c.d is pop rock .....but there is sum hope...i mean i was able to find 3 goos songs on this album 1.Destroy All 2.Kill Your Idols 3.Ostegolectric(one of the best ostegos)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"Unfortunately, as much as people complain that this CD is not like WDT, if it was they would be complaining \\"why do they not get a new sound\\".

I put off buying it for a while, but as soon as i heard 'black and white' I was off to get a copy... and I was'nt disappointed! 'Shadow zone' isn't released in the UK until the 20th of October.. 2 weeks late.. but I have heard loads from the record and I am eagerly awaitng my copy. For those of you who have complained about the change in sound its called PROGRESSION people.. its how bands evolve and grow.. and it looks like the 'X' are definately going in the right direction!they've also defined a stronger image for themselves as time has gone on.. something else that will benefit them in this age of blandness!Keep it up guys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Static-X's third offering is as mediocre as \\"Machine\\"","review":"\\"Machine\\", the previous album from Static-X, was pretty mediocre and a serious letdown after their surprising 1999 debut \\"Wisconsin Death Trip\\". \\"Shadow Zone\\", the third offering from Static-X, is as medicore as \\"Machine\\", and as sad as it is to say, finds Wayne Static and co. sounding like a derivative Ministry cover band. Former Dope guitarist Tripp Eisen, who is having some troubles of his own at the moment, isn't a good fit and pales in comparison to Koichi, but Wayne Static's songwriting seems to have taken a nosedive here. \\"Dead World\\", \\"So\\", and \\"Invincible\\" are incredibly lame, while \\"Control It\\" and \\"Kill Your Idols\\" are solid post-industrial sludge. Other than that, \\"Shadow Zone\\" really doesn't offer anything that you haven't heard before, which is a big disappointment because Static-X was one of the few bands to emerge from the late 90's nu-metal kick that actually deserved attention. Stick with \\"Wisconsin Death Trip\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops!","review":"\\"Oops\\" is the only possible explanation for this circular piece of crap that i bought. Hopefullythe band feels the same way. There are hardly any hooks on the album, the lyrics are AWFUL, and everything that I liked about Static-X from the first two albums is gone. I was hoping that they would recover from the small step backwards that was Machine, but they took the sales figures as a green flag to suck my ass! I really hope Tripp Eisen is the next to leave the band. He is draining the life out of it, just as he did with Dope, and as he is doing with Murderdolls. Stop bad music before it starts."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIAL AND DISCOVER PHONE","review":"This was disappointing. When the phone arrived,it had a nice medium volume.The next day the volume was so low, you could barely hear it,except see the lights blinking.I changed the batteries, but it still did not help.It was a waste, since my grand-daughter's loves phone ringing, and this does not. Giving the benefit of the doubt,my item may be faulty.I threw the box, so could not return it. My advise is\\" Keep the box and return label\\" for sometime, incase you encounter the same problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound is too low","review":"I bought this for my daughter today. She was playing with it in the store and it was loud and you could hear the numbers, voices, and ringing clearly. But as soon as we took it out of the box and removed the strip from the back the volume was inaudible. I cannot even hear it unless we are in a very quiet room which is rare when you have two children. I am taking this back to the store tomorrow. It is a shame because other than the volume it is an amazing toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun for kids, TORTURE for parents","review":"Thank goodness we do not own this one! The one-year-old I was babysitting brought it over, and all three kids (oldest not quite 3) loved it. I could handle it, mostly, myself, until they discovered the button that sings some random customized words to the melody of \\"This Old Man,\\" *OFF KEY!!!* Let me say that once more: the song is played in one key in standard electronic-toy tones. The voice sings the song in an Entirely Different Key. It's not just one or two notes that are a little off, it's the Whole Song - by at least a full step.As another friend of mine put it, this is the stuff of horror movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not buy this phone if you are musically inclined","review":"This is a cute phone, though the voice is slightly obnoxious. The thing that really bothers me is that when you press the moon/pound button, it plays the tune of \\"This Old Man\\" in one key (E-flat) while the voice sings it in ANOTHER KEY (B). It's atrocious. And this WILL be your child's favorite button to press, because kids love music, no matter how awful it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I'm surprised this toy got so many positive reviews. The speaking voice that comes out drives me crazy! The inflections of individual words don't match the sentence; for example, the voice says, \\"This is the RED triangle\\" and the word \\"red\\" has this excited, overly happy inflection. It just doesn't fit in the sentence. It's the same with most of the sentences and sounds unnatural - \\"Let's call MOMMY!\\" It reminds me of a computer voice where the words are pieced together. We have other Vtech toys that we are very happy with. I wish we had a different brand of toy phone, though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck?","review":"Not only did this phone not work, but the screen was really quite tiring on my eyes.

Even so, the telephone is still not loud enough to cause attention. When we got this phone I was hoping it would replace an old Vtech phone my older children used to own 12 years ago (when my children outgrew it, it was donated to charity). That thing was not only loud enough, it had at least 16 different tunes (YES 16), it would ring, say the alphabet, you name it; anyway much better than this piece of junk. This one is way overpriced by the way. Vtech downgraded their original phone, took four dollars off the price and lowered the volume. Then they decided to share the original available features among a bunch of other devices including their overpriced children laptops with no backlight. None of then are worth the price, Vtech used to make such great toys years ago.PS I tried slipping a plastic piece like instructed, to no avail, it didn't work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great phone to save your phone...just don't pull the paper out!!","review":"Great phone for my little since she loves to reach for mine when I am on it or for one of the remotes.

She looked at it then put it down. To save the day I opened the batter cover...put a little piece of paper in the slot and magic as a review suggested. She can hear it and it keeps her entertained.

The author surprises the reader with a completely non-judgemental concept of what The Ten Commandments are all about. She reminds the reader that growth, and love, are the true purpose of the \\"Commandments\\" and that they were not intended as structures for condemnation.

Of course, we have already seen how that works in the former Soviet Union (it doesn't work at all). Yes, in a democratic-republic (Nieto always forgets the republic part) there is a dominant culture. Kind of why we call this a nation state, we have national culture. Unfortunately, Nieto is too busy saying the dominant culture is based on White European ideals. In fact, the ideals are based on Judaism, which is not European at all.There are some aspects of diverse cultures that keep people down trodden in our society, and it is NOT restricted to the dominant cultures.

This bothered me immensly and I didn't like the end at all. It didn't leave a feeling of satisfaction when I finished it and I was even a little angry. I felt that the book lacked consequences to the immoral behavior. I didn't fall in love with the hero, as I usually do in books, and the herorine didn't impress me. She isn't a role model I would choose for myself. This was an interesting read and I learned more about this tragic event in history, but I probably wouldn't give it to my child to read someday.

While his style is not stream of consciousness he often seems to hover on the edge of it. The long sentences (one of which is two pages long!) can sometimes make following the story difficult, but rich and original imagery balances this. The book is better the second time around for sure. My favorite story was Gentleman's Agreement, the first in the collection. Very touching, a story about fatherly love."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Romantic Comedy","review":"This is a great movie. A man loves a woman and is willing to sell his soul to the devil in exchange for seven wishes so he can have her, not that this is really a great idea, but it is a good story. All the characters are amazing! I don't think they could have picked better people to play them, and they dressed- and made them up really well. This is such a funny and romantic movie. All the wishes are nice but Hurley (the devil) just finds ways of ruining them, but what do you expect? She is the devil. Frasier shines in this movie. His love interest is also terrific. I also love the other characters 'cause they are so funny. This is a must-have DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nano case","review":"This case was made for the old nano and I have the new one, so I will give it away to someone who can use it.

The chain was a little too large and not what I expected (even though it was supposedly copper or copper coated). The Irish penny was very lightweight. I think the item would have looked so much better on a nice silver chain ... a little more streamlined. I'm sorry to say, that I'm not happy with this product; however, it was given as a gift so I won't be returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Progressive Hard Rock","review":"If you like Deep Purple but don't own Fireball, you are in for a real treat. This album is a hard rock masterpiece and Ian Gillan would totally agree with me. It's a shame that Fireball has been kind of forgotten about, it clearly holds up against In Rock. If you're just starting to collect their albums, maybe you already have Machine Head, this one won't disappoint you. It is one of the great rock albums of the seventies.The highlights: Fireball, Strange Kind of Woman, Anyone's Daughter, Fools, No One Came, Demon's Eye, I'm Alone and Freedom.PS: Check out their 2005 album, Rapture of the Deep. It holds up well. I would say it is right up there with their classic material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong From Beginning to End","review":"Truly a breakthrough recoring for the Mark 2 Deep Purple. And it is even better with the bonus tracks. Solid opening with the one two punch of Fireball and No No No. Great solos and vocals on these two puppies. Demons Eye is pretty good but a litle plain. I like the Purp's attempt at country with Anyone's Daughter. Cool lyrics and different vocal style. The Mule kicks but not one of the better tracks with not enough vocals. Fools rules and No One Came is ultra cool with amusing lyrics.Happy Strange Kind of Woman made this one as it's a catchy tune with more oomph to it than the somewhat plain Demon's Eye. The rest of the tracks are ok and sometimes fun. I do not hear the difference between the 2006 No One Came and the original. Like the take on the William Tell Overture. The backwards piano is unnecessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I just love Carolyn Mark - her voice, her lyrics. This album is fantastic, very very funny and wonderful.

The film appears flakey and beaten up, low contrast (blurry) with a barely audible sound track. It is a shame because this is an endearing performance of Shakespeare's masterpiece, with outstanding performances from Sir Laurence Olivier (his first Shakespeare film) and Elizabeth Bergner. The \\"seven ages of man\\" soliloquy is one of the greatest ever written. J.M. Barrie, the author of PETER PAN, adapted the bard's play for the screen. Into the waste bin this travesty goes. I have opted to buy the HBO version (1999) and am keeping my fingers crossed (HBO typically delivers quality product and I have been delighted with their offerings in the past)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in the fog","review":"The sound on this Alpha Video DVD is dismal: you often can't make out what the actors are saying.

I'll update this review after comparing the two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent '70s hard rock collection","review":"I picked up this collection back in the late \`80s and it still sounds great after all these years. Electric Seventies is an excellent 12-song collection of hard rock tunes from the 1970's. Some of the tunes here like \\"We're An American Band\\", \\"Black Magic Woman\\" (single version), \\"Blinded By The Light\\", \\"All The Young Dudes\\" and \\"Paranoid\\" continue to get played regularly on album rock radio and oldies stations while others like \\"Hocus Pocus\\" , \\"Easy Livin'\\", and \\"Smokin' In The Boys Room\\" you don't hear much anymore. Other great songs here include Edgar Winter Group's awesome instrumental and #1 hit \\"Frankenstein\\", Alice Cooper's first hit single \\"I'm Eighteen\\", Gregg Allman's solo hit \\"Midnight Rider\\", and the wicked three chord stomper that is Mountain's \\"Mississippi Queen\\".

The boys did alot of analog stuff which gave their music an amazing quality, unlike the Pro-Tools induced Niklebacks of today's corporate rock world. If you like your music neatly packaged and processed with boxes of electronics to make them pretty, do not be shocked when your kicked in the throat with Nirvana's raw sounds. Kurt may sing off tune sometimes and have simple solos, but everything Nirvana touched always had 100% heart and soul in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for the obsessed","review":"Don't get me wrong; I love Nirvana. I also love box sets with lots of B-sides, live cuts and rarities. However, this one is scraping the bottom of the barrel. There's a reason tracks are called \\"rehearsals\\" or \\"demos\\". Often, some demos are diamonds in the rough. Unfortunately, this box set has only a handful, and for the total amount of material, it's just not worth it. Most of this should have been left on the cutting room floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"A best of cd/dvd with it would have been nice.","review":"2.5 stars in my opinionWhen I hear box set I think a collection of best of songs, covers, demos, a collection of videos, and rare songs all rolled up into one set so you don't have to go out and get every single cd or search for the holy grail of demos. Paying $50 for this monstrosity then paying $20 just so I can get a best of cd is insane. I was hoping that if I got this set I wouldn't have to lug my [...] to the music stores and buy their entire catalog. This is as horrible as Slayer's box set from last year. I was expecting maybe to hear some covers of bands that from Dave Grohl's mouth Kurt and him were into (i.e. Celtic Frost) on this collection. This must have been a Courtney Love controlled release. Ah our generation's Yoko Ono.

Bootlegs with this song DON'T have that garbled error. This boxset is a total gyp. Get the demos from a friend that already has the boxset. If you're any kind of a Nirvana fan, I'm sure you already have \\"If You Must\\" and \\"Pen Cap Chew\\". And maybe even the awesome \\"Sifting\\" instrumental jam with the wah-wah guitar solo. Oh wait, that wasn't included here. And to top it all off, the sound is totally defective on the Sub Pop \\"In Bloom\\" music video. Let me repeat: There is absolutely no sound during said music video when there should be. I'm sure many of you will counter this with the argument that there are \\"hidden gems\\" in the boxset, but any amount of defects (ESPECIALLY on a major label release) is too much for people that have shelled out seventy dollars for this.Buy at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"NIRVANA SMELLS LIKE CRAP","review":"I love Nirvana one of my favorite bands.

There's also a couple tracks of the band jamming to nothing particular while Koban wails for 9 minutes. Alas, there are a couple jems on here, but not emough to fill up even one of the three CD's.

Not all the songs are radio-ready but there are some that are worthy of air play.There are 61 tracks on the first 3 discs.The 4th is a dvd disc that starts off showing Nirvana in 1988 rocking it out in Krist's moms house in Aberdeen. The dvd also has Dave Grohl's 1st show with Nirvana and it also has the concert debut of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\".

Couldn't they find some better live stuff from 92' or ANYTHING from 93'. For half of the dvd, Dave Grohl isn't even playing drums. I can appreciate a few home video clips of them rehearsing early in their career, but this dvd has way to much of that, and it kinda sucks. Although, I will happily say that the cd's are really, really good (as long as yours doesn't have errors on it), and complete the bands discography.

Nothing can erase the importance Nirvana had on pop culture, and their place near the top of the rock pantheon is secure. But this box set is an abomination. Three discs of alternate takes, demos, doodles, live tracks, etc., never congeal to show us the genius behind the depressive. Instead, they make a case for Cobain's all too fallible humanity. Disc One is nearly unlistenable in its entirety. Disc Two barely passable, and Disc Three the only one anyone need own of the three. And the DVD, important as it might be as a document, is simple bait to get you to fork over your hard-earned cash. Listen, kids, these half-baked cuts aren't going to bring him back.

It was recommended online (can't remember by whom), but it didn't do much for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A failure.","review":"I am a fan of Amos Oz's novels, but I found \\"My Michael\\" bleak and unrewarding. Having recently read Oz's memoirs of his childhood, the parallels between the young couple and Oz's own parents are evident. This makes it even stranger to me that Hannah is such an immature personality, which I believe is the reason the novel fails."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"This classic novel by Amos Oz is a good introduction to this brilliant Israeli author. Unlike most translations of foreign books into English, Oz, who speaks fluent English, closely supervises the translation of his work and therefore the English translations of his work beautifully capture the rhythm of his writing in the original Hebrew. Oz is rumored to be a front-runner for the 2009 Nobel Prize in literature, and this book serves as an excellent introduction to his lyrically beautiful work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A complement to Love and Darkness","review":"If I had encountered this haunting, atmospheric novel before readingA Tale of Love and Darkness, I don't think I would have known what to make of it: other than a slow-moving journey of a depressed young wife whose sexual fantasies (and shopping spurts) are about all that keep her going through tedious years with a dull husband and a matter-of-fact child she can't relate to. But ATLD is the key. The novel and the memoir complement each other. When you see that Hannah and David are, more or less, the author's parents and young Yair is Oz, then the window to the past that Hannah begs fortune to keep transparent lets you see clearly what will happen to them in the end, even if it is off stage. You should read both books for a fuller appreciation of each one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for all to read...","review":"After I read this wonderful book, I finally realized the price of freedom, and how I took this gift that my forefathers gave to me all for granted.

I wasn't just listening to the story, I was there with David as he travelled, conquered fears, hid, and struggled his way to Denmark. My life consisted of getting through my mornings in order to rush home and keep going with the story. From my safe and warm home in Vancouver, BC, I learned a little bit about compassion, bravery, and determination from this story. Beautifully written.

If anyone one who was unfamiliar with the tranformers saw this in jet mode they would think that it was a real model plane. Anyone who objects to the oversized missles should direct their complaints to the United States government and not to Hasbro. Although I don't understand why they couldn't have included the original missles because the adults are the ones who are going to be buying this. (A misguided mother probably wouldn't see the value in spending [the money] for a toy airplane.)

Skywarp is one of FIVE Jet Decepticons (Thrust, Dirge, Thundercracker, Starscream, and Ramjet). Skywarp is very close to the original with only a couple modifications that have been changed due to government regulations (larger sized missles to keep young children under 3 from choking for example). However what really matters is the toy itself which has the exact same dimensions as the orginal. Skywarp will also increase in value if kept MISB like the originals."},{"rating":"2","title":"A WISH COME TRUE","review":"WHEN I WAS A LITTLE KID I WANTED SKYWARP SO MUCH, BUT I NEVER GOT HIM.

I wish this Model wasn't so hard to find; it's really the best one for me!

Her assiginment was to report on a historical fiction book. She chose this book because it purportedly had \\"romance\\" in it. I found it far removed from any historical content. In fact, the romance is actually an abusive father-daughter relationship. One half the book takes place in England, the other half in the U.S. The Revolutiion or any historical event is tangential at best and it veers so far from having historical content that it is almost laughable.

(At this point, i might add that i spotted several good places for Martha's story to end which would have improved the novel.) But the greatest disappointment for me was that i was NOT wild over the title character, Martha Peake, as mcgrath and his narrator so wants us to be.

Hardly!","review":"The Washington Post reviewer said this book was unputdownable. Yet I had to force myself to continue reading after about the first 50 pages. It took McGrath the first half of the book to establish that Harry Peake, although basically a goodheart, was driven insane by his alcoholism and guilt, etc. Enough already -- I got the picture! While Martha was sympathetic in the first half, she became annoying in the second half. She brought about her own downfall with her obsessive (vs. rational) concern about her father.

There were certain sections that were suspenseful, but on the whole, it was a difficult novel to finish. I found the constant switching between the points of view of Ambrose and William to the story in America, and then back to Harry to be confusing and misleading. While some may consider this well-written, I thought that McGrath overdid a lot of his descriptions. The characters were fully drawn, but I did not find any of them particularly likeable, with the exception of Sara Rind.

For readers unfamiliar withKupperman's work, let me clarify. After reading some of thesecartoons, you will not be able to engage any other activity with anyseriousness at all. For example, you may read a strip aboutUnderpants-on-his-head-man, and then proceed directly to your morningpaper, however, after Underpants-on-his-head-man, you will have anadded insight into how ridiculous things really are and be unable totake anything Vladimir Putin, and certainly George Bush Junior &Al Gore, says seriously.This book is good for a rainy day, its goodfor a sunny day in the park.

I hadn't seen the drawings -- the idea alone tickled me. Now I've seen the art and I'm knocked silly.Michael Kupperman is a genius. This collection of work is profoundly inspired. He's created superheros the likes of which have never been seen before: Underpants-on-his-head-man; Dr. Slappy; Rip Lazybones and His Futuristic Wonderbed; and Professor Gastropod to name only a few. And superheros aren't necessarily his strong suit. Part surreal, part non-sequitur, all inspired. The humor comes from the concepts, the dialogue, and the art itself.If you're a fan of humor that lands in the ballpark with Gary Larson, Monty Python, The Onion, Robert Smigel, Smack the Pony, National Lampoon etc., this collection is for you.

You won't want this if you dont own or havent watch series 1 - 5! Its that simple.If you do own them however, or you have seen those seasons, how can you not complete the experience without Season 6, the complete series, the final season, The End?After watching all 18 (?) episodes, include two, double length episodes, you will be left completely satisfied, or, ironically, completely Lost.But its alright, don't fret! Because now that there are no more spoilers, you can scour the internet for all those spoilers you swore you wouldnt ruin!But quite honestly, I was satisfied to complete my many, many hours of Lost with the last season box set!A very happy purchase, one Id recommend for any Lost fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheese Fest Extraordinaire","review":"\\"The island it was mythical, but in the end they died.

I'm using my S1-S3 DVD's as coasters. Wasted potential, wasted characters and a waste of time! Good riddance indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Season 6","review":"I have to be honest, after reading so many negative reviews for this season I was nervous to watch it. I have been watching Lost since the 1st season was released onto DVD and have enjoyed it immensely! After watching the 6th season I am completely satisfied with it and the ending. The 6th season wasn't as amazing as some of the others, but it was still great. The series as a whole has been one of the greatest shows I have ever had the pleasure of watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful end to a fantastic series","review":"I have never been more hooked on and obsessed with a television series as I was with LOST. When the final season came along I was skeptical that it would be able to live up to the hype and provide a proper ending to the epic tale of science vs. faith, not to mention the classic ensemble of characters, that we've followed for six years. Now that the series is over I have to say that I am blown away; the finale in particular exceeded my expectations. A beautiful and satisfying ending. This was a great season filled with a fine balance of tragedy, comedy, adventure, horror, etc etc. I highly recommend not only this season but the series as a whole; it's one wild ride you won't forget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy and disappointing","review":"The final season of 'LOST' was a weakly written and character centered wrap up of a great story that tried and failed to tie 5 seasons together. The story moved from being plot centered and left many seemingly important questions unanswered or even addressed. My wife and I were very disappointed with the entire last season and I still wonder about many plot twists that were ignored by the writers. In retrospect, it would have been better to stop watching after the conclusion of season 5.Totally disgusted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost 6 not quite what I hoped for","review":"I had hoped that the explanatory banner on each episode of the television episodes of Lost's Season 6 would be included in the DVD, but they weren't. Otherwise, I was as caught up in it as I was in the preceding seasons. The quality of the DVD was excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost....","review":"wow, so disappointed and what a depressing ending. If I wanted to see the dead walk into the light, I'd watch Ghost Whisperer. And I won't mention that back in year 1 the producers insisted purgatory had nothing to do with this show.the best moment of the show? Vincent laying next to Jack. I expected a few more happy moments for 2.5 hrs of TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST SEASON YET!","review":"I can't believe LOST is over--what a journey. In my opinion, Season 6 has been the best season yet! Not to offend but I think a lot of the people who \\"hated\\" the ending didn't truly understand it. I know that many questions were unanswered but I think we all saw that coming and I think it was amazing that even up to the last ten minutes the writers still had us all guessing! I am totally impressed with it and could not have asked for a more perfect ending!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down!!!","review":"I really thought they were going to answers some more of the questions. Isn't that what they kept claiming on the commercials for the final episodes? I don't watch TV to have someone force their religious beliefs on me. I watched Lost for the quality entertainment it provided, and that was not present in the last episode. It really was a lame way to tie it all up. Online they are referring to it as a bait and switch scheme, and I can't agree more. Where were the answers??? LAME!! If I wanted to think about what it all means I would read a book. I watch TV to be spoon fed. I don't want to assume my own conclusions. That's retarded; basically I could assume whatever I want. I can read into it whatever I like. That's such a sorry cop-out. Well that being said I think the first seasons were great, and then they let it slip out of their hands at the end. They tried to make it something it wasn't. Well obviously I hated the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could un-watch this season","review":"The first three seasons of Lost were amazing. Season 4 was pretty good, and Season 5 was good. Season 6, however, was a complete disappointment. The ending was a total let-down and didn't explain anything. If anything, it made the series make less sense than before. If you're a Lost fan and have yet to watch season 6, I would recommend just not watching it. Make up your own ending, because it will be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOST","review":"i loved the dvd.

Whew, what an amazing finale. It was better than I ever imagined it would be...not since season 1 has an episode so deeply focused on these characters we love. It handled each story with grace and class and ended with the theme from the beginning as strong as ever, we must find a way to live together or we die alone.I can't express how satisfying the end was, and the way the flash sideways was used to tie everything up was just genius. Many of these actors did their best work in season 6, Terry O'Quinn and Matthew Fox in particular.Nothing but love for this show and season 6 now ranks as second only to season 1 for me...classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOST was anything but typical from day one","review":"Now, I can certainly understand why some people would want the final batch of episodes to be nothing more than an unrelenting assault of answers, but in the end, wouldn't that have made LOST just as plain and predictable as the rest of the junk on television nowadays? No, this series has been so much more than that, and considering it's consistently remained fresh season in, season out, I would expect nothing less for its final hurrah.Full 5-Star review here.

The ending that is supposed to answer all the questions only leaves more to be explained.

Review","review":"What a disappointment. After 5 years of build-up weaving incredible mysteries and all that hype, the writers had nothing, but a \\"Oh look, there's Chuck E. Cheese\\" ending. They wasted half the season on the meaningless Flash Sideways world and answered little to nothing of the mysteries they utilized to keep us coming back for 6 years. Talk about a Long Con!!!! Darlton should be vilified and never allowed near a TV or Motion Picture script again.Best thing they can do with this Show is lock it away in the famous Disney-Vault for 20 or 30 years and then pawn it off as \\"Nostalgia\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best...","review":"LOST Season 6 is disappointing after they had so many great seasons before it. With the way the storyline turns out in the last one to two seasons, I was almost embarassed to be a fan.

I'm wondering what on earth makes this collector's edition $100 more than the non-collectors edition? Sure it has 1 extra disc, but is it gold plated???I'll wait until the price is lower. I'm just not ready to spend this much, even though I really enjoyed the series and have all the previous seasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dropped the Ball","review":"I was enamored with this show until the end of this season. To use a football analogy, it was as though they carried the ball diligently and with only a few hiccups until the one-yard-line and then dropped it. I felt as though it they were more concerned with comforting their audience then tying up the plot. I felt like they basically took everything that had happened over the last five seasoned and made it all totally irrelevant in the final episode, most of which, made little or no sense.I would still recommend this show as a whole and I had a great time watching the other seasons and watching the characters develop, but I was monumentally disappointed with this ending, especially when the rest of the show was a great display of creativity and courage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Final episode was a joke!","review":"We were all waiting for secrets to be revealed, but they weren't. The ones they did reveal were lame. This was the worst finale I have ever watched. It ranked up there with the final episode of Seinfeld.I'm hoping this was all just a sick joke and the real final episode will be coming out soon. I can't wait to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Trash","review":"The final season was a waste. After the finale you'll be scratching your headed wondering why you wasted so many hours of your life with this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Also disapointed","review":"Like many other I also felt this season was a major let-down. It really was a red herring, but that doesn't take away from all of the great times and memories I have from watching the series as a whole"},{"rating":"1","title":"I want all that time back","review":"I have to count myself among those who, in the final 15 minutes of the final episode, felt like I had been royally conned. Essentially, you can watch the first season and the last episode or two and get as much out of it as watching the entire series. Yes, there were some exciting, intriguing aspects to the show, but to find out that they were ultimately just filler with no real point throws a bucket of water over any of the \\"good\\" parts. It's not the lack of ultimate answers, it's the lack of any resolution to the stories. People who go on about the characters seem to forget that the characters are pretty stock and only developed through the mysteries and action on the show. Otherwise, they were pretty bland."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a great ending to a good series","review":"This show was one of the best on tv for 6 years. All the twists and turns and all the questions you wanted answered was not solved. You had more questions than you had answers. It was really a weak ending. A good season but it ended flat. This svd is good to have if you loved the show and want the end to the collection. It could have been so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another \\"a shame it's over\\" series","review":"Once again, advertisers and/or the typical viewing public can't sustain an intelligent drama series more than half a dozen seasons.

Of course, the DVD itself is complete and functions exactly as you'd expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOST: THE FINAL SEASON","review":"Like most watchers, I held my breath for the final season; then promptly forgot about it and later, in a cleaning spree, took a request for the DVD, Season Six, from the top of my Want List. While I am convinced, in the end, that the writers and producers of \\"LOST\\" made the story up as they went along, I would be among the last to deny that the series produced weekly, far-out and over-excited theorizing, much eager waiting, and a lot of fun. I would not have dreamed of being anywhere on Tuesday nights, other than in front of the screen.....Or was it, indeed, Tuesday nights? It might have aired on Friday....Nah.

The reason movies like Sixth Sense or others were watched over and over was they made you wondered how did you miss the clues the first time you watched the movie.Lost was an insult on the face of all the audience and we all know no answers were given and the show ended abruptly. So, I would not buy Lost final season Iam happy with 1 to 5 seassons"},{"rating":"1","title":"A STINKER OF A SEASON AND A LET DOWN","review":"Despite strong performers and high production values, LOST's Final Season was a HUGE let down.I'll pretend it was some strange \\"flash-upside-down\\". I'd rather be left with unresolved mystery than an insulting, lame 'let's walk into the light' ending that diminishes the very parts of the program that were enthralling for 5 seasons.Well, they made their money I guess. Now they're crying all the way to the bank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"I loved Lost with all my heart. But the last season was an insult. Don't let those guys have any more of your money. They are only in it for money now, as you can clearly see. Don't fall for it.

The overall plot of Lost is not nearly as important as the endearing, realistic and memorable characters. This was an excellent season for the show and while the end didn't tie up all the loose ends, it tied up enough and gave us an excellent end for the characters of the show. Also, the dvd has a bonus for those of you, myself included, who were wandering how Walt would play into things.One of the best shows ever made. Do yourself a favor and check it out. If you like a decent drama and some mystery, you are going to be in for a treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great build up, but a somewhat disapointing ending....","review":"Season Six was excellent and kept you on the edge of your seat. A fantastic rollercoaster ride until the end.. Which in my opinion was a cop out by the writers. Chances are if you're purchasing the BD you've seen it and know what your getting into. The discs are excellent with great sound and picture. Most importantly the set includes a mini epilouge \\"The new man in charge\\" while this may not completely satiate your thirst for more information, I thought it was done well and answered a few of the many lingering questions. If you're a fan of the series who wants to complete your collection then go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total cop out","review":"I invested so much time into the years this show was on, and was anxiously anticipating an exciting and unique ending.

Thank you for the answers to the island, JJ Abrams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't understand the Negativity!","review":"I for one loved the final season of the show. I watched the first season snd part of the second season, when they first aired, thinking they were so-so. Years went by and I watched the second season finale at a friends place on dvd. This was my turning point. Season 3 brought Juliet and it's been a roller coaster ride ever since. I also love the fact that all the island's mysteries were not explained. Why would I go back and watch all the episodes if I I already know everything. The island was it's own complex character. It's a shame that many Lost Fans fall into the generic category of wanting all the answer's. Heaven forbid that they think or not have everything handed to them on a silver platter, wrapped in a bow. In conclusion, the last episode was beautiful. I felt my own closure with the show and the series, and can't think of any other way I would have wanted the show to end. Great series that will be terribly missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad to see it go","review":"A beautiful and non disappointing ending, unlike the end of seinfeld and the supranos where the ending just didnt live up to the show.

Action paced, amazing acting, big budget. But, already in Season Three, it was clear (to me, at least) that the writers did not know where they were going.Also, the producers probably turned the process of casting into a big money game. That's the simple explanation for the huge quantity of characters, even new ones appearing in Season Six! (you can almost visualize the scene: an agent asking the producers: \\"How much do I pay to get my client in the show?\\")The producers sensed they got a steady following (rightly so, judging the so many great reviews) and thought they could get away with murder. So, why bothering explaining the \\"hundreds\\" of unansewred questions? We just tell them that \\"what matters is the journey\\".To me, the ending was a complete swindle on a faithful audience, one that stuck to the show even after the atrocious Season Three."},{"rating":"1","title":"Illogical end","review":"This was the most improper and \\"magical\\" ending I have ever seen from a television series, that started out beautifully through scientific examinations of the plane crash, attempts at community building, and tried to give us some faith in extra-ordinary events in character's lives, and faith in the island's history.I did not have any problem understanding both sides - science and faith, but the ending in LOST season 6 is pathetic by any standard, since it did not explain anything through either science or faith, but pure magic, which made no sense unless there was something or someone causing the magic.In the end, Locke (the \\"faith\\" guy) is dead, Jack (the \\"science\\" guy) is confused and tries to kill himself, and the \\"others\\" (native inhabitants of island) had their leader (Jacob) killed and the island sinks to the bottom of the ocean.

The storytelling was remarkable and first rate...for five years. Season six is beyond poor. I can't decide whether the writers lost their nerve or whether they ever had any intention of resolving the myriad of plotlines and story points in the first place. And I don't care.Imagine a long joke, with an elaborate set up...and no punchline. Essentially, a colossal waste of time.While I loved the series up until Season 6, and remind myself that, often, 'It's the journey, not the destination'- but who expected at the end of the 'journey', to be thrown off a cliff? The 'extras' they will include on the DVDs are meaningless. They've proved how little they respect their audience. Who'd pay for more of that??At one time, I imagined watching the show again and again...but I'll sell my copies of seasons 1-5 on eBay.

Writer exhaustion? Hollywood gone amok? A cop-out? Throughout the 6-year run, like many other reviewers, I had my suspicions about the writers doing a mass improvisation from episode to episode, but I was usually willing to go along for the ride (hell, it was entertaining and engrossing!), looking forward to see how our heros would deal with their latest fix. Even throughout seasons 5 & 6 I was totally into it, watching what I suspected to be some kind of parallel universe unfolding, with the twist of the characters slowly coming together in the later episodes. Of course everything logically pointed to some sort of supernatural ending, but \\"logic\\" never struck me as being a word to describe Lost. Something more creative was called for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why waste 6 seasons?","review":"What started out as a great series eagerly followed by fans was made into a mockery by this last season. It is as if the writers all quit and then the producer told everyone to wrap it up in a hurry and they developed a quick, unsatisfying ending. Rather they had made a 2 hour movie if that was the intended way of the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost was a Masterpiece from Start to End","review":"While this season started off slow, boy did it end perfectly. Many people writing reviews on here completely misunderstood the end, and I am sure if they would re-watch the ending and actually listen they would see what actually happened. The Finale was impeccable. Like always, it is open to some interpretation, but all in all it was as about as satisfying as it could be. The finale had a twist that NO one saw coming which is hard to believe as there were millions of theories about the way the show would end, and the writers were able to fool everyone. If you have never watched the show, you can not start here. You have to start at disk one and watch every episode. This show is a journey with some very deep messages and in the end, you feel like you have known these people forever, which only makes it harder to let them go."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Very Sad.....","review":"I'm not going to repeat all the problems and praises of this series but suffice to say.....So Very Sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost Season 6: the Black Stain of the series","review":"I sincerely wish I didn't have to give the final season my favorite show of all time a bad review, but despite all the good episodes like Ab Aeterno, Across the Sea and Happily Ever After, this season was ultimately ruined by the travesty that is The End.

It's nothing more than a daytime soap opera with a bigger budget to allow for more special effects. There were never any rules of the world that was created other than there are no rules, so essentially anything goes from episode 1 of season 1. Lame! That's exactly what happened throughout, ideas were made up and implemented as the show moved along, and over the course of 6 seasons the \\"geniuses\\" behind this lame show found themselves boxed in a corner with no winning way out. They were actually boxed in a corner long before and at a certain point just kept getting more \\"lost\\" in their box to a point of no return other than more and more garbage. The ending was actually fitting for such a stupid show."},{"rating":"2","title":"writer's strike","review":"If I'm not mistaken, the producers of LOST had a 6 year contract, which would officially end in 2010. However, the writer's strike in 2008 caused a lot of complications for just about every TV show. It shortened season 5 and I'm guessing that must have had an impact on season 6 as well. They had less time to wrap up ALL THE ANSWERS. In my opinion, they did the best they could with what time they had left. I've been a LOST fan from the very beginning and would never sell out this truly amazing tv show."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dull ending...","review":"I TOTALLY agree with the reviewer who said the ending of the series (and the final season as a whole) RUINED ALL OTHER SEASONS. Yeah, ALL other seasons became senseless.What a lack of imagination: THEY WERE ALL DEAD. Yes, that's the answer to all the mysteries. They were dead... duh!!! A six year old child could come with a final like that. When you're dead you can time travel all you want, talk to smoke monsters, see things that don't exist and even ressurect to die again. Wow, how come I haven't thought of that before! Amazing writers these guys...Come on, they had you believing for 5 years, 5 years, that it would not be something so stupid as this. The \\"they are all dead\\" theory was the one everybody came up with in the first place, at the very begining of season 1. And they had you believing it would be something TOTALLY diferent. And you believed, because \\"it was such a stupid ending, of course they would come with something better than that\\". Well, they didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hurry, they pulled the plug!","review":"Season Six - Well to me the final season was a complete dud. It felt as though the writers happily went on their way never planning an end to the show.

All writers scrambled with silly ideas to end the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Final Season Smash","review":"What a great final season for \\"Lost\\". It is fantastic that they got to wrap up the series and give the viewer an opportunity to unravel many of the mysteries that have puzzled us since the first season.

For me, Ab Aeterno is ep2 of season 5, and Juliet blew up LOST at the end of season 5. OMG, season 6 was such a major letdown. You could really tell, ep to ep, that season 6 was written nowhere near as well as or with as much zeal as ANY of the first 5 seasons.I will buy season 6, to complete my LOST series on DVD, only because I need ep9 (Ab Aeterno)... but I will wait until it hits rock-bottom pricing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Television","review":"I began watching Lost and enjoyed the adventures, cliff hangers, and beautiful scenery. Finding out new things about the characters and making discoveries on the island was a great week to week adventure. Then Season 6 happened. It was pure drivel.

However, when I selected the audio commentary for the first episode, \\"LAX\\", there was no audio. I tried various ways to get it to play but, in each case, there was no sound.I received Disc Two from NetFlix.com a couple of days later and its four episodes also played normally. However, when I tried to play the episode \\"Dr Linus\\" with its audio commentary, there was no sound.I also rented the last disc of Fringe Season 2 from Blockbuster. I played the season finale with commentary and it played just fine so the problem is confined to the Lost DVD box set only. I am so glad I didn't buy the box set, as I would normally have done in the past. It would have been a colossal waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the island?","review":"If you're a fan, and someone who never watched this series asked you \\"What is the island?\\", after watching 6 seasons, would you have an answer?LOST is a well-written, well-acted series with some great moments, but the reason for initially being drawn into the show is this central question. If you're expecting some explanation based in reality, you will be disappointed with LOST.Watch the DVDs and enjoy, but skip the final season and make up your own ending.

I won't even get into inconsistencies, red-herrings, omissions, and mistakes----I think that the 'brain trust' who led me astray with the futile hope that some creativity could be salvaged from Network media should simply be ignored in all future endeavors.

This warmer is activated by the shock produced from clicking the metal disk- however, it is also activated by slight bumps to the diaper bag or even by sqeezing it to hard when you pick it up! The idea is great, but this warmer is not worth the frustration of warm bottles three hours too soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Idea","review":"This warmer is great when you are on the go. I love that it doesn't need to be plugged into a lighter--going out doesn't mean you are always near a car. It will take a few extra minutes to heat the bottle, so don't expect instant results. I haven't had any problems returning the warmer to the gel state. We've boiled it many times (mostly because my daughter and husband want to show it off to our visiting friends). The only problem I have is that I need two more!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"As a bottle warmer it stinks, but...","review":"I bought this to warm bottles that were currently being kept cool with ice packs. In that case, the thing did not work. It got warm enough to knock the chill off the milk, but didn't come close to making the bottle warm enough that my son would actually drink it. However, I switched my approach so now, if I know I'll be giving the bottle in an hour or less, I'll heat the bottle at home and put the already warm bottle in this bottle warmer to KEEP the bottle warm. In that case, the thing works like a charm. I do the same thing to keep baby food warm. It really does stink if you're trying to heat something that's cold. I imagine that if the bottle started out room temp, it might get fairly warm. And if the bottle or food starts out warm, this will keep it warm. For that last reason, I love this thing. I use it at least weekly. But for an actually warmer... to make something warmER, it stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless...","review":"I bought this item as we take a lot of car trips with our little one.

Don't buy this it is truly useless!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have","review":"We never had a problem with this product. It was easy to use and served its purpose. Yes, you have to plan ahead by 10-15 minutes - but if you're a parent - you're good at that! I highly recommend this bottle warmer."},{"rating":"2","title":"You don't have to boil it.","review":"I just purchased this to replace my J.L. Childress bottle wrap. I haven't had a chance to test it yet so I don't know how good it is. But, you don't have to boil it. You can reactivate it by putting in your sterilizer. I don't think you can put it in a microwave sterilizer but my steam sterilizer will reactive it and I believe an electric sterilizer will work as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy this item...","review":"Maybe I just purchased a defective one but I took it out twice to use and both times had a problem. The 1st time I was no where where I could heat a bottle and when I went into my diaper bag to get it the stupid thing had already warmed and cooled so my poor child screamed until we found a place that would heat the bottle.Boiled it again figuring maybe we didnt keep it in long enough the 1st time and then put it in the closet. When I took it out to use it it was already hard..apparently it had warmed/cooled on its own again. I threw it out and desided to buy the 8oz cans of ready to feed to take out with me. This way my baby (now 6 months) drinks her bottle room temp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother!","review":"We go to a lot of outside events (car shows) where a bottle can't be warmed so easily. I bought this bottle warmer after reading the ratings and thought that I could prevent the metal disc from activating itself. The first time I used this warmer I was very careful how I placed it in my diaper bag and I was also very careful not to bump my diaper bag. When I went to use it, I was very surprised to see that it activated itself. I did give this bottle warmer a chance.........I tried it about 6 times and it only worked one time. Needless to say, I returned it to Babies R Us. If you do decide to go against this rating, please keep your receipt. I think you would have to put this warmer in a steel case before placing it in your diaper bag in order for it not to activate itself! It would be a great invention if it wouldn't activate itself! I also wouldn't mind boiling the bag if the product would work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very convenient when traveling","review":"I just came back from a road trip and this came in very handy. I have reheated the pack back to its original state time and time again and I'm still happy with its performance. It really does get quite hot. The only complaint I would have is that it doesn't heat the bottom of the bottle so it probably takes a little longer than I would have liked. But it does what it's supposed to do and works great on baby food jars as well. If you're heating cold milk bottles, however, I would use 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Worthless","review":"I got this warmer because I often need to warm a bottle while shopping or hiking when a power supply is not available. I knew it would take a while to warm up but it takes at least 15 minutes to warm a bottle up sufficiantly. That is if it didnt already go off before you needed it. No matter how carefully I pack it, the warmer gets set off before I ever get a chance to use it. Don't rely on this item or you will have one cranky baby without a warm bottle."},{"rating":"1","title":"this thing is not worth the trouble","review":"I bought this for the times I went places were it would be hard to have my daughter's bottle warmed like the mall, the zoo, etc. However, I have found like most of the other reviewers that it takes a long time to warm up and it activates on its own. For example just this morning it activated twice on its own and I didn't touch the disk, once was after I boiled it I was going to put it away and the second time was when I was trying to put it into the blue cover and it activated again. And the other down side is that you do have to boil it to reuse it so if you are going to be out for a long time where you might need to feed your child more than once you are still looking for a way to get the bottle warmed up. I wish I would have read the reviews before I bought this, I just happened to be in the store and saw this and thought it would be convienent, oh how I was wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Buy","review":"I was going on a trip with my 3 month old across the county and bought this for the plane ride. As far as heating bottles, this does not work at all. You have to boil the bag after each use and let it cool down completely before trying to use it again which is a real hassle. It also activates when you don't want it to. Most importantly, it doesn't heat the bottle at all. It's a neat product, and I would recomend this for using as cordless heating pad for your sore muscles...but not for heating bottles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"I absolutely love these! I used them for my daughter 6 years ago when she was small and now use them for my baby son. They are the best thing for keeping a bottle warm while you go out for shopping trips. I do not know what I would do without these as I have never found a product that even comes close to the convenience of these bottle warmers."},{"rating":"2","title":"warms perfectly","review":"This works great for our hockey games. Warms to the perfect temperature and doesn't overwarm if you leave it in for more than the 15 min. The only thing is you have to handle them a little carefully so they don't accidentally activate."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I Must...","review":"I purchased this warmer because I am on the go all the time and often feed my baby boy while we are out and about. I have found that it is more trouble than it is worth. It is only good for a single warming and it takes about 15-20 (sometimes longer) to warm the bottle. Also, I use the drop-in system, so I have to warm just the bag...it won't warm at all if the bag in already in the bottle. I find it is just easier to carry a large big gulp sized cup in my car and fill it with hot water at a gas station or coffee place. It warms the bottle up in less than half the time. If I have no other options, I would boil this down and take it with me, but only if I had to. It has been sitting in my kitchen drawer now for a few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"semi-happy","review":"i thought that this would be a great product to have since i am out often so it just makes feeding easier. my daughter likes her formula warm. the first time i tried it, it did take longer than i thought it would. i only warmed 4 oz and it took at least 5 minutes. i found that it helped the process if you swirl the bottle while in the warmer around a couple of times. my one major complaint is that i have taken it with me a couple of times and found that it would accidentally warm up in my diaper bag. it turns out that the activator disc seemed to have become VERY sensitive after using it. it basically just needs to be touched, not even \\"clicked\\" twice, like the directions say to start the process. so when i needed it, it was of no use. i am going to return this and exchange it for another one. i am hoping that this one is damaged. i am going to try my luck again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money!","review":"When I used this for the first few times it worked wonderfully! Then, it started hardening on it's own.....anytime from when I had just boiled it and laid it out to cool off on the counter to when it was in the diaper bag. So, when I went to use it, it was of no use to me. I found it MUCH easier to just go through a fast food drive through and ask for a glass of hot water, and warm the bottle that way. If I still had the box this came in I'd return it to Babies-R-Us. But, I don't have the box, so I'm stuck with a useless product. Bottom line is not to waste your money on this product until it's improved dramatically."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"Very useful if you can transport it without \\"clicking\\" the disc that activates the warming solution, and if you do it is useless if you are somewhere without a stove and a pot of boiling water. But it does warm bottles really well, just have to learn to be extra careful with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hard to use","review":"I bought this warmer thinking it would be easy but like other reviewers stated the liner gets hard too quickly and it takes too long to heat up. I was very disappointed and returned it to Babies R Us. I bought one that you can hook up to your cigarette lighter and it works much quicker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes too long to warm milk, and it's only lukewarm","review":"I bought this to warm up refrigerated breastmilk when traveling. I only tried it once as it did not work very well in warming cold milk. When you press the button, you can feel the item warming up, but it never got really hot. After 15 minutes of warming, the bottle of milk was only lukewarm. Not very good if your baby prefers warmer milk. I did try the unit out before traveling, and it did work well warming up room temp water for formula milk. I had better success in warming up cold milk with carrying around a thermos of piping hot water and an empty plastic container to sit the bottle of milk in it and then pouring the hot water into the container when needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!!!","review":"This is a terrible product! The idea is great, however the actual product is not. It worked once & then would harden on it's own. I tried a few times & boiled the product to it's liquid form only to have it harden on me before I could actually use it. Don't waste your money on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Time use!","review":"I bought this in mind for obviously when Im out to keep bottles warm. 1st of all as soon as you mesh the button it starts to warm-a bit of a wait(okay, a long time of a wait) & then that is it!

Pointless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heats Lukewarm Bottles Fast; Takes Forever w/ Chilled Ones","review":"If your bottles or the water you use is not cold or frozen, and you are able to prepare your bottles just before heating, this gadget may work for you. However, due to the nature of the cans our formula comes in, we have to premake and store our bottles in a thermal container with ice packs. During our recent air travel, we gave up on this thing and finally asked the steward for some hot water (which heated the bottle in 5 min). This warmer simply takes too long and didn't heat up bottles as warm as our son prefers them - which created bottle battles...not fun when you're traveling during Thanksgiving:-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Product!","review":"I bought this based upon the good reviews this has had, but it is a terrible product! The first time I put this product into boiled water for 10 minutes to enable me to use it again, it split, leaking the crystals all over my counter top. It ruined the pan that I had it in, and meant a lot of cleaning up - who knows if they are toxic or not?

Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't know how this works, it just does!!!","review":"I LOVE this bottle warmer! What a godsend! My husband sent me to Babies R Us to buy a better insulated container for our daughter's bottles and bought this (though, admittedly, I was VERY skeptical). It works exactly the way it has been described, and I have had no problems whatsoever in getting it to reliquify or warm up again. This is great if you are a busy mom, out running errands for the day, or just going to the park or mall for a couple hours to get some exercise.I'm going to buy another as a spare and this will definitely be a gift I will give to every new mom to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised!","review":"I was looking for a way to warm bottles on the go. The options are very limited. I didn't want to have one that required electricity or a car plug in. I saw this item online and decided to take a chance. None of the reviews I read prior to buying told me how it worked. Essentially, there is a pack that you wrap around the bottle. You \\"activate\\" a warming chemical reaction by pushing a button. Then, the liquid changes to a solid while simultaneously warming the bottle. It works great! I used it 3 times last week and it worked perfectly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea, But....","review":"I own one of these things and have used it once. To be perfectly honest, it is rather a pain. Yeah, it's cool that it heats up and all, but boiling the thing for 10 mins to get it back to its gel state sucks. It is also not very lightweight. I don't know about you, but with the amount of stuff I have in the diaper bag, the last thing I need is this thing weighing me down. I have found that keeping a clean bottle, a bottle of water at room temp and some powder formula (save your scoops) work the best for feedings on the road. And if you are at a resturant, it is far easier to just ask for some warm water. Then you don't have to come home and remember to boil this stupid thing. I wouldn't buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great in theory, bad in practice","review":"I too thought this was a great idea--in fact, a friend had first introduced me to it, so I thought it must be good. It worked ok the first time, but then after I tried reusing it, the chemical reaction would start with the slightest movement (I was very careful handling and letting the thing cool); still I tried with variable luck to get it to work. The last straw--about my sixth and final attempt--was pulling the supposedly liquefied gel pack out of the insulator to find it had leaked and crystalized, making it totally unusable. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money. Not worth 1 star.","review":"This bottle warmer was good for it's first use, but you have to boil it before each use thereafter. 99% of the time it started the heating process on it's own before I got it out of the diaper bag, rendering it useless. The final time I boiled it, a little piece got stuck to the pan...even though I was stirring it constantly. It was a mess and hard to clean off the counter, cabinet and floor. I took it to the trash immediately, on the way I got it all over my dining area rug. The gel hardened up on my rug and I can't get it off. It's just not worth it. If you plan on formula feeding, I recommend the enfamil single serving packs that you add to room temperature bottled water. They are inexpensive and much easier than worrying about keeping premade formula cold and warming it up on the go."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the hassle","review":"Thought this would be great for quick trips to the mall or doctors office where you really can't ask for hot water. It is so aggravating because the button is so sensitive, it activates all the time. Then you can't reuse it without boiling it. It never gets the bottle warm anyway. Might as well just let the cool bottle come to room temperature on its own if hot water is not available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm up the bottle ON THE GO could not be easier!","review":"We needed something to warm up a bottle while travelling or walking around town(s). This works great. All you need to do is wrap the pack around your bottle, stuff it inside of the neoprene cover, and pop the little re-usable \\"button\\" that activates the solution inside of the pack. It instantly gets hot and you're bottle should be ready in about 10 minutes or less. Once you get home, just boil a pot of water and drop the pack into the boiling water for about 5 minutes and the pack is re-set for the next time.

The signature moment in his career was when he politely asked Bill Clinton about the FBI's allegations that the President had accepted bribes from the People's Republic of China. President Clinton told Donaldson to shut up and sit down and Donaldson meekly crawled back to his seat and never raised the issue (or any other challenging question) again.You would never believe that Donaldson's career exemplified that sort of cowardice from this self serving book. Instead of being a bullying member of a herd - never striking out with something original, never speaking truth to power, only turning on unpopular Presidents - this book shows that Donaldson thinks of himself as some sort of hero. As with all too many third rate autobiographies, if you deleted the first person pronoun, you would have a book half of its current length."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humorous, Serious look at TV Journalism","review":"Sam Donaldson is both humorous and serious in this semi-autobiographical 1987 look at his job covering the Presidency. Donaldson is known as a dogged questioner disdainful of dodges and evasions. And as he shows that's his job, no matter how annoying he becomes to Presidents, other public figures, and the viewing public. Donaldson focuses primarily on Presidents Carter and Reagan. The Carter section is somewhat humorous; the section on Reagan would be even more so until you realize how out-of-touch the man was. Donaldson also examines the TV news business, the program THIS WEEK WITH DAVID BRINKLEY, his Texas upbringing, and lest you dismiss him as some liberal journalist, his vote for Goldwater in 1964. Ironically, for all his attack-dog persistence, he never gets very revealing about politicians, the news business, or himself. Still, this is an informative and humorous read."},{"rating":"2","title":"damn good","review":"hmm...where do i start? i have almost all of the NOFX albums to date, so i bought this one for no reason at all. i really have no idea why i did...no wait, i got it as a valentines present...anyway...1) All Outta Angst2) Shut Up Already3) Leave It Alone4) Green Corn5) Don't Call Me White6) Soul Doubt7) 180 Degrees8) Reeko9) Bleeding Heart Disease10) Day to DazeI'm kinda over Pump Up The Valuum...in my opinion, that's the worst album, but whatever."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is not their greatest stuff","review":"If you think that this is nofx's compilation of best songs, then you are really missing out.

Theres one problem though: some missing songs. \\"Please Play This Song On The Radio\\" is easily one of NOFX's most clever and catchy songs, and it definetly should've been included on here. \\"The Brews\\" is a fun grungy sing a long tune, as is \\"My Vagina\\".

I don't have the original, but I do have Sideswipe, who shares the mold, and Red looks to be a good reproduction. The joints are very tight, so he'll hold firm in either mode for a long time to come, unlike some original figures whose legs collapse on themselves after a little wear(usually the ones with diecast chests). There appears to be no change in the mold - both the gun and the missiles are unchanged from my Sideswipe. A few things to watch out for, though: The windshield is flimsy, as on a lot of the early G1 cars. Be careful when moving it. The doors are also relatively thin and might break. Also the missle launcher snaps onto the shoulder rod _very_ tightly. If you use too much force attaching or removing it, you might break the launcher, the rod, or both.

His feet and knees do articulate a little stiffly, I think on purpose so he will hold a pose like standing up. His arms, elbows, wrists and even hands are posable!We also worried at first that the wings weren't meant to fall apart so easily, but I think this is a feature, not a bug.

Martha Peace actually advocates that battered wives stay with their husbands who hurt them. She says that the correct thing to think when your husband hurts you is this: \\"My husband may hurt me again. I hope not, but if he does, I will just have to let him and glorify the Lord.\\" What kind of advice is that? Women who are getting hurt by their husbands need to get out of the marriage!I was so disgusted by this patriarchal and mysogynistic book that I am going to throw it out!

There were a multitude of these references. My husband and I support each other in every area of life and we feel like this is truly what love is. Every time I have seen a woman give up every aspect of her self and devote herself 100% to her husband, there has been abuse on the husband's part.

It seems like Mrs. Peace not only rests the whole weight of the marriage on the wife's shoulders, but she also seems to feel that the place of the wife is UNDER the husband's foot instead of at his side. Statements such as the wife should \\"recognize that her work, needs and desires are less important than her husband's\\" are NOT helpful! In fact, they go far to breeding a serious sense of inferiority in a woman! I actually had to seek the advice of other Christian married women, whose advice I trust and lives I know to remind me that I while yes I am submissive, that is not equated with inferior. I think this is a dangerous book for newly married Christian wives, particularly those who don't have positive Christian, marital examples in their life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did you know that you can recycle books?","review":"I received this as a Christmas gift from my sister-in-law several years ago. In short...this book leaves me flabbergasted. The subtitle \\"A Biblical Perspective\\" is overstating things to say the least. Perhaps it's better subtitled - \\"From Martha's personal interpretation of the Bible.\\" I held onto it for several years as I was unwilling to donate it and subject anyone else to Peace's point of view. My husband and I have had a good chuckle every now and then about the book. We both agreed that throwing it out seemed the best route...until I discovered that you can recycle books. I took of the covers, broke it in half, and put it in the bin. Perhaps the paper in its second life will be far more useful. Save your money...there are far better marriage books out there than this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a book you want you daughter to read.","review":"Be warned: This book is nothing but a fundamentalist attack on what healthy marriages should be. Martha Peace takes the women's movement back about 300 years with this archaic and literal interpretation of the Bible's view on marriage and a woman's place in that relationship.\\"Submit graciously\\" is just the beginning here, folks. This book suggests a woman blindly follow her husband wherever that may lead her -- abuse, rape, unwanted motherhood. It is literal translations from the Bible like this that makes being a Christian hard to defend."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to be DEPRESSED, this book is for you.","review":"SAVE YOUR MONEY....You'll need it to get a divorce lawyer if you follow it's teaching. If this is what God requires of the married woman, you might as well stay single.I must say that I never finished the entire book. After several women at my church recommended this book, I purchased it. I started reading and thought it might be one that I could use to help be a more supportive helper to my husband.First, there is no such thing as the excellent wife. I think being a humble, quiet, gracious, God glorifying helper for your husband is what we should strive for. It isn't in our power to \\"Change\\". God is the only one that can change us. We can only study His word, pray, apply it to our lives and let Him do the rest.Instead of this book, read \\"On The Other Side of The Garden; Biblical Womanhood For Today's World\\"THIS BOOK IS NOT WORTH GLANCING THROUGH. I wouldn't even sell you my copy...I recycled it to the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"be VERY careful...","review":"This review is written by a Bible believing wife who believes in the biblical roles of the family. If you are a perfectionist, or have any emotional or sexual abuse in your past--please be extremely careful how you apply the recommendations in this book. It aims to help you be more like Christ in your relationship with your husband; but given human brokenness and sin by either party it can easily lead down the road of works based religion and extreme damage to your heart and your relationship. It is okay to speak up in your marriage. It is not healthy or okay, or even holy, to swallow every single thought that is slightly negative. The Lord gives us our instincts and brains for our own safekeeping. How I wish I had never ever ever been given this book--or felt motivated to follow it. Or had used it only in consultation with a *very* balanced counselor. Be aware."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Excellent Wife","review":"This is the best Biblical book that I have ever read on being a Godly wife, I would read and trust the books written by this author, and find the contents to be Biblical accurate.

It's filled with rules that will leaveyou depressed and under a cloud of condemnation. Well, I have good news! Galatians 5:1 says,\\"It is for freedom that Christ hasset us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery.\\"It isn't Biblical to think we are made right with God by what we do or don't do (The Law) instead of by grace. (Read Galatians)If you are in the Word and in prayer, and are making it your life's goal to glorify God in all you do, trust the Holy Spirit to gently let you know when you need to change and become more Christ-like.If you want a good book about marriage and family, buy a copy of the book, Your Home A Place of Grace, by author Susan Hunt. That book is challenging, yet freeing at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book for wives!","review":"The Excellent Wife may contain some good, valuable information. However, if you are married, you must not buy into the teaching that we, as wives, have Biblical authority over our husbands. There is not gentle rebuking from wife to husband; there is no room for a wife to stand over her husband in any authority whatsoever at any time in a marriage. Our husbands are our covering, our protection, and our authority-blessed by God and used by God to bless us. Please consider turning to Scripture yourself to see all the amazing truths about marriage rather than reading The Excellent Wife. If you must read a book other than the Bible, please consider \\"Created to Be His Helpmeet\\". It is more doctrinally true to what the Bible teaches about marriage and offers much deeper teachings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very warped and not biblical","review":"Let's just say that this is one woman twisting Scripture to suit her own worldview and then forcing that view on everyone else.If you disagree with her many misuses of Scripture, she calls you \\"rebellious.\\"She doesn't believe that women are called to serve in leadership positions.I disagree with her on this issue. But, after reading her book, I am thinking women shouldn't author marriage counseling books if they are named Martha Peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rejected","review":"What wife doesn't want to be an excellent one?

No women's lib here. Just kind, straightforward talk about how God has created wives and husbands and their roles as such. All points are soundly based on God's Word, a true inspiration to Christian wives everywhere!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book makes me sad.","review":"If this book represented every marriage, I would not get married. I have an equal partnership with my husband and that is the marriage I dreamed of. I feel protected, secure, and VALUED in my marriage... not as a caretaker or a slave, but as a partner.I received this book, it's companion book for husbands, a bible, and a crucifix as a wedding gift from my FIL's group of friends. I am sure they had the best of intentions with their gift, but you simply can't give these books to someone whose beliefs you aren't familiar with.I wrote this review solely to advise others to not purchase this book as a gift for a woman unless you know her values are consistent with what this book contains. It was very offensive to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't believe this book!","review":"I am just STUNNED at all the positive feedback this book has gotten. I was so disgusted by what I was reading I couldn't even finish it. The author puts down women who work, encourages wives to blindly do what their husbands tell them to do, and even tells women to stay in abusive relationships. If this is what marriage is, I can safely say I'm never getting married."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I received this book as a gift and was very uncomfortable reading it. I didn't appreciate the author stating that a wife should never want compliments from her husband. My primary love language is Words of Affirmation and compliments help me to feel valued and loved.The bible says that women should be submissive to their husband... but when is it EVER a good idea for anyone to stay in an abusive relationship!!??! I question the author's use of scripture and think she just piece-mealed the Word together to suit her own opinions. Don't read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not about the Proverbs 31 Excellent Wife","review":"I was disappointed by this book. It seemed to be all about submissiveness and confronting your husband's sin. I was looking more for inspiration from the Proverbs 31 wife: How can I be an excellent wife who is industrious and looking well to all the ways of my household? This book just didn't deliver. Might be good if your husband is abusive or something like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those who are ready to be humble","review":"This book was about more than just being a good wife. Many of the principles she draws from remind the reader about being a closer Christ follower in general. Submission is a big topic in this book, and honestly, more wives need a clearer picture of what that really is. Do not miss the sections, where, she explains that submissive wives are NOT doormats.. but faithful helpers who submit to their husbands at the same time being used by God to refine him into the man God wants him to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay as a starting point","review":"This was not the first book that I have read on biblical submission and far from the best. I think it is a fine starting point (or even just intellectual background information) for women who are searching for God's plan in their marriage. However, Martha Peace is too heavy handed with with wife as the only one responsible for the marriage and heavy on the guilt. She is married to a Christian which I think distorts her view. Her methods CAN help all marriages, but I put down the book feeling ... put down. She has great ideas, but there are other MUCH better books out there if you are looking for a guide to biblical submission. And those books are more about being the best Christian you can be - which will lead naturally to being the best wife you can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Excellent wife can have an opinion.","review":"I found the book to be unrealistic at times, every marriage is different. Every wife is different. I have been married to my husband for 10 years and we have mutual submission to each other and we rely on each others strengths.This book says that you should agree with every thing your husband says except if he asks you to sin. I respect my husband as the head of the house hold because that is what the bible says, but every man needs a storng woman thats not gonna just agree to everything. I don't recommend this book for wives with husbands that are not following the Lord. Read the bible, pray and seek Godly counsel from real people."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had a bad feeling about this one","review":"I had a bad feeling about this book when I started reading it. The one star I rated it is for Mrs. Peace's testimony that seems honest and transparent and for the valid biblical principles she did present.I do agree with her that a wife should seek God with all her heart among other biblical principles (how to bring a biblical reproof, how to communicate biblically, etc), but she inserted her opinion and used snippets of scripture to back them up too often in this book.Please see the rest of the 2 and 1 star reviews. A lot of them said it all. I did not feel that the exegesis of scripture was thorough, taking into account cultural and linguistic implications of the passages she used - mostly Psalm 31, Titus 2, and others. Also, as mentioned before, she often chose just parts of scripture to support her ideas. I pray that anyone else who reads this book looks up the scripture themselves and checks what this author is writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"This book gives a very good description of what one can see along the trails but lacks information on intermediate trail access other than what the authors calls the 'Trailhead'. Perhaps some people want to start on the other end or in the middle but there is no description on how to get there. In this age of GPS units in almost every vehicle, GPS coordinates for trail access points are a necessity but none are listed. Some people run shuttles in order to do sections of trails only one way but there is no help, especially for folks that come from far away to ride these trails. The maps are adequate at best. The Office of Greenways & Trails brochures are much better in listing access directions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful Guide to Paved Bike Paths in Florida","review":"This updated version of Florida's Paved Bike Trails, 2nd edition, provides the cyclist with a variety of places to bike in Florida. The newer edition was very helpful to plan weekend bike trips around Florida, as we knew what to expect in advance.Helpful descriptions of the trails, although a few more illustrations would improve the book a bit. However, overall this is a very useful guide to a variety of paved bicycle trails througout Florida.I have used this book in conjunction with other books on Florida's bike trails."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"This is the first Widescreen concert registration that I've seen and it's beautiful. Not only the audio quality is very good (some people have paid attention here!) but the direction is also impressive. But as I said, seeing this in widescreen is really great - it adds to the feeling of being there at the concert. And now for the greatest news, especially for all fellow Yes fans, these guys are still in great shape! What a super performance this is. Even the really old stuff is played beautifully and gives you back the feeling of yesteryears. This DVD has to be recommended to everyone who likes top notch concerts but especially to all Yes fans out there: get this disc!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something? Or is it Yes?","review":"I bought this DVD partly as a result of the extremely positive reviews here, but I have to admit that I'm very disappointed. I positively love Yes. I saw them live 3 times in the 1970s, but this doesn't sound like the band I knew. Yes combined technical proficiency with a hard rock \\"wall of sound\\" and passion. I hear no wall of sound and no passion here. It's like a classical string quartet performing Yes. It's like Yes turned into elevator music. Is it the absence of Rick Wakeman here? I noticed that visually the DVD focuses on Anderson, Howe, Squire, and White and not the two additional musicians. That's fine. But does the sound mix also leave them out and is that why this sounds hollow to me?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disc Gone Bad","review":"I've had the same problem with the DVD going bad.

The time is now and the word is YES!","review":"I is so nice to get a music DVD that has positive spirituality at it's center. The performances on this DVD are unbelievable. Jon Anderson is at his spiritual best here. I was totaly involved with the performance. I wish other bands would see this and understand the spirit of joy that YES has been providing for many years.

I would recomend it to anyone who loves music and wants to add a little positve joy to their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Evening With Yes","review":"I'm seeing an awful lot of complaints about the sound quality of this or something, but I don't see it. I was happy with this from start to finish. I am also happy with the other Yes DVD's in my collection. I mainly wanted to get the live versions of \\"Yours is No Disgrace\\" and \\"Perpetual Change\\" which I don't see on other Yes DVD's. We have some of the usual standards such as \\"Roundabout\\", \\"And You and I\\", \\"Owner of a Lonely Heart\\", \\"All Good People\\" which seem to be on nearly every last live Yes DVD, but the other tunes seem to alternated.

If you really believe communism is coming back (only better this time, without tyrants), and that human nature is going to fundamentally change just because we've now got better technology, then this book is for you. Frankly, I found most of his thinking extremely fuzzy-headed, and many of his historic changes in civilization extremely far-fetched. There are many better alternate histories around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Future History as a variation on the End of History genre","review":"In the U.S. of the late 20th century, a number of historians have turned to somewhat eclectic methods of interpreting the end of history or other variants on the notion of escaping or surpassing history. This is a particularly Americanized view of the world, or often Eurocentrist. Professor Wagar's book unfortunately falls into this category, and draws mainly on Eurocentric examples in his analysis of recent history, and his examples often lack rigor and fail to relate longer trends in state formation and authoritarianism as contributing factors to the mailaise of current crises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Utopia of the 20th Century","review":"This book is a career-crowning triumph. Wagar fans who have read \\"Building the City of Man\\" or his introduction to \\"The Open Conspiracy\\" will anticipate about a third of this book, but the investigation beyond the World Party is breathtakingly good. The book soars because it is not only first-class futurism, but also captivating fiction. Not every historian is also a great novelist, and so \\"A Short History of the Future\\" is a surprise. The book's strength is its credible presentation of alternate (centralized and decentralized) long-term scenarios. Its weakness is that it was written before the collapse of the USSR, and proposes a path that did not turn out to be so. But if you read past the particulars to the underlying dynamics, the analysis is both graceful and incisive."},{"rating":"1","title":"outdated look into the future","review":"Reading this book ten years after it was written made it very hard to get into it. For one thing, the author still talks about the USSR and East Germany, and those countries faded away so long ago that the whole book seems dated. It's hard to suspend disbelief and imagine this book was really written far in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Deal","review":"Having spent 20 years working on the Pacific Rim I can state that Indonesian fried rice is far and away the best fried rice that you can get. In most places fried rice is just a way to use up leftovers. In Indonsia fried rice is an art form called Nasi Goreng. Nasi=Rice Goreng=Fried Istimewa=Special which means that there is a fried egg on top. Nasi goreng istimewa is usually served with Satay which is BBQ'd meat on a stick. The ABC brand Kecap Manis (sweet soy sauce) is a key ingredient in the fried rice. It is also the BBQ sauce that is used to make the Satay. This is wonderful stuff and is a common table item in Indonesia. It is a fine addition to many meats and vegetables either during the cooking stage or added at the table."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious sauce!","review":"Product arrived promptly. I love Amazon Prime...Used this sauce in my Indonesian Pork Fried Rice recipe that night and it was the winning ingredient. No supermarket in my area carried this product and I probably could have gotten it at one of the Asian markets in the city, but ordering it seemed a sure thing. The bottle is huge; I will have to will it to my children upon my demise as I will never use it up, hence the 4 star rating. It really is very good, much sweeter and thicker than regular soy sauce.

Unfortunately, the atmospheric music adds up to very little of substance. There are many electronic and instrumental albums in my collection (Cocteau Twins, Anthony Phillips, Jean-Michel Jarre, Kraftwerk, many more), and Spirit of Eden just cannot compare to any of them. I bought this album after falling in love with TalkTalk's Colour of Spring, but I was quite disappointed. Perhaps I'm missing something... I see many positive reviews posted here. But I've given it many many tries, and I cannot recommend it.Colour of Spring is the true five-star TalkTalk album; if any shoppers are choosing between it and this one, I strongly suggest Colour of Spring. It is also progressive and conceptual, but it does not sacrifice coherence and power."},{"rating":"1","title":"DE EVOLUTION OF TALK TALK","review":"Seems a lot of people think Talk Talk's later works are some kind of brilliant musical triumphs. Maybe to classical musicians or something but as far as I am concerned they started out as a rather run-of-the-mill synth pop group, evolved to make thier greatest work \\"The Colour Of Spring\\", then de-volved into a insipid, boring, lifeless band. Talk Talk- Music to slip into a coma to. This isn't quite as bad as \\"Laughing Stock\\" but close. Barely audible vocal mumblings pervade throughout. With the exception of the latter part of \\"Desire\\", I didn't find a pulse.

This release with the vinyl and hi-res dvd are a great combo for a classic album. The only thing to note is that the original tracks were bounced from 2\\" analog to a digital Mitsubishi deck before the mix so all of the tracks were 44.1 or 48k at some point and thus don't have full frequency extension even though the DVD is 96k/24bit.

Although it quickly becomes apparent that the author is no less than brilliant, in the midst of reading this material, I found myself cracking up out loud. The information is comprehensive, yet delivered in an easy to understand and humorous style. I also liked that this book cuts through a lot of \\"fuzziness\\" and tells you the bottom line on a number of issues.

Fortunately my outlay was small enough to tolerate the disappointment. The moment that the first movement cadenza begins it's as if someone had changed the disc, so bizarre is the appearance of the piano and so disturbing is the violin transcription of the piano cadenza. This is not about traditonalists versus radicals; this is about aesthetic judgment. This performance is so ugly that it became impossible to hear the rest of the recording.

The author is very straightforward, honest, and motivational. He gives the \\"tough love\\" kind of talk I wish I could get from a live person.

Anyway, the motivational talk is what will keep this book within my easy reach in case I don't feel motivated to move.The plan itself to \\"walk yourself thin\\" is so very easy-you simply can't do it wrong!

Too many people eat because they are consciously or unconsciously \\"tanking up\\" for some imagined famine--\\"Oh no, I won't be able to eat until breaktime!\\"--or because they are semi-conscious in front of the TV.I only gave it 4 stars because the writing style is somewhat annoying--it reads like an infomercial, with a lot of yakking.

Obviously if the author [cared about overweight people], he would have researched and printed factual info (like the baloney about skipping breakfast being good for you... *sheesh*) and made an effort to help people of all sizes feel good about exercising and walking. Instead, he just added to the monumentally prejuducial treatment that fat people receive on a daily basis. Don't waist your money on this book, it is liable to just make you angry.

Published in 1983, Fup is the story of a cantankerous grandfather, his gentle grandson, and their pet, a 20-pound mallard duck (the grandfather named the duck because he thought Fup duck was funny). Born in 1880 the grandfather spends most of his 100 years tending his stills, sleeping, and drinking his 194-proof whiskey called Ol' Death Whisper, which he believes will keep him alive forever. The grandson is a master fence builder and spends his time building dividing their enormous Northern California ranch and hunting the giant wild boar that keeps tearing up the fences. Compared on the book jacket to Tom Robbins or Mark Twain, Dodge's style reminds me more of a Richard Brautigan. It's not quite as poetic, but is just as original, odd, and hilarious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Previous reviews are total scam!","review":"Wow, these reviews are completely biased!I took a course with Jim Dodge in 2001 at humboldt state university. He heralds himself as some sort of God among men yet cannot recognize passages from his own work when cited in opposition to his current (and infallible) opinion. What a complete hack and utter waste of time. 90% of the positive reviews for this book are obviously from students and colleagues of his (many of which I know personally)whom have fallen under the ridiculous spell from this out of touch, mentally decrepit, obtuse individual. His work is sophomoric at best, lacks character development, and employs an idiotic structural disaster befitting that of the ancient and irrelevant authors Jim Dodge blindly idolizes.

This is an incredibly imaginative book with rich, deep characters, even though you can read it in just a few hours. I loved the book and its characters so much I began giving copies of it to my friends and family for birthdays and things like that. It is the best book I have read with the exception of Siegfried Brian Barger's June 2003 novel, FONTANA, and Larry McMurtry's LONESOME DOVE. I cannot recommend FUP enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"A genuinely feelgood book.","review":"Fup is an odd and endearing fairy tale that's charming and warm without slipping into schmaltz. It's easy to see why it's been given as a gift to so many people.Not only does Dodge tell an original yarn, but he really brings you into the lives of the three main characters that's at once ordinary and extraordinary.It takes about an hour or 2 to read.

I cannot recall EVER going to the see a movie a second time in the theater. I actually might see it again in 3D as it was stunning! Also One of Disney's best villains in my opinion. The psychological aspect of Mother Gothel is deep.Don't miss this new age Disney classic. Perfect for everyone in your family. It will warm your heart, make you laugh and cry and gives you that Disney magic feeling we have been waiting for since Beauty and the Beast! Amazing!!I cannot wait for this to come out on Blu-Ray.

It was enjoyable in the theater and they couldn't wait for the movie to be released on DVD. After watching it at least 5 times at home, it holds up well for replay value. What I mean is that some movies get to be very difficult to hear over and over but Tangled is fun.The princess is sweet, naive, and pleasant, her 'mother' is obnoxious and Flynn Ryder becomes very lovable. We really love the horse and his 'bloodhound' style. My kids especially like when the horse is hiding behind the bushes in the shape of a horse. The musical numbers are funny, very classic Disney. The animation is very well done.I've only given this four stars because if I compare it to recent releases likeToy Story 3andDespicable Me, it is just not quite on the same level, close though. So I would go 4 if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kids love it.","review":"Even though it is a \\"princess\\" film, my two boys (5 and 2) absolutly love it.

I was expecting just about every joke. The best part of this movie is the stepmother, who has great lines and great voice acting and a very expressive face. The lead character is so sheltered and \\"young at heart\\" that I'm made uncomfortable by the fact that suddenly she's thrust into a romantic situation. It's like watching a 7 year old fall in love.Also, clearly that horse is just a painfully unrealistic ripoff of Altivo. It was a eprfect example of the forced humor used throughout this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"This movie is adorable.

We saw it a year ago when it came out and my three year old at the time was a little scared but it was so compelling see couldn't look away. (Note, it was only \\"scary\\" because there was action, there's very little tension, even my daughter who thought the weeds in the Tinkerbell movie were too scarey does fine with this movie.)

BUT I am just so taken aback that this item is for sale on here at $30.95. Why? It's not even a 'new release'. No disc warrants that amount of money... no matter how many times the little ones will watch it. And I see that the bluray version is cheaper. Is this the same ploy that the music industry used to get us to switch to the infinitely more profitable CD format from vinyl? Make the newer [and more profitable in the long run] format cheaper? I know it isn't Amazon that is racking this up to insane prices [at least I hope it isn't :)]. I think people should just boycott items that are overpriced, either online or in stores.

This was a poor attempt at 3D by disney (as are many I'm finding regardless of producer)that there might be 1 or 2 points where the 3D actually works and they are quite intentional such as a spear pointing straight at you. I guess I expected movies to be much better at this point, 2 years + out from Avatar (blue people, not the awful movie version of the cartoon from Nickelodean), but not many movies have made the effort. I'm still buying 3D movies sporadically if it is a movie I want to keep regardless if 3D works or not, but I would by alot more 3D blu-ray if they would make an effort to create a true 3D experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A modern-family Classic","review":"We absolutely love the movie.

Overall this show is worth the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"For my kids","review":"I rented this for my kids and especially my daughter, she loves Tangled a lot, I had to buy the movie so she can watch it all the time when she wants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Movie!","review":"this is one of my favorite movies, its entertaining, wholesome and funny. great for all ages. i highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best disney movies!","review":"Great quality video! Movie was entertaining and fun to watch! Our girls loved the story! Disney always makes great movies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Add this to the best of Disney classics","review":"Tangled is the perfect name for this movie. It should be a revered Disney classic because it, in true Disney fashion, can be enjoyed by any age, any gender, for any and all of the tangled social issues it addresses. I loved how conflicted the female protagonist is portrayed. So colorful, action-filled and joyous this movie is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Granddaughter loves it","review":"When we got our 3D TV, we promised the grandchildren we would get one 3D movie for wach at Christmas. Kadi loves Tangled, so this was her choice. It is a fun movie, and has some great 3D. I would recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tangled Video","review":"This is a family favorite in terms of a children's video. There are parts that are scary at first viewing and a child should watch it with family the first time, so they can see things are not always as they seem. Maximus, the horse, is everyone's hero. Grandpa is required to be Maximus, so he can be ridden around and around the living room. There are many good lessons in this story, as well as great humor, appreciated by adults and astute children. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"Very enjoyable movie. The singing was engaging and the dialogue was very witty. My kids loved this movie. Even my husband liked it if that is a recommendation! The ending was a bit scary and may be too much for very small viewers. My daughter saw this when she was just turning 5 and she was fine but she has nerves of steel and nothing bothers her. The ending is eventually happy but for a few minutes there my husband and I sat there in horror thinking our kids might be traumatized for life. Luckily, it all worked out well and parents may want to see this first so they can explain what is happening in the end. This isn't like when Bambi's mother dies off screen. The rest of the movie is great though and it is definitely worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable movie","review":"Even our 20 month old granddaughter enjoyed this movie. Also the 2 disc set allowed us to play it other than on a blue-ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MOVIE","review":"I have a 4 yr old and a 2 yr old Andy they completely loved it. They even say through the flick at the theater. Now they watch it almost once a day. When they are not watching it they are playing it by putting a blanket on their head and pretending its Repunzel's hair. I recommend it to anyone with kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film, Better Service","review":"I bought Tangled via Amazon.com and received it rapidly. The price was reasonable compared to local stores. When it arrived, the Jewelcase was damaged (a clip for the DVD was broken). Amazon immediately and without question replaced it and explained how they were going to do it to ensure maximum speed crossing the Canadian border. They did a brilliant job of customer service. The film itself is great, combining some CG technology with more classic Disney-fairytale storylines, music and other classic Disney elements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal!","review":"I was very happy with this item! It arrived in great shape and very quickly. My daughter has watched it repeatedly since she got it. It has provided many hours of happiness for her!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for all ages","review":"Ever have a problem finding something the whole family will enjoy watching? If you're like me you have one child that likes magic and scary monsters (but not too scary) and the other likes animals, Dad likes action and adventure, Gran likes romance and me I just like to laugh. Then Tangled is the movie for you, it had it all, plenty of action and adventure a horse named Max who made me laugh out loud, a sweet romance, magic and a scary monster called \\"Mother\\". Add funny, silly and sweet music, beautiful animation and a wonderful adaptation of an old Fairy Tale and you've got a real gem.Note: if you have a very sensitive child \\"Mother\\" might be too scary for them as she is really mean and verbally abusive (no bad language but hurtful)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Disney movie with less singing","review":"I saw this movie during Christmas holidays. It was my first time to spend holiday with young children around. Family had to pick a movie that will be fun, entertaining and engaging. I was dreading the thought of having to watch another \\"sing and dance\\" movie with endless catchy songs.This film turned out to be fun. It has lovely story line from one of the fairy tales and plenty of action. It is great for both boys and girls. Adults will not be left behind, they will enjoy this film just as much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I purchased this dvd for our 5 year old daughter. She really liked it and we've watched it as a family several times. I thought it seemed age appropriate for her and also for girls/boys older than her. The animation is suberb, as always, with any Disney movie, and it contains some catchy tunes that my daughter loves to dance to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic disney","review":"I was not impressed by this movie and could not watch it past 15 minutes. I am afraid that after Aladdin, most of the animations Disney has put out seem the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"tangled is good but sweet hostage is much better","review":"im a big movie buff i must of seen a million movies. the best i ever saw was sweet hostage. they should release sweet hostage on dvd immedietely. i own it on vhs and transfered it to dvd. trust me on this one it would be a great seller. everyone i show sweet hostage to says its the best movie they ever saw.linda blair and martin sheen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good But Now Quite Pixar Quality","review":"This was good, and our kids enjoyed it, but as an adult, it lacked the extra spark of Pixar movies or even some of the earlier Disney movies like Aladdin. Some of the songs and jokes seemed tired and contrived, and the stepmother was a little too scary and creepy for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Play","review":"The movie itself it wonderful!! Unfortunatly,the copy I purchased doesn't play in my DVD play and acts ups in my Blu-ray."},{"rating":"1","title":"No dvd extras! Almost.","review":"Not even a commentary on the dvd. I'm really disapointed.There is no 3d presentation on dvd, only on the blu-ray...You have to have a blue-ray reader to be able to watch the special features...I liked the movie very much, though..."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new favorite movie!","review":"I bought this movie for my 2 year old daughter, but my husband and I watch it with her every time she does (which is almost everyday) and it never gets old, its one of the best Disney movies I think I've ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 3 yr old is obsessed!","review":"My daughter saw this movie in the theater and I new I would have to preorder. Ever since we saw it, she won't get a hair cut and says she wants to paint her hair golden to be like Rapunzel:)We love this movie, great addition to the princesses"},{"rating":"2","title":"I MAY BE A GROWN MARRIED WOMAN, BUT LOVE DISNEY MOVIES, AND THIS IS JUST ANOTHER PERFECT EXAMPLE OF PERFECTION!!!","review":"Don't really like Mandy Moore, but man, she did an INCREDIBLE job with this character!!! The storyline is perfect, lots of OPTIMISM, REAL LIFE ISSUES, AND MOST OF ALL.......A TIMELESS LESSON THAT EVERYONE SHOULD LEARN.... \\"STAY POSITIVE, THINK POSITIVE, AND YOUR HAPPY ENDING IS JUST A DREAM AWAY!!!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Classic","review":"Overall, this film fit very well amongst the other Disney Princess films. While the beginning was a bit slow and the singing felt a little unnatural and out-of-place, the tearjerking moments and comedic timing allow this film to stand up with the rest of Disney's greatest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite \\"Princess\\" Movie of all!","review":"My daughter LOVES this movie! And so do my husband and I! My daughter is 3 years old and this is the only movie she will watch aside from Toy Story.

It instantly became one of her favorites and even her 8 year old brother likes it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow - Just tied as my favorite Disney Movie next to Ariel!","review":"This movie was very surprisingly wonderful! I went into the theatre, not having high expectations - and absolutely fell in love with it! It was great for my 6 year old girl and my 8 year old boy....as there was plenty of humor with Maximus the horse, and Pascal the Chameleon."},{"rating":"2","title":"No regrets!","review":"Saw this movie in the theatre with my 5 and 2 year old sons.

Greatest animated movie in decades!","review":"I usually dont write reviews but I was so impressed by this animated movie that all our family members never blinked once! I ended up ordering a Blu-Ray and DVD as an addition to our collection. It's worth every penny! (BTW, dont miss the \\"I've got a dream\\" song!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its okay......","review":"My kids where more exited about the idea of the movie then before they watched it. After watching it they haven't asked to see it again. If you have a portable player, in your car or on your lap make sure you get the DVD- Blu-Ray combo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tangled DVD","review":"Received quickly, disc 2 of Blue Ray DVD set, was not plainly labeled as such on website, other than that, disc was fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughter loves it","review":"I don't understand why people have mixed reviews, but my daughter loves it to the point that other cartoons seem not as entertainment. I think she watch it over 8 times already (separate occassions). Songs are great and the plot is not too crazy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tangled - superb","review":"A gripping mix of action, comedy, romance and fantasy, Tangled captures your heart. In a style similar to Shrek and Mulan, Tangled takes you on a bittersweet journey with a few twists. Based on the traditional fairy tale of Rapunzel, an innocent and beautiful girl meets a fugitive thief and together they embark on a trip to see the lanterns - a trip which leads to the discovery of long hidden secrets. Beautifully scripted with captivating voice actors including Mandy Moore, with hilarity and slapstick thrown in at every turn, this movie is a winning combination of classic and modern for the whole family. Tangled will make you fall in love with fairy tales all over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"very funny","review":"My husband doesn't care for animated movies, but loved this one and laughed very hard. We especially loved the horse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful fun for the whole family.","review":"If you want to see a really funny, fun and wholesome family movie you have to view this movie. You'll want to this movie more than once, the same day."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant surprise.","review":"I guess over the years I've gotten really spoiled by Pixar.With the exception of the Shrek movies I tend to shy away from other animated movies.I was curious enough to rent Tangled since it was based on a Bro's. Grimm story.I was hoping Disney would do the story justice and...they did.Excellent characters, they all developed at a fast and interesting pace.Excellent story telling.Direction, art, animation were all beautifully done.The one thing I really don't like about old Disney films is the constant singing.That's probably why I like the Pixar movies better but thankfully Disney toned down the singing this time around with more humor.Heck even the songs themselves were funny.I loved this movie and will be buying the 3D version.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very entertaining movie","review":"Tangled is a magical and funny movie that had my attention from beginning to end. I took my niece to see it and expected to be bored but that wasn't the case at all. I just wish that the white horse Maximus had more scenes because he's just hilarious and he's a scene stealer. I think he's the most original Disney character in awhile and he didn't even need any lines to be funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best princess movie yet!","review":"Going into this movie, I was not overly excited. I got the impression from the marketing that it was in the vein of \\"Shrek,\\" with adult-based humor. I am so glad I was mistaken. This is a GREAT movie! I think it is my favorite princess movie yet--right next to \\"The Little Mermaid\\" and \\"Beauty and the Beast.\\" The horse and the chameleon characters are wonderful--their facial expressions are hilarious. And I love seeing a strong princess who is not dependent upon her savior prince. My 4 year old daughter and 6 year old son loved it. We may even go see it again in the theater! It really is a wonderful movie. I don't know what Disney did wrong in the marketing, but if you have hesitated about going--DON'T! You'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Thinking About This Movie","review":"Taking my 12 & 14 year old daughters to see this movie Thanksgiving Day, I had no expectations due to what I feel was inadequate promotional material.But after having seen it, I am still blown away by just how fantastic this movie was!! It was funny, heartwarming and a beautiful love story. The music was incredible and the laughs just kept on coming! At no point was I bored and the scene out on the lake at night was simply breathtaking! I'm surprised that I am saying this, but I cannot wait to see Tangled again!Marvelous job!! You guys knocked it out of the park!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the last of the disney classics","review":"I heard that Disney isn't making happy ending movies anymore :( But they sure did end on a fabulous note. Tangled is such a sweet movie. The songs are amazing and has the cutest characters. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a light, feel-good pick-me-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unmatched for 3d Animation","review":"When I say unmatched animation I mean the characters move and emote more beautifully and expressively than in any other 3d animated film. This film was originally directed by Glenn Keane, the master animator who drew Tarzan, Aladdin and the Beast, and his superior animation knowledge really shows in the movements of all these characters.This is also a very well-made, funny film. My wife, my 7- year old son and I all loved it.I don't like having to buy a 4-disc combo to get 3d, but the 3d is well-done and convincing. So I'd say the price is high, but it's worthwhile to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"excelent movie","review":"My daughter watch it every Day and we are glad because is a beautiful story. She watch it at home as well as in the car"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I normally don't like watching children's movies, but I loved this one. My sister had a copy but I wanted one for myself too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and amusing.","review":"One of the better animated films out there. The animation is sharp, precise and vivid. The voice over work is \\"spot on\\". The story is a little different but that makes it more interesting. Definitely not the same old story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"This movie kept me entertained along with my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter. I found myself laughing out loud (especially at the horse - the scene stealer)."},{"rating":"2","title":"My First 3D Movie on a New TV \\"Excellent\\"","review":"Since this movie just came out supporting 3D in the 4 disc package I bought it to be the first full length 3D movie I would try on my new 73\\" Mitsubishi TV. Bottom line-Disney knows how to do 3D. For me I felt like I was looking through a window at the action. Good colors and done well. They do not need to report to many of the overdone cheesy effects that are often tried in lesser material. Good action scenes, story and it is a quality piece of work. Adding all the discs to this package plus the digital copy makes it a great value. Many will use the DVD in the car or on kids players, and it allows those with 3D TV to experience that as well. If you dont have the 3D yet, you watch the Blue Ray regular version. And you have an extra copy for the laptop, IPAD or I touch device."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Great Great!!","review":"Tangled is fantastic!

Strong characters, good story. A real winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"This month's kids' favorite","review":"We saw this movie on Netflix first, I thought it was entretaining enough, but my kids(2&5)somehow LOVED it.They especially liked the horse named Maximus.He is such a spice to this movie indeed.For kids' request, I bought a used dvd on Amazon, they enjoy watching it in the car as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing 3d content!","review":"Recently got a new vizio 65 inch tv(XVT3D650SV).

Me and my 9 yr old daughter enjoyed 3d to our hearts content.Must have 3d blu ray for all 3d fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disney's Tangled","review":"This is a great film with a twist. It is as entertaining for adults as it is for children. There is much humour that goes over the heads of the little ones that will keep them asking you why you are laughing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Great story line and beautiful music!

The movie quality is fine so I won't be returning it, but I was sad the case was ruined."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not \\"very good\\" at all.","review":"This item is wrongly tagged as \\"Used: Very Good\\". A better tag for it would be \\"Acceptable\\" or \\"Poor\\", since the disc is damaged, and the movie freezes and skips several times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware if you want to watch in 3D!","review":"I have nothing bad to say about Tangled, the movie. It's excellent. Don't take my 1 star review meaning that the movie is bad because it isn't--it's totally cute and worth watching.But don't purchase this combo pack if you think you can watch the 3D version on a regular television. The 3D version is ONLY viewable with a 3D TV coupled with a 3D Blu-Ray Player. It does not come with glasses to watch on a regular HD TV.I think this pack should come with a warning about this. Yes, there is a regular Blu-Ray, regular DVD, and a digital copy included, so a person can definitely watch the movie. Just not in 3D"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the movie, but it won't play in my blu-ray players","review":"I purchased this movie a while ago and just recently opened it. I was surprised to find out that it wouldn't play in my Vizio Blu-ray player. I tried several times, but it would actually lock up my player. I sent it back and was quickly sent a replacement. I tried that one on two different blu-ray players and the same thing happened. i went to the internet and found out that a lot of people are having the same problem with this movie. I think it is crazy that Disney would put out a movie that doesn't play on most people's Vizio and Samsung blu-ray players. All Disney suggests is that you update the firmware on your machine. Well mine says it is updated, yet I still can't play the movie. So, I will return this one too and just purchase the regular version which does play. But, I really wanted the blu-ray version."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOO","review":"The mother who steals Rapunzel stabs the boyfriend-And they show it. Not appropriate for children.

The story is so charming and fun and is a wonderful Disney twist on a classic fairytale! I love it very much. Me and my parents loved watching it together.

Beautiful movie, the art work was nice. I enjoyed seeing it! I loved the story...hope and dreams no matter how silly, can come true. The characters were unique and had great personalities! The music was catchy!The only thing that I didn't like was a comment made by Rapunzel's \\"mother\\" about her getting chubby. I know that she was to be portrayed as being \\"bad\\" but all other comments that I remember her making were all true. She was anything but chubby and with all the self image problems girls have these days, that will just be added to it. As an adult, I can see that this was to show that her mother was bad, but I don't think little girls are going to get that.Now it's been a month or so since I saw the show. When my copy arrives from Amazon, I'll revise my review if I'm wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOVE movie but the DVD sent by amazon was scratched/damaged","review":"We love Tangled - it's one of our favorites.

Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheer Genius","review":"This movie is amazing. It brings back all the good that I was starting to think that Disney left behind. Sure, in the past 5 years Disney has had some \\"cute\\" movies but this one brings Disney back to the era of The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin. First of all, Alan Menkin, the man who wrote all of the aforementioned movies songs, wrote ALL the songs for Tangled. Also the storyline is great, I really didn't plan on seeing this movie(I'm 19 years old)and all my friends said \\"No, you have too! It's sooooo good!\\" and they were right."},{"rating":"2","title":"this was great!","review":"this was really fun....very well done! i can't imagine not enjoying this movie, so be sure to buy this one and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Apple TV Compatability","review":"The streaming feature is good, but I cannot play the movie on my Apple TV using the iPad, only through my iMac.

The reason why I ordered this combo disks are, I can play the Blu-ray at my home and the regular DVD in my car. Because my daugher loves to watch this movie.

The 2D blu-ray version is also really good.This is a kids movie, and my 8 and 11 year-olds loved it. But it is also entertaining for adults. If you have kids, then this is a must. If you don't, indulge yourself, the movie is really cute - destined to become a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tangled","review":"My 4 year old niece and I have movie night every Saturday night.

Tangled was a huge hit--with both my daughter (who is almost 3) and myself...and my grandparents...and my parents...and the list goes on. I loved the story, loved the music...and was so glad that unlike some more recent Disney movies, this had no content I found questionable. Fantastic film. Also bought the soundtrack!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's awesome ok!!","review":"Well many people think that the \\"gay bar\\" is revolting but they just need to fix their heads. It's a scene showing that not all men are alike. The men are wanting to follow their dreams!! Come on really it's not revolting. Has Disney pumped out better movies yes but rapunzel's story isn't all that exciting. They have made it MUCH better than the story books. I personally think that it's a good movie to take your kids too because it shows them that if you follow your dreams they take you places and you meet people that you'll never forget.

After hearing this was finally a Disney title that equals past efforts I was shocked to find I had to shut it off after 30mins. Four completely boring songs, generic CG animation and story, characters I just didnt care about. Princess and The Frog steam rolls this 20 times over.

The Lost Princess/Rapunzel is just another \\"misunderstood\\" girl who's coming of age means rebellion against her parent. This is practically a theme for Disney films of late, perhaps done so they'll be marketable to the so-called spoiled \\"tween\\" girls who think the the world revolves around them. In any event, this film has the obligatory (and forgetable) musical numbers that fall flat and don't advance the story, but rather are just an interruption of it.Save your money, unless you want to entertain young children with the bright colors and fast-moving action.

I rolled my eyes, thinking this another Disney clunker, but boy was I surprised. This was a snappy, fun movie with clever, likeable characters and a fun plot with plenty of action, kind of like Shrek without Shrek. And, not surprising because it was a Disney film, the animation and computer generated effects, were both beautiful and exciting. This was a good film that a wimpy ending could not even ruin.

I think this movie is best seen on the big screen to be able to appreciate the absolutely amazing colors, the action and the charm of it. I was hypnotized as I exprienced this adventure with such joy. Rapunzul is so sweet, the horse is hysterical. I adored the scene where the little girls braided Rapunzul's hair. So much hair!!!

I used to go to a Messianic Congregation, and the emphassis seems to be is trying to fit into the Jewish community, and not at times trying to follow the Messiah (Jesus). I think the leaders of the Messianic Movement need to read what Mr Telchin says. He has some words of wisdom from a man who knows alittle about Jewish evangelism. Only By lifting up Christ, and Him alone, can draw people to him. Whether it be Jew or Gentile.

Even Pagans themselves wonder why Christians celebrate thier holidays. When I looked into the meaning of these holidays it was clear that no Christian should be involved with bunnies, eggs, Christmas trees. God commands us not to follow the pagan rituals.

He is someone who has never invested himself into the Messianic congregational movement, and here seems to be trying to justify his cutting himself off from his own people by finding fault with a movmement that he could have enriched with his input had he not been so bitter.It is a pity when people become so bitter that they air their discontent for the whole world to see.I would reccomend this book to NO ONE who truly wants to understand or learn more about Messainic Judaism.A far better book on the subject, treating the subject in a more scholarly and unbiased fashion, by a non-member of the Messianic Jewish Congregational movement, would be Messianic Judaism, by Rabbi Daniel Cohn-Sherbok."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book on cell church ideas","review":"A very good book giving an overview of cell church ideas, and nice to find something not written by Ralph Neighbour, although he's worth reading too.

And then there's the hero, Andrew Kane, a struggling fisherman haunted by a grisly discovery that drags him off the wharves and into the limelight.

So the reader is left lingering somewhere in between, as the dialogue is way too corny and amateurish to support a serious murder mystery plot, yet not in any way humorous enough to be touted as satire.To the folks that know nothing about the Hamptons but what they read in the tabloids or see in self-proclaimed Hamptons documentaries, it's embarrassing.

Take, for example, his recording of the Dvorak 8th and the Janácek Sinfonietta - an amazing performance of both of these works. Large brass sounds, responsive playing, interesting, well thought-out interpretations. His recordings of the Beethoven overtures for Phillips are equally thrilling. On the other hand, take his recording of the Beethoven 5th. It seems like a different conductor and orchestra than in the Dvorak/Janácek performance. Here we find a bored orchestra playing a concert staple with no energy, no emotion, no nothing. That is what you will find here in this recording of Frank's only symphony. The energy of the piece is totally destroyed and we are left with a mediocre performance of this great romantic work. Look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gimme Tone Poem","review":"The Franck Symphony is, as other reviewers here have noted, incredibly dull in this performances. But every once in a while Kurt Masur had an off day, and produced something exciting. The Tone Poem Les Eolides is excellently performed, exciting, and filled with unexpected detail and flourishes. It seems normally Masur, when in his mettle, produced workmanlike readings. But there were always exceptions, when his conductorly gears stopped grinding and he actually got inspired. ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible recording","review":"I talked with some of the musicians that performed on this recording because the balance is horrible.

A new an exciting approach to a piece, completely void of form. I ran out an immeadiately purchased a copy of CD recorded about 6 years earlier. While it remains one of the better recordings of the piece, it lacked that sparkle that the live performance had. I guess that one could say this is the difference between live, and recorded performances.

After his 3 tracks on the 8 mile soundtrack (which are amongst his best) I thought this could be his best album yet.I was horrified to see I was wrong, not only was I wrong I was completely off target. Everysong on here lacks any real energy and felling and he sounds bored. Songs such as Puke and Rainman are terrible I say leave the funny stuff to Weird Al. And for the serious tracks, they lack any feel. Like toy soldiers is great for the first 2 or 3 listens then you just dont want to know it.Eminem surrounding himself with artists such as Bizzare and 50 Cent has obviously hurt his career, his once rebelious rap music has turned into mainstream pop and I say to eminem, Game over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not ems best but better than all but 1 cd this year","review":"great cd, only da carter is better this year and the documentary is close"},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn.....zzzzzzzzzz.................yada, yada, yada........","review":"Nothing impressed me as far as the sample clips go.

I couldn't even get past track 6 on the album because of the wacky beats. Whoever told him his beats were cool should be shot. Everyone can't be a producer the main reason the other three did so well was because of Dre. Dre had the beats and Em had the flow they were like Batman and Robin or the fat guy with the skinny friend. I miss the old Em because he was hungry and was hustled hard to get to the top. The truth is he doesn't need black people to sell records. He turned his back on BET and has now found his new home on MTV.

Right off the bat, I see that he has placed alot more retrospective thought into this album and you really feel like you got a little something out of it. I must say though, this does not an album make! You will tend to just get annoyed by most of the songs on the CD. I think that his G-Unit counterparts released far better albums, even for all 50s overexposure, the entire G-Unit have released alot tighter solos. There are like 2, possibly three tight songs on the CD (Ass Like That has an infecious beat). I guess you have to be like a hardcore Em fan to appreciate it. I am not.

The naughty eminem who once loved poking fun of fat chicks and boy bands now seems too have grown too much of an ego and takes himself too serious. Ok, its great to grow up as an artist, but it sucks to grow up in order to make the world take you more serious. I think Eminem had his own style and was triumphant with it. I believe Eminem used humor in the past to get over with his life that once seemed hopeless but now he's become angry. He tries to fit in with the rest of the \\"angry\\" rappers and everytime does so, he becomes less original. I miss the eminem who didnt give a s*** about critics, politicians or anything...but now he's come out with a song that \\"encourages people to go vote.\\" I sincerely think he does'nt really care about the elections.

Of course hardcore Eminem fans who like anything he throws at them will. And heres a note to those Jackson lovers. @#$% U!

People think he is writing these songs for no other purpose than to be funny, but it isn't as simple as that. Eminem has already hit success, not only as a rapper, but as an actor and producer. We know all about his past, do you honestly want to hear another song about kim? The underlying theme of this cd is that Eminem can say whatever he wants. You think he is joking and being silly?

As a fan of rap, this is what I think of \\"Encore\\"**These songs are all 10 out of 10**Yellow Brick RoadLike Toy SoldiersMoshMockingbird**These are 9 out of 10**We as AmericansRicky Ticky TockLove You MoreEvil DeedsJust Lose ItPukeEncore/ Curtains DownThey're arn't many songs left on the CD, but they are mediocre, to crap at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too progressive","review":"Eminem has consistently made progress with the musical composition of his raps. Each new album has shown him make a step forward in deversifying how musical he is with his flow. However he's dumbed down and THAT SUCKS! He used to be so clever and playful with his words (which gets props in the underground) but now as a mainstream artist he's almost entirely thrown that out to focus on flow. I respect this album as a progression of his musical sensibilities.. but it's also sad to see his sincere meaninful thoughtful wordplay almost gone. His MO of a psychotic sense of humor is almost gone too, but he didn't replace it with anything but sophmoric farting, puking, and baby sounding potty jokes.In otherwords it's great music, but also a less human somehow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"If there was a 0 star I'd give that EMinems new album 'POINT BLANK'' sucks Encore is overrated and a Big disappointment..

Most songs here have awful, annoying beats with dry and less meaningful lyrics. The songs just dont have that spark that Eminem songs usually have. There are, however, two of Em's best songs from this album:Mockingbird- This is one of my favorite Eminem songs ever. He is full of emotion here, making a truely beautiful and meaningful song to his daughter Hailie.Like Toy Soldiers- Just a plain good song. Great beat and chorus, and very meaningful with well-written lyrics.Other than those two, awful album. Oh well, Em made up for it by making Relapse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"This is the worst album I have ever bought by any artist. He used to rap well and have intelligent lyrics. On this album he got juvenile with his lyrics and tried to sing but he has no voice. I liked the four preceding albums to this one. Infinite, Slim shady LP, Marshall Mathers LP, and the Eminem show were excellent. Now he's making garbage like this. He sold out big time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Talent","review":"Eminem has previously shown (The Eminem Show, Lose Yourself) that he has much more talent than he puts forth on this CD. This CD resorts to farts and burps and lots of homosexual themes, something that isn't really shocking coming from Eminem, but really is beneath his ablity. And does every Eminem CD need to have at least one song about Haley? Here's an idea--write a song about Haley, but don't actually use her name in the song 30 times. That way listeners can come to their own conclusions about what the song is about. Dre should start cutting his ties to Eminem if this is the direction his career is headed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average album","review":"Eminem seriously underachieved on this album, its average, no where near his previous 3 releases...Best Songs:Like Toy SoldiersMockingbirdRain ManEvil Deeds"},{"rating":"1","title":"Encore my ass","review":"My cousin was a cute kid and then when he hit puberty, his face exploded. my face is the sun, my position right now is the earth and my cat dodger juice box likes to drink the smell of fear.

There are still a few songs I can't listen to such as \\"Crazy In Love,\\" but there are plenty of exceptional songs. My favorites are Rainman, A-- Like That, My First Single, Puke, Evil Deeds. This stuff is so creative and The hateful people need to get a sense of humor and realize there isn't anyone who could do what he does, the way he does it. Hell no!! Eminem has the balls to speak out against Bush on Mosh. The songs are hilarious and so many of us need to laugh once in as while. So buy it and have a good time listening to it. Really, once you get past the puking, the potty humor, Heart and the homicidal/suicidal theme it's quite enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's ok","review":"I have been an Eminem fan since I heard the first cd.

But this cd is absolutely terrible. I hope that this is just a big joke from Eminem and he is proving that he can just crap out a cd and it will go multi-platinum, because it will.But if anyone actually think this CD is well made, they must love the CD because its Eminem, not because of the music. He has no feeling in his voice, he has horrible lyrics, and the production sounds like it was made in someone's garage.Every CD before this I absolutely love, but I am dumbfounded so many people think this is a great CD, how can you say that. I think Eminem is one of the greatest rappers of all time, that is why it is so hard to hear this CD, its absolutely terrible in every aspect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never been more disappointed by an artist...","review":"Wow. I expected great things out of this album, especially after the others were so incredibly good. Encore is just a re-hashing of pretty much all the same topics in his other albums but he seems to have lost all of his artistic ability. The lyrics are nowhere near the quality Mathers established on his previous albums; some of them are just plain stupid. Eminem seems to be running out of things to write about. I'll definitely won't buy his next CD without hearing it first.Awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this cd!","review":"I really wanted to like this cd, but lets face it, its terrible, nough said.

Eminem is no different from your average teenybopper pop star. This is the first cd he has obviously made specifically for 12 year olds. With the horrible, unlistenable production and the weak rapping, I guess the kids get a kick out of toilet humor.Em stretches his credibility when he tries to get \\"political\\".

I got sick of this album before I had heard half the songs. There are only a couple of good songs but by good I dont mean to the same degree as his old albums. Simply that there are a couple of songs you can actually stand to listen to.The cheesy... This album is the source of eminems cheesiest single yet.The bad... His old albums had songs that were not a favorite, but this album has songs that I will literally never listen to more than the intro (the time it takes me to hit the next button).I have to say that this albums date of release and content show that he is simply cashing in on loyal fans, with little or no concern for his content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip the Encore","review":"I love Em's previous albums, almost every track of every CD which for me is uncommon. However, with Encore that is not the case. I bought this based on the fact I liked his previous CDs thankfully I only paid $9.99 at Best Buy for it. I think this release is going to have a lot of variance with his fans but ultimately I wouldn't be surprised if the majority agrees this is not his best CD.So what makes this so bad compared to his previous CDs? While I don't mind Em experimenting with his style, Encore has a radical departure from anything else. I'm hard pressed to even think of even one song I really like. I love songs like \\"My Name Is\\", \\"Without Me\\", \\"The Slim Shady\\".My only recommendation is listen to a friend's copy first or something before buying it. In the meantime, I guess I'll have to wait 2 more years for his next album and hope it will be the same level of quality as The Marshall Mathers LP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once you lose the edge, its time to turn in your wings","review":"And thats exactly what happened on this album. I could not believeit when I listened to each track, I kept waiting for Em to come out and blow me away, but it never happened.

I hope this is not his last, he can't end it like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never seen an ass like that","review":"Even though this cd is not em's best i would still give it 5 stars just for the fact that he is an original.

But after I started listening to it I was really disapointed. Eminem has made much better albums. On this album, I can honestly say there were about 3 songs that I liked. Everything else was just stuff hes rapped about before. Boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"great if you're a fan of pop music","review":"eminem is not a rapper, he is a pop star, i have never been a fan of him but at least in the past he's had some motivation/hunger, now he's just plain ripping people off with this audio atrocity, it bothers me i wasted an hour of my life listening to this beer coaster of an album"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"I like Eminem's music but I thought that this cd was pretty much a redo of all of his other work.

I really think that this is the biggest joke of a cd that i have ever heard. Why do u ask that? Well the only song that i think would be considered listenable is \\"Never Enough\\". That song is hot and the verses from Em and 50 are hot. But the rest of the album is ridiculous, from Ass like that, to Puke, to his dumb single Just lose it, to Rain man which is very stupid and not funny at all. I mean honestly i dont get why all you idiots are buying this album and saying it is actually good. The only reason that this album gets 2 stars is because of that one hot song. The rest of the album is just a joke. PLease for the sake of good hip hop dont buy this album. I made that mistake and am on my way to Strawberries for a return and buy some real hip hop like Nas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eminem got soft after his 2nd album","review":"I thought em's 4th cd was gonna be his best yet from all the hype it got in magazines and all that but i ended up real dissapointed. there are a couple of songs that save the album from being 1 star but the rest is garbage.

I don't know where Em picked up this new type of flow[whiny,nasal pitched singing voice] but it's garbage. Even the singles are wack. Why write Mosh, was White America not good enough. Just Lose It is especially weak, even the video. It seems Em put no thought in this project and it shows in almost every track. What's most shocking is the production. It's horrible. No matter how bad this record is there are a few highlights like when track 20 is finished the agony of listening to this uninspired crap is over. I swear listening to this is the equivelant of chinese water torture."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT ?!?","review":"Can anyone explain just what happend to the talented artist he used to be...I gave him 2 stars an I'm so full of guilt because this CD is a complete joke.

This album was a serious step down from his former brilliance. The delivery isn't the same, the beats, the lyrics, the complex rhyme schemes. Even his crudeness, apart from his lyrical ability, ends up sounding just plain awkward. He rhymes like most [not all] popular rappers today: terribly.Eminem deserves to be judged harshly because we all know what he's capable of, so he can't give us any less.

I have all of Em's albums and this one is inescapably dull, overlong, and boring. I'm not trying to be a hater, people. But I also don't feel like I need to praise everything the man puts his name on. Eminem has set a very high standard with his previous work, and his fans should be able to expect new material to meet that standard (or surpass it) when they're shelling out hard-earned cash.Hey, I'll buy his next album too.

With the release of his previous album \\"The Eminem Show\\", which would've gotten 5 star from me, I thought he might actually be maturing and developing a following. There is no doubt that Eminem is an artist and some what of a genius but after hearing this album I keep thinking 'What the hell was he thinking?'

Instead of having his usual one \\"stupid\\" song like \\"Real Slim Shady\\" or \\"Without Me\\" he put two or three on the album this time. And now hes using jibberish to rhyme instead thinking of something significant to say. I miss the stuff he came out with that actually had a message or some substance to it now it sounds like hes reminsicing over all the things that has happened to him.

The boy cannot rap. If you'd like to listen to some real rap, stay far FAR away from this trailer trash. Sure, that's great, we get it, he doesn't like his ex-wife. So, why did he try to get back with her? And why can't he just let her go? He is so bitter, it makes me laugh. He never does anything new. He keeps talking about his ex-wife and touching (i mean, NOT, YEAH RIGHT) little boys. Hasn't he talked s**t about his ex on all of his CD's? Little white rednecks should not be allowed to rap, for they will (as he does more than once) make a joke out of rap. Listen to 3 6 Mafia instead of this wannabe rap-crap. EMINEM, YOU SUCK, MA.

This has got to be the dumbest most pathetic and feeble genre of music ever. There are no good elements in rap. Every rapper has to put on some tough attitude like being a punk is cool, because of that almost every kid at my school acts like a punk and tries to live the rap lifestyle. There is nothing musical about this either, it is just a guy talking over top of a computerized beat, bad poetry at best. This genre along with all the emo bands out there and nu metal bands and of course pop is killing off music. Thank god bands like silvertide and rose hill drive are coming along to save the world of music. Maybe they will bring us back to a time when musci was good like in the 70's and 60's. MTV is killing off music, please do not watch it. F**k MTV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Y0 Y0 Y0 Y0!!!!11111111","review":"I B Da sLeM sHaDeE Y0!!!

What, is this cd for elementry schoolers or sumpin. This whole cd consits of corny fart jokes, puke jokes and potty humor,and the beats song like goofy circus and nurshery rymes melodies, and even worse he's now runnin around sayin Crunk. can it get any worse, How could this moron make fun of corny little pop stars when he's one himself.

With his lyrical rapping skills and great producing by Dre and himself, he makes this one of the best CD's he ever came out with! There are great party songs like \\"My 1st Single\\", \\"Rain Man\\", \\"Big Weenie\\", \\"A$$ Like That\\", and his single \\"Just Lose It\\"! He also gets emotional on \\"Mockingbird\\", a song to his daughter Hailey. Em disses everyone from Ja Rule to Benzeno to the notorious Suge Night (who he hasn't even mensioned until now) in \\"Like Toy Soldiers\\" which is clearly the best song on the CD. His other best songs on the CD are without a dought \\"Like Toy Soldiers\\", \\"Yellow Brick Road\\", \\"Mockingbird\\", \\"Mosh\\", \\"Puke\\", \\"Encore\\", and \\"Just Lose It\\"!

There are a few ok tracks, but for the most part Encore Blows. By the way, Mosh is NOT one of the good tracks, it's a rehash from the 8 mile disc and just because it agrees with your political beliefs doesn't make it a good track. (And doesn't change the fact that the pres was re-elected) Stick with the Slim Shady album and Marshall M album, don't waste your $$ here. Will I buy the next album?

Many of his songs try to be funny, but are just plain annoying (Puke, Rain Man, Big Weenie, and Ass like that). In Rain Man, Eminem can't even keep the rythem.

Second single is a serious track which he tries to make himslef seem serious when he is just a joke. He follows the same track type in every album 3 tracks about how he hate kim, 3 about how he hate his mom, 3 joke/not serious tracks, 1 i love kim track, 2 growing up white b.s. track, 2 daughter tracks, and it all adds up to the marshal mathers bullsh*t.

Maybe he's just run out of ideas? The whole celebrity bashing to get attention routine is transparent. Gee how creative to kick Michael Jackson when he's done. That's an easy target.

Don't get me wrong, I liked Eminem's older albums a lot. His style has completely changed now, and it seems like he's made this album just for the sake of making a bloody album, rather than expressing himself via his medium of music. Each and every song except the one I describe below is unbearable.The one star was for the song \\"Mockingbird,\\" which, although overly sentimental, did show that he is capable of positive emotions (i.e. how he loves and cares about his daughter).

The Eminem Show was better, but this is still classic, too. Some songs were way out of control, and hilarious. I love the song \\"Mosh\\".

Ok...maybe he was a novelty at the beginning...like back in '99 but the self-riteousness, the attitude, and prolonged negativity can only take you so far.With \\"Encore\\", the formula is finally going thin. Anyone ever notice how he releases a cornball first single *which always sounds the same* then tries to go hardcore? Heck, even \\"Just Lose It\\" uses the intro from \\"Without Me.\\"Hopefully the public is tiring of all of the sound-alike hip hop that is ruling the industry right now.

However, as like most eminem cds it takes a couple weeks for some of these tracks to hit you. Lyrically a great album, but some of the topics talked about are not very interesting...like in the song \\"Puke\\". However there are shades of greatness mixed upon the many tracks of this album in \\"Mockingbird\\" and \\"Yellow Brick Road\\".My favorite song is \\"Love You More\\" which is a bonus track that hits home for me and I'm sure will with many who have been in types of relationships like that. On my last note I think if you listen to the tracks longer and interpet the songs harder it will grow on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Don't Know What to Think of This Album","review":"I don't know what to think of this album. All the songs are good but for some reason I'm not felling the album like Em's others. The songs just dont work together as an album for some reason. I like all the songs though. Maybe I've come to expect to much from Em or sumtin. This album just doesn't give me the feeling like his others. Maybe it's to much like his others, not as differn't from the last like his others. Like Marshall LP was differn't from Slim Shadey LP, and Eminem Show was differn't from Marshall Mathers LP. Maybe it's to much like his others and not as innovative as he's always been before. Maybe I was expected a great finale from Em for his last album and it wasn't a big loud crazy finish like I expected it to be. Something was just missing. So that 4 I gave the album is because the songs are good (some great), but like something was missing from this album so is a star from the score."},{"rating":"1","title":"TSK TSK TSK","review":"WITH THREE CLASSIC ALBUMS UNDER HIS BELT, ENCORE MIGHT JUST BE THE WORSTE ALBUM OF THE YEAR.

Sure this album is not as charged with the singles of his first album, the sheer rage of his second or the introspective looks of The Eminem Show BUT this is probably the best collection of pure rap tracks Em has put out since he crossed over. It is clear by tracks like Never Enough, Yellow Brick Road, Crazy In Love, and eve Encore that the emphasis of this album was on lyrical content. Not that Em doesn't always focus on lyrical content but some of these tracks are more lyrically complex then a lot of tracks on previous albums.

I didn't honestly expect another masterpiece from this album, but I at the very least expected some classic Eminem. Instead, this album is a collection of \\"old school\\" type rap songs, totally unlike anything Eminem has ever released before on a major label. I despise it. He doesn't flow like he usually does.What a major disappointment. Is this album a joke? Did Eminem pull a fast one on all of us? I can't honestly believe that he thinks this is a good album, worthy of a major label release. It sounds like underground rap. Is Em finally tapped out creatively? Is this the end of the line? The \\"Encore\\"? Is he bowing out of the rap industry? Like I said before, this album is a major disappointment, and I plan on selling my copy while it still has some market value. I can't even listen to something this bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Meets Terrible","review":"Bloody terrible, Infinite is better.

But you know what folks? He doesn't care. He's laughing all the way to the bank. While the youth of America uphold and follow him as some sort of god, Marshall Mathers is laughing and living it up. And all he had to do was shout obscenities and nursery rhymes into a microphone! Maybe I can make a CD too? Nonetheless, it's no wonder that the music industry is self-destructing. They only brought this on themselves, and they deserve their self-inflicted wounds as far as I'm concerned. It's not just Eminem either. 90% of the stock at my local CD store is pure GARBAGE.

Unlike some of his other Albums, I had no idea what message he was trying to deliver. Maybe it was more of a mix tape approach?

I spent the last 6 years listing to Eminem's rivals ICP. I always kept an open mind and checked out all of the Eminem albums and was never impressed. Eminem's Encore is excellent though, to my surprise. I purchased this album after I heard it for the first time. In \\"Mosh\\", Eminem so openly thrashes George W. Bush, which was needed from somebody the youth could relate to. Other songs such as \\"Spend some Time\\",\\"Mockingbird\\", \\"Crazy in Love\\" and \\"Encore\\" made me a believer that Eminem is good at what he does.

This album has a hidden depth that needs more than one idle listen to understand. The Eminem Show's brashness is missing and a far more lyrical quality has been added, but all in all the music is amazing. Two years seemed like such a large gap to wait for another album, but after listening to Encore...it was well worth the anticipation."},{"rating":"2","title":"EMINEM IS THE BEST, PERIOD!","review":"It's amazing that a white dude could become the best rapper of all time! I mean, come on, isn't rapping just for black artists? No way. On the album \\"Encore\\", Eminem showcases his brilliance once again. Instant classics include \\"Mosh\\", \\"Like Toy Soldiers\\", and \\"We As Americans\\". Though \\"Encore\\" is another classic, it doesn't quite have the amazing, untouchable feel that his other three albums have. He's mellowed out a lot since his debut album \\"The Slim Shady LP\\". He has a few songs on here about his ex-wife Kim(\\"Puke\\", \\"Love You More\\", and \\"Crazy In Love\\"). This album is definetly amazing, though.

If Vanilla Ice had released this BS then people wouldn't defend this garbage. Eminem can rap (not that this such a great talent) I give him that but this album is like dirty nursery rhymes that would make Andrew Dice Clay embarrassed. \\"Puke\\"???

If you are an adult and you own Eminem, shame on you.Eminem has opened the flood gates for MTV manufactured, talentless posers who seem to want to just look tough yet cute and sing about how hard life is and use the same sounds over and over again in each \\"song\\".

Aside from about 2 or 3 songs (like Toy Soldiers) the album is filled with lame, unoriginal, songs that lack in both content and presentation (Big Weenie - c'mon dude, for real?). That's right, some of Em's rhymes on this album just kinda suck, and his style actually used to be good, back in the day...Oh and Mosh sounds like a political-message rap song that at a point in time maybe had some substance but for whatever reason got turned into a dumbed-down political message for the \\"general audience\\", who don't even really like/get it. Seriously, Mosh was shady's big chance to expand into a new direction with his music but instead he delivers at half-effort.After ripping Toy Soldiers and some other track I gave away this CD to a friend.

I've liked most of Em's prior work, and he appeared to be heading in a positive direction culminating in the brilliant 'Lose Yourself'. But what happened here? It's like the progressive improvement never happened - he's back at square one.Musically, it's all rather uninspiring. Much less variation than his more recent work, and uncompelling hooks. Where are the 'Stans' on this album? There's not one song with a beat that incites you to hit the 'replay track' button.Vocally, it's all over the place (and I do wish he wouldn't try and sing - it's rather painful). Lyrically, it's disastrous. I thought the boy might have been maturing after listening to 8 Mile.

Where did the genius go?","review":"I could not have been more dissapointed with this album. The lyrics are terrible, the beats suck, and in other words Eminem has turned into any other one of those crappy rappers out there.This CD doesn't come close in quality to the Marshal Mathers LP let alone the Eminem Show, the greatest Rap CD ever made.Eminem acts like a retard in this CD. He repeats words like ten times in a row in stead of rhyming like he does in his other albums, and none of his songs have the wonderfull Eminem feel that I always liked.I forced myself to listen through the whole thing plus the bonus CD just so I could say I heard the whole thing, and it is a piece of ****. If you are an Eminem fan buy this album just so you can own all his CD's but don't expect it to be worth listening too more than 0 times.This album is quite frankly a piece of crap, and if you are hoping to get any enjoyment out of buying this cd, FORGET IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst albums I ever heard!","review":"Don't even download this crap, Em has hit rock bottom although I thought he was never that great begin with, there's something wrong with you if you think this is hot, I suggest that you check out KRS-ONE's \\"Keep Right\\" album instead if you want a recent quality hip-hop album."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was Em thinking???","review":"This one was garbage!

And then to show you the talent listen to the song \\"big weenie\\" where he talks about that he doesnt have to look at a paper that he can say what he thinks well i counted like 15 seconds about someone having bad breath and tooth decay thats got to be the dumbest thing i have ever heard and to just let you know the only reason he really sells albums is some talent but more that he is white now and a pop icon other then that he has lost talent and all respect that i had for him"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disappointed","review":"Okay..let me make the record very clear here: I like eminem's stuff.

Half of these songs really made me ashamed of listening to it in the first place. The only thing that I really will say that I like about this album is \\"Mosh\\"..and Em using a Atmosphere lyric: \\"Momma had a baby and it's head popped off\\" in \\"Evil Deeds\\".

I can't understand how such an intelligent and gifted guy can't get it together for his own album. He did great work producing for other artists such as 2pac, Jay-Z, Nas and Jadakiss but for some reason he forgets how to produce for himself. I was never such an Eminem fan but i really thought this album would be different but again it's bland, boring and repetetive. The only 2 good tracks here are Rain Man and Just Lose It with the latter being good simply because the lyrics are so funny, only Em could get away with it.

Just lose it was bad too but this album had its high points like Yellow Brick ROad, Mockingbird, Rain MAn, and Evil Deeds.

This album is a weak effort by the best rapper out there and is a major letdown. Eminem went soft on this album and fails to do what he does best which is stir up controversy and make hilarious rhymes. The only person he manages to offend on this album is Michael Jackson and that's already been done. I think the problem was that Dre did not have enough input into this CD since he only produced half the tracks on it. These are the best songs on the album including my favorite Encore featuring Dre himself. When Eminem laces the track all you get is a weak beat complete with fart noises, burps and puking. Hopefully bad reviews like this one causes Eminem to elevate his rhymes and be the great rapper that he is. I look forward to new Eminem albums and hope that he doesn't go out with this weak CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slim Shady Where ARE You?","review":"This album is so terrible it leads one to the theory that it is intentional. I mean, listen to Just Don't Give A F***, Rock Bottom, and Brain Damage from his first album, and then Puke, Mosh, Ass Like That from Encore and the difference is obvious. This is passionless music. If you want a passionate Eminem, check out \\"Straight from the Lab\\". Em is either saving his best for the bootleggers, or has gone off the deep end. I truly want to believe it is the former."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is the worst cd i bought!!","review":"i was really excited to get it, but there's only a couple of good songs, the rest is crap. it's obvious that eminem didn't care about quality, just quantity. get the songs from itunes to save some $$!"},{"rating":"1","title":"no im sorry","review":"ive got all em's albums ,they were all off the hook, but this ones just not there ,the first 3 i was instantly hooked, i might get used to this in time but its not on the level we are used to hearing from the man, he's got all his shady artists on here, 50, obie, d12, all i can say is rap is just gettin worse, some one should save it, krs one, public enemy etc should drop another bomb before 'rap' turns into watered down pop, some of you will love it but not me"},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to Move On","review":"I loved \\"The Eminem Show\\" and could not wait to get my hands on the follow up.

O.K., you had a bad childhood, you hate your father, your wife Kim was a drag, and until Dr. Dre came along your career in music was going nowhere. Been there, done that.This effort gives the Eminem fan nothing new to grasp on to. Nothing fresh, no inspiration, no reason to listen more then once. We have heard this story before. Might be time to retire your jersey."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe people actually enjoy this","review":"This album is terrible. This is below below what Eminem's standards should be. A couple good songs and a funny skit should't sell 4 million copies in the first week. Eminem needs to learn he can't sing. 'Mockingbird' would've been good without it. 'Spend Some Time' would've been good without it. Everything would be better without it. Dre's production is TERRIBLE. Nothing special from him. Nothing special from Eminem.

Since then his music has declined into one of the most monotonous and poorly produced albums i have heard. As a big eminem fan, i was extremely let down by this album... it's just not good. His first single 'just lose it' has none of the ingenuity of the singles from his previous albums and feels churned out last minute so that he can attract the mtv audience... the lyrics he spits just don't sound like the eminem that broke new ground with The Slim Shady LP. Maybe he's getting tired..but his lyrics just arent as satirical and fast paced as they once were.

Michael Jackson, who has higher standards. Michael Jackson, who is idolized by many...and yet Eminem said that he STILL idolizes Michael Jackson.Eminem says Michael is a genius, a legend, and has gone through a lot of $hit. Is he just hypocritical? He bashes a legend, a genius, the man he idolized? He wants to add to more of this B.S MJ is persisting through?Eminem, you have low standards, and maybe that's why your records sales are decreasing, and your fan base is weakening.

I really liked \\"Mosh\\" because I completely agree with his Bush-isms. My absolute favorites from the CD are \\"Just Lose It\\" *of course*, \\"Crazy In Love\\", \\"Never Enough\\" and the last track - \\"Curtains Down\\".

This new album is just a bunch of lullabies and love songs. The bonus cd had 3 songs on it, and they were better than any song on the actual album. I was hoping that Eminem would redeem himself after the Eminem Show, but i was wrong. I listen to a song like \\"Criminal\\" from The Marshall Mathers Lp, and it just destroyes any song from the new album. Eminem NEEDS to make another album like the Marshall Mathers LP.

There are maybe 3 or 4 songs worth listening to in this whole deal. While production is pretty much there, Eminem seems not to care about the lyrics. He whips them off in various styles, but they, for the most part, sound like he's rambling about whatever topic. It's as it he's not even trying as all on this one. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was he thinking???????","review":"I am a big Eminem fan but I dont know what he was thinking with this one.He shows alot of lyrical talent on Yellow Brick Road, Mosh, Like Toy Soldiers,Never Enough and We as Americans.Its his worst album since the Slim Shady Lp.If he doesn't step it up maybe fans wont ask for an Encore!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No encore please!","review":"Where do I begin? This album is worst then the other ones he did, and they suck also. I am tired of his high pitch voice, and his style of exploiting and reticule of people. Man this stuff is getting old, and maybe he is a telented rapper but the contents are not. His new song, I don't remember, is the lamest of all the lame songs he put out. He never saw a \\"a** like that?\\". Come on, you sound like a bag of candy! Why do people buy this stuff?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eminem Encore","review":"Excellent album. Eminem, for but his mortal flaws, is one our times greatest artist. In order to find his genius one must look to his past. For this, I recommend your own research. I will only say that if you require a depiction of the life and times of Marshall Mathers-look only to his words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly an 'Encore'","review":"Encore; an album that was supposedly composed in 2 weeks by Eminem, really shows a lack of effort. I can't consider this album, as a whole, 'music'.He gave his fans what they wanted--- an updated Slim Shady-- and, they got him. Too bad Eminem has matured too much to take on this persona again, and produced 'potty-humor' that only his daughter, Hailey Jade (see 'Mockingbird') can laugh at.I gave this album 3 stars (as 2.5 stars isn't selectable), because half of the songs on this album are bearable. However, the 'mature' Eminem showcases some brilliant lyrical talent, like 'Yellow Brick Road' and 'Never Enough'. I find Eminem is a better storyteller now than he is a comedian. Hopefully when (or if) Eminem produces another album, he'll come to his senses and drop the fact that he's not funny anymore.Those who have listened to this album would agree that if Eminem had released this album as his first, his success would be non-existent.I don't think that this album is worth the buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happen eminem","review":"When I first heard of the album coming out I couldn't wait to get it. When I heard it I couldn't believe that the album was that bad.I was hoping for this album to be more like the eminem show or the marshell mathers Lp.Insted it's nothing like those albums. I know that eminem is putting out a greates hits collection but please em' before you do that make another album because I know you could do better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eminem - Encore","review":"After a 2 year break from Eminem Show, Eminem releases this less than average album.The lyrics on this album fail pretty bad on most tracks, but are really good on some others. Tracks that are lyrically good are \\"Yellow Brick Road\\", \\"Like Toy Soldiers\\", \\"Spend Some Time\\", \\"Mockingbird\\" and that's really it in my opinion.The beats, its half and half like above. Good beats are \\"Like Toy Soldiers\\", \\"Spend Some Time\\", \\"Mockingbird\\", \\"Encore.Overall, Eminem just wasn't hungry on this album. A few good tracks, followed by a pretty good flock of mediocre tracks just doesn't equal up the first two albums Em released.

Dude, didn't anyone have the courage to say, \\"Em, dude, this cd is whack. Maybe ya better record some more songs.\\" And Em musta said, \\"Nah, my dumb little fans will buy anything I puke out!\\". There was a time when his hyper rapping style and goofiness was entertaining but now it's just annoying. It's time for someone else to get the attention you got. \\"Rain Man\\", \\"Puke\\", \\"As- Like Taht\\", \\"Just Lose It\\", all whack.

A friend of mine pointed that out to me, and a seriously is true. But it's not a compliment, it's shows how bad the songs on this cd are.I just think this cd is mostly depressing and where Em tries to be funny he just isn't. There is a lot of gross stuff on some songs and I'm not being a prude I just don't want to listen to Em taking a dump while talking on the phone. It just isn't entertaining. And there are other things like farting and throwing up that sound disgusting. Some reviewers are saying Em has \\"grown up\\" and gotten mature but I mean how mature is this unneeded \\"humor\\"?I thought \\"Just Lose It\\" was the worst first single from any of his cds. But now after listening to the whole album I think \\"Just Lose It\\" is one of the better songs. Not saying much.

It is not be his best work. \\"Encore\\" digs deep within his mind, and with Eminem's lyrical ability, strikes the listener, or fan, to demand the CD be listened to. Alot of what Eminem talks about happened to all of his, he just puts it in a grander perspective.Some of the songs are funny, and some are psychotic. Eminem goes off on tangents that are worth listening to. I have the boxed set, with the seperate pictures. The lyrics are on the other side of the picture. The lyrics are a crack up, and it's fun reading through them, to see who he picks on next, and figure out what he's trying to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISSAPOINTMENT","review":"this album was pathetic. eminem's first 3 albums were classics. this album, eminem doesn't know what to rap about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameless Rip Off","review":"This cheap film shamelessly rips off the title \\"Forbidden Zone\\" in order to confuse it with Richard Elfman's cult masterpiece of the same title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ace Reporter","review":"In this age of rip-and-read anchor persons, it's startling to confront an example of an earlier age when reporters were journalists. Robert Casey is a journalist's journalist, perhaps the best writer of any who covered WWII. He frequented both European and Pacific battlefields to report the human face of what he saw. In this book, he records events and experiences from the European theater from early in the American entry into the war to the expulsion of the last German armies from France. Covering Atlantic convoys, motor torpoedo boats in the Channel, the D-Day invasion, the breakout from the Hedgerows, the liberation of Paris, he writes with both intense human involvement and the reporter's eye for detail.

It looks very nice and kept my wine cool while it worked, but now I need to replace it. I agree with other reviewers that the shelf spacing isn't large enough for some of the bigger wine bottles out there, and it really isn't very deep either.

Sold it, stupidly, but found it again on amazon. I don't have the original Xbox and am playing on the 360. The oly issue with that is that the game will sometimes freeze the console and you have to restart the whole thing. It only does it when going to different districts, so if you save your progress and don't mind getting up and restarting the Xbox every few hours, it's totally fine. Sometimes it doesn't do anything at all. No freezing that is.

The designs are very striking, especially in the bright colors the Turkish people love.My only complaint is with the layout of the book itself. The title font is difficult to read and the graphs are ... weird. They are very large, say 5 stitches per inch as opposed to 10 per inch you usually see. So it's hard to see the whole pattern in a single glance. Second, the symbol used in the graph to indicate the patter is weird, a tilde ~ and it again makes the pattern hard to see at a glance. I found it most useful to copy and reduce the pages and then color the pattern squares in with more readable symbols.This is not a book for beginner knitters. If you don't already know hot to knit socks you'll have a difficult time. If you already know how to knit, you'll love the patterns and find many uses for them beyond socks."},{"rating":"2","title":"A loving meditation on art","review":"Ten stars. This beautifully-written, handsomely-illustrated book is a must-read for all lovers of art, of any period. Not only does Varnedoe illuminate the works of specific artists, traditions and eras, he proposes fresh ways of looking at and thinking about art. Writing about Degas, he says, \\"This Realism doesn't describe a world, it proposes one.\\" Modern art makes the familiar look strange so that we may come to know it more fully - from a variety of perspectives. Key to Varnedoe's argument is the contribution of the individual artist, whose innovations should not be reduced to a \\"cultural context\\" by later historians. My favorite quote in the book comes not from Varnedoe but from the Russian Formalist Viktor Shklovski: \\"And ... so that stones may be stony, there exists what we call art.\\" A provocative and inspiring read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought this for a teacher in my building","review":"Bought this for a teacher in my building that was having a time management problem, I never read it myself"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good tutorials and problems.

Have no idea why the producing company should not have kept it in its inventory (save for lack of sales due to inadequate appreciation of what this production does) but, hopefully, it will be available at a reasonable price from some (legal, of course) source.I will note that the five stars represent a comparison with productions of similar type rather than with the GRAND OPERA with its compulsory tragedy and exaggerated emotion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Cleanup","review":"I'm not a professional drywall installer but have done a fair amount and do appreciate quality tools.

Don't get me wrong- there's nothing wrong with sounding slightly derivative- all bands are to some extent. But this cd is nothing more than a \\"good clean fun\\" version of Rancid. So why not just buy a Rancid cd? They're fifty times better. Christian magazines even marketed the band that way- if you liked Rancid, you were suppossed to like One-21. A way to play punk in your mom's minivan without making her angry.

One of the jailers, curious about this \\"famous\\" Christian, risks his neck to ask Peter questions about his experiences with Jesus -- particularly the events surrounding His crucifixion. Peter recounts portions of his time with Jesus, and the viewer gets to see Scripture in motion -- it is very powerful to see and hear Jesus words in context! It is impactful, also, to realize how human Jesus' disciples were... yet still so loved by Jesus.Would not recommend for young children, as the depiction of Satan could be a bit frightening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"Enjoyed watching this movie very much.

I love the way that it was written. It is easy reading, and anyone can understand it. I must admit that the author gives very vivid images of everything she saw, felt,smelled, or heard in hell. The book is 100% truth, and everything coincides with the Bible. Also the things that were written, no human could just make up. This book is a true blessing. If you're saved it just makes you appreciate Jesus all the more because of what he has done for you, and the horrors that he has saved you from. And if your not, it will open your eyes, and make you wanna make a serious change in your life. I pray that everyone will read this book and get right with God.

Satan ruling Hell? Where in the world did she get these notions? Oh yeah, \\"Jesus\\" showed them to her (hint: this was not the Jesus of the Bible.)

It does the amazing task of covering 7+ years of television history regarding the show responsible for renewed interest in science-fiction.The history is indeed an interesting one. Many tidbits are revealed, and if you are a trivia junkie, it will fill the endless void nicely.The pictures are great, as well as commentary and brief interviews of folks. The only thing I felt that could have been done better were episode summaries. They fell by the wayside a bit; but the sheer volume of information contained in the book makes up for it.It is well-constructed, and has lasted repeated flipping and reading. That and its size make it an excellent coffee table book. People who have no interest in Trek pick it up and are fascinated by the information. It makes a great gift, for yourself or the TNG fan in your life.

Although some people feel this predecessor to \\"Marvelous Things\\" (released the end of that year) is inferior to their sophomore EP, I disagree on all counts. \\"Laughing City\\" proves Eisley's capability to create worlds through their music ~ from the serene melodies of \\"I Wasn't Prepared\\" and the title track to the dancing rhythmic harmonies in \\"Tree Tops\\". Sherri and Stacy's unique vocals and harmonies provide a texture to the music that blends perfectly with the other instruments.

Jena Bodner, in her first film role, delivers a credible performance as a woman undergoing a lycanthropic change and makes the movie worthwhile all on her own. Yes, she is nude every other scene, but you can hardly hold that against her. The castle setting, direction and cinematography all add a great deal to the production. My one complaint is that the ending is a bit inconclusive and up in the air, then, it looks like they were looking to make it into a series of films. The old British TV show \\"She-Wolf of London\\" might have done well to employ more of the primal, sexual themes used here. This is not one of the high art horror movies, like Dario Argento or Mario Bava, it is strictly exploitation, but it is well-done exploitation, and a pleasant surprise for a weekend night."},{"rating":"1","title":"left me howling mad","review":"Supposedly set in Wales, but shot in Romania. The accents are so bad as to be offensive, most of the cast sound like scandinavians being slowly beaten to death with Irish people rather than Welsh.

Falkner doesn't disappoint. I am a fan of the power pop genre but have often been disappointed with the simplicity of some of the songs put out by artists who write power pop stuff. The three exceptions to this are Brendan Benson (his stuff is SUPERB), Eric Matthews and Jason Falkner. If I were to pick a favourite song out of this five, I would have to go for 'Lost Myself'. It contains one of those typical brilliant Falkner choruses that comes in by surprise.Yeah, this man knows how to write good music.

Soundtracks often only have 2-3 tracks which you've been desperate to get hold of, but the D.E.B.S. soundtrack is that and a whole lot more. As previously mentioned, the music plays an important role in the movie, and these songs have clearly and cleverly been handpicked. All tracks will remind you of the movie. If you haven't seen the movie you needn't worry - though I'd recommend it - the soundtrack is an album by itself, mixing old (well old, that makes me old!) and new. Seriously great tunes, you'll wanna hear over and over and over and over (you get the idea). While this last sentence may become dull... the tracks to this album will NOT! Candy for the ears - Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This is probably more like 2.5 stars as there are redeemable songs here.I was disappointed with this CD.

Most of these songs I could do without.The best songs on this soundtrack are Be Like Water and Strict Machine. I'm not sorry I bought these but it would have been a lot cheaper to buy them as singles if that were possible. A Little Respect is not bad but I found out I only really like it in the goofy movie scene when Lucy Diamond dances to it.

All instruments are buried in the red, often making Sighting's music more vicious white noise than anything else. They straddle the line between arbitrary noise and music, but they know what they're doing, and keep the results captivating.

It turned out to be opposite of the commercials. This vacuum is poorly built and appears to be fragile, not made to last.

I returned it within 24 hours of purchase and bought a Eureka 4885 which is far superior. Overall, this Euro-Pro is not even worth twenty bucks.

You would be much better off skipping both the book and the manual, and looking to the Bible and your own wife (for those of you who are married)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frightening, ignorant book","review":"This book is a call to arm for misogynists to take back there throne so high a top women. It assumes a \\"natural\\" masculinity that is equated to emotional distance, and dominance that implicitly states that men are superior and more powerful than women. Domestic abuse is explained as a result of over-investing in a man's relationship to a female, instead of being the product of a world that falsely trains men to believe that they must dominate at all costs - exactly as this book tends to do. Its rhetoric reminds me of the KKK's \\"oppressed white community\\" mantra in its message that men have been \\"stripped\\" of power. Why don't we embrace in a world that has made some strides in gender equality, and try to further a society in which masculinity and femininity are equally valued, and allowed to manifest in men OR women???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Powerful Book Next To the Bible!","review":"Wild at Heart is a must read for any man. Especially for the fathers. It is the most powerful book I have read and used next to the Bible. I taught a men's group on the book at a church and now have set up a men's study group at work. Fathers, you owe it to your sons, no matter what their age, to read this book and be honest with yourself.What more can I say?"},{"rating":"2","title":"wild at heart","review":"I have not finished this book as I am writing this. I can say the first 40 pages are worth the purchase price. Eldredge really seems to know how a man is to relate to Jesus.

Maybe you should wait to get your multiengine rating if you're at that level."},{"rating":"2","title":"very impressive","review":"I don't know how old Michelle Branch was when she recoded this CD, but I am sure she's old enough to be my daughter that I would have had in my 20's. Her lyrics are ingsightful without alienating audience in her age group but retain a certain sophistication beyond her years. Imagine she wrote most the songs, co-wrote some, played the guitar and the base, and what a crystalline voice, the kind that is timeless and can transcend her listeners. It is nice to know that The Woman Song Writing tradition started by Joni Mitchel, Joan Armatrading and such will be continued, for this reason, I think Michelle Branch will be around for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing album","review":"I think this album is absolutely amazing. This guitarist/singer-songwriter has some serious talent. She's only been playing guitar for 4-5 years, and only turning 19 next month. Her style is something new and refreshing. I have been listening to this cd repeatedly for up to 7 hours a day... ever since October, two months after it had come out. I have regretted it for not buying it sooner. You think I'm crazy for listening to it over and over, right? After YOU listen to it, I think you'd do the same. With intelligent lyrics and both electric and acoustic sounds, this Pop/Rock album is a must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD from a hot new artist","review":"I first heard Branch's single \\"Everywhere\\" while on vacation in SE Asia. Then after listening to it at a music store I knew I had to get it. I wasn't disappointed. I like the energy and freshness a new artist brings to the music scene. I'm confident this will be the first of many great CDs from Branch."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's Everywhere","review":"For me to like an artist it is really easy, have one good song and I'll go buy the CD. Well, this happened with Michelle Branch's song \\"Everywhere.\\"I went out and bought the CD and I personally loved it. Every song on the CD had a piece of Michelle in it.This CD is easy for a teenager to enjoy and it will make a person get hooked on Michelle.What's not to love?

There is no doubt in my mind that I'll be one of the first people to get her next CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"write","review":"This is an amazing cd!

Keep your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, I'm not being harsh.","review":"I'm being real. The fact that contemporary music listeners acclaim this CD as being one of the most deep and reflective albums in current Pop music shows how dumb we've gotten since Britney Spears and N'Sync. This may be a notch up from Spear Britney and NStink, but it's nothing to be acclaimed; for Christ's sake even the songs that hit the radio are hokey and overproduced, how long will it take listeners to again understand that there IS music past female posterchilds with one-hit-wonder written all over them?No, i'm not scapegoating anybody! This is just uninspired, boring, and incredibly annoying. My female dog Missy has more true emotion and inspiration in her voice, and dog's are probably the most emotionally shallow house animal there is. Stay away from this album, for God's sake I'd recommend Christina Aguilera's new album over this.. I'm Serious!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERATED!!","review":"I don't care if she writes her own songs, or sings without the help of machines like other pop people. Her songs (...). Period. I can understand how people can like her, but she's not \\"amazing\\". There's been many before her that have written better lyrics. If you listen, her lyrics aren't that \\"brillant\\". If you want some real female talent, listen to Carole King."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"I don't even know what I liked about this CD when I bought it.. but I know I never listened to it much, and still don't. It's just plain BORING.. there's nothing original about Michelle Branch at all.. if you want REAL music, check out Def Leppard's Greatest Hits. *I* even write better lyrics than Michelle and I'm not even in the spotlight, lol.

All You Wanted was better. Goodbye To You played on two of my favorite shows(Buffy and Charmed). But I bought this album and gave it a chance, I even relistened to it.

Because of that i bought the CD, but i'm warning you...all the other songs sound the same. They are slow, use the same tune and Michelle's voice just gets annoying after a while. Rather buy Avril Lavigne's new CD...now there's talent!! Her songs are all different and each one has something new to offer...and she doesn't get boring!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go, Michelle!","review":"Michelle Branch may be just what the doctor ordered. Michelle writes her own music, and plays it on her guitar. Her voice is memorable, and different from many other female artists. You can tell she puts a lot of feeling into her songs, simply by listening to them. Her two hit songs on this album, and my favorites, are good-pop-beat \\"Everywhere\\", and emotional \\"All You Wanted\\". If you like Avril Lavigne, or Vanessa Carlton, then it's very likely that you'll like Michelle Branch.I highly recommend The Spirit Room, as well as Michelle's second album, Hotel Paper.This review was brought to you by,GMM (Gold Mew Mew)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the 'Goodbye To You' you're looking for","review":"I bought this for the song 'Goodbye To You', which appeared in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode 'Tabula Rasa', but the version on this album is different and not nearly as good. The Buffy version is simple and dramatic; the album version has been remixed with additional instrumentation to make it sound a lot like everything else on the album: not terrible, but pretty forgettable. The whole thing is more mainstream and formulaic than I hoped.Edited to add: The album version is not a re-write, it's how the song was written. For the Buffy episode Josh Whedon wanted it changed to be more sombre."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than u can imagine","review":"This album is realy good , Michelle has a real talent , her voice is very special , wich gives her an amzing charm .Between Alanis morissette and Avril lavigne ; michelle branch is a very good singer .I don't know why evrybody compares her to Vanesa Carlton cuz there's nothing in common with her !!!The spirit room is more rock than pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Really Talented Artist!","review":"Michelle Branch's \\"The Spirit Room\\" Is Without A Doubt The Best CD That I've Ever Bought.

I had apprehensions about this album though. I saw some danger in it being a tad bit to poppish, maybe her one song only disguised her Brittanyesque style? However, there are no secrets to this album. It is what it should be. It reminds me of Fastball's, \\"All the Pain Money Can Buy,\\" which had a superb summer single, supported by a very good album. None of the other songs sound like \\"Everywhere\\", but they are good. She has a voice that seems to be a cross between Alanis Morissette and Susan Tedeschi (excuse my spelling), and she can play guitar, I dont think Brittany can. I would recommend this album, it's the start to what I hope is a promising career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michelle Branch: Simply Amazing","review":"This is a new review as I wrote another one before I got her album.Her CD is AMAZING!!!!!!

Finally after living through the NSYNC, BSB, Britney phases the music scene has finally discovered talent. Michelle Branch rocks. She isn't your typical POP singer who uses computerized vocals and beats. Michelle writes her songs, sings them, and plays the guitar. She has a lot of strong songs like \\"All You Wanted\\", \\"Everywhere\\", \\"Something to Sleep To\\", \\"Sweet Misery\\", \\"Here with Me\\" and \\"You Set Me Free\\"If you like guitars and actual TALENT, Michelle Branch's music is for you! ;D"},{"rating":"2","title":"breathe a little......","review":"Just wondering why everyone is being so uptight about this cd..just because it is not your regular teeny-bopping cd does not mean it isn't good.

My favorite songs on this CD are All You Wanted, Drop In The Ocean, If Only She Knew, Sweet Misery, and Goodbye To You (the radio version is better, but still a great song).

Try listening to Everywhere, Goodbye to You, Here With Me, or All you Wanted to see if you'll like her music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised","review":"I absolutely love this CD. And this coming from someone who generally doesn't like pop music. I've always felt if you find a CD in which at least half of the songs are ones you want to listen to over and over, then you've found a keeper. Well guess what folks? There's not one bad song on this CD. I don't have to skip a song here and there because it's all good. All killer, no filler...what a rare feat these days!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a great cd","review":"I have to say, this is one of the few cds where I actually like all the songs. Michelle is amazing, and I feel she is a very down-to-Earth singer. I can say that her songs relate to her fans; for a few months, I think I was living the songs \\"If Only She Knew\\", and \\"Goodbye To You\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly overrated","review":"I have listened to this too many times trying to find what people see in this, these ears don't hear it. Her voice is nothing special, same with the meaningless lyrics. The melodies are just as easily forgetable as the words. Don't buy this CD because you like the first song (everywhere) like I did. The rest of the disc sounds nothing like it. It's the only truly good song on the CD. There are about 3 others that are listenable. The rest I can hardly even get through, with some of the music and background vocals so annoying in places I want to pull the CD out of the player and smash it. Lousy production to me with annoying background vocals that like to drown out the main vocals. There is alot better music than this out there, not recommended by me. If you want some new chick tunes that rock with decent production, lyrics with some meaning and real melodies, try Rachel Farris her voice and songwriting skills infinitely better than Michelle Branch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shy Pop Listener","review":"Michelle Branch has been around and quite frankly, I knew she was around on the radio but never really tuned in. All the people I hang around with listen to hip hop, rock I guess those types of music and never pop. But when im driving in my car and im alone I listen to music that I wouldnt normaly listen to while with friends. Michelle Branch has this voice thats soo beautiful and she knows how to play the guitar. She's a True pop talent and a good role model for young teenage girls. Other sings like Avril,Ashley, Hilary etc all suck. They are soo made up and have no music talent. All Wannabes.I hope that Michelle Branch keeps up the good work and keep releasing records."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great album","review":"I just have to say that this album is pretty life changing, and everyone should have a copy of it, along with \\"Hotel Paper.\\" And for the last reviewer who said that Branch is 14, she is 21 going on 22 on July 2.

She convinced me that I would love it even though I didn't even know who Michelle Branch was!!!!!!! Get that! HAH!! On the way home, I listened to Michelle Branch in my dad's car. \\"Everywhere\\" is my favorite song on the album and I even want to sing it in my school's talent show next year. She reminds me of myself because we have similiar voices and both play the guitar. For teens like myself, she is a SUPER DOOPER role model cuz she doesn't go around half naked like Britney.

She's not that good. Her voice and lyrics are average, if that. Her hit song, whatever it's called, sounds like it could have been written for any teenybop singer. I heard she writes her songs, though, so I have to give her that much credit. At least she has enough intelligence to write her own lyrics, however unoriginal they are. I guess our society is so accustomed to bad untalented pop singers (Spears, C. Aguilera, J. Simpson, M. Moore, J. Lopez, etc.) that when one of barely average talent comes along, they are held in much higher regard than they deserve. Michelle Branch is an example of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Spirit","review":"Very well put together and completely uninteresting. While Michelle has a nice voice and can play an instrument, she apparently has nothing new to say. In one song she actually says \\"in this crazy, mixed-up world\\". Unless you are under 15 years old buy something by an angry young women like Fiona or Alanis instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very boring","review":"I have to echo what a lot of other people are saying: This album is really mediocre. It's a collection of bland, inoffensive, peppy tunes that will fade from mind as soon as the CD ends. I actually skipped past a lot of the songs on the first listen. I was expecting alot more, but the album didn't live up to the promise of \\"All You Wanted\\". I guess she gets some credit for writing the songs herself, but what does that matter if it still sound like the same commercialized, processed pop?"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Goodbye to You\\" featured in Buffy tVS Season 6","review":"Michelle Branch did a guest spot on BtVS Season 6's episode, \\"Tabula Rasa\\" (the episode following the incredible \\"Once More With Feeling\\" musical).

I immediately loved her. I bought her Spirit Room CD and have to say it is excellent. Every single track is great, especially my favorite, Goodbye to Love. Her voice is exceptional. This is an extremely talented young artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christian for teens","review":"Michelle is an awsome artist.

It's very quite simple! First Michelle has originality, second the voice to back it up, and finally fans around the world whom supports her music and what she had done. Don't listen to reviews who bash Michelle, they just don't realize how good she really is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She's genuine","review":"Michelle Branch rocks. She writes her own songs, plays the guitar and is under 20? geez she rocks. The CD also rocks. The best songs on the album aren't the singles. She writes from the heart, you'll find yourself relating to her in almost every song. And it's not some pop producer's song - it's her lyrics. I love the entire album, it's one of the few albums that I can play front to back. It's great. Get it. DAMIT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jetting off from the Starting Blocks","review":"This cd was great. The added video and pics were a treat. Michelle Branch has a wonderful voice, and her songs just touch you where you need to be touched. \\"Everywhere\\", \\"Goodbye to you\\" just spoke to me. \\"You Get Me\\" told me another story. When I put on this cd and I close my eyes I don't have to worry about any song I don't want to hear because I like the all. Besides the three I already named my favourites are \\"All You Wanted\\" and \\"Sweet Misery\\". I can't wait for Hotel Paper to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the most orginal CD in the world...","review":"But she IS talented. No, her lyrics aren't the best, and her guitar skills are by no means stellar, but she has a pretty voice, and the songs are catchy--in a good way. And even the lyrics, though cliched, are down to earth--she doesn't try to appear deep or mystical, like Creed does, she just says what she wants to say and lets you do what you will with it. My favorite songs on the CD would have to be \\"All You Wanted,\\" \\"If Only She Knew,\\" \\"Everywhere,\\" and \\"I'd Rather Be In Love.\\" Give her a break, guys--she's only 18, and at least she's not pretending to be all deep and spiritual. She comes across as someone who's comfortable with herself and doesn't feel a need to prove her maturity or talent. Which means something in itself, yes?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes a bit...","review":"This cd was pretty low-key in comparison to what I was expecting. However, despite many of the tracks being similar, it is still easy to listen to especially while working or driving.

Thanx 4 ur help evry1!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Michelle Branch rocks!!!","review":"Like the other reviewers have said, this isn't another teen queen like britney. Michelle's songs are indie music, which sounds like rock with a little bit of country sound. Every single song is about relationships. Although I can't relate to a few of them because I'm a guy, some of the lyrics work both ways, like the lyrics to \\"everywhere\\" and \\"you set me free\\". The best songs in my opinion are tracks 1, 4, 6 and 8, but I like all the songs except maybe track 11, which sounds kind of like a gospel song.This is an ENHANCED CD...If you stick it in your computer, you will find a link to the web and some cool pictures. You'll also find a video, but the video in the cd extra ISN'T the same video as the one on mtv. It shows scenes of michelle singing, playing guitar and having her picture taken. The guy in the mtv video isn't in the cd's video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading...","review":"I was first exposed to Michelle on a late night \\"live\\" performance... I first heard Everywhere there and it had punch, and the influction in her voice brought the promise of something really new and interesting. However, after hearing the cd after purchasing, I must say, the rest of the album scarcely resembles the song that is indeed, everywhere. There are highpoints, the vocals and production is layered appropriately however the cd just quickly devolves into \\"typical\\". After \\"Torn\\" by Natalie and \\"Taffy\\" by Lisa Loeb I was hoping for more follow through as far as a \\"complete\\" cd. This is more a collection of chorus's with the verses being more of an after thought than something solid. If you like lite pop this may be a good cd for you though if you are expecting something a bit more raw, alive, and down to earth this isn't it. (...)you could do worse than the Spirit Room, but I can't reccommend it (**)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got Boring Quick I Only Liked About 4 Tracks","review":"1. Everywhere 4/52. You Get Me 1/53.

In two words: SHE ROCKS!!!I think that the whole album is great and she has the exact mix of great lyrics and music.The best songs of the album, are the following:Everything: who hasn't heard it?All you wanted: this is one of the best songs in the album.You set me free: great song. Great lyrics. One of my favorites.Here with me: this is not Dido's song, but its a great song, great one!!!Goodbye to you: this is a slow song, and i usually dont like the slow songs, but this is the best she could ever made!! You can feel that she's singing with her feelingsI might say that the other songs are also great, and maybe You Get Me will be a singe, but sorry, i prefer others!!Well, if you dont buy this album, is because ou dont like good music!!

Michelle has a strong voice. She excutes it well on her debut. The songs on THE SPIRIT ROOM are very well done. It shines with pop/rock delights and it flows very nicely. Each track is acoustic guitar driven with hints of electric guitars and drum machine beats. Michelle co-wrote all of the tracks here, mostly about love. THE SPIRIT ROOM is not candy coated, polised pop. Each song has a certain edge to it. Michelle's strong vocals and the electric guitars add that edge. THE SPIRIT ROOM is pop/rock gem that leaves you wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"the spirit","review":"this cd was ok. it was a diffrent style. a little indie, a little rock, a little pop. i liked the album cover so i purchased it. the album wasn't as quality as the album cover. but i said to myself. give mb a break. keep this cd. so i did and i still have it right next to me. the wreckers which mb is part of a country music duo, she's way better @country than she is @pop/rock/indie. michelle branch you rock! just please stick to country from now on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My goodness","review":"This is a review about music. Politics should have nothing to do with an incredible talent. Honey you sing about \\"Your Everything To Me\\". You did it, you made it. The listeners should be everything for you. People who think they control a thing have no control. They pretend and lots of people who listen follow them instead of thinking for themselvesThis song is about the Muses. Who inspired you?, When you fell, Who picked you up? When they told you Your nothing, What kept you going? You did. Yet there was something there driving you. What was that feeling?

All you wanted, Everywhere, Breathe and Are you Happy Now are all great songs. I was at the library with my grandma and I saw this CD on the rack. I wanted to try it out because I had heard her singles and I liked them. But this CD does not live up to her singles. Michelle's voice is whiny, annoying and after each sentence in a song, she'll take in this annoying breath.Good Gravy-she sounds like Avril! I can't stand these annoying alternative pop stars. I thought Avril was bad-but this is horrendous. The songs are lame and boring(except the singles). Not to mention unoriginal.You know, she would have a lot of potential if she had other people help write her songs-better yet, don't write the songs at all.I'm soooooo glad that I checked this out at the library. Otherwise, I would have wasted fifteen bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but nothin special.","review":"This cd can be sorta fun but only when you're singing along. I, personally, don't really enjoy her voice like some people here seem to. Her songwriting is shallow and unoriginal and so is her guitar playing.

That's just ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"the new alanis?","review":"its not really a complement really is it,being compared to miss irony herself,she always made mediocre songs and so does Branch.we don't really need her 'insight' in the world we have already got the likes of jimmy eat world to do that sort of stuff(and they do it much better too) not do we need anoither solo female with a guitar.this album is impossible hate,difficult to like unless you really really love alanis in which case there is really no point in you getting this album as it is like a collection of her b-sides.yes it really isn't that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"how much can we take","review":"how many more britney wannabe's can we stand come on now, when will this pop stuff end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally we can respect a young talented artist!!","review":"Michelle takes us to her own little big world with her acoustic melodies and almost hypnotic lyrics.

The harmonies in them are just excellent. Soft and slow doesn't work too well with some of the other ones. If you bought it for Everywhere, you'll really enjoy these other two. Happy listening!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your ordinary girl!","review":"Unlike some of the other female singers of today who are resorting to syrupy-sweet pop lyrics that really have no meaning. Michelle Branch is going to subjects that hit home with most people and putting them to music that is fun yet just a little ruff around the edges, taking that syrup off the pancake so to speak. Its nice to see that being young doesn't have to make one completely eye candy in the world of music, you can still have substance too."},{"rating":"2","title":"[??? life]","review":"I don't know about some of you but her songs show everyday life for me and it's always good to listen to these kinds of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best CDs of the new year.","review":"what can I say but wow? This album totally swept me off my feet upon first listen and has been playing nonstop since.The album is a good mix of rock/pop and Michelle really knows how to write. All the songs are incredibly catchy and almost every song has potential to be a single. The only problem I have with it is that it isn't long enough. However, I'd much rather have a cd filled with incredible music than just standard B-side stuff. Definately recommend this CD to anyone who likes music.Favorite tracks : Here With Me, Goodbye to You, Sweet Misery, I'd Rather be in Love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's the Radio Version!!!","review":"I thought most of the tracks were great, but the one track that I really bought this CD for was the RADIO VERSION, which I happen to LUV, of \\"Goodbye To You\\". I think the version on the CD is ok, but it's not nearly as emotional, expressive, and especially consistent, as the style that her other hits are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad at all","review":"Well, after reading some of the reviews I had to leave my own of Michelle Branch's album \\"The Spirit Room.\\" I think this album is quite catchy and flows smoothly between upbeat songs and slower songs. I find it refreshing that Michelle writes her own songs; this gives the song a more meaningful expressive voice. I know you have probably heard \\"Everywhere\\" and \\"All I Wanted\\" a million times on the radio, but I think these songs are still great and the others are as well. Her music is not overdone with silly lyrics that make her seem foolish (which seems to be a common trend among the up and coming female singers...not mentioning any names...hmm...Pink). Instead, she sings about common human themes. I know it is Pop, but it is not a sin to like some genres of Pop as long as they have some degree of substance. It is also impressive that she was only 18 when this was produced. I recommend this Cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars","review":"michelle is not just another female pop star/ she happens to have her own talent.

This album is [girl] pop rock at its finest.Writing your own (very decent) lyrics + the ability to play guitar + good vocals = The Spirit Room.If you're into the girl pop rock type of music, this is a good one for you.One simple request, don't tell my (male) friends that I like this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"you get what you pay for","review":"Getting the product was pretty quick, but my cuctomer was not happy with quality at all.

It is shedding small silver flakes all over the place and has developed a large tear. This cover is in an open area that is not exposed to falling limbs or excessive pine straw, just a lot of hot Arkansas sun. I am very disappointed in this tarp because I have car covers, boat covers, motorcycle covers, propane grill covers, etc. that are several years old and they are holding up fine. This tarp didn't even last a year. I like the kennel, it wasn't to difficult to put together and it gives you the option of 5 x 15 feet or 10 x 10 feet. But I do not recommend this cover. You can purchase a much cheaper tarp that will hold up for several years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me.","review":"Bought this for a very sick cat whom I've been force-feeding for two weeks. She has thyroid cancer and can't swallow regular food, and I was hoping she would be able to lap it up, since she still drinks water. She would not drink it, so after reading a couple of reviews here I tried force-feeding her some. She vomited it back up within a couple of minutes (she doesn't vomit the other food).For comparison, I tried giving it to my healthy cat who loves everything. She wouldn't touch it, and when I rubbed some on her nose to give her a taste, she shied away from the saucer I set in front of her.I looked for an expiration date on the can, but found none, so I can't tell if it could be spoiled. It doesn't smell spoilied. Worst, I got this at PetCo, and paid $10 for a single can. So, neither cat liked it, and my sick cat couldn't keep it down.

Scott Fitzgerald once said, and I paraphrase here:Why are you wasting valuable time listening to someone else when you could be writing?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I was disappointed with the lack of useful instruction in this book. There is evidence that the author had difficulty padding the material out to book-length (an entire chapter is devoted to weighing the merits of writing in a spiral notebook versus typing into a computer). When the book finally gets around to discussing the various types of journals to keep, it doesn't go into very much more detail than can be simply enough inferred by the chapter title.If you're looking for examples, they can all be found -- for free mind you -- in the sample pages ...As an aside, I am suspicious that these Idiot books may be written quickly to cash-in on whatever is \\"hot\\" at the moment. The Idiot's Guide to the Roman Empire for instance -- makes frequent mention of the movie \\"Gladiator\\".

The volume (of the person on the other end) could not be made loud enough, and the display is comparatively grainy and small. The instruction manual is lacking. I really disliked this phone.

They gave me a new one thinking that it was just that phone... but it wasn't. The one I have now isn't as bad as the first one, but it still loses service and drops calls constantly. Don't buy this phone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This phone is pretty, but it's terrible!","review":"I recently got this phone, and I really hate everything about it. It has a tiny battery life -- a day or two, even if I don't talk on it at all. It interferes with my laptop like crazy, even when it's not in use -- I have to keep it at least 10 feet away. Also, to do almost anything takes way more steps than it rightfully should. When you go into your \\"names\\" section, you can't just type the letter of someone's name. you have to first hit 1, and if you mess up, and then hit 1 and try to go back, it will highlight \\"delete all contacts,\\" which I have almost done countless times. And I have yet to figure out how to edit a word in text messages; I don't think it can be done. In fact, everything about text-messaging is difficult to use (compared to my old Nokia phone). I would really, really discourage you from buying this phone. In fact, I registered with Amazon just to warn people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Random Dropped signal and calls","review":"This crazy phone will frequently go from full-scale signal to dropping a call while standing in one place. When it happens, the screen goes blank and there is a 20-30 sec delay as it figures out where it is and gets a signal back. Meanwhile you've lost a call. Could be at the beginning of a call or anytime thereafter.Also will give random errors when looking up a number from the contacts list. Frequently comes back with 'error reading smart chip'. Usually have to shut it off and 'reboot'.It is basically a piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"20% good/ 80% bad","review":"We've had 3 of the LG1500 in our family plan for nearly a year. Very inconsistent service. When calling our son, I would get a message that his number was \\"blacklisted\\". After calling Cingular several times, we demanded new phones...not LG1500. We were told it was \\"like for like\\" exchange, but that policy is not in writing...so we're getting a different brand. If a phone doesn't work, the company needs to get rid of them!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad phone","review":"I've had the phone for five days so far and I think I'll return it. It has a short battery life, about one day of life with little use. I'm receiving my voicemails several hours late. I bought two ringtones which I was charged for but never got the ringtones downloaded to the phone and the cingular operator wasn't able to resolve the issue. Also, the phone wouldn't receive or make calls for part of one day then it just started working again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think \\"limited\\"","review":"If you want an inexpensive phone that will do VERY little other than make/receive calls, this phone is adequate. If you like to do \\"complicated\\" things with your phone, like (gasp!) change your ring tone from time to time, don't bother with this phone.I paid $18 for this phone. That was about the upper limit of its value."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT CELL PHONE!","review":"i just got this cell phone 2 days ago and i totally love it! its my second flip phone but this is my favorite one. my old cell phone was a nokia the nokias are ok but there keypads and non flip totally sucks. the good thing about this phone is that it'so easy to text. You just have to go to the text and theres a c button to clear it. The only down thing about it is the battery life."},{"rating":"1","title":"9 months - many problems","review":"We bought 2 phones on a family plan last October. We were looking for a very basic flip phone capability, no bells and whistles needed. Our major use was to communicate between each other. We were happy for for about 5 months. Since then we have experienced all the problems mentioned. Our phones were replaced during April. One sim card was replaced during June. Yesterday we again replaced our sim card on the same phone. Another replacement phone is on the way to us. The major problems have included \\"service not available\\" even though 4 bars are showing and the other phone works at the same location, \\"unable to read\\", \\"insert card\\", and of course dropped calls. Yesterday as I was talking to a warrantee agent trying to resolve our most recent problem my call was dropped in the middle of the call. At this point I have concluded that this model is extremely unreliable and am looking for an alternative solution. I can not depend on it. I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phone constantly reboots","review":"It's a cheap phone and you get what you pay for.I bought 3 of these for my kids a week ago. Within a couple of days I returned 2 of them because they kept recycling. The third phone is now acting up and one of the 2 replacement phones is also acting up. That's 4 out of 5 phones exhibiting this flaw. I'll be swapping these LGs for something more reliable like a Nok or Moto. No more LGs for me.Some of the others here noted things like the phone making noises and the screen lighting up for no reason. That's the phone recycling and it does it for no reason. Next time it does it, look at the display and you will see that your bars go away. If you happen to be on a call when it does this, it disconnects you.In the last week, I've invested way too much time diagnosing this problem for Cingular. I can force the phone to recycle just by holding it near my MP3 player, or laptop.I have a Moto V3 Razor and it works flawlessly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many problems","review":"I paid 10 dollars for this phone and have spent almost 40 on sim cards. The phone will say \\"Insert SIM Card\\" even if it is inside. It recyles, and when it does so, the screen goes blank and if you were talking on the phone your call is dropped. There is a VERY minimal selection of graphics, ringtones, and games. You cannot change the mini display. Save your money because you might end up spending 40-50 bucks on SIM cards, and another 50 for a replacement phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whaaat???","review":"There is a slight background noise constantly. I am easily heard on the other end, but I can't hear whom I'm talking to well at all, it's like there is a huge distance between us. If there is ANY noise on my side, I can't hear at all. As well, the microphone is not near my mouth but way over on the right side. Perhaps this unit is defective? I'm sending it back immediately. I'm really sorry I chose it, this does not live up to the good recommendations. Back to Plantronics!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No mute","review":"The description for this item says \\"speaker mute function.\\" This apparently means that it mutes the speaker on the handset it is connected to. There is no mute feature on the headset. Also, even with the volume on the phone at its highest I can't hear some calls very well. There is no volume control.Given the lack of features, this is way overpriced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent bracelets and worth the money","review":"I read the reviews and I had to give it to a bunch of girls in my family. I ordered 10 of these and it arrived in good packaging and on time. Everyone liked it and for the money, this is a great gift. If you are looking to distribute it for a large crowd, this is very affordable. The stones are attached to a stretchable rubber band. One size fits all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and Classy","review":"Looking for a cheap but interesting gift for my eccentric friend, I decided to purchase two types of stone chip stretch bracelets. The Turqoise being one.It compliments my friend's wide array of trinkets, giving her another simple but interesting piece to collaborate with the others. A bit of polished stone is timelessly classy.A good purchase for the price; the shipping is more expensive than the item. Buy it on Amazon though, as other sites and stores charge a bit more for such a plain piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect fit for Jeep Cherokee XJ","review":"Perfect for Jeep Cherokee XJ as title says fits my 2001 Jeep XJ perfectly, this muffler is not loud at all, which I wanted.

It's a repaint, but a cool repaint. Skeletor now dons a more evil black and copper color scheme. His Havoc staff is replaced with a rather lackluster spinning weapon. The blades have a bat wing design. A nice alternate color scheme, but what can I say...the original is best. Think long and hard before you buy this guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, the rich pageantry","review":"This was one of the most influential albums of my youth, helping to shape my appreciation for the rich, textured side of the new wave movement. I have to believe that the people buying this album know and love the band already - because Mark's vocals don't fit into the 80's pop mainstream, and some folks just don't like it. But there's something about him - his voice resonates. Everything this band did was warm and textured, and had great production value. I bought the album back in 83, found the cd in the early 90's, and still listen to it regularly. It's just really good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Eroica lacking in heroism","review":"when one of the most dramatic statements in the history of music and art is belittled by the assertivness of pedantic musicology ( acting here as a substitute for deep artistic feeling and understanding), the outcome can only be disappointment; and disappointment it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Overview of the Epic- But \\"Classic\\" Art?","review":"This book is put out by ISKCON, and includes an excellent summary of the epic for those unfamiliar with it (including an overview of the Bhagavad Gita as interpreted by ISKCON). However, the title is misleading- this book does not include pictures of \\"classic\\" renditions of the Mahabharata, but photographs of s modern sculpture in New Delhi called \\"Glory Of India\\" (apparently sculpted by the author) paired with sketches by the author.
