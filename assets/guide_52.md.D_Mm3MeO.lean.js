Ever since I tried it with Benjamin Creme in LA in 1981 I have been practicing it, some 31 years now! I flew back to Colorado where I still live and with two other people started a group that same year. The proof is in the pudding. Try this meditation weekly for one year and try to convince me it isn't everything Mr. Creme says it is. He says it is 1) a world service second to none and 2) it speeds up your own evolution unlike anything else. To my mind it is definitely a meditation for this lifetime and the next and the next... It is simple, powerful and always free. Anyone age 12 or over can safely participate. No group in your area? Start one. Buy the book for details."},{"rating":"2","title":"What makes this meditation different?","review":"I had lots of questions about Transmission Meditation and this book helps answer them all. You might wonder, how does it affect my other spiritual activities...or compare to something like trancendental meditation? What have other people asked over the years? These are all answered in this book.Great if you have been meditating, and just as good if you are brand new to meditation. Either way this book is beneficial."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent overall","review":"This recording is welcome because it refrains from the usual ultra-romantic performance style which tends to contaminate the Requiem in particular. I like the pure sound (no vibrato) of the chorus and orchestra, and I am very happy with the generally brisk tempi, which I much prefer to the slow, Wagnerian tempi with which the Requiem is usually saddled. I wish the soloists would also sing without vibrato, or at least not so much of it. I find Patrice Michaels' voice uniformly beautiful with impeccable pitch; I do not admire the other soloists as much. I do however recommend the recording, which is well worth the modest price that it is selling for."},{"rating":"2","title":"A healthier way to visit the land of the mouse!","review":"I bought this book because I have been trying to make my diet vegetarian and eating out is sometimes difficult. I thought that this would help me find the places for me. I also think it would be a helpful guide for anyone trying to just find healthier food in a junk food \\"world\\"The book is great and very thoroughly researched. The only problem I found was that I would start out my day planning ahead for which restaurants I would go to at the theme parks and when I got into the line for food the item I wanted was no longer on the menu. The biggest offender was not Disney but still when you've got a heartier meal in mind a salad doesn't always cut it. This is not the fault of the authors and I highly recommend this boook to anyone planning a trip to Orlando."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This is an absolutely marvellous CD. I am a classical music lover, particularly of the baroque period and preferably with original instruments. But then I heard a snatch of this on the radio and bought it - and was immediately charmed. I'd say that it is definitely NOT for purists - the sometimes odd synthesised sounds, the swapping of the musical strands from one speaker to the other and back again, sometimes rapidly alternating, will probably be regarded by some as tasteless. However, for me, none of this takes away from the beauty of the creations of Jean-Philippe Rameau, one of the great figures of 18th. century French music, and Bob James does him both homage and justice. I simply never tire of listening to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would love to meet this man...","review":"Anyone who can successfully work within these genres has to be interesting.This is a successful project.

I can see where the author is trying to get men to take ownership of fixing their marriages, but for those already enlightened, who's marriages still aren't working, there's nothing offered but \\"keep trying it's your fault\\". After reading this, all i want to do is crawl into a hole and die. To me it almost seems to have been written strictly for profit, recognizing that women buy the bulk of self help texts and therefore catering to this market segment. Suggesting that the average unhappily married woman buy this book for her husband to read so he can \\"fix himself\\" in my view invites further marital strife and quite possibly violence."},{"rating":"1","title":"good husband, great marriage","review":"This book was previously published as, \\"It's (Mostly) His Fault.\\" While the title may have changed; the premise has not. Also, when an author makes the disclaimer, \\"This is not male-bashing\\" as this one has, get ready to be bashed in ways you have not even considered. This is the worst book ever on marriage. The only reason I gave it one star is that 1/4 star was not an option. I am sure he will profit from this book for obvious reasons.

It has a TON of notes written in all margins, above the title headings, below the title headings, and on the sides. The notes are specific to the couple who used the book last, it so distracting that a person can't help but read the notes. Well, this detracts from reading and learning. He wife's suggestions, her hightlighting subtitles for him to read is so personal, that I wouldn't have offered this book for sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not safe in my opinion","review":"I bought this toy two years ago and I was not happy with the weight of the middle piece that lays above your baby's head. It is basically supported by the balance of three legs and the legs are attached to the cloth mat (not very securely either). I kept worrying the huge, heavy mirrored piece would fall on the baby. I ended up taking it apart and just using the mat and basically the rest was trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful toy","review":"My 9 week granddaughter has been fascinated by this toy since 3 weeks when we set it up. She'll watch the leaves go up and down for 20 to 30 minutes which is wonderful for her Mom. We have hung some bigger toys, than what came with it, near the bottom holes and she is hitting those with her hands. I think she'll be able to have fun with this for a long time and use it in many ways. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest infant toy that is not available anymore.","review":"This is the greatest toy for infants. My baby would play for a long stretch of time trying to reach and grab the suspended toys. The music is great and the rotating petals and mirror keep infants interested for a very long time. Later you can attach more toys for tummy time and a beginning of crawling stage. It is portable enough and we have taken it with us on vacation as well. It is a shame the company does not produce this toy anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun toy for babies","review":"I bought this for my baby when she was about a month old, and she loved it until she was around 5 months - when she started sitting unassisted. She would stare at herself in the mirror and eventually was able to reach and pull down the toys.My only complaint is once she began to reach for the toys and get them down, she would naturally chew on them. The pictures on the hanging toys are stickers and even without teeth my baby would mouth the sticker and would end up with loose pieces in her mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overpriced here on amazon","review":"I do agree with the other reviewer that said the \\"middle mirror is too heavy\\" the base does attatch to the mat but i wouldn't trust that too much, it could easily get knocked over if you accidentally bump into it.. dangerous if your baby is underneath. The toys ARE a bit hard to reach unless my son is laying half off the mat so he can reach them.My 4 month old seems to like this gym & it entertains him for about 10-20 mins. at a time.. that's something at least. I think that the company needs to make the legs/mat more sturdy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased!","review":"We bought this in December for our 2 month old son for Christmas. He is now 7 1/2 monthes and he still adores it! My 4 year old daughter even enjoys laying under it with him. They like looking in the mirror, watching the petals go around, and lights change. The song it plays is so cute! I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"At times too quick to follow","review":"Our seniors group still need to position ourselves right so we can see the video. The moves make you look away a lot.......Anne Pringle is wonderful in this DVD. She is slow and deliberate and explains her moves in very simple terms. My seniors are in their 80s and they found this helpful.HOWEVER, her male partner whizzes through the movements and uses Yoga jargon that my seniors don't understand. They get lost when he is on and also frustrated.In the end, they didn't like the DVD and always want to go back to Anne's Stretch and Strength Chair excercise DVD.This DVD might be more appropriate for a younger crowd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped Working","review":"The DVD stopped working after a very short period of use.

However, I was annoyed by the fact that so many of the stories feature characters who are complaining. Also, Alec Baldwin isn't too great as narrator."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cranky Bugs","review":"I found this video to be great. The only reason I find this tape to be a four is because of Alic Baldwin narrates it. I found out that Alic dosn't give as good voices as George Carlin did. The stories are great. Ther are three new charecters, Cranky the Crane, Derek(known as The Diesel), and Old Slow Coach. There are two accidents and a suprise for Toad. Hpe you enjoy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Night train song not available on DVD version","review":"We ordered this DVD for our son after borrowing the same version on VHS from a friend. My son loved the \\"Night Train\\" song so much that we ordered this DVD for the song alone. However, the \\"Night Train\\" is not on the DVD version, which makes absolutely no sense that the DVD and VHS versions would not contain the same stories (and the \\"Night Train\\" was listed as the last story on the VHS). We now have endless requests for the song and will now have to order the VHS. This DVD was a ripoff. Just order the VHS and save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cranky the Crane is Crummy","review":"My son has enjoyed every Thomas video he has seen, except this one. The Cranky the Crane character makes him cry every time. When he is older, he might appreciate the story line and not cry at Cranky's angry outbursts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good overall, but narration poor","review":"We were dissapointed with the narration on this one. Baldwin doesn't have the voice quality, inflection or ability to give each charactor a unique voice. However, the story where Toad goes into a muddy ditch is one of our boys favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"It dances!","review":"Wind it up and it dances around my desk.

It is a great score, very well done. Works very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT the Moroder soundtrack!!","review":"The music Giorgio Moroder came up with for his soundtrack to the classic \\"Metropolis\\" was unbelievable and actually enhanced portions of Fritz Lang's masterpiece. But this \\"offical\\" soundtrack contains ALL butchered versions of the great music found in the movie. Why couldn't they have just inserted what we heard in the film onto the soundtrack instead of revising (for the MUCH MUCH worse) all the songs? The most disappointing track is when Pat Benatar's incredibly moving vocals in the film are destroyed and replaced with a lame effort here. Moroder's film versions of these songs introduced me to deep feelings of romantic love I'd never experienced, and this \\"official\\" soundtrack doesn't even match the emotional level of a cheesy chick flick. If you like Giorgio Moroder, do what I did and record the audio off the DVD or video of this film onto a tape or CD... do NOT listen to this soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second rate songs from 1st and 2nd rate artists","review":"This was the first album I ever bought that I disliked so much I got rid of it. There are some top names here, some familiar from what was probably my favorite album at the time: The Flashdance Soundtrack, and my favorite artist at the time: Bonnie Tyler, but the songs here are not their best works by any means. I still love Pat Benetar to this day, but \\"Here's my heart\\" was really rather forgettable, as are the rest of the songs on this album. Interesting concept to combine modern songs (the early eighties was the era of the big pop music movie soundtrack) with an excellent silent film, but it just didn't work with the songs they picked here. Footloose was the other way around: great songs with a lame movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucka$$ mp3 download","review":"Charged $8.99 and download failed. My order shows download complete. This is the first and last MP3 I will ever download from Amazon.com! There is no way for me to download now and I've been ripped off $8.99. Merry freaking Christmas!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A classic has been defaced","review":"Metropolis is a great film of American history. It is a beautiful classic that should be appreciated for the stunning things Fritz Lang did with it in the 1920's. Instead a few washed-out 80's bands make a mockery of it. Metropolis or anything of it's kind can not be parelled by loverboy or billy squier. This has only made a ridiculed the genius of Fritz Lang by tampering with something to please fans of 80's electronica."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear me, Cheap CD-R from Amazon","review":"Please be aware this is a cheap CD-R, the sound and mastering are fine the music is so so (that's just a taste thing) but the packaging leaves a great deal to be desired. There is NO artist information (this is a various artist CD and I want to know who is performing each song) or ANY details on the recording or mastering. This is bad enough but to top it all off they have the track listing on the back in the wrong order!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It will open your eyes to tying great midge patterns","review":"Midge fishing and tying midge patterns was always something I left to somebody else - very intimidating. Where do you start and what do you fish and why? Talking to Ed and Don at fly fishing shows, listening to what they have to say, seeing the vials of midges that Don had pumped from the stomachs of trout, looking closely at the midges under magnification, and reading this book brings it all together. The patterns are real. They are easy to tie. The materials are cheap. When you read this book, sit back and take it all in you realize that most of the mystery is gone. It gives you the tools with which to master this art. You gain an appreciation for the patterns and why they work. This is not a pretty fly book. This is a real working fishermans reference. You have the results of 20 plus years of two masters trials and errors of fishing midges. A must have for a fly fisherman."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Patterns Than Tactics","review":"As long as the reader understands that this book doesn't cover a lot of tactics, it's a highly useful guide. The focus is on patterns--how to get the colors right, how to tie them, and what they imitate.There's not much on casting technique or how to actually use them on the stream, but the material that is there is great. It has really useful patterns that are surprisingly easy to tie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tying should be simple","review":"Reminded me that flies should be simple. The book shows that simple flies can still capture accurate colors with inexpensive materials. For only a couple of dollars, I bought enough materials for me to tie a wide variety of flies for serveral fishing seasons. Writer/tyers make a lot of money designing complex flies and selling books on tying them. But we can catch a lot of fish with simple, fast-tied flies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not-so-good guide","review":"This guide of the Wildlife of Costa Rica is actually a guide not very complete of the birds of the country.As biologist, I've always worked with many field guides, and this one has dissapointed me in many ways. It lacks illustration of photographies of the animals, it does not include any kind of plants (they are part of the wildlife as far as I know), has not any geographical dispersion pattern map in which consult the distribution area of the species, the dimensions are extremly unconfortable (specially considering the light content of the guide), and it's not exhaustive by all means.I'd not recommend to buy this guide to any naturalist interested in a field guide for travelling in Costa Rica."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splediferous!!!","review":"Bell Jar!

Meanwhile, I'm buying it written!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational Lyrics, Pleasant Sound","review":"FFH really does a great job in composing lyrically solid songs. Their music is certainly focused on Jesus.The sound is one that is very light. They have several very good tracks on this CD. I particularly like 'You Found Me' and 'Ready to Fly'. 'It's A Good Day' is also a very catchy tune.I generally prefer something with a bit more oomph, but this is a nice sound. My daughter is very fond of FFH so their sound can certainly be a draw for teens as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Album is Terrible!!!","review":"I just heard this CD, with the song \\"Good to be Free\\" at a local Christian Bookstore, and the song has a number of lyrics in it which the early church declared as heresy. For example, \\"Things of this world are overdone Things like theology and philosophy - oh yeah.\\" and \\"spent so long Living in a cell that I thought was home. I didn't know it wasn't meant for me\\" These thoughts are not \\"Biblical\\" in any sense. This world is our home! Genesis 1 and 2 are pretty clear about. The idea that this world is not our home was a pagan thought made known by followers of the Greek philosophy of Plotinus... thus Neo-Platonism. And then the song devalues the study of God, \\"theology\\" and the study of how we study god, \\"philosophy.\\" No Christian should give this CD a good review. And it is not edifying for our understanding of the world, God, or our relationship to him."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Review of \\"Ready to Fly\\" by FFH","review":"I absolutely loved the new FFH cd. From the second that I heard \\"You Found Me\\", I knew I had to buy this cd. I've owned it for awhile now, and I still love to listen to it. I have to say that \\"If Not for Christ\\" has to be my favorite song on this cd. It has beautiful lyrics that carry a lot of meaning and is set to beautiful, hymn-like music. I would reccommend this cd to anyone who loves Christian music that lifts up the name of Christ!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lu Chi must be rolling with laughter","review":"Mr. Hamill's translations leaves much to be desired. And completely misses the point by trying so hard to make one.The translation is stentorian and saccharine at the same time.

The idea is that a large comet(s) are exploded and diverted in such a way as to bring some additional rain to Earth. The ill conceived plan goes drastically wrong, and the earth is once again deluged with non-stop rain. Cilivization and the environment break down, and Anthony's band of misfits - being led by a man with a vision in a Winnebago - try to survive.If you are a die hard Anthony fan, you should read this to help you understand his evolution as a writer. If not a die hard fan, you may want to avoid this one and try some of his other Sci-fi - like his Orn, Omnivore, and Ox trilogy, or Kirlian Quest Series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure trash","review":"I had a feeling going into this novel that it would be kind of trashy, but I am a sucker for apocalyptic/end-of-the-world stories, so I thought I'd read it anyway.Bad, bad idea.The writing is incredibly juvenille and amateurish (I cringed at how Anthony abuses the poor exclamation point), yet the content is often very adult and gruesome and not something I would recommend to young readers. The only remotely likeable characters are killed off and I just wanted to slap some sense into the rest of them. A rather nasty misogynistic thread runs through the entire piece as well. Parts of the story that could have been interesting are glossed over or rendered entirely unbelievable by the way they are presented. I honestly can't believe that crap like this could have gotten professionally published.Don't waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Forgotten Anthony Classic","review":"It's hard to believe these days, but Piers Anthony used to write his books one at a time, or in trilogies of no more than three volumes. In fact, he was considered one of the best of Science Fiction's \\"New Wave\\" of writers of the late 60s and early 70sRings of Ice, while not as \\"edgy\\" as much of the literature of the New Wave, is a fine example of the form -- thoughtful, character-driven, often intensely moving. The characters are deftly and realistically drawn, the action gripping but plausible.With everything else Anthony has ever written, edited or used to prop up a rickety table filling the shelves at all the major bookstore chains, it's astonishing that Rings of Ice has remained out of print for so long.

He has some very compelling arguments and research to back his claims on the undermining of the US and even world government by extraterrestials. The objective question is, where are the researchers he cites? Who are they?The mysterious visitors in this case are some Catholic priests who came to his lectures and later he realized they were aliens.

I really was dissapointed because I very much enjoy the directors other films, but this one fell short. Sometimes gay films get decent readings simply because of the homoerotic material.

It was so distracting that I could barely keep up with the plot. This was the most amateurish, SUB-STANDARD TRANSFER of a film that I've ever seen.

Love it!","review":"\\"Mad Monster Party\\" is an early Rankin-Bass production, and it shows. While the stop-motion photography is a bit jerky in spots, it does not detract from the film but seems to make it that much more endearing. There are two famous voices in this film: Boris Karloff and Phyllis Diller. Karloff voices the old mad scientist who wants to retire, and Diller is the wife of the Monster, whom she calls, naturally, \\"Fang.\\" When she learns that Dr. Frankenstein (Karloff) plans to will the whole shebang to his nephew Felix, she and the rest of the gang plot to kill Felix and get everything for themselves.As I've noted, the motion is sometimes a bit jerky, but somehow that does not detract from the film in a bad way. The voicing is excellent, and even Boris gets to do a number, though he talks it more than sings it. Still, it's a great flick and I still love it as I did years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coolest Movie Ever!","review":"The claymation characters are very detailed.

I've always loved the Rankin-Bass stop-motion classic's, and, yes, I consider this one of them. Phyllis Diller is terrific! Boris Karloff in an animated musical comedy! What more could you want? Sexy Francesca, timid Felix Flankin, Yetch .. it was like seeing old friends. The production is terrific, but remember: this was made in the 60's. At one point, you can see the fishing line holding up the glass ball being passed off as a bubble. In my opinion, seeing what passed as state of the art technology then only makes the movie that much better/funnier. However, only four stars for this one since I feel that the storyline could have been better and there are parts of the movie that are either boring or filled with groan inducing puns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mad Monster Party 2 cents","review":"I recall enjoying this as a child but now that I am older I frankly find this film to be bland.

The reader must rely on what appear to be lovely and credible English translations by Wyatt Mason of the French Symbolist poet's letters, but is the reader able to know it for sure? When any reader bothers to read Rimbaud - and no less than his personal letters - the original French text accompanying the English translation should be, ahem, de rigueur [of rigor].

The characters are deeply developed and the historical background is so accurate as to make one totally forget this is a work of fiction. The author keeps just the right amount of mystery/suspense flowing to persuade the reader to turn just one more page. Most enjoyable part of having this book in my possession is that I can open it to nearly any chapter and re-read it as if reading for the first time - and usually I pick up some new facet of the story I had missed. It is truly a book that you will want to return to. A great escape.

It just falls over. If it were plugged in, it would fall over and make an amplified thwack sound, instead of a light tap. So, yeah, that's why I don't deem any further testing necessary.

The book seemed drawn out right from the beginning. To me, it took a long time to get to the plot of the story. I could not manage to move beyond page 37. The author tries to incorporate pieces of historical fiction into contemporary fiction, which, in my opinion, do not mix well at all.

The writing is breathless and compelling - lots of adjectives and action - the \\"hanging off the end of a rope at the end of the chapter\\" kind of writing. I enjoyed it, if for nothing more than the blatant racism which is SOO non pc and of its era. Dr Fu Manchu is an evil genius, the Yellow Peril, that must be stopped at all costs. He is so much of a caricature that it's like reading a comic really - a hoot.

The pictures and illustrations are very clear - which is the most important part. You never have to ask \\"how did that piece go there?\\". The key is to practice a handful of knots so you can do them in the dark, or in a storm, when you really need them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Climbers","review":"The photos in the book are for the most part good. However, it probably tries to cover too many areas. If you're a climber it's missing key knots and hitches-- munter - mule and klemheist for example. Plus, the water knot is just plain wrong. The picture is of a fisherman's knot -- totally different. I've ended up using Luebben's 'Knots for Climbers'. Some of the photos are hard to follow but it includes everything and doesn't appear to have any mistakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I bought this book after reading the reviews, and seeing that it is well rated, but am very disappointed. It really doesn't have that many knots. there are a lot of pages wasted on many different ways to tie the same knot, like the bowline. there are also a lot of wasted pages ( to me ) on decorative knots, which I will never use. I was hoping to see a lot more useful knots for camping and climbing, but they're just not there, like a sliding knot for tent ropes to adjust them, and a sliding knot to use like an ascender. Very disappointing, would never have bought it if I could have looked through it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got em all this is the best.","review":"I have a bookshelf full of knot books and each of them have something to recommend them but my favorite is Morrow Gide to Knots.

I ordered the DVD in hopes that it might help to minimize the pain. I wasted my money. These stretches are for someone who is very flexible and with me having a bad back, it is not something I feel comfortable doing. It was also hard to follow because my tv is on the wall and I needed to constantly look up to see what stretches were being done. I would not recommend this product if you suffer from back pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yoga for back care","review":"I found this dvd very dissapointing. It consists of 5 to seven poses with no instruction at all and some muzack in the background. I thought they forgot to put some meaningfull instruction on what muscles you should be trying to engage put apparently not. The start of the tape seems like an intro to the real meat of a good dvd and was waiting for more but it never got better. It's a half hour long tape at the most with repeating poses in a loop, a total waste of money. I also purchased back Rx by Vijay Vad at the same time. This dvd was the exact opposite of Yoga for back care with instruction on what you should be doing, 3 levels of yoga combined with Pilates exercises. I found this DVD to be the most helpfull in relieving my back pain over chiropracters, rolfers, and pain medication this is the one to get, do not waste your money on Yoga For Backcare!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too quick, too short","review":"I found that by the time I was in the pose being taught, Mr. Yee was already moving on to the next pose.

In my opinion, this video was a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"SAve your back on a daily basis","review":"I started using this product through my local library. I couldn't believe how much better I felt the first time, I worked with it. Unfortunately, my memory isn't what it used to be and I wanted the reminders of sequence and thinking process when I went through the Yoga steps.

If changing props interfers with your workout or stresses you, then you don't want this."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for people with active back pain","review":"I was disappointed with this DVD. I bought \\"Back Care Yoga with Rodney Yee\\" because I am currently dealing with lower back pain and friends said yoga could help. However when I got the DVD I was unable to do most of the things in the routines. I can't think of something harder for someone with back pain to do than sit cross-legged and try to put their forehead on the floor. Also there are no examples or suggestions of how to modify poses if you can't do what the instructor is doing. Nice production value and nice view of a beach but this just felt like someone told the guy to do a \\"yoga for back pain\\" DVD and not a lot of thought went into the abilities and limitations of the people who would be watching the lessons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yoga Journal's Yoga for Back Care","review":"Rodney Yee is an excellent yoga instructor. This DVD really helps people with back issues. The DVD is prop heavy though and you cannot properly do all yoga poses without the required props. Other than that it is a good DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading","review":"The variety of stretches were fine, but the description of what is included is misleading at best. Unless you do guided meditations for 1-2 minutes, this is not really included. It seems that it should be more than 24 minutes as well. They describe what they will do at the beginning, then flow right through, so if you thought you could break at a section, or review it, you would be mistaken. Overall, probably not worth paying full price for, maybe renting it at the library or borrowing from a friend, just for the various postures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yee Yoga DVD","review":"This is a good beginning yoga tape. As I have severe damage to my spinal column, I was hoping for something with more modified poses. The routine is broken up in 3 sections: stretching, strengthening, and restoration. Overall, they are all good though, I think, a little short. I would not recommend this to anyone else with severe, cronic back problems-I cannot do many of the poses and someone who is not aware of their limits could aggravate their condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was falling asleep","review":"I felt nothing after doing this routine.

For my specific problem there are a few too many poses that aggravate my spine, but if you just want to strenghthen and build up your back, I think it is ideal. There is also a section of Rodney and an MD talking about caring for one's back on a daily basis-like how to sit in a chair properly. Good solid advice. There is a section of \\"restorative\\" poses that relax the tired back. You will need a bolster pillow and a blanket you can fold under you. Even though I am not ready to do all the postures, it still has encouraging advice and some good yoga practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Tape","review":"Turns out I already had this in another package.

This is definitely plenty of exercise and strength building for those of us who are not macho yoga types."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good for your back","review":"I bought this DVD several years ago but hardly ever used it as I thought the poses were too easy and I would not get much out of it.Lately I began to experience lower back pain each time I played tennis. I tried this DVD again. The first time I only did the 18 minute Flexibility and Strengthening segment. Even as I was doing the exercises, I could feel the tension draining away from my back. Just like that, my back pain was gone. A few days later I played tennis again and the back pain returned. This time I did the entire DVD and felt great afterwards.

I did the am/pm in the past and felt great (am was best). I thought this would be just as awesome but more specific for my back. Long story short - too many props for two little poses/ exercises/stretches. He goes a little two quickly between setting up props and doing the poses and his directions are too quick also. Toward the end I was like are you kidding me...I might as well just take a nap on my stomach. I am just floored and feel like I am getting a migrane. My neck is stiff. If i could I would ask for my money back. I suggest get Am/PM. That was what I originally was here to purchase but I read these reviews and wanted to concentrate on my back so I got this.

I have chronic back pain, and in order to avoid, and not take pain killers, I do yoga. I have used this DVD, and as soon as I finish one of the three routines, my pain is gone. The only thing that I don't like about Rodney's approach on this DVD is that he shows some very weird excercises, and sometimes you feel like you aren't doing anything. The first routine feels like you didn't do a thing. The second routine is great. The third one has a lot of akward positions, for which you need a chair and a king size pillow. I have never been to a yoga class where you need such items, so I find it weird, and not too effective. However, overall, it is a good DVD (but he has a better DVD, try the Yoga for Athletes, also from Rodney. It is excellent.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bending Over Backwards","review":"Well, not really! However, this DVD is a wonderful introduction to sitting better and exercises to take care of our backs.

The resulting knowledge should provide you with the knowledge and skills necessary to use multilayer switching to implement campus networks using Cisco Catalyst switches, and to interface to other equipment as necessary.Besides the test, this book is also aimed at the network administrators who are responsible for implementing and troubleshooting enterprise level Cisco routers and router configurations.This is not an introductory book, it is assumed that the reader has at a minimum an understanding of the vocabulary of switching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!!","review":"I love trying new products and am always excited when I find something I can't live without. This is not one of those products. Okay, it has a nice pepperminty taste and it has some exfoliating properties, but you can get the same effect by rubbing a wet washcloth across your lips. Really; the price is high and the shipping is also high for this tiny tube of various seed oils. I recommend Aveeno lip conditioner in chapstick form with an SPF of 15, much better. I did order more than one item from Philosophy to make the shipping a little easier to accept, but still this product is not worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"A wash cloth and a good lip balm would do the same","review":"Being a fan of their Kiss Me lip balm, I decided to give this a go. What a waste of money. You would get the same results rubbing a wet washcloth on your lips at night and slapping on a good lip balm after. I'd never waste the money on this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, but not a good product","review":"I usually love Philosophy's products, but this one I didn't. I can't find one good thing to say about this \\"lip therapy\\". Well, that's not true. I can honestly say that the minty flavor was good. Other than that it feels like there is sand in your lip ointment and the effect is minimal at best. I found that using the Microdelivery Peel on my lips had a larger effect than the lip ointment. Sorry Philosophy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Next Frontier","review":"When talking about the exploration of space, and in particular of the planet Mars, it is easy to fall into one of two categories : a) Over-technical b) Over-fantastic.Fortunately, this book avoids both of those paths. Don't misunderstand - this is for those with a technical/scientific bent, but can be understood by lay-people. It is a high quality astronautical engineering book, focusing on the _how_, but pause is also given to the more human side, the _why_ - why go, why explore. Contributors of chapters come from reputable and solid backgrounds, with ideas that are backed not only by imagination, but with engineering know-how.In short, this book provides a valuable reference for those interested in the technical aspects - if I win the fifty dollars for a review, I know what I'll ask for..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Happy I didn't purchase it.......","review":"I flipped through this book at the library.

It's a discussion of \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" from a feminist viewpoint. However, after reading it, I can't really say very many positive things about it. It seemed to me as if every point Roberts made was illogical and simply manipulated the episodes to suit the point she was trying to make. Part of the problem is that it was based a lot on French feminism, which I find uneven at times, but there is good writing that stems from it, and this is not it. Roberts contradicted herself, and used to the same evidence in various parts of the book to come to different conclusions.I was hoping she might redeem herself in the conclusion, as I often found authors have more coherency in their conclusions, but no. The conclusion was just another ruined analysis, this time of \\"Voyager\\". When I finally put the book down, I was relieved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant feminist analysis . . .","review":"This book is a very well-written analysis of Star Trek from a feminist perspective. Roberts analyzes the texts (episodes) with a great deal of insight as well as a sense of humor. That said, if you are looking for a soft read, this is not it. Sexual Generations is a scholarly book and well worth the effort to read it. Roberts does not try to simply illuminate the \\"fabulousness\\" of the series, but rather seeks to unpack and understand the many social and cultural implications of the series. She also seems to argue that popular culture is worth analyzing and taking seriously as an art form--I agree! I recommend this book highly if you are interested in a very smart approach to Star Trek."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Captains Did Not Have Sexual Relations!","review":"See, anyone could come up with a funny title...

A true gallery of unforgettable films, supported by a minutely account of valuable information aorund every one of the exposed films.To review the films of the Great Masters such as Jean Renoir, Marcel Carne, Robert Bresson, Julien Duvivier, Henri Clouzot, Rene Clement, Jean Delanoy or Jean Pierre Melville represents a journey through the dense brumes of the memory and one the most important chapters of the genre.If you are (as I do) a profound lover of the French Cinema or even the Cinema in its broad meaning; this book is recommended.Do not doubt it just for a second and try to find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A keeper","review":"From his own website: \\"He made haste in the direction of his teachers' influences: Robert Johnson, Robert Pete Williams, Reverend Gary Davis, Blind Blake, Blind Boy Fuller and others.

Listening-wise, this should be appealing ... equally appealing ... to fans of Bob Dylan, Robert Johnson and Wes Montgomery.

Ok to get corrector yui, take sailormoon, pull out all emotion, stroyline, comedy, and back story, add a computer based plot and wallah. I mean the story itself is just silly. Now to get the character of yui, take every stupid anime character ever and put them together. She's completely flat, nothing at all sets her character apart. The villian name is just stupid, plus he has 4 minnions, that it!!! They use the same lackey's over and over.BORING!!!! The only half way decent thing about this show is the theme song, that's it!!!

Marketing your creative portfolio shows no visual examples nor does the title or nice cover really depict the real aspects of the book. I would not recommend the book for anything other than simple marketing ideas and basic information structure. the book however would be good for a High School based program needing some multiple choice / fill in the blank questions for the students to start out with. I had higher expectations and it didn't come close to delivering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun book to read","review":"Despite Amazon saying this book is only 3 pages long, it's actually 176. It includes five stories, all of which are much longer than the regular comic book stories. The entire book is in black and white, and the introduction includes a little story about the 1940's films. Also, as far as super villians go, the only famous one in the book is the Joker. The names of the stories are:1. What a Sweet Racket (detecive type story)2. The Phantom Terrorist (sort of like Phantom of the Opera)3. The Joker's Symbol Crimes4. The Secret Triangle Farm5. The Missing Heir DilemmaI know amazon doesn't have this available anymore, but if you can find it at a store I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful musicality and astounding versatility; great jazz!","review":"I really love this CD. Terry shows many sides of his musical talent. You'll hear why he is one of the top studio woodwind players in the world. But more than that, it's a wonderful musical journey. The tenor sax/trombone sound is featured on many tunes (the soulful George Bohannon) that might remind you of the Crusaders. Other selections feature Bob leatherbarrow and Bill Cunliff among other fine musos. Terry splits his time between tenor sax and clarinet. He's a master of both. Especially interesting are his lines, which are swingin' and gutsy, but venture into new and unusual harmonic areas. His polytonal ideas are intelligent and not the \\"usual\\" jazz licks you've heard before. ...and what can I say about his clarinet playing which is about as good as it gets. Search this CD out and buy it!By the way, the arrangements (by Terry) are also excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst spiderman game","review":"The only things i liked was the free roam, but the missions are sometimes fun but theres a lot of puzzle like things in missions which are really annoying.

I am very upset that someone would actually get away with giving this game to the website and allow them to sell it. I am furious and I am looking for a way to complain about this game but I can't find one other than writing a review. I don't know what to do I'm just so angry.

Now I know why I hardly played it. Jumpy camera, ridiculous missions and silly enemies. Sorry, just swinging around NY could not save this one. I remember having much more fun with Spider-Man 2.I really tried to have fun with this but when some gang kept respawning out out pots in one of the hangouts I knew this was bad. Not to mention the Arsenic Candy Gang? Really? I found myself actually being emabarrassed for Spider-Man having to fight a gang of school girls. I was more embarrassed when they mopped the floor with me because of the horrible combat system. Combat in this game is totally non-satisfying.With so many other Spider-Man games to choose from you should definitely pass on this. Pick up Web of Shadows instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great sequel to a so-so album","review":"One of the misnomers about Neil Young is that \\"Harvest\\" is one of his best albums, when in fact despite some great songs it is wildly uneven. The sequel \\"Harvest Moon,\\" while lacking a song as good as \\"The Needle and the Damage Done\\" has no such problems. A conistent accoustic rock gem, this album continued Young's 1990s resurgence. The first two tracks, \\"Unknown Legend\\" and \\"From Hank to Hendrix\\" are the best, though there is not a bad song in the mix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harvest Moon","review":"The first three songs on this CD would not play they skipped.

This is just such quality music, it ranks with the best of most anyone. \\"Unknown Legend\\" is wonderful musically and lyrically, and the title track is just as good with it's use of a broom as an instrument. My two favorites are the lengthy and moving \\"Such A Woman\\", and the epic \\"Natural Beauty\\", which talks about preserving nature. Overall this is easily one of his essential albums. Anyone who enjoys it might also like \\"Silver And Gold\\", \\"Unplugged\\", and of course \\"Harvest\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"folksy and easy","review":"I bought this CD because I heard the title track on the radio.

If I *really* like it, I might listen to it again the next day.When I got \\"Harvest Moon\\", I listened to it three times in a row, without pause.The album is... simply beautiful. It sets a mood from the opening notes, and continues it for the next fifty minutes. Very rarely do an album's lyrical and musical content harmonize so well. Topics include weariness, lost loves, fond memories, old friends, times gone by.This was THE album that got me into Neil Young.

I tried 20-30 times but the top ended up on it's side, upside down or even when right side up, it never got out of the first bay. I tried setting the board on a slant. Still nothing. I tried using cotton string as another reviewer suggested. Nothing. The instructions suggest moving the top down on the dowel. Couldn't even do that, the top is lacquered onto the dowel.

It was used many times over the holidays in both cases and with my large family we divided up in teams of adults through the youngest players, which were 5 and 6 years old. It does not take skill but it does take a little getting use to as you find the best way to pull the string that is attached to the top, so you can successfully get it to spin and jump all the way to the back rooms and knock down the pins.

After many trials i have not got it to skip. Now for the bad, there are moving parts you can hear them when it starts i think there reading to track. i have had a few small problems with the disk getting stuck in the drive. I also think this little blue top is going to fall off. The headphones (...) so get some good ones.

As a player, it's a pretty great thing, with tremble/bass adjustments and all that a player should have, BUT since it's zip disk input keeps breaking down, I would not recommend it to anyone, unless they plan on using just one zip disk and never take it out (if you do take disks out and put them back in, chances are that they will get stuck on the 50th time, and have fun ordering the replacement).

The \\"loud whirring\\" some people have complained about is very faint (at least with mine) and only occurs at the start of a track, and I've never had it skip. In my mind the carry case with belt clip make up for the larger-than-average bulk--heck I never carried my RIO in my pocket anyways--and the Li ion battery is a nice plus.My only complaints are minor:1) the earphones aren't great2) the backlight control is stupid--as far as I can tell the only way to turn it on is to go through 3 menus...now how can I do that in the dark? should I just leave it on all the time?3) when copying files to/from the drive via Win2K nothing seems to tell you when the drive is done reading or writing, you just have to listen closely"},{"rating":"2","title":"No buyer's remorse here -- this thing is GREAT!","review":"I toiled for weeks, trying to decide which MP3 player was for me. The price (I got mine minus a $50 rebate) and features like the inexpensive 40MB Pocket Zip disks, along with the awsome sound quality made this player the only choice in my eyes. Despite CNET's claim that the unit is big, it's still smaller than the Discman it replaced and not much bigger than the other players I looked at.

There are a few other enchancements also (See update documentation). Disks are very durable - but care must be taken when inserting - it must be done exactly with care. Do not force. This player is also a very good audible player for listening to audible books (audible.com) - very easy to use. Disks do not hold as much music as more higher memory units but extra disks are easly to cary and also this unit can be used as a drive for the computer - so music files can be easily transfered to the disk through Windows Explorer with no additional music controling program needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mac compatable and cheap storage space!","review":"the title says it.

The Hip Zip is a little more reasonably priced than other players, especailly when factoring in the inexpensive storage media. I use it for my bus/subway commute, and one disc holds enough music for the 35 minute trip.

I don't see how Iomega released so many faulty units(maybe it's not faulty it's just very very poor quality).

I am a high school student so of course I took it to school, to listen to on the bus or where ever. I don't know what caused it but after about two months of using this product the battery life greatly lowered. It lowered to about 1-2 hours before it needed recharging again. It's a great product otherwise but the fact that the irreplacable batteries go bad after only a few months is a big dissapointement for me.

I have had no problems with the device as of yet. I take it hiking and biking and it does the job.However, now that I have it, it would be nice if the disks were double if not triple the storage space. It's kind of a drag to change the disk in such short intervals. But again, I knew how much data they would hold before I bought it. This also means I carry about 6 disks with me at a time to make sure I have plenty of music.It's a trade off. I didn't really want one of the bigger jukeboxes and still don't see the need. I don't want to manage that much music when I'm trying to enjoy what I'm doing.

That is the entire content on technique. There is only one recipe that uses whole fish and it is for arctic char. The book is less than a hundred pages. Most of it is soups, salads and side dishes. There are much better books on plank grilling available now. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not rate five stars!","review":"Very disappointed. The 2 lead recipes used in the TV cooking demo as well as in the book are very good. That's it. Many ingredients are either difficult to find or unobtainable which makes some recipes practically useless, if you want to follow it for the correct results. Other recipes include the use of store-bought BBQ sauces, which can alter the taste completely, depending on what brand used. BBQ sauce recipes should have been included.

It also set me straight on a number of misconceptions I had formed out of ignorance or from the half-truths spouted by diet \\"experts\\".If you're thinking about a low-carb diet like Southbeach, you owe it to yourself to get Atkins' perspective on nutrition and food-related health issues.Bottom line...there's a lot information in this book.

I love how easily the pages flow and how you want to just keep reading every time you pick it up. The character of Ruby felt a lot like me in that she could get so wrapped up in the day-to-day and the worries and stresses of the day-to-day that she overlooks some of the good. For good or bad, I tend to do that as well. This made her character more human to me.

I do understand this is book one in a series (which seems to have trivial gem theme name protagonists), but relationships were formed and we didn't see them mature. Since the rest of the series picks up with a different character, we lose the relationship we had with Ruby, therefore abandoning the little information and emotions we felt. The religious aspect of the story was overflowing, smothering, and uncalled for, since no reason was touched upon to have it. This book is labeled as a historical fiction, when a religious historical fiction label would have been apt, so it was poor marketing.

Regardless of whatever the message was that the author wanted to get across, she could have done it without going into detail. She could have just worked into the storyline that the saloon had been previously used by the devil, and now was to be converted into a respectible establishment--albeit, one that still condoned gambling!

Like many other reviewers, I hate leaving a book unread. I wanted to like it. It had some great potential, but the story just seemed to plod along with no real determination or goal. No clear antagonist showed up, so there was no reason to root for the supposed heroine (who was far too naive to be believable). And when the story ended I couldn't help but say, \\"That was it?\\"I won't be reading any further books in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed expected more.","review":"I was disappointed with the ending. I expected two or three more chapters to complete the parts of the story left unfinished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hope for the doves","review":"What a story about hope. Going west per her father's request Ruby and her sister find that their father's inheritance is more than what they could have imagined. A story about hope, forgiveness and moving forward, and living New lives...lives that enrich others as well as themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Very good despite not ending as I had hoped.

It was as if the author got bored with writing the book and decided to just stop. It was such an abrubt stop that I actually went back to the Amazon order page to check the page numbers in the book. I was convinced my tablet froze in the download process and there were chapters I had missing. Why put in a whole plot line about possible romance with one guy, and a clear tension that looked like it would become romance with another, and do NOTHING with either? It was like that whole story line in the book had been forgotten along with a few others. It looks like the next book is about a completely new character, so it appears there will be no resolution. I will not be paying to find out. Oh, and the all of a sudden religious overkill at the end was too much for my taste. Unsure as to how this book received so many great reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ruby by Lauraine Snelling","review":"Wonderful, kept me reading and reading into the night. Can not wait to read book 2!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the book but ending made me wanting...","review":"I couldn't put this book down. It was awesome. However, when the book ended, I felt like something was missing. So my question is, will be there be a sequel so we find out where Ruby goes from here? And what about Belle & the other girls? I would definitely recommend this--a great read--but it needs to be continued in another book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Despite the distasteful subject,the story pulled me in!","review":"I wasn't sure if I would be able to stick with Ruby to the end,when I discovered that it was about what I suspected. However, as with this author's other series~ Red River Of The North that I am also reading, she has the skill as an author to really make you feel that you are there,and to feel a connection to her characters. I never lost interest in the story and am anxious to continue with book 2 Pearl.If you haven't read Lauraine Snelling's work,treat yourself to either one of these series \\"Red River Of The North\\" or \\"Dakotah Treasures\\", you will be glad you did.I lived in North Dakota from '64-68 when I was in my teens,when my dad was stationed there in the AF,and despite hating the place, the author is able to make me love both of these series,even though they also remind me of the unbelievable cold,wind and flat,treeless scenery!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blessing","review":"The characters in this book keep the reader interested with their personalities, antics, and struggles.

But she had a strong determination and the reader appreciated her independence. Because of this the story moved along quickly and hence the 4 star rating.I do believe readers would enjoy reading about this young woman's fortitude to continue in an unknown environment where people didn't want her to succeed.Yes, I would recommend this book.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"I chose four stars because even though the ending wad happy it was very predictable.

I have read all of the Red River of the North, the Return to Red River and Daughters of the Confederacy books. I was raised in North Dakota. I LOVED all of the other books. This one lacks description of the area, the characters, the location, the time period, the heat, the clothing, the main building, and I could go on and on. I have been to the Medora area several times, but I don't think Mrs. Snelling went there once. It seemed like she was assuming too much of her readers. The story line was very predictable compared to her past books. I will read the other two books that are supposed to be in this series, but this was a totally unexpected disappointment. Sorry, maybe the next one will fill in the gaps."},{"rating":"1","title":"A student who was required to work through the whole book","review":"This textbook is disconnected and poorly organized. The authors of each chapter are so absorbed in their own work that they don't seem to remember that the text is supposed to be for a multidisciplinary audience. The problem sets are hit or miss, and in some cases the solutions are not supported by the text (if you relied on the text alone, you couldn't solve the problems). The biomechanics and biomaterials chapters are good, but the imaging, fluids and mass transfer chapters are lacking. If you want a good, broad bioengineering text, you should look for the Ratner book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FULL DIN","review":"This product is NOT Full DIN size as it is advertised, it will NOT fit a DIN sized space as it is advertised.

Sure it was full of the blue-grey world of despair, full of careless un-truths, full of boredom. Is that a good reason to go rent or buy a movie? I just don't think so.

It purports to be a facsimile copy of the original book. In fact the book was OCR scanned, and this is an unformatted printout of the resulting file.

Being raised in the early 50's and 60's in Biloxi, Mississippi, I grew up listening to this music, from the worksongs I would hear the chain gangs sing to the simple single string slide playing my old neighbor would play, that would make the hair stand up on my neck. This music might not be eveyones cup of tea ( Sonny Bono ? I dont think so ), but to me and my own humble opinion, it stands right up there with anything today in this style.

Reading it again a dozen years later, I'm able to catch a few of the subtleties that zoomed over my head the first time.

When I called tech support, which did call back the next day, they said it is common for contrast to not be properly read on LCD monitors and to use the default contrast setting. Huh? He then tried to talk me into upgrading to the Display 2, which has a lot more functionality, for $99 but he thought he could get me 25% off.

I also used it on my laptop and it seemed to do a better job there which is what it's most widely used for, but didn't seem to make a big difference.

The mathematics may be difficult in places for non-specialists, but that fact alone confirms Swerdlow's argument that the accomplishments of the ancient scribes were impressive and sophisticated. Technical aspects are explained as clearly as possible, yet Swerdlow does not duck larger issues, such as the significance of Near Eastern astronomy for the rise of ancient science. No longer will historians wish to credit the first origin of science to the (non-mathematical) pre-Socratic philosophers of ancient Greece. Everyone interested in ancient science will need to take account of Swerdlow's arguments in this book. It will be a classic, and should come out in a less expensive paperback edition!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a difficult read","review":"Even with a B.S. degree in physics, I had a hard time keeping up with the mathematical and scientific details in this book.

Each idea/concept being explained was clearly identified, then a program example was used to illustrate the concept, and then the example was gone over again to show how it worked. Every piece of code (every word) was explained in full. I only had two issues with the way the book was written. The first was that some of the naming conventions used for classes that were developed as examples in Chapter 5 were poorly chosen as they were similar in name to the concepts being explained. The second problem was that some of the programs that were used as examples were more complex than necessary to illustrate the concept being explained (same Chapter)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horton may know his Java, but he's no teacher!","review":"Although I think Horton's book is excellent for somebody with a firm background in C++, he attempts to teach abstract content with more abstracts, yet only to pile more abstrats on later! For example, he uses math too often in his logic, when other content will do.Other authors do a much better job at teaching the Java language by example, rather than boring the reader with meaningless math operations. (If you are hung up on math, why not use something that is \\"real world\\" since Java is a real world computer language.)I just can't recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for self-study","review":"At the moment, I have neither the time nor financial resources to go out and take a Java class at the local JC. Of the four books I've tried to use in order to teach myself the language, this one has, by far, been the most helpful. It goes through EVERYTHING step-by-step and is exhaustive in its information. A little too exhaustive for my taste. I'm a little annoyed by the structure of the book (Applets are discussed near the last half and are only glossed over) but it provides an education that allows one to grasp new concepts quickly.

From there you have a choice of learning the basics of AWT, JDBC, Networking, RMI, or other useful, real world topics without having to buy another book.

Big mistake. The animation is not even close to the Disney standard, and the storyline lacks the polish of a Disney production. None of the little touches of comedy that children love exist in this fairly mediocre recreation of Kiplings classic.

The story starts out with the villian (a tiger)chasing a baby boy who finds shelter with wolves. The tiger demands that the wolves turn the child over to him as it was his prey. He demands the child be given to him so that he may eat the child for dinner & goes on to describe this in too much detail. The tone of the movie continues in this fashion throughout. I was horrified, not to mention the at my 3 1/2 year old asked me to turn it off because it was \\"nasty\\".

To one extent or another, this first-year installment set the tone for the rest of the series, and after 37 years, \\"Rogosh\\" is still fresh, and still a model of staging and editing.Director Leonard Horn was a veteran of the sci-fi classic \\"The Outer Limits\\" (\\"The Man Who Was Never Born,\\" etc.), as was writer Jerome Ross (\\"The Man with the Power\\"). Other \\"Limits\\" tie-ins include directors Lee H. Katzin and Paul Stanley, as well as co-producer Alan Balter.The second episode on the video, \\"The Train,\\" is more gimmick-reliant but quite entertaining, with one especially nerve-wracking moment.

Gone is the self aware tongue in check humor of the 1994 movie starring Jean-Claude Van Damme. Instead we have this slow moving, not much martial arts for the first thirty minutes, movie that dosen't even realize that it is so silly. The Van Damme movie knew it was a joke, and succeded quite well, I should add. Here, we have gravity defying wire fu, but this one is supposed to be more \\"realistic.\\" I love the term realistic, action movies are about as realistic as porno movies, weather it be Die Hard or the Transporter, in real life, this stuff dosen't happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad, it makes Van Damme's film look oscar worthy!","review":"This movie is, without a doubt, one of the poorest efforts by hollywood in DECADES. The plot is ridiculously lame, the villain is the illigitimate love-child of Donald Trump and Michael Flatley (from Riverdance). Claw-weilding, mask wearing Vega is explained as the ultimate assassin, killing an entire room of asian mafia. 10 minutes later, Vega is taken down by Chun-Li in 2 seconds.Robin Shou is wearing HORRID \\"old man\\" makeup. Special effects are cheaper than the worst low budget Sci Fi channel movie. Chun-Li's fireball is literally two frames of animation (the one step up from the 1994 movie, since that movie only had a single white frame as a 'fireball')I'd rate this movie as zero out of 5 stars, but Amazon won't let me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun Li .....","review":"I, like many others, have always loved Capcom's Street Fighter games. One of my favorite characters to play as has always been Chun-Li. I was looking forward to this movie for that one reason. But, when I saw this movie, I just couldn't believe what they did to it. I thought the last movie was awful but this one just blows that one out of the water. And, of all things, I thought Kristen Kreuk would be the one redeeming quality to save this film. Yet, even with all her beauty, it wasn't enough to save this film.Folks, no joke-- this movie is bad. Real bad. I tried watching this movie twice and fell asleep during it both times. I barely made it to the end the third time. Thank Heavens, though, I did.What gets me is the trailer made this movie look so good.

I liked the movie, but I could see WHY they didn't like it. It took quite a few liberties with the source, but at least it was recognizable.This... I don't even know why the source was ignored so much. Chun Li is practically unrecognizable here - her story has been changed.

There is almost no scientific data, and many descriptions are similar to this one for the pink pearl: \\"With this pearl, the animal kingdom points out to us that we have forgotten the agreement that we have made with God - to protect all living beings and especially those that are subordinate to our development.\\" Nearly all crystal descriptions are filled with references to God and most impart human characteristics to the crystals.Whacko! This is not a scholarly resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Ready For A Ride","review":"I'll tell you what I liked about this book. I am an avid mystery reader. I enjoy a book that I can sit down and relax with. I guess in a way that means that I enjoy a predictable read. As I was reading The Deal Master I found myself enjoying the book and then thinking, \\"What's going on?\\" The book is by no means predictable. It called on my full attention. And as I gave the story more attention, it delivered more to me. The story pulls you in. And once it has you, and just when you think you have a handle on it, Wham! The story takes off in a different direction like a rocket ship. If you are like me and enjoy Robert Parker, Michael Connelly, Patricia Cornwell, Stuart Woods and John Sanford I think you will thoroughly enjoy this book. Just don't make the mistake I did and think that this novel is like anything written by these other authors, because it is not. It goes beyond."},{"rating":"2","title":"More deals...please!","review":"The twists and turns from this book got a grip on me and wouldn't let go. I read it in 2 days! I'm hooked and need more deals from the Deal Master....please!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting psychological thriller...","review":"The Deal Master is a page turner that left me sleepless and haunted me for days after I finished it. In the style of 1940s gumshoe detective novels, Gerard Bianco shapes believable characters with depth and histories. Their dialogue is perfectly rendered - you can hear the characters speaking, right down to their NYC accents. Bianco takes you through unexpected plot turns and keeps you second-guessing in this psychological thriller, right until the shocking end. Looking forward to the next one by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Jingle Bells","review":"Although the box was adorably small, the figurines were misshapen.

Like this mini wood box and the matchbox boxes. We have a number of different ones and like most of them. This one is cute and has a lot of detail on the figures. The center scene rotates as the music plays. There is a little illuminated (battery powered) shelter that adds to the miniature nature of it all.Very cute. Makes a nice small gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Just a bunch of basket cases who get together at a cabin retreat, in Utah I believe, and cry. And scream. And cry. And laugh. And cry. And eat. And cry. And destroy video cassettes. And cry. And pile on top of each other, crying (of course), with a declaration to the Martha Plimpton character (the \\"outsider\\" in the bunch) that \\"You're one of us now!\\" Awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shore and Cronenberg with another winner!","review":"Shore has been collaborating with sci-fi and horror master David Cronenberg since the 1970s, and this score is yet another wonderful result. Like many of Shore's dark and brooding scores (THE GAME comes to mind) this isn't a CD from which you can pick favorite tracks -- there is really only one track that had to be divided into multiple parts. Most of the tracks sound similar and cannot be differentiated easily -- but in Shore's case this isn't criticism but praise. The score is like a book: you can't skip to one part and read it on its own and expect full gratification. The only way to listen to this CD is to pop into your player, press play, and let it unwind and permeated the room. A wonderful exericise in gloomy, doom-ridden atmospherics. Check out the movie, too -- the best thing Cronenberg has done since DEAD RINGERS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrifyingly beautiful soundtrack from a fantastic film!","review":"I never am in a mood where I don't want to listen to this music. Moody, strange, and mysterious - this music always sends me into a trance-like feeling (reality?!) which is exactly what Howard Shore was aiming at with it. As music accompanying one of my all time favorite films, I greatly appreciate this music fromeXistenZ.You follow Ted Pikul's strange adventures through the gigantic computer game structure accompanied by this music and in a way you become Ted Pikul or Allegra Geller as you absorb this music. One of the things I particularly like about this music is its universality: you can listen to it when you're excited, exuberant, depressed, sleepy, or wide awake. It doesn't matter.This is an impressive score from Howard Shore's pen, and I encourage you to buy this - it is one purchase that you will never regret!\\"Hey, tell me the truth... are we still in the game?\\" - The Waiter"},{"rating":"1","title":"unsatisfied customer","review":"I didnt care for this issue, I was unaware that the issue was in black/white.

In my opinion, No movie can compare itself to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies, much less Leatherface! However I bought it and was a bit disappointed. The movie is a bit boring at times but did contain good death scenes. The best thing about the movie was the gore. It centers around a man named Jack who's badly addicted to drugs. Being so messed up by drugs, Jack believes that everyone is out to get him and kill him. He takes revenge on people by killing them with a jackhammer which I admit is \\"different\\" and a refreshing change. Overall, not a bad movie but not as good as I expected.

Maybe it doesn't help that the author is incapable of moving through the book without boring the reader to death with the names of dumb cops who have really nothing to do with the actual case.

BUY!","review":"This is one of the most exciting books to come out in recent memory, with his irreverant off-the-wall humor, Lloyd Kaufman has rocked the literary world with The Toxic Avenger: The Novel. I got this book after reading Make Your Own Damn Movie, which I picked up since I'm a huge fan of Lloyd Kaufman's truly independent cinema, and I can say, everyone who enjoys positive things about the world should pick up this book. Seriously, it was a quick read yet I go back to it again and again. It's like reliving the movie-in print!Also, if you get a chance, see other films in the Troma collection. I personally can't wait for Poultryguest to come out, but my favorite is still Terror Firmer, or maybe Tromeo & Juliet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insanity at its best!","review":"Since Troma first unleashed Toxie into the world, he's been the most unique, out-there hero you'll ever find - but also the most relatable. He's the average underdog we all idenitfy with and root for while marveling at his all his...well, toxic avenging.This novel is a Toxie fan's wish come true. It offers everything we know and love about the hero and then some! In true Troma style, we delve into the muck of the Toxie experience, and how joyous it is!

Just the fact that purchasing the book supports the fine people at Troma, the book is a great novel, riddled with the sense of humor that Lloyd is famous for, and that alone is worth the price of admission!!!If you haven't already, or if you're thinking about it, BUY THE BOOK, you won't regret it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Aunt of an Aunt","review":"I purchased the Auntie Mame books and the movie for my sister she is the Auntie Mame to my children.

It went WAY too fast, and for someone who's heard even a little Arabic (my husband is Syrian), most of this was unintelligible for me. For example, the way it taught numbers was \\"1, 2, 3\\" and said it all together, so I had no idea where one word started and the next one ended! Like I said, I've heard a little Arabic over the past few years, and most of the words I heard didn't mesh with anything I'd heard from my husband and his family.Granted, this is supposed to squish what you need to know in one hour, but don't waste your hour trying to figure out what these people are saying.

The stories about Elvis here are presented in a fair unjudgemental fashion, and the author (despite a few moments of artistic license) has a good grasp on Elvis the man and entertainer. The problem with the book is that the Stanley's were not as close to Elvis as they make out to be. For instance Ricky was not playing Racket Ball with Elvis the last night of Presley's life. Their stories turned very dark later on, but here they tell their stories both good and bad with a great deal of respect. Ricky and Billy basically maintained that respect over the years, but Dee and David's stories have gotten more scandalous since then. Basically this book captures the feel of Elvis' life in the 70's pretty well and feels authentic since it was finished before the 70's came to an end.

The wheel is constructed of three circles and 8 squares that you assemble with a long bolt that runs through them. You have to tighten the bolt regularly.It is still a lot of fun. It doesn't work as smoothly as the one my grandparents had. We used to be able to stay on it for hours. Because this one slips so much, we can only stay on it for a few minutes.I don't think it will break from our weight. I weigh about 150 lbs.

I seriously doubt the longevity and durability (greater than one year) of this product.Frankly it looks like someone went to Home Depot and bought some cheap plywood.

The big problem with the board is the roller that you have to assemble from half a dozen pieces of cutout plywood or composite wood. After bolting the pieces together and giving it a spin, I was immediately disappointed by the performance of this. Then upon inspection of the material used for the roller, I noticed immediate wear or deformation of the pressed wood substance and expect this piece to be useless within a month of use.I have used other boards to include the Indo boards for hours on end with no such problems. Most of the other makes use a solid piece of wood or molded plastic with great results.If I had it to do over I would spend the extra money and get the Indo board without hesitation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carrom Balance Board","review":"This product looked like it was going to be great from the picture on-line, but once we got it opened and saw how it had to be put together and the cheap wooden parts, we were very disappointed. We did follow the instructions to put it together (the \\"roller\\" part is a combination of round and square pieces of wood that alternate on a metal rod)and found that it didn't even work. Our overall opinion is that this Balance board will be the cheapest one you find on-line, in price as well as in quality!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of fun, but it's not very hard","review":"I got my balance board a couple of weeks ago off of amazon. The assembly is really easy and you can play with it almost instantly. I thought that it would be very hard to balance based on other people's reviews. In about 30 minutes I was able to ride it easily on smooth flooring for as long as I liked. I was expecting it to be more challenging and give me more of a workout, but I still really like it because it is so much fun. So far I haven't found any flaws in the board, but I haven't had it very long yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Balance Board","review":"I bought this for my five year old and my thirty five year old husband! They both really like to stand on it and are getting better at balancing. They snow ski and skate board and so I thought this would make a great practice gift for them. It is a little (long) for my five year old to negotiate on his own, but with someone standing by, he does a great job on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed Quality","review":"The board is of high quality but the cylinder is very poor. Instead of being a solid block of wood, is a collection of pieces that leave the action when balancing inconsistent and sloppy.

Now trying to put that carseat in the bag for 2 flights, it is ripping where the straps are sewn to the bag itself. The quality is terrible and the design is super bulky. I now need to replace this bag, and will probably either buy a Britax bag or one that has wheels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Alternative Music","review":"Wow! This CD is full of honest Alternative Music, every track is an adventure. The underlying theme is almost goth, but there are other tracks that could be mainstream rock hits, if only the major FM outlets could get past their 40-track playlists. The \\"I'm Not Exercising Enough\\" and \\"Kids Have More Fun\\" have a great sound. Listen to this CD a few times and the other, very unusual, sounds will grow on you. Max Gomberg has a smooth voice, would have been a crooner in the 40s. The contrast with Nora Keyes is great---she can sound like Rosie and the Originals, or she can be very cool, as in \\"Thousand Eyes\\". I think anyone who likes stuff out of the mainstream will appreciate this new OC offering."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"This is the kind of book I usually love, where a writer brings you into intimate contact with another human culture, and at the same time acquaints you with the behavior of a fascinating animal.However, like other reviewers here, I found the prose clunky, shallow, and rather egotistical and condescending. Maybe that's due to the youth of the author.There are occasional bright spots, where Hall weaves in information about Asian elephants, and historical and cultural information about the Assam region of India."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough power.","review":"I have an Ipod touch 2nd generation and this does not provide enough power to charge or even run it.

However, I'm not happy with this product at all. The vanilla taste just isn't there. It's great for adding the vanilla bean \\"look\\" to my recipes, but I found that even if I use a lot, I still can't achieve a good level of vanilla flavor. I used about 1/3 of the bottle for a frosting recipe but it still didn't have the vanilla flavor I was seeking. I had to add vanilla extract for that.I thought it would be thicker and have more vanilla beans in it, but it's about the consistency of maple syrup. It shouldn't be called a paste, as it really isn't. Pastes are very thick and don't run. I won't be buying this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to expectations","review":"I bought the vanilla bean extract but I was very disappointed to find that it has a stronger alcoholic flavour to it than the actual vanilla flavour. The extract was also not as thick as the other extracts I have used. I have not tried the vanilla bean paste of this brand and maybe that is of a better quality than the extract."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great flavor","review":"I purchased a bottle of the Nielsen-Massey Madagascar Vanilla about a year ago through Amazon and noticed how the vanilla enhancedthe flavors of whatever I used it in. Cookies had a richer flavor as well as pancakes and other baked goods. When I ran out I purchaseda couple of smaller bottles of vanilla at my local market, but the flavor just wasn't as intense. So, I recently purchased anotherbottle of Nielsen-Massey and am very satisfied again with this product. Keep in mind this is \\"pure\\" vanilla as opposed to \\"imitation\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"FLAVOR-filled :)","review":"Nielsen-Massey Madagascar Vanilla is BY FAR the best vanilla I've ever used in my baking--and I've used a lot of vanilla from numerous companies over five decades of baking. There have been store-brands, spice company brands, the famous vanilla sold door-to-door years back, and even vanilla brought home from a foreign country.When I opened this bottle of vamilla, the aroma was fresh and fabulous. Then I tasted the \\"old\\" cakes and cookies I've baked umpteen times. I could have sworn they were new recipes, and my guests responded likewise.I proudly recommend Nielsen-Massey Madagascar Vanilla for your use. Buy the 32-ounce bottle, because you're going love baking with it :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good vanilla at a great price!","review":"I used to find smaller glass bottles of this same product at retailers like Marshall's and TJ Maxx.

It's good music to play in the background or really late at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tricked by the reviews","review":"I think you are hard-pressed to call this a yoga deck. It is more like variety of stretches. I actually have some yoga experience, but most of these poses were unfamiliar. When I started out I ended up pulling a muscle because it is hard to tell if you are doing the stretches correctly because it is not a video. I imagined that it would contain different poses or variations for the different trimesters, but really almost all of the poses can be done during all the trimesters. I got this early on in my pregnancy and, as I said, pulled a muscle with it and then quit altogether. I am actually quite regretful I purchased this because I think,had gotten an actual video, I probably would have used it regularly as I do enjoy yoga and did use yoga videos fairly consistently before pregnancy. I would say stay away from this deck."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not like the deck option.","review":"Instead of pictures it has poor drawings, it is hard to see exactly in some cases.I found the books a lot more explicit and more descriptive.I returned it the same day I got it.

You can choose the complexity and length of your workout with different combinations of cards (if you went straight through the whole deck it would take more than 2 hours). It's small enough to take with you even to the hospital, and the breathing and relaxation techniques are very helpful for preparing for labor. Of all the pregnancy exercises I have tried this is by far the most rewarding, and I intend to continue it even after I am no longer pregnant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like","review":"Too boring, black and white sketches are hard to follow.

They are an intriguing combination of musicians from the San Francisco Bay area and the Baltimore area. This CD features songs that have been played live over the last couple of years. A nice blend of ballads and jam vehicles with a California style. Robert Hunter wrote the lyrics for Long Gone Sam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jamm that Jazz","review":"David Nelson has successfully put an album of various types of music together.

Highly reccommended,once you see it you will never escape The Village :). A must for your Sci/Fi/Spy collection.

You get the following episodes : Arrival/ Free for All/ Dance of the Dead plus Chimes of Big Ben (alternative version). All episodes of The Prisoner are of excellent quality with the alternative version of the Chimes of Big Ben being the major exception. It appears to be taken from a low quality print, the print is scratchy, and the color is off.The set does come with some supplimental material on the DVD. A very challenging quiz, photos, and the trailers for each episode. Overall this was was enjoyable, the quality of the Chimes of Big Ben alternative version was notably less than all others. I would have given this a five, but the no explanation behind the alternative version was something I found distracting, as well as no indication if we would see the other version of the Chimes of Big Ben later in this series was frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"A winner...","review":"Not all good entertainment comes as prepackaged color tv dinners. I bought this on a lark late one night at Tower Video and haven't regretted that impulse buy since. I watch the episodes all the time and with each review, find something new. The stories are multilayered, the humor satirical and it does pay fine homage to Orwell's 1984. I might even think it was inspirational in the creation of Brazil. Well worth the investment and I can't wait for future episode releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the picture. Hated the sound","review":"A&E, what did you do?!

The level of intelligent script writing and depth of imagination is a true benchmark in television history. The tenacity of this one man to keep his individuality against all manner of methods to squeeze his secret from him makes for one heck of a series. Patrick McGoohan was made for this role and the entourage of actors and actresses who meet him on film is exceptional. Not everyone will understand it, but I would wager most couldn't help but appreciate this level of effort. I am thrilled it's finally available on tape. I've only seen the series four times in 30 years-now I own the first few-with more on order! Hooray!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING","review":"I love this British TV show.

It could be subtitled \\"The Triumph of Taste Over Virtuosity\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobody does it like Muddy.....NOBODY","review":"I feel a little guilty rating this a \\"4 star\\" album....but let me explain why. It is the extra tracks & the way they are so disjointed from the first 9 that originally comprised the whole album. If they were seperate....each piece would have the full 5 stars. Continuity is an important element of any great album. That being said, simply programming songs 1-9 and listening to them on their own merit willl BLOW YOUR SOCKS OFF!

Karen Pinkus describes her book as a \\"screenplay\\" (it isn't) \\"concerning primarily the intersections of cinema, paparazzo photography, tabloids, feminity, and politics.\\"Professor Pinkus is clearly very knowledgeable about Italian history and language: the book contains a solid description of the facts and characters of the case and any consideration of the Montesi scandal would be deficient without the secondary issues Professor Pinkus raises.

As for the movie itself, it was a good movie and was very funny at times (this is a comedy), but just didn't have as much substance as I would have liked, I just never really cared about all but a couple of the characters. It isn't a bad movie, but it isn't a great movie either.

It took 2 pieces for each display to make the room dark again. It is difficult to see the display during the day, however. Also, the volume is very difficult to adjust. There is something to be said about analog controls. The digital volume on these units is too soft on one setting and too loud on the next higher setting.Nevertheless, I am still glad I bought them.

Compelling, whispery vocals wrap themselves around intelligent lyrics while meandering through dynamic and fluid guitar arrangements. I can't decide whether the sounds he makes with his voice or with his guitar are more beautiful. Suffice it to say, its a pleasure to hear them at work together. There are plenty of beautiful slow songs on Didn't Ever...Hasn't Since but a few of them definitely rock with a reserved intensity that eventually bursts at the seams.Didn't Ever....Hasn't Since is an intimate and intricate album that has the potential to propel Olsen into the national limelight.

She does a wonderful array of both traditional and contemporary Christmas songs and blends Spanish and english renditions magnificently! Carr is under-estimated by many and it is her who long before fashionable,recorded songs in Spanish ! She fought with Columbia records to record and release her first spanish lp back in 1971.

Love her voice and I think she is a truly wonderful human being. BUT, this CD is a big disappointment. Somehow it just doesn't work for her. I think it is a combination of the arrangements and orchastra, they just don't match her voice. Any of her Spanish or earlier music is outstanding and I recommend it, but sorry not this CD. However, the price is right so if you are confused, pick up a copy and judge for yourself. Its not awful but not typical Vikki quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"If you're buying this CD becasue you loved her old version of \\"What Child Is This\\" you will be disappointed.

As a result, the lyrics are the blandest they've ever written. The band who gave us \\"Surrender\\" is reduced to making sexual grunts and singing about females perched at the edge of their beds. The whole album isn't a waste, however.

I'm not a millionaire yet - haven't even found a better job - and I haven't written that novel I've always meant to write. But I've noticed my attitude to life is more relaxed and my willingness to stand up for myself - in a non-confrontational way - has improved since I started listening to it.Often, when I listen to self-hypnosis programs, I wake up an hour later and wonder if I heard anything. Harrold doesn't just lull you to sleep; he uses some pretty nice routines for gradually talking you into that trance state where things suddenly seem to make sense and you don't push back against affirming suggestions but you don't sleep through them either. Some of the music, in fact, is surprisingly up-tempo for this type of program.If you're looking for a lift in your mood and attitude, this is a great disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Video for advance and beginners","review":"This very relaxing video is an excellent hour or half-hour yoga workout.

And I'm not talking about the \\"Calypso\\" or the \\"Sneezing, I'm allergic to you\\" song and dance numbers, either. But when one sits down and thinks about why it's sexy, it says alot about one's own fetishizations and brand of sexuality, I think. For example, consider the physical separation of the man and woman. One's on top, one's on the bottom. The voyeurism was also strictly one way, which forces the other person to be an exhibitionist. And despite the advantage/disadvantage environment that is dictated purely by things beyond their control (i.e. the weather, the Kafkaesque Gregor Samsa virus) a desire for one another was still nurtured.

Just a glance of this book got me on the alert side. Although the title of the book bears the name of Jesus, it is largely based on the author's personal meditations than the bible. The author refers very little to the bible. And, the chapter \\"Rise Above Karma\\" annoys me as it relates \\"Karma\\" to the bible teachings. Is not \\"Karma\\" a term for Hinduism and Buddhism? What is dangerous about this book is that it mentions the names of God and Jesus so often that without discernment it is easy to mistake this book as one of the christian books.

I was a bit worried at first, because I have played on an actual sized shuffle board and was worried this product would not have the same feel or fun factor, but honestly I have had a great deal of enjoyment and fun with the product. It's a great item to have for house parties or just get togethers with friends. The board was well put together and the wood finish and paint job was superb! The board came well packed and protected. And finally the pucks are well designed as well and durable. The mini pucks have a plastic ring around a steel baron to glide across the board, which it does very well. And the plastic ring is great when bumping other players pucks off the board and from points. For 40 dollars you can't go wrong with the item and it fits on top of a dinner table easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible pucks!!","review":"I was really excited when I found this. A friend of mine had bought one at a garage sale about 20 years ago. We had a lot of fun playing on that shuffleboard! When I finally received the item, it was delivered without any damage. The shuffleboard itself looks great, but as soon as I started rolling the pucks, I was very upset. These pucks couldn't pass a sobriety test! The pucks that I used to play with, were much better quality. You could really play with finesse with them. Fast or slow, they always rolled straight offering good competitive game play. The current pucks roll so poorly, resulting in the board sitting in my closet wasting space. Not only that, I missed the return date, and now I'm stuck with firewood. That's my fault.

It is very, very stylish, shot in color and black and white, with great use of computer effects and editing tricks. The story is a bit complex until you really pay attention. Three different groups of people are attacked by zombies and must merge together to survive. The zombies are brought back by an evel spirit trapped in a scarecrow. Many scenes in this are very shocking, artistic and disturbiing. I was impressed. I have not seen anyone else use video like this to create such mood and atmosphere. We also get two incedible crazed serial killers that make me laugh one minute then disturn me the next. Includes a great shot from INSIDE a guy's mouth as his tongue is impaled on a knife.

They just sink slightly down into your eye sockets (to avoid white circles around your eyes) and stay there until you're done. I use the little cord which holds the goggles to my eyes so that if I turn over or move, they stay on. The nose piece is raised so that there is space between it and your nose, so no tan line there.They take a small amount of adjustment the first couple of times you wear them, especially if you've never worn tanning goggles before.

But that's typical for British TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's like a bad xerox of the UK version.","review":"This is just a re shoot of the original UK series. I suspect that those who say that's not the case didn't watch the UK series. There are many episodes of the US series that are done nearly scene for scene from the UK series. I also found the fact the vampire faux \\"Edward\\" casting to be a cheap attempt at cashing in on the Twilight craze. This manages to miss all the charm of the UK series and the connection between the viewer and the characters. It would have been nice to see this done well since there is so little from the genre that is taken seriously in the US but this will not help that cause. I suppose the there will be a US Dr. Who version next, God help us all."},{"rating":"1","title":"ba","review":"Not even sure why someone felt compelled to remake the show running on the BBC.

What's up with the Blu-ray packaging?","review":"I just received The Complete First Season of Being Human on Blu-ray. The show gets a 5-Star rating, but the packaging gets 1-Star because that's as low as I can give it. This is a 4-Disc Set and what they did is stack 2 discs on top of each other on one sprocket on both sides. Terrible!! Could hardly believe it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this","review":"I saw the first episode of the SyFy channel's version of this and thought it was going to be a great show, and i was right.I KNOW this is the BBC version but bought it anyway because SyFy isn;t coming out with the episodes fast enough.the picture quality is fine, the low marks are for the sound. i thought it might clear up so i stayed with it a few minutes and it didn't seems the music track is MUCH louder then the talking track and i couldn't hear a dang thing of what they were saying.I hope the SyFy version comes out when season one is done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely disappointed....","review":"I will not bore you with a comparison of this vs. the UK version or give away any spoilers.The \\"Being Human season 1\\" series is so dry, flat, emotionless and lacking any substance. Even the dialogue is poorly written. There is no depth to any of the characters. The actress playing Sally is flat out annoying. I cannot understand how some reviewers can praise this with 5 stars unless they are just too simple minded and easily entertained by shiny objects. If you want show that you can get into, care about the characters, and \\"sink your teeth\\" into what's going to happen next, this is NOT it. If I had to describe this using one word it would be \\"LAME\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Trust SyFy","review":"I won't watch this or any other series from Sy Fy until they come out complete on DVD. SyFy is unreliable. They get you hooked and cancel. They move their series all over on different nights and even different seasons. You will watch a few short episodes before the series will take a long break after which you will have no idea if the series is going to continue....The network was once my favorite. Now I consider it the worst network on Television. Other networks produce far better programming that can be called Sci Fi than the channel that once had it's name.Pathetic.So, I do not advise anyone to watch any programs produced by SyFy. Apparently they have no way to tell who is watching their programs online and must only get their numbers from broadcast/cable numbers. They don't have a clue and unless they undergo a radical shake up in their upper management and program direction posistions, I know more like myself who will not be bothering with this network."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"I got hooked on the show in the american version so thought i would try the BBC version and i love it!!!

There are distinct differences. It is the differences that make the show worth viewing. I like the characters as well as the arc story lines. The actors are very good and believable in their characters. the writing is very solid and the stories move along at a brisk pace. You will enjoy this show even if you are into the BBC version. I own both shows and we like them both at my house!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series!","review":"BBC has been doing some fantastic series lately, and this is another one of them. A vampire (Mitchell) and a werewolf (George) want to break out of their molds. They want to try leading 'normal' lives, so they become roommates. Of course the place they rent comes complete with a ghost (Annie). The three become friends and start exploring what it really means to be human. The story lines have been wonderful, and the acting is surprisingly good for a tv series. This is currently being redone for American audiences on the SciFi channel (I refuse to accept their change to \\"SyFy.\\" That was a ridiculous move on their part.). The American series is also turning out pretty good, but I have to admit I still like the British version better.In an aside, everyone goes on and on about Mitchell...I have to disagree, though. I'm definitely a George fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"BBC Go","review":"This I think was a good enough show just the fact that it was canceled after about 2 seasons sucks I like the BBC shows"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best series of its kind!","review":"I will admit that I love everything vampire and werewolf (and I'm almost 40!), but I've gotten very tired of the insipid teeny-bopper shows that have less depth than a sheet of typing paper. Being Human deals with grown up issues and speaks to the angst of my generation. Very intelligent writing that utilizes subtle humor well and creates complex relationships that the viewer wants to be a part of!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An improved version","review":"I know the UK guys deserve the credit now that it was their original idea, but from a person that has seen both shows, believe me, this is a HUGELY better version, the producers or whoever, really pay attention to de BBC show and perfected it, the US version makes a lot of more sense on the 3 stories, in the way the handle the 3 main characters, specially the ghost girl, in the UK version you know she's dead just because they told you so, but she does everything like she was alive, she touches things the two boys can touch her, the only thing that makes her different is that regular people can't see her, totally different in the US version, there, she can do nothing!!, that for mentioning something of a lot of more details, seriously I know what people say about re-makes, but this one really deserves a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being Human is hard to do!","review":"Besides True Blood and The Vampire Diaries, I feel Being Human (US version) is one of the better shows on TV - obviously I like vampires!

It has been renewed for a second season and I can't wait!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time & $ - watch the U.K. version...","review":"The U.K. version is fantastic! The actors in the U.S. version are pretty uniformly wooden, the characters are on a pretty uniformly self-righteous and indignant rant. No chemistry, no sense of humor about themselves - the opposite of the U.K. version. Boring! I'm only sorry I spent the price for the whole U.S. version, season 1. I won't bother wasting my time watching the whole thing. Definitely go for the original U.K. version, seasons 1-3."},{"rating":"2","title":"SLAMMING THE US VERSION ISN'T GOING TO MAKE PEOPLE LIKE THIS VERSION","review":"Even though the premise originated with this version, both the SYFY and the BBC versions are awesome in their own ways. I hope to get the entire collection of both shows as soon as they are released, because I'm not a self centered idiot who wants to deprive himself of great entertainment just because one wasn't the original concept. There are more than enough differences in both shows that make it worth it to own both of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a fabulous show!!!","review":"First of all, no I haven't watched the BBC version and don't think it matters for review purposes. Being Human is a highly entertaining, emotionally satisfying show. My daughter and I were completely HOOKED on it for the entire first season and stopped everything in order to watch. We cannot wait for Season 2. I cannot count the times we actually yelled back at the TV because something happened so unexpected and so incredible that we could not contain ourselves. We spent considerable amounts of time outside of viewing in discussion of what was happening and what would happen next. I cannot wait to get this DVD set to give to her for Christmas so we can marathon watch before the next season starts in January.

Darker, yes, but the actors pull it off, especially Aidan Turner as Mitchell. Loved the \\"extras\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The missing pilot","review":"Some one asked where the show pilot is. To answer that I read online that the BBC tends not to show pilots. Yes, some shows do have pilots because they set up the show's idea. This show had a pilot but the original cast were changed except for Tovey who plays George the werewolf. So now the first episode of season one is the pilot. The story is essentially the same. Actually, I like turner better as the vampire he comes across as less broodie. We've had broodie with Angel. I also like the girl playing Annie better too. My apologies to the original cast actors but that's how these things go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable and Different!","review":"If you like Vampire Diaries, True Blood, and The Gates this will be a nice series to watch during the off seasons.

It replaced a Rio that I owned for 6 years and used for 30-60 minutes every day running or lifting weights. The Lyra's battery consumption was horrible compared to the Rio, and even worse to my new 1 Gb Sansa. I'm still on my first battery with the Sansa, and it has played what would have been 3 batteries worth of MP-3's on the Lyra.The user interface and features on the Lyra don't compared to either the 2000 Rio or the 2006 Sansa. Sadly, Rio exited the business, but the SanDisk product is at least as good.

It worked great when I first got it (about a year ago)but, now I'm running into an internal memory problem where it will only hold around 20 songs. Yes, it does jam up from time to time, but new batteries fix that problem. Try as I might, after getting a memory card for it, I could never get it to play the songs on the memory card.

While I found the audio quality to be just fine, I did experience that it ate batteries like nobody's business. I also had some issues with it staying connected to my PC long enough to transfer more than 1 or 2 songs at a time, so I eventually gave up on that and went with just using SD cards. Eventually this player had problems playing in both ears, a problem related to the fact that the headphone jack is only secured in the player with the solder points and eventually the natural stress created by the headphone plug will cause the solder joints to fail, resulting in loss of signal to one ear or other. This is a common issue for lower-priced MP3 players. While I certainly feel like I got my money's worth from the product, I won't buy another."},{"rating":"2","title":"RCA Lyra RD1076 personal player","review":"Very happy with the product so far and it looks like a new MP3 player.

If the people who shot the footage had a shotgun mic to capture the sounds of what they were shooting, it would have helped a lot.But the video isn't for me -- it's for my cat, and he loves it. Even when I'm home with him, I can put the DVD on and it will entertain him for five to fifteen solid minutes at a time, many times throughout the day.Update Jan. 14th, 2012: I upgraded this review from four stars to five because I'm amazed at how much my cat still loves this DVD. In fact, he has some of it memorized -- he pounces at the TV a fraction of a second before birds fly away.

My three year old boy cat is almost to skitish for it though. The opening segment is gerbils and he really likes to watch them.

I've played it about 3 times for them on a continuous loop. I observed them to see if they were interested. My kitty pays no attention. My cat isn't interested in the first part (mice?), but pays intense attention beginning with the birds. In fact, he's tried to climb up 'into' the computer (lol) to get to them, and accidentally set it to something else! Now he doesn't do that, but he's definitely into it for a while.

The next day, I left the DVD on Loop while I was away at work for over 9 hours. When I returned later that evening, within minutes, he aggressively attacked me--scratching my legs and foot and viciously biting my hand and arm. I was shocked at his ferocious behavior, and quite frankly, became frightened of this usually docile, male, neutered indoor house cat that I adopted from a shelter over 2 1/2 years ago. I had to run from the room and shut the door to escape his attack. He has NEVER acted like that in the past and I can only attritube this behavior from becoming OVER-stimulated, and perhaps frustrated, from watching and hearing all the critters on this DVD and not being able to interact with them. I have no other explanation -- so BEWARE! No where on this DVD, does it meaning a warning of this sort!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a hit!","review":"My cat loved this DVD when I first got it. When I first turned it on, she darted over to the TV. After awhile, she settled down and watched it from the couch.

The first time he watched it he was entranced, the second time he tried to get the mice, the third time he was bored and knew he couldn't get to the creatures. Since then he has ignored the DVD totally. The quality is only fair with quite a bit of camera jumping around and the outdoor sounds are annoying after a while....at least annoying to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"One cat loves it!","review":"I recently purchased the cat sitter dvd for my two cats.

My adorable little feline friend -- a very talkative Siberian Russian mix -- loves to chirp at me when I'm talking. I bought this DVD with the intention of getting her to focus on the movie and not on me while I work.Well..it was definitely an effective kitty-sitter. She sat and stared at the loop of images and sounds for a few hours, periodically getting up to try and bat at the images on the TV. She was also just super relaxed with the noises that played, kneading away on a comfy blanket I'd put in her favorite chair in front of the TV (she's spoiled).In short, she was enthralled and I'm both surprised and pleased. Highly recommended. Why don't they sell these in pet stores?!?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"I thought this would be at least 15-30 minutes of scenes and sounds that would interest my cats. It turns out it's only 3-4 scenes (at least one that just shows cats watching the DVD). It has butterflies and birds, but it didn't interest either of my cats for a second. I was disappointed, too, because it plays in an endless loop. I had hoped it would be something I could enjoy with my cats, but it's just annoying to me. I've never bought one of these DVDs for cats, so maybe they're all made similarly. But I feel like I wasted my money.Disclaimer: My cats can watch birds, butterflies, and lizards through the patio door and the bedroom window, so maybe that's why this didn't interest them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"This is a great, quality DVD. It has a range of animals in it: pet rodents, parrots, wild birds, squirrels, butterflies and fish to name a few. There's a constant nature background noise of chirping mostly and it can be pretty annoying for us humans, but cats will like the DVD even if it's on mute. The video automatically loops and will play over and over.I have two cats, one of whom had previously shown an interest in the tv and computer screen and that's the only one that likes the DVD. My other cat doesn't care about it. So it will depend on your cat's personality as to whether he/she will respond to this DVD. I recommend putting your cat in a chair really close to the tv screen to help it take notice and get into this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute idea, but not for my cats","review":"After three tries my cats still aren't even paying attention to the sounds or the video. My cats are indoor/outdoor, so perhaps they are just used to watching real birds and could care less about TV. My friend adopted two siblings of my one cat, and they are completely indoor cats and I know those cats love the DVD and will walk around the TV trying to find where the birds, etc. are coming from. So if your cats are used to sitting outside watching real birds, then this DVD might be a waste of money. If your cats are indoor cats and you have long work hours, then this DVD is a great solution for curing a cat's boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for all cats I guess.","review":"My Burmese cat was not the least bit captivated, either by the sounds or images."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT SUCKS!!!!!","review":"I AGREE WITH THAT GUY I MEANT TO GET THE UNCUT BUT SOMEHOW I GOT THE EDTIED VERSION OF THIS SAGA IT IS NOT FUNNY IT CUT OUT ALL OF THE NUDE SCENES LIKE ON MASTER ROSHIE'S ISLAND AND THE PUFF-PUFF SCENE,BULMA'S PANTIES,THE BULMA PILLOW SCENE ALL COMPETELY GONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ITS SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO NOT FUNNY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncut version coming in 2004, hopefully.","review":"If you are wondering why the first boxed set of the Dragon Ball series is edited while the others are uncut it is because Funimation doesn't have the rights to these first set of episodes (Pioneer has them, I think).

I gave it four stars because it was censored to much so it looks like a kid show, as Dragonball, DBZ, and DBGT are targeted to adults 18 and over, but this is still a very enjoyable tape to watch. Unlike Dragonball Z and Dragonball GT, Dragonball gives more information, so that later in the series, there can be a lot of action scenes without people getting confused. This set has all the Dragonball tapes that FUNimation dubbed, about 1/4 of the episodes are here, all the English ones.

All of the funny jokes that wouldn't be appropriate for the majority of the American viewers (little children) have been taken out, and changed around so they make no sense at all. FUNimation did a pretty good job with the voices, and its great that for such a low price you get episodes 1-13 and a movie. All that's left of the 140 other epidoes of the series is the rise and fall of the Red Ribbon Army, Gokou being runner up at all of the Tenkaichi Budokais but 1, training with Urani Baba, many many deaths, the introduction of a lot of great characters such as Piccolo Daimao, Kuririn, Tenshinhan, Tao Pai Pai, Chaio-tzu, Android 8, Baba, and a lot of other keen stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT WAY TO TELL A STORY","review":"This box set is a good video for kids.

Sadly, no.","review":"Dragon Ball.A wonderful TV series. In Japan, that is. Sadly, in US, the series has been butchered by translators to make it appropriate for kids. The problem is that the series was never meant for kids, as it contains a lot of violence and dirty humor.Luckily, the translators have started to release uncut DVD box sets, containing both the dubbed version and the uncut japanese original (with subtitles). These are [well priced], and I really recommend them. However, this is not one of those box sets. This set contains nothing but the dubbed version, which was a very poor job, and generally disgusting to watch.

I play baseball and basketball, and I still LOVE playing games like this.

It is a bit of a scandal to their better-off relatives, but it keeps the folks in scratch. Most of the time. At the moment the group is in dire need of funds, and they are up to their usual tricks -- sending out one of their own to pretend to be an obscure relative of someone rich, then having them pilfer small but valuable objects. And rather bashful Mrs. Budley has drawn the short straw. Now she must toddle off to the estate of a doddering marquess, little knowing that the marquess has died and the estate is now in the rather capable hands of his nephew. Oh dear.This is a quiet, sweet story with amusing characters. Not a page turner, it is eminently satisfying as a literary bon bon. I will read others by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light reading feel good book","review":"If you like M.C. Beatons books its another great one, in fact the whole series.

This should give you no problems, though.I did notice that this brand was a bit more...gritty? than my other brands. Almost like there are more solids.

(That is what it reminded me of) It was very creamy and coconut tasting. I think I will try eating a couple of tablespoons a day. I will do as some other reviewers and try cooking with it and even rubbing it into my skin. Hopefully it won't feel greasy!

When I received the jar, the contents were hard, like candle wax. I had to scrape what I needed out with a spoon. The label says to keep it refrigerated, so that's what I've been doing and it's stayed hard. However, it liquefies immediately upon contacting a hot frying pan.I tried frying some eggs in half a teaspoon of coconut oil. Wow, did they taste good! The oil gives the eggs a very subtle \\"hint\\" of coconut. It still tastes eggy, but the aftertaste makes you think of Thai food. Now I've been using this oil every morning to fry eggs, and if I get any on my fingers, I wipe it on my skin to soften it.

Takes a year to exhaust the 16-ouncer.Come summer time, when it melts on its own, I'll pour it over a dish of hot pasta, shrimp, basil & lemon, or something like that. It's far healthier than butter, GMO Canola oil or any other processed oil.It's not often I'll eat a teaspoon of oil, but the subtle, smooth, creamy taste is really delicious.So, there you go.

When trying new products, less is more, so I used the back of my thumb nail to scrape off about half a teaspoon's worth. I rubbed it between my hands, and it melted without getting runny. I ran it through my shoulder-length, damp, curly hair and let my hair air-dry.It was a miracle product for under ten bucks. My hair was curly and shiny, without being hard and/or sticky.

Somehow Jarrow manages to make this oil both perfectly smooth and full of a hearty sense of cocunut fragrance and taste. Wow, wow, wow!

I had tried Nutiva before, which is also very good tasting but was unhappy with the messiness of the jar. The Jarrow coconut oil jar doesn't seem to get as much excess oil around the rim and lid.

Since then I put in the video and it is a month later and he is totally engrossed in this production. I think it is colorful, fun and educational for kids with a good mix of puppets with real pictures of various sea life and water sources--from oceans to rivers and ponds.

Needless to say I couldn't wait for Thunder to come out. Rushing out and buying it; I sat up and read it in a day. Redeemed! Everything I wanted to happen in Thunder happened, and she didn't cheat! Now my heart rests easy, He Shall Thunder in the Sky was fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"There are three or four series that I especially love and this is one of them, perhaps the #1. Elizabeth Peters has created, over the years, characters that are so 3-dimensional that they become almost real in the reader's mind. In this particular episode, WW I has begun and its affects are being felt in Egypt as with most other parts of the world. I found this book particularly impelling because of the way in which Ms. Peters treats subject of the war - showing the affects without actually taking the reader into the battlefields. The premise of the book is that Ramses is a coward, refusing to fight; that misconception is soon righted for Amelia, Emerson, etc. although they never believe that he is a coward, anyway. The book moves along at the usual Peters-pace and the ending is fantastic. Have already purchased the next book in the series and look forward to many more exploits with these characters who have almost become friends to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Must Read\\"","review":"If you like the Amelia Peabody books, you must read this one. It gets somewhat complex with spies, counterspies, etc. but I could not put it down. Not only that, I was deeply moved (okay, to tears) by the end of the book---and I am a prosaic, pragmatic person.I am impressed by the depth and quality of Ms. Peters' characterizations as well as her fine eye for historical detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peabody continues her life.","review":"This book continues her saga. I read it for enjoyment. I will enjoy the next installment when I get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect 10.","review":"Like every Peters' fan, I not only waited with breathless anticipation and frightfully impatient yearning for He Shall Thunder, but also pre-ordered the copy so that I would have the book in my hands the second it was released. It was well nigh near impossible not to sneak a glance at the last words on the last page but I managed it somehow and the wait made the ending all the more satisfying. I was in tears by the end, tears of joy, and I will reveal nothing further. But you die hard fans will know what I mean. I think this is the most wonderfully written book in the Peabody-Emerson series and now I can hardly wait for the next two installments. Buy it now, read it now. You can't afford to miss this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than ever!","review":"Peters does it again, only better than ever. She takes us back to Egypt in a bygone era. She makes you cry in one chapter and laugh out loud in the next chapter. I finished the book with a deep sigh and a very foolish grin on my face. What a wonderful read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stories don't come better than this . . .","review":"Its all been said in previous reviews, but I want to add my praise to that already given: its a wonderful story, tying all the loose ends together, and ends perfectly - my only worry is that its too well tied up! I hope we haven't seen the last of the Emersons!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"He Shall Thunder In The Sky\\" is what it's all built up to!","review":"I absolutly love Elizabeth Peters. I have read several of her books. I was quite pleased with \\"He Shall Thunder In the Sky.\\" I love how the book ties up a lot of loose ends that have been floating around for a long time. I was estatic with the conclusion, as usual you are left wanting more! If you have never read any of the books I recomend that you don't start with this book. My only complaint it the lack of excerps from Manuscript H, and Nefert's letters to Lia. It seems like it takes 300 pages to get to the climax, but when you get there it's well worth it! I loved this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY!","review":"This book is ELizabeth Peters and Amelia Peabody Emerson at their best. This book has everything: romance,mystery,history,and Egyptology. The book takes place at the beginning of WWI and Ramses just doesn't want top become involved with the war so he has \\"enough feathers to stuff a pillow with\\"given to ladies who are unaware of the risks he is taking. Meanwhile,Peabody and Emerson who are trying to keep their children safe and still carry out a dig at Giza(that's right Giza) find a statue that most certainly doesn't belong where they found it. Nefret has finished her medical training and is now running a clinic in Cairo for \\"fallen\\" women. The action that ensues will go at a pace that will leave the reader breathless. This book will leave any long time reader very satisfied and waiting for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thunder Overhead","review":"Plots, threads, subplots come together for a delft weaving of HE SHALL THUNDER IN THE SKY by Elizabeth Peters. These are the tumultuous day before WWI and every member of the family has an agenda that they prefer to keep secret from other family members.Intrigue and espionage are the soul of the politics of 1914-15 in Egypt as many factions war for control of the country and its vital seaports, the Emersons are drawn into the foray, but are they all on the same side.Maybe the best of the series as it is much more complex than previous volumes.Nash Black, author of Indie finalists WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and HAINTS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"Elizabeth Peters' series of the Peabody/Emerson archaeology/crime fighting family is well written and excellent in its historical detail. Her talents at writing are exquisite in her portrayal of characters, especially the English and Egyptians as portrayed in this book suffering the stress of World War I Cairo. An added pleasure of reading this book is that many of the questions raised in the previous books of the same series are finally answered. Peters' unique husband and wife team are immortal and unique literary characters, whose stories I always find difficult to put aside even when I have other tasks to undertake. I recommend reading this book and listening to the audio version as well, as narrated by Barbara Rosenblatt. I found using both the visual and literary versions of the novel enhanced my appreciation of the author's choices of vocabulary and her depiction of the vivid settings of WW1 Egypt."},{"rating":"2","title":"An author worth returning to","review":"Amelia Peabody Emerson's spirited feminism, clothed in a genteel package, is both nurturing and beguiling. I kept picturing Helena Bonham Carter, from the film A Room with a View, as Nefret. Ramses is downright sexy, in body and mind. Charismatic characters bring me back to an author again and again. Elizabeth Peters masters this. But then anyone who's studied the Egyptian Pharoahs would know a thing or two about charismatic characters. The author, by the way, is an Egyptologist herself.He Shall Thunder In The Sky is the second of Elizabeth Peters' books that I read. I recommend this series to anyone who's interested in ancient Egypt and likes to read cozies."},{"rating":"1","title":"He Shall Thunder in the Sky Not All it Could Be","review":"I must agree with some of the reviews on this book. Having read all of Elizabeth Peters', Amelia Peabody series, this book is definitely lacking in content and sometimes uninteresting. There is very little in the way of Egyptology going on, and seldon does she refer or even go into detail about the archaeological excavations & sites they set out on in the past. It is vague, but finally in the last 10 pages Ramses & Nefret come together romantically and a shocker is revealed to all about Sethos! Definitely not her best and is lacking the Egyptological descriptions, setting, mystery and adventure I used to read her books for. I am very glad I purchased this one used."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Final Chapter?","review":"Please tell me that this is not the last Amelia Peabody mystery that Elizabeth Peters writes! In \\"He Shall Thunder in the Sky\\" Elizabeth Peters sheds a much darker light on the early Twentieth Century world. Although I liked this book, I was disppointed that there was so much attention paid to the political and social issues and very little (compared to her other books) attention given to the archaeological aspects. Granted, it is set in a turbulent time, but I still would have liked to read more Egyptian history. This book pretty much ties up all of the loose ends in the Amelia Peabody series and there's a surprising twist at the end. (Well, it surprised me, anyways.) Again, I am left wondering how Amelia and Emerson managed to only have ONE child."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love you Elizabeth Peters","review":"Let me just say this, This book would be a great read for anybody. My Aunt introduced me to these books a few years ago and I have been in love with the whole Peabody/Emerson clan ever since. Ms. Peters has managed to create a world where you love the hate the villains and just plain love everybody else.I started to read \\"Thunder in the sky\\" late one night and had finished by 3 nights later. In this books she managed to tie up all the loose ends she left at the end of \\"Falcon at the Portal\\", and she did it quite neatly too. Even if Elizabeth Peters tied up the loose ends in the this book, she still left me wanting more. I hope to see more and soon. Elizabeth you rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"He Shall Thunder in The Sky","review":"I liked the way the way Amelia showed how much she loved Ramses. The plot was well thought out. I was glad to see the Master Criminal again, He was always one of my favorite people. I was sad to see him go. Finally, Ramses and Nefret are together! I was really happy with that turn of events. I wonder if she will be pregnant in the next episode. Food for thought at least. Over all I enjoyed the book and it's worth re-reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"The story is five star; however there should be a note","review":"on the jacket.. indicating this is a fourth book of a series. I was so confused at first, but I hung in and am glad I did. I understand how difficult it is to review a mystery without having a spoiler, but Donald Wayne Mitchell, top 10 reviewer has done so. His review is perfect. I only wish I had read it before starting this story. The characters are incredibly interesting and the social interactions and their faith in each other made me think and appreciate my own. While I didn't understand the machinations relative to Egyptian diggings, seeing the movie \\"Mummy\\" (while in the midst of this book) really helped put everything in perspective and my vivid imagination took off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"He Shall Thunder In the Sky","review":"Elizabeth Peters has done it again- why aren't her books made into movies or at least a TV series! Her new book \\"He Shall Thunder in the Sky\\" takes the reader into the lives of people we have all gotten to know and love. I always feel empty for a few days after I finish reading about Amelia, Emerson, Ramses, Nefret, David and all the others. Once I began reading I couldn't put the book down. I recommend this book to all of Ms. Peters's many fans. I feel this book is one of the best ever! I can't wait for her next book. Please don't make us wait too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is Sethos still alive?","review":"I hope he is. We weren't told that he was definitely dead like Percy. It seems to me that we are left to take it for granted. Emerson would know for sure, as he did about Percy, and he may be under orders again not to mention it. There is plenty of room here for Sethos to return. The lung wound might not have been fatal (Nefret had been commenting on it when help arrived) and he could have passed out from blood loss. Isn't it odd that Emerson would not mention burial arrangements for his brother even though he mentions provisions for Molly and trying to do right by him in the past? It is such a glaring omission. Amelia carries us along with her plans to discuss moving the body back to England at a later date so we just assume he is dead.Sethos might operate more freely if everybody thinks he is gone. Since he was (still is?) an agent for the British, he might get his own series of books.This book did tie up some loose ends but created others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"After waiting in feverish impatience since last June's Falcon, I almost couldn't read Thunder fast enough. Happily, it was worth the wait.Thunder is a complex, wonderfully handled book, masterfully mixing historical events into the story of the Peabody-Emersons. It's a great conclusion to the four-book \\"younger generation\\" arc.I was incredibly impressed with how well Peters used seemingly insignificant clues from earlier books to important effect. She brought many threads together and answered many questions that have been intriguing readers for many books. And she devised a rip-roaring finish.My only quibble is that it could have used more narration from Ramses' point of view. He's Peters' best character, and some scenes cried out for his take on matters, but we had to get it through Amelia's eyes instead.And it was so gratifying to *finally* see those last two words in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Her Best","review":"I love all the Emerson books and they just keep getting better as they progress. Amelia's nemesis is a favorite of mine and he is featured in this book. For fans, I don't need to say more. If you haven't read Peters before, I suggest you start with the first of the series and read them in order since the characters age and change as they go on. Coming into the middle might be confusing.I have come to love all of the characters over the years and I love Egyptology which is what attracted me to the books. What fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amelia Peabody is up-staged","review":"Well, somone has finally done it.....someone has finally up-staged the great Ameila Peabody....and the person who does it....her own son....I was so excited to see that Amelia wasn't the first person to solve this mystery and prevent a war, in fact she does little in this book but provide minor clues and insights. This whole book basicly revolved around Ramses and his efforts on behalf of the war effort. He becomes a spy and out-witts the person who hates him the most. (Can you guess? ) The ending is happy and I must say it is about time that Ramses and Nefret got it together. All my suspicians about thoses two were confirmed and then some in this book. It was a true delight to read...."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed with Lillies","review":"I searched the web for the rain lily and it was advertised as 3 plants.

I especially like that they are of different shapes...circle, square and octagon. I was expecting the finish to be more in keeping with natural walnut wood. The stain is too dark and the varnish, too shiny. But nothing a little steel wool can't correct (the finish). Other than these minor observations, the trivets are a welcomed addition to my kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"could've been better","review":"I thought the killer was a little obvious and the book could've had a little more suspense.

Otis is almost like one of my goofy friends. This was an awesome story.However, there's one thing I feel confused about. The kids in this book are 3rd graders, yet they act like they're so much older than that. Truthfully, I can't see 3rd graders doing what Otis Spofford and Ellen Tebbits and Austin Allen do. Maybe it's just \\"nowadays\\" that 3rd graders are childish. I don't know. Anywho, you'll like this story if you read it, despite the age problems. The way they acted I think Otis should've been at least ten years old. And I've also noticed that Beverly Cleary has written books for children eight years old, for teens fifteen yeasr old, but NOTHING IN BETWEEN!!

It didn't offer me anything new so I skimmed thru the first couple chapters and struggled to finish it, but finally just put it back on the shelf.If you have an interest in the Hollywood studios, I would HIGHLY reccomend \\"The Glamour Factory\\" by Ronald Davis and \\"City of Nets\\" by Otto Friedrich, I found both of these very interesting - another great read is \\"Irving Thalberg: Boy Wonder\\" by Mark Vieira."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Cord","review":"There is nothing wrong with this extension cord.

It's a little premature to release a \\"greatest hits\\" package, and that's basically what this CD is. I really like his song, \\"When You Need My Love,\\" but I've already got it on another CD. If Mr. Worley and his record company really wanted to release his new vanilla-patriotic song, they could have just released a single.

Darryl Worley really sings his heart out on this song. While his 'connect-the-dots' lyrics (Osama+Saddam= 9/11) is suspect, the song is worth listening to. As for the rest of the album, well, it includes some of Worley's best songs. His older hit \\"I Miss My Friend\\" will bring a tear to the eye, while the balladry of \\"POW 369\\" is respectful of a slow-driving war veteran. My favorites are the rollicking \\"Tennessee River Run\\" and \\"Shiloh,\\" a song about the famous battle during the War Between the States which took place near his hometown some 130 years previously. I was impressed with this collection of music from Darryl Worley. He certainly deserves continued attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, I have not","review":"While im proud to live in America, im not proud of 9/11.

What will be next for Darryl a CD blaming Canada? There is nothing patriotic about using lies and falsehoods to push a political agenda, this CD is nothing but a poorly conceived attempt to cash in on post 9/11 patriotism and it does so in the wrong way.

They are gruff and crude and vulgar and everything that stereotypes A MAN.

It is just a blast and it doesn't take serious skills to complete but isn't super easy that it can be beaten in under a days worth of playing. Honestly if you haven't picked this one up do so, you won't regret it and if you are buying for someone younger, it is safe and has nothing a child shouldn't see.

Highly recommended!! Each is slightly different but all were easy to learn (each skill is introduced gradually) and great fun to play. (My only complaint in Sly 3 is the \\"% done\\" calculator . . .

While it was not a difficult game, it offered a lot of fun and challenge in the form of lengthy platforming levels. In that game, you could spend several minutes smoothly running through the levels jumping, swinging and shimmying among the obstacles. In Sly 2, this model was thrown away for a more GTA-inspired mission-based model. Missions had less platforming and were often short and just plain boring. In Sly 3, all that was good about Sly is gone. The missions are very short and often pointless. There is very little good platforming. The only positive parts of the game are the art, humor and story. If you are looking for a fun platforming experience, give this one a pass and pick up one of the Ratchet games or Psychonauts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome & Great!","review":"It's sooooo good!But its also kinda hard.But I dont care because hard is my thing!I'm a Sly Cooper fan and I really hope there is a Sly 4!So Please take my advice and Try out this really awesome game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Without doubt the best album by Molly Hatchet","review":"In my opinion, Molly Hatchet have been a second grade southern rock band way behind Lynyrd Skynyrd as well as Blackfoot. But with the release of 1984's \\"The deed is done\\", Molly Hatchet got their act together and gave us an album full of groovy melodic rock of high quality. Some fans think this album is too light, too commercialized, too popish (the even used some keyboards) but the fact is that Molly Hatchet have never sounded as good as they do on \\"The deed is done\\", and the album sure rocks. Just listen to the opening riff of \\"Satisfied man\\" which kinda sets the tone for what to come. With songs like \\"Good smoke and whiskey\\" with its slight resemblance to ZZ Top, the catchy semi ballad \\"Stone in your heart\\", the very Lynyrd Skynyrd sounding \\"Heartbreak radio\\" and the in-your-face \\"Man on the run\\" this is without doubt the best release from Molly Hatchet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgraceful!!","review":"This album is a COMPLETE DISGRACE to the Molly Hatchet name. I can see that they were trying to go \\"pop\\". I mean synthezisers? Synths are fine for Rush, Pink Floyd, Foreigner, and even Lep Zeppelin, but not Molly Hatchet. There's only one decent song and that's \\"Straight Shooter\\". The rest sounds very cheesy, I mean very cheesy!! You know what the music reminded me of? The kind of music that they play at the end of a bad B-movie when they are showing the credits. No joking!

Unlike my home towels, it stays in place and lets me focus on my positions and the opportunity to relax, which has made my yoga classes much more enjoyable.

I did end up ordering more yoga towels in the tie die color because the white color shows every mark. I do slip on the towel a bit, however, it does give you much more security than no towel at all. This may be due to the mat I have underneath, which is a biodegradable mat with jute interwoven. During my practice I find that I must smooth out the towel because it bunches up, but obviously, this is not a deal breaker since as you see I've given this 4 stars.

I even brought a mister to make it a little damp (as reviewers recommended), but I was still slipping. And then when transitiong from one pose to another, it can bunch up and leave you with something else to do - horse around with your towel - while everyone else has taken the new pose. In the middle of an hour and half session I chucked it and relied just on my Jade mat and an occasional wipe of the hands. Also, I was surprised to see so many 5 star reviews for a product that, as indicated on its own \\"care tag,\\" bleeds in the wash AND says it can stain your dryer (which is why I ordered white.) This could be a disaster for those who don't pay attention to care tags. Other than some dark denim, which I wash separately with Woolite dark wash, I don't have any washables that pose such a danger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I am a beginner at yoga.

Could have found locally for less money, but cant beat home delivery"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very absorbant. Minor slippage.","review":"This yoga towel is very absorbant! I love using it for Pilates as well as for stretching and strengthening exercises after a good kickbox cardio session. The sticky nubs at the bottom keeps this towel from sliding around on top of an exercise mat although I still find myself slipping while holding certain yoga poses such as Warrior II and Downward Dog on the towel itself. I will try flipping the mat upside down and see how it works the next time around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact, foldable, absorbs sweat but you slide on it","review":"I have had no problems with the colors running in the wash. I do wash the mat by itself. Mat sticks to any surface using rubber nubs, but you slip around on top when doing down dog or other poses that need friction. It does not hold your poses like a traditional mat. If you need a compact foldable mat for ashtanga yoga and you have the strength to hold your poses and not rely on the mat to provide friction then this mat will do you right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really like the skidless towel","review":"This product is very good. It is very helpful for the classes where the heat is up and your hands and feet slip on a plain mat. The towel really grips in and helps you hold the poses and feel more steady. The instructions say you can use the towel dry but I find that the I get the best slip-prevention when the towel is damp...especially at each end of the towel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it says","review":"It's colorful and fun. Washed it by itself a couple times at first to keep the color from bleeding as suggested by other reviews. The towel is a little slick dry, so I spray it down with a little bit before I start my workouts so that my hands stick to it. The sweat that develops during the workout takes over later. It doesn't skid all over my mat. Like this product alot."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm slipping and sliding.","review":"I read many reviews on this product and seen it in use by many fellow yogis in my classes. I bought one enthusiastically. I'm quite disappointed actually. I slip and slid on it A LOT. It is better just to use my mat straight. The silicone side doesn't slip but my hands and feet slip on the towel surface. I pour water on it to increase traction and it does help. It is hard because I don't want my entire towel wet just where I put my hands and feet and often times I don't have a large enough area. Also - I've heard washing it increases its traction so I haven't had many cycles of washes yet. I may alter my review in the future if washing it does seem to help. Otherwise - it doesn't work for me :-<"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mat","review":"The bottom of the mat is covered in little rubber dots just like the ones on nonslip gloves. I have only washed it a few times and so far none of the dots have fallen off in the wash. There are so many though that even if some fell off there would be enough to keep the mat still.

The first time I used this towel was like heaven- All of my slipping prayers have been answered! The downside- It seems (and I follow all of the care instructions) that now that I have washed 10 or so times, my hands slip around a bit on the top of the towel. I will still say, however, that this is by far the best solution- Just take good care of it, and DONT use fabric softener. I have the green, and it's a light beautiful color. I absolutely love this towel, and DO NOT regret spending so much money on it.

After reading the cleaning instructions carefully to avoid the bleeding of colors onto other clothes, I washed it separately. Unfortunately, my first washing caused the edging/stitching to become unraveled. Just a bummer for a $45 product. I have yet to fix it or use it because once it's used, it needs washing and will continue to fall apart. Returning defective products purchased on the internet is loathsome. I had better get out my sewing machine and start stitching...if only I had the proper type of thread. Ughh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my Mat","review":"Perfect to place on top of your sticky mat.

The rug lies flat and stays flat, and costs $15 less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great towel!","review":"This is a great yoga towel!

We sweat a lot, so having a towel is necessary to prevent slipping on a sweaty mat. This towel is good because it covers the whole mat perfectly and doesn't slip too much.

It slipped all over the place. I almost fell down when doing standing asanas. Then I tried it on a concrete floor. Again, it did not stick as I hoped it would. It might stick on a 'sticky' mat but I don't have one of these to try it on. In general, I found it too 'scrunchy' when moving from one side to the other in such standing poses as triangle, warrior, etc. I did not return it (and gave it two stars) only because I decided to use it for more static type poses such as practicing moving from plank to chaturanga back to plank or from down dog to cobra back to down dog.

One time I hadent washed it and had to use a regular beach towel, I was so annoyed the towel crumbled up with every movement, I kept sliding and tripping over it.This skinless towel is pricey but I'm telling you it is worth it. Having the right mat too is important because the little skilled bubbles on the bottom of this towel have to have something good and squishy to hold on to and grab. So make sure you get a good yoga mat too!Love love love. Buying another one soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for those sweaty hands and feet!","review":"I mainly use this towel only for my hot yoga classes and it hasn't disappointed me at all! I use it with the Lululemon align mat (which causes me to slide a lot) and it sticks on really well, and especially well once you start sweating. I haven't noticed really any bleeding with the one I got (springburst) but it might be because I put it in the wash with all my dark clothes. I usually just air-dry the towel after the wash, and it dries pretty quickly. It is a little bit on the pricey end but I think it's worth investing in a piece that you will use if you practice hot/bikram yoga regularly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but why so expensive?","review":"These are great and I use them every time I practice, but... why are they so expensive??Microfiber is not that expensive a material.

I wash them separately from other items in cold water & there is no bleeding. The nubs go down & since there is no jumping around in bikram the issue of slidding/slipping doesn't occur. Towards the end of class the mat bunches up a few times at the corners. However, the chance to fix it buys me time to get in the posture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love. This towel saves my life every yoga class.","review":"I sweat a lot when I exercise. Especially while playing basketball and doing power/vinyasa yoga.Anyone who has tried to plant their hands on a wet yoga mat knows that either it doesn't stay planted for very long or your attention is distracted because you are focusing on your hands and not your pose.These mat towels actually give you MORE traction as they get wet. In fact, a lot of users will wet the mat towel before class with water at the four corners (more of a back line and two front corners, for down dog).As much as it helps for actual grip, the mat towel also just frees my mind to be absorbed in the lesson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied with towel","review":"After slipping on my mat in yoga class I decided to purchase a towel.

A must have for any yoga practitioner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great towel for warm yoga classes","review":"I ordered the Yogitoes Skidless Premium Mat-Size Yoga Towel after I saw other students using them in my warm yoga class. Without the towel, my mat got slippery once I began to sweat. It is much easier (and probably safer) with the towel.Here are a couple of helpful tips on the towels: First, wash the towel BY ITSELF several times because the color bleeds. One downside is that as I have used and washed the towel several times, the color has started to fade.Second, spray the ends of the towel before class begins (in the places where your hands and feet would go in Downward Facing Dog). When the towel is dry, it is too slippery to hold poses. If you get a spray bottle and wet it slightly, it helps you to keep your traction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well for me at yoga class","review":"I go to yoga classes often and I hate carrying my mat around, b/c it is awkward to carry.

However, at $50 (!!!) it really isn't worth it. I bought one because I thought it HAD to be amazing, since so many people have bought it and it has so many good reviews.

I went with the towel after reading the reviews here. As other reviewers have noted, the non-nubby side of the towel is quite slippery. The cloth is much smoother than a standard terrycloth towel and there's just no texture to \\"grip\\".The towel itself sticks to my mat beautifully, but my hands and feet were sliding all over the smooth side of the towel. I took another reviewer's advice and dampened the towel before my next class. That definitely helped. I haven't tried using it with the nubby side up, maybe that makes a difference. Overall, I'm happy with it, but this towel would be greatly improved with more texture on both sides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome absorbency!","review":"Great quality and absorbs sweat amazingly during my hot yoga practise!

Ten minutes into my class the entire towel was completely saturated and at the end of the class when I rolled the towel up with my mat, a steady stream of water poured out of my roll. IMHO this is intended mostly for hatha or people who barely sweat and I am disappointed they try and market this as a HIGH ABSORBENT yoga towel. Not true.

Then I wash it in cold water and hang it to dry. It only takes a couple hours to dry when hanging.

The round screen printed dot on the front eventually wore off but the old adhesive marking is still there in case you need a floor spot to focus on. No bleeding (except for the first two or three washes) and it has not faded the least. I've done both Bikram and Ashtanga and it's kept my mat dry and kept me from slipping. Do be aware that your grip may feel a little less assured after an hour in the class if your palms get moist. Just push those five fingers into the floor a little harder and work out the hands.

I always was annoyed with my general towel on mat action when I was in hot vinyasa classes and I would start to slip when in a warrior pose or something, but this towel helps with all that nonsense.Plus, it folds up nice, which saves space in my gym bag. I hand washed it twice with soap and quite a few plain water rinses to get the color to bleed out as much as possible, since I have the teal colored one. I would recommend doing the same or using vinegar in the washing machine like others have suggested. Also, do not put in the dryer, always air dry.

The towels do not bleed either like another reviewer said before me. All you have to do is wash it with your other yogitoes in cold water and do not dry it and you're good to go. It helps before you practice to put some water on it. Wetness (such as sweat) activates it but right when you start practicing you won't be sweating right away so it's a good idea to put some water by where your hands will go to get it going. THE ONLY THING I do not like about yogitoes is that it sometimes doesn't stick as well as it should to the yoga mat and I have to keep straightening/fixing it during my practice. That's a bit annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good solution for me","review":"I would agree with other reviewers that if your skin is dry, you will slip, possibly more than on a regular mat. However, for me, that really doesn't happen for more than a minute, so I've been very satisfied.

With a little dampening at the ends, my feet and hands stay put during Bikram.

Both our mats get pretty slippery during a yoga session, so we needed a product like this. It's a little smaller than I expected, but it keeps us from slipping. I wanted one that was a little less \\"loud\\", so I went with black. The black mat is very low key and the emblem is small. My girlfriend got purple and she uses it daily. If you're slipping on your mat, this product is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for hot yoga!","review":"I bought this to go over my mat that was very slippery - this works great. As in previous comments, you do need to wet the towel a bit at the beginning - just in places where your hands and feet are because you will still slide a bit. If you don't do this, your hands and feet will slide initially. Towards the middle to end of class, you aren't slipping at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"add chicken wire for koi","review":"These lilies come in a plastic bag with good instructions for planting.Be sure, though, if you've got koi, to place them in a separate area where they can fully develop.

Unfortunately, this water was about 115 degrees, maybe more..sitting in the back of the UPS truck at 150 degrees, didn't do these plants any good whatsoever. I called Amazon and they were more than gracious about replacing them. They replaced them the next week, and it was the same temperature and I received the next batch exactly the same way, Even with over night delivery. So really this order didn't work out for me.

Now that they have been washed, they are starting to gather where the band is. The only reason I bought these towels is because I had an amazon gift card. So unless you have free money like that, I would suggest just going to Bed Bath and Beyond or Target. You will definatly get a much better towel there.

This is basically just a scattershot series of sketches centering around its three main characters, and only a handful of them really stick. As one might guess, De Niro's scenes are definitely the most memorable, particularly a funny scene involving his attempt at an erotic photo shoot with a girl. The rest of the scenes just meander without producing very many laughs. Plus, the subject matter and style feel very dated, and not in a good way. Also, the amateurish quality makes it pretty clear that De Palma hadn't quite found his feet by this point yet. The follow-upHi, Mom!is absolutely worth checking out though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny DePalma Film","review":"This early effort by director Brian DePalma is a funny series of vignettes that touches on the various social issues of the late sixties. These issues include the Vietnam War, the Kennedy assassination, computer dating, voyeurism,etc. This is definitely a low-budget affair and the film has some ragged edges but it is done with such verve that you choose to ignore it and go with the flow. The selling point is a featured role for a young Robert DeNiro and he is fine but this is more of an ensemble affair.

The trip takes Franois's family and his friends to the island of Sanguinaires off the French coast in the Mediterranean Sea. The arrival to the island is a rough start as the caretaker is late, which serves as a negative omen for the film as it unfolds.

There are far too many pictures of the same people/families, with a clear favoring of the Ellender family. At times I felt like this was just an Ellender family album.

I don't always agree with his interpretation of the story, but (as has most Biblical fiction) the book has made me anxious to open my Bible and read its account of Sarah, digesting every word like precious wine (excepting that I don't actually like wine, but you get the picture). My favorite part of the book was his interpretations of Lot's wife and Hagar, the handmaid who bore Ishmael. If those women truly were how they are portrayed in this novel, then it would explain a lot about why their lives turned out how they did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting","review":"I found this story very interesting and spell binding. I felt I was there with Sarah and Abram and there were made very personal to me! Alot of this may be fiction but seemed to carry me back to those times and forced me to go top my bible and read it! I am looking forward to his next books of Rebekah and Rachel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The American Sarah?","review":"I have to agree with the previous reviewer who found this novel lacking in cultural depth. The story was okay--if you like OSC's other stuff, you'll probably like the storytelling well enough--but I found myself annoyed throughout the book by the fact that the characters were not Middle Eastern, but American. Card, while ostensibly setting his tale in the Middle East of several thousand years ago, made no attempt to craft characters whose motivations and personalities might have been shaped by that place and time and culture. They all acted, to my mind, like 20th Century Americans, thus rendering the whole story unbelievable and silly to me. While I'm not a huge OSC fan in general, I prefer his sci-fi stuff, where he makes up the place and time and culture and then crafts characters to fit those circumstances. It's more believable to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Exactly The Bible Story","review":"Orson Scott Card, who usually writes science fiction, turns his hand here to the story of Sarah, from Genesis. He begins with a spunky ten-year old \\"Sarai\\" and her bratty sister \\"Qira\\" who will later turn out, interestingly, to be Mrs. Lot. Card takes a number of liberties with the biblical story, but he has done prodigious research, and is able to make those almost prehistoric times, customs and peoples believable. I enjoyed the book and recommend it, but it has some limitations. The characters are one-dimensional and they never seem to grow or change. I was disappointed in the portrayal of Abraham's relationship to God--it was unique and unheard of for his time, not just another religious guy. Still and all, the book was most enjoyable and easy to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Card - Excellent","review":"Card doesn't usually have to try very hard to win my praise. Aside from \\"Lost Boys\\" which was awful, I think I have enjoyed every book Orson Scott Card has written. I was a bit hesitant to read some of these more recent books, \\"Stone Tables\\" for instance, because I'm not particularly religious minded, however these books are extremely enjoyable as simpe fiction. Card has always been good at blending history and fiction (\\"Pastwatch\\" was a triumph) and he does just as well with the biblical stories. I am very much looking forward to the other books in the series, and - truthfully - for any further books from an author who excells with historical fiction, fantasy, and science fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you think you know O. S. Card, you are in for a surprise!","review":"If you think that Card is just a science-fiction or fantasy writer, this book will set you straight. He takes the story of Sarah, wife of Abraham, and give it fictional, but balanced treatment; that is, all the heroes and heroines are still heroes and heroines, and miracles do happen. But, Card is no Biblical Literalist; he assumes that stories can be garbled or told twice (for example, it is only once, in this book, that Abraham claims that Sarah is his sister.)It is like reading Genesis with new eyes; as if an old dirty picture had been cleaned, and you see details you never saw before. Give it a try, and prepare to be delighted. This is Card's best, up to now."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book!","review":"I was familiar with the Abraham/Sarah story from long ago, but the depth that Mr. Card gives to these characters in this novel truly brings them to life in the mind's eye. Abraham is shown by his faith in God and how it never wavers. Sarah, with all the insecurity of being new to Abraham's faith, often wonders if she made the right decisions or if she is being punished for disobeying her father's wishes. Sarah's relationships with her sister and Hagar show how outward appearances often mask what is really going on. Hagar seemed to be Sarah's friend, but that masked the true feelings of hatred because of the master/slave relationship.I would recommend this book to anyone, and can't wait until I can get my hands on \\"Rebekah.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorites!","review":"Excellent combination of historical fact and fiction. Card has a vivid imagination that allows readers to go back in time and feel as if they were a part of Biblical history. Just be careful to remember that truth and fiction are craftfully interwined here and not to lose sight of the important messages behind the story.As one of my all time favorite books, I had to read Rebekah and Stone Tablets immediately thereafter.

I wonder whether she could do a bit of better acting, or the films she has made are consistently mediocre. Still waiting. Don't get me wrong, she is, as usual, impressibly beautiful. James Hong is the \\"inscrutable\\" Chinese! My, my, the director, Lang, should know better. A better cinematography could have made this film more palatable.

We have many historical accounts of bravery and agression on the battlefield and while those accounts can stir the blood in positive ways, nothing has moved me more than Rolph's reports of merciful bravery in My Brother's Keeper.

Definately a must read and a \\"Keeper\\" for my library."},{"rating":"2","title":"A moving description of another side of war","review":"Rolph's description of acts of mercy across enemy lines is truly moving and beautiful.

He replaced the batteries, fanagled it a bit, but it is still not transmitting to the indoor unit. The atomic clock works and the indoor thermometer works, but it doesn't tell us the outdoor temp anymore. What a HUGE disappointment!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"short lived junk","review":"The outdoor unit consistently reads .3-1 degree higher than the indoor, even when they're standing next to each other.My unit's outdoor sensor stopped transmitting less than 24 hours after I turned it on and it hasn't worked since. I live in northeast Texas--hardly an extreme climate.It's been a week and the atomic clock still hasn't successfully connected once--not even when I stand in the front yard to get a clear signal.Also, the backlight/snooze button whines like a dying mosquito for a few seconds when activated.Besides those things, the alarm seems to work fine and the temperature measured is fairly accurate and consistent. The ice alarm is a neat idea: you can set it to wake you up early if the temperature is below freezing. I just don't have much use for it, living in Texas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weather Station","review":"I bought one of these for myself and gave others as gifts. Works great no problems.

I bought it in defiance of some of the negative reviews it has received.After having used it for a couple/several months now, my report is: It started off fine. But after about a month, the indoor display unit lost contact with the outdoor sensor unit. Translation: Indoor temp displayed; Outdoor temp blank.So I followed the manual instructions and got the two units to reconnect. 10 days or so pass. Same deal. Then another week... Same deal.Am I going to have to manually reconnect these two units every two weeks for the life of the product? -- being, I would think, at least several years? The two units are only separated by about 25 feet. That doesn't seem reasonable, to me.It's too bad. So many other things are right about this product. But one of its core functions seems to be intermittent.I would send it back for a refund, but it's not worth the bother. I suggest you save yourself the expense and the bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"V.Pres.","review":"Quality unit.

Unfortunately it goes off at 32 degrees, I cannot change that. So , I was goign to send it back but after realizing I paid $6.00 shipping to receive it, would have to pay shipping to send it back and then the company charges a 15% restocking fee, well, it wasn't worth it.

So the caffeine if anybody is worried about that is not really that much. The FDA recommends a person consume no more than 300mg of caffeine in a day. I don't drink coffee (Yuk) and I don't drink soda so I don't have to worry about that. I wouldn't have more than two of these a day though. Each can contains 160mg of caffeine.

We meet a number of people, and get to \\"know\\" them a bit as they go through the day.....and some, we never know (e.g., the group of men who walk into town). This is a film to be savored, again and again, for the outstanding cinematography and sense of place and time. Little touches such as the inexorable movement of the sun that causes a group of men to move their chairs closer to a shading wall, and again closer, are truly remarkable.

TBOE has now been handed down to my 16 month old who loves the tape. This is a great tape to pop in the VCR while you are trying to get stuff done around the house and it's a good one to sing and dance to with your kids. The 30 minute time limit is perfect because it gives you time to have a few minutes to yourself and it won't keep your child a prisoner of the television. Of course you may find yourself watching the tape aling with your child singing la-la-la-la, Elmo's Song!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated and anoying","review":"This is obviously an old VHS transfered to DVD. It has none of the Elmo's World format, the talking directly to your child that kids find so engaging, or the wonderful Mr Noodle. Rather it is uninteresting story staring Elmo built to tie together a few very old musical numbers. For example, Elmo's rap number is just lame, like old-school in a bad way. And the sound quality throughout is pretty fuzzy. My kid was bored, and usually any Elmo makes her squeal with delight. I consider this purchase a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry -- no thumbs up on this one, Elmo!","review":"We have nearly one dozen ELMO DVD's for our toddlers; this is their Least favorite and by far my worst as well.

The Noodle Brothers are a real favorite and they don't even make an appearance in this one!

She absolutely loves it! Then, I bought it on DVD.What a mistake. The audio transfer is horrible--it's terribly distorted from start to finish. Even my tin-eared aunt said, \\"What's wrong with the sound?\\" I tried calling the toll-free number they have listed on the DVD packaging to see if they know anything about this. The ... person I spoke with said that my inquiry was a \\"technical question\\" and had nothing to do with a defective disk. I was shuffled off to another phone number that ultimately was a dead end.Evidently, quality control isn't much of an issue to Sony and Sesame Street, and it certainly takes a back seat to profit. So while the material on this video is great for toddlers and Elmo fans, stick with the VHS version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Terrible Audio","review":"I have to agree with the previous reviewer.

You'll find yourself singing these songs to yourself at work, while doing housework, anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripped Off","review":"We purchased this DVD for our 2-year-old daughter this year (2010) because she had a Best of Elmo DVD dated 1994 that was handed down to her that she absolutey loved. So silly us for thinking this was a \\"Best of\\" DVD SINCE 1994. NOT THE CASE. It's the exact same DVD, just repackaged with a new cover and redated 2010. There is absolutly nothing updated about this, and we feel completely ripped off and deceived by Sesame Street. And, we can't return it for a refund because we opened it. Adding to the frustration, the DVD case itself mentions 1994 and 2001 reproduction ONLY under a convenient copyright label that is not easily removed (I only removed it searching for some indication of how old this DVD really is). So beware to any parents who have accepted older hand-me-down DVD's...anything Sesame Street you purchase might already be in your arsenal of DVD's, just in different packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"best of elmo","review":"My 20 month old granddaughter loves this DVD.

At 18 months, she can point to every body part requested from her. She knows the number two follows one. Six follows five and so on.

Kids don't care and I don't think this video earns the \\"best of\\" title. Also, the copy I received freezes up and unfortunately I didn't sit down and make sure it worked before I threw the shipping info away and 6 weeks had passed before my grandson watched it. For under $10 not worth the hassle of returning, but you usually get this quality at the swapmeet for $5, not from Amazon. All in all a disappointing purchase. Wiggles is WAAAAAY better....more singing and action, less talk."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cant be Elmo at his best!","review":"Seeing the reviews on this site, I excitedly went out and purchased the Elmo DVD for my 2 year old daughter. First of all, what a disappointment! This DVD does not deserve the title of the Best of Elmo. Secondly, there are only a handful of songs (3 are cute/noteworthy, the others are not great). The DVD is only 30 minutes long and maybe 5 minutes of that is talking/storyline. Of the talking parts, 2 of the segments are totally uneducational and pointless (Whoopi and Julia). So I would say that only 10 minutes of this DVD is actually enjoyable. Despite this, I'm giving it 2 stars because my daughter actually sat through it, although because its only a half hour in length she makes me repeat it 3-4 times each time she watches it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheers to Kevin Clash and the SS Gang...","review":"Just a fantastic arrangement of skits.

The \\"Bed & Pillow\\" skit is just the best. Also, the \\"Getting Dressed\\" bit is hilarious.

It has catchy songs, a good selection of other characters, and (most importantly) it keeps my two-year-old son engaged. There aren't any \\"Elmo's World\\" segments, which is kind of a good thing. There are several Elmo's World DVDs out there to choose from, so this one is kind of unique.The story line is that Elmo is trying to decide which of his drawings he should put in the monster art show, and as he shows them to his friends to get advice, he winds up giving them all away.

The story line is cute with Elmo needing help picking a drawing for the Monster Art Show. He keeps giving his drawings away, and ends up without a drawing for the show. Teaches a good sharing lesson. Very cute cameos by Julia Roberts and Whoopi Goldberg. My daughter's favorites are \\"One Fine Face\\" with Ernie and Elmo (also my favorite), and Elmo's tap dancing song. All of the songs are pretty cute. My husband even likes this DVD because of the honker at the end (especially when Elmo says, \\"Honker, pull yourself together!\\"). Definitely worth ordering.

My daugther cried a lot because she could not watch the movie she wanted.After we came back and called for the warranty, we recivied a big surprise THE PRODUCT JUST HAVE 90 DAYS OF WARRANTY, so they could not respond us.

It actually stopped working after playing only 6 DVD's. It was still under warranty so I sent it back to Coby -- I had to pay postage to get it back to Coby and send a Money Order for $18.50 so they could either send the repaired unit or a replacement back. It took 8 weeks before it was sent back and then Coby sent me a new one, but a different model -- the TF-DVD7307 -- not even a tablet-style player. At that point I decided to keep the \\"wrong\\" unit they sent me because it would just mean more postage to send it back and then more to get the correct one sent to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece Of Junk","review":"I bought this player to use when traveling.I only used it a couple of times and the player died right after it went out of warranty.I will buy a name brand next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"NIce while it lasted","review":"As I have gone back and read more reviews, I realized I should have read more of the negative reviews instead of just one or two from each good and bad, then saw there were more good reviews so decided to give it a shot since the price was right at the time.I bought this pretty much for my husband to take on his Navy Deployments. I am glad we tested it out before he actually had to leave. Like many others our unit lasted barely 6 months. I chucked it up as a loss since hubby got a laptop. But We used in the car a few times to entertain our little one and hooked to the TV. After awhile the screen turned out and the remote quit working. Which was fine at that point I just decided to leave it hooked to my bedroom TV. Well after a little while of that the discs quit spinning at all! No error messages, no picture, no producing sound, the remote and player buttons no longer worked.So I say wait an extra payday or 2 and save the money for a better unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but doesn't last","review":"My 3 year old son received this as a gift for Christmas last year. I loved all the features, great sound, great picture, nice for trips to visit family two states away. The only thing I didn't like is that I had to take the player out of the case to change the disc. Would have been nice to have some way of rigging it so I didn't have to completely take it apart. Unfortunately, it only lasted about 6 months. Brand new DVDs started reporting \\"Wrong disc\\" after playing for only a few minutes. Now it constantly freezes up, or reads \\"Wrong disc\\" and won't play at all. Maybe it's just too sensitive and needs to spend all it's time indoors...not out on the highway? I will not buy Coby again after this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coby TF-DVD7050 7\\" TFT Portable Tablet-Style Portable DVD Player","review":"This is the worst product I have purchased ...ever.

Don't be fooled by the low price. You won't get what you paid for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was good when it lasted","review":"I had this product for a few months before it started giving me the wrong disc error. It lasted me a few car trips as well as a trip across the united states and back via flying. Everything was going well until I left it sitting on my couch because I was watching it while I was sick. I think the unit heated up too much (as it does frequently, even if just sitting on a table) and something must have fried inside. I haven't been able to fix it at all and will definitely not be getting the same one. My opinion is that you invest $30 more and get something that will actually last you longer rather than taking a gamble with this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good Coby - wrong disk error","review":"This is our second Coby Portable Tablet DVD player. We chose Coby again because, 3 years later, the first player still works great. This one only lasted 89 days (being used 5 or 6 times) and then froze up with a \\"wrong disk\\" error. We tried everything to no avail. Coby's warranty is 90 days for this item and I have to foot the bill to return it to them and then shipping again for a new unit.

After about one year, it doesn't work at all. We didn't even use it that much! We only took it out for longer trips.

Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technical Problems","review":"The first one I got didn't start at all, and the replacement had a pixel error ... however, the design is great"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for traveling with kids","review":"We needed a portable DVD player for a cross-country trip with the kids. After some research we chose this Coby model. The picture is incredible for a little unit that is pretty inexpensive. Some reviews we read warned about the screen scratching easily, so we used a soft storage bag. Battery life is OK, gets you half way across the US, but if you have a layover, make sure you know where to look for outlets in the airports and you have time for the unit to charge, as it does not charge that quickly. Another great thing about the unit is that it comes with just about everything you need - except a good storage bag. So you're set in the car and at home. It also does come with headphones and there are 2 jacks. Note that once you plug in a headphone this cancels out external audio. It seems to be well built and does not weigh much. If you're not an A/V snob or have kids, highly recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"not even one star... read on.","review":"This DVD player as really big problem or should I call it defect. Let me explain:For all the great reviews all the plus accessories all the hype this DVD as been getting, for all that it can get any worse that to have a DVD player that scratches the DVDs, after a day of viewing a movie it left a ring on the outer surface of the DVD, yes!! A well-rounded symmetrical ring. I returned it to Amazon and replace it and the second unit did the exact same thing. What's next you guess it... Refund.So for all of you who have purchase this Coby DVD player look very closely at the DVD you are playing and look very closely again before you put it back you might be surprise, although not pleasantly with what you find."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTAL junk","review":"This product is a TOTAL junk. I purchased and had to return it the next day because the screen did not show any image. I made the mistake to change it for the same item. The replacement worked for a couple of months and then it is not reading DVDs....because Amazon is only responsible for 30 days now I have to waste my time and money calling the manufacturer...DO NOT buy this please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute rubbish","review":"As is the case with so many, we wanted to save money on a portable unit for the kids to watch while on extended road trips. I guess we've used it maybe ten times in about two years. Now all we get is a blue screen although the disk plays sound. Are we being too demanding to expect a DVD player to last longer? I've read other reviews where folks got zero help from the manufacturer so we'll not waste our time. This item is just typical of the modern manufacturing mentality of \\"planned obsolescence\\" where products are made only good enough to just barely slip through the warranted period and then fall apart, leaving the purchaser no choice but to buy another unit that won't last any longer... ad nauseam... ad infinitum. Save whatever you might have spent on this crappy Coby DVD player and buy books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like the idea but the item was cheap","review":"I had the wrong disc error that many people had.

Well, the first one played with out a problem, then the next one started the errors. I had read this was possible and had other items to entertain the kids so it was no big deal. Really wish this one had worked because the batery powered player at this low cost would be great even if it only lasted a year...

I bought it for the car mostly for my three year olds entertainment.Like the look overall. Seems durable. Nice picture. Came with everything you need.The only downfall I can see is that if your using it for your car, the bag it comes with wasn't designed very well. You have to take the whole player out of the tight fitting bag in order to change the DVD. Kind of a pain, if you ask me. Make sure you put in a long running movie so you won't have to keep changing it.Not sure if I would purchase another one, just for the fact that I wanted it specifically for the car.Next time I might look for one that has a better bag design or buy a side loading DVD player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coby TF-DVD7050 7\\" TFT Portable Tablet-Style DVD Player","review":"I like the tablet style is neat it's a cool looking portable dvd player but i had nothing but problems with it from the get go, it would flicker, just shut off for no reason ( yes, the battery was charged), it would also fowl up when you played an audio cd as well.poor quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible - Do not buy","review":"We purchased this for my baby several months ago. I knew it was going to be troublesome from the start when a DVD that I had no prior issues with started skipping repeatedly on this player. Changed DVD's and that one started skipping, too. I really wanted one that could mount to the headrest since my son was rear facing, so, I just put up with it for the last several months on long car trips. He's just one, so it wasn't a big deal that the DVD would randomly start over or that it made a grinding noise at times that sounded like it might blow up at any minute. Of course, this would be an issue for an older child or adult trying to watch a movie. Now, however, the stupid thing won't charge. There is a short in it, I guess, so it is now useless. I'd read several good reviews, and a few bad ones. Upon coming back to leave this review, I couldn't help but notice that the last several reviews are negative. I guess it once was a good product, but it certainly isn't any longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Quality","review":"The Coby TF-DVD7050 stopped working after one use [which was it's trial run!].

It worked well until the color went out. I called COBY and they said that the screen went out and that they only cover it for 90 days. Since it had been more than 90 days they would not fix it even at my own cost. What a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"As did most everyone, we bought two of these to keep our kids entertained on long car trips.They worked perfectly and without fail for the first trip. I agree that the headrest mounting bag that comes with it covers some important knobs and inhibits operation. Has to be removed to adjust almost anything other than volume.About midway through the second trip one of the players started gliching (like it was overheating or something), would just go black on screen and stop in the middle of a disc regularly. That irritated the kids more than if it hadn't fired up to start with. The second one started doing the same thing just before the end of trip 2. We tried to take them on trip 3 and they wouldn't last more than 5-10 minutes at a time. All this and they were about 2 weeks past the replacement plan date. They are in the garbage dump if you really want one.Thumbs down Coby!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Coby is very bad quality","review":"I own it only half year and play about 20 times. then it's totally not working.

My grandson loves it! It keeps him happy while he's strapped into the child seat, which is very boring little guys who don't like to be restrained.I read all the reviews and I knew that people have had problems with this unit. But that was true of most of the other units out there, too. The dual units are connected by a small wire and break down often as well, but when they do, you have to send them both in for repair. Since this one had the price and features I wanted, I can buy two for the price of a dual screen. If one breaks (which has now happened after 3 months), I still have the other one to use while the first is being repaired.Bottom Line: buy the two year warranty! Nothing is made to last these days, and the cost of the warranty is CHEAP compared to replacement!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Started out ok, then both units became complete junk!","review":"We bought this and initially loved it. Then a few months passed and we discovered what a piece of junk it was. Sure it comes with a lot of great stuff and it's well priced, but you get what you pay for with this player. We bought the replacement plan and I guess it's good we did because after a few months when the first one wouldn't play anymore, we sent it back and received another one. This one pooped out in a different way, but led to the same result--no longer usable. We had to pay for the shipping to send in the player and we had to re-buy the player from amazon and then be reimbursed. So I suppose we got our moneys worth (?), but now a year or so later and $100 plus the warranty later, we are back where we started--no portable DVD player. Buy at your own risk and don't trust a review from someone who has had it a couple of days. We'll definitely be buying something different this time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Defective Units!","review":"I wonder if these players were good in 2005, but now they're just plain old and don't work anymore.

Then we got the dreaded \\"Invalid disk\\" error and the battery was getting HOT, burning HOT. It was replaced under warranty with no issues. The new one arrived in May 2006. As of Feb 2007 it was having problems with the connection on the unit for the power cord, both car and home. And you can fry eggs on the battery with this one, too. Now it will not charge and warranty is over with. Between two brand new in box units, they have managed to last a whole 14 months.

Warranty coverage is close to useless.Within warranty period: it takes 4-6 weeks, plus you have to send money order for USD$12 in addition to paying for sending it back. If you add what it costs to get the item serviced under warranty (~USD@20) it is 20% or so what you paid for it. That seems pretty high not to mention you have to wait a long time.Overall, it worked fine for 40days, then even though it is \\"covered\\" by warranty, it is too expensive to get it serviced. It is now garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the low price","review":"Purchased this unit from Amazon just prior to Christmas. It crapped out end of March (just after the 90 warranty, of course). Now fails to recognize any DVDs.Coby support has been wholly unsympathetic. They indicated they used to make exceptions to the 90 day warranty, but this exercise was discontinued (can't imagine it was because the products were so good). I couldn't understand how a company won't stand behind a product longer then 3 measily months.I also purchased a Coby Digital picture frame for a Christmas present. It came out of the box with a black line right thru the screen.

I love that this attaches to the headrest and I use it almost everyday for my 2 year old. My only complaint, is that there isn't any way to turn off the dvd player and have it start where you left off.

I was able to purchase it on sale for under one hundred dollars. I have found two problems with this player - first, it is kind of loud. I wish it would be a silent player and second, the volume isn't all that loud. I guess they are hoping that most people will use the two sets of ear plugs that come with this player. The carrying case that comes with this model, lacks a bit and doesn't really protect the unit. On the plus side, it has a rubber type bottom which is nice and the value for the money is very high. I checked out over twenty different players and feel this player was the best of them all for the price. I would buy this unit again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Far exceeded my expectations!!!","review":"This is one excellent little machine!! I bought 2 of them for my 2 kids to use on road trips, but we've gotten far more use out of them than that. My husband watches one or two movies a day on one of them at work, and he loves it. I use the other one at home frequently in the kitchen, thanks to the adjustable kickstand in the back which allows me to set it on the counter while I cook. We get about 3 hours out of the batteries, which is very impressive for a piece of electronics like this. They are sturdy too, not flimsy, and you don't feel like you have to be very delicate with them. This product had everything I was looking for: tablet form, battery powered or plug-in (car or home), and excellent picture and sound. I highly recommend this player~!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!","review":"Today is March 25th. I purchased this item for my fifth grader for Christmas. She has used it carefully for only 3 months, and the battery will not hold a charge that lasts any longer than 30 minutes. I tried to get a replacement, and the only company that carries the battery is Coby themselves, and they will only replace the battery if you ship the whole unit plus a $31 money order to them.

The player works fine, as long as you always have an electrical outlet or car outlet handy, but how portable is that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away From Coby!","review":"Although it feels like it's build quality is good, it really isn't. I've had two of these players over the past 1 1/2 years. I used them at home for my child (usually playing out to a TV) and when we're on the road (a few times a year). Both broke down in a similar fashion, the controls became inoperable. Of course the warranty (90 days) had expired. Again, although this item feels like it's solidly built it always craps out. The only reason I purchased this twice was I figured the first was a fluke and it really is inexpensive compared to the others out there. I guess you could look at it as an item that needs to be repurchased every 6 to 10 months. What a shame. Perhaps it's worth spending the extra dollars for a better made item."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Wrong Disk\\" error after using it twice","review":"Looks nice, which is why I bought it.

We only played 3 or 4 DVDs on it and it was treated very delicately.

It worked for a while, then stopped working. I called Coby and even though it was outside of warranty, they allowed me to get a money order for a replacement and ship it back to them at my cost. They sent me this TF-DVD7050. I have never had the chance to use it - it shows a \\"Wrong Disc\\" message for every disc I have tried. Really, believe the other low-rating reviewers. I can't believe I would get a dud (by chance) twice unless there are that many duds. Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, great!","review":"Nice player, especially for the price. Screen has one dead pixel but I can live with this. I wish this player had video input so I could use it with a digital camera and camcorder. Battery life is about 3 hours and spare batteries are available from the manufacturer for $40. Sound is very good considering the internal speakers are tiny. Wish there was volume control from the remote."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Kid Product!","review":"Very easy to use... very much like the disney dvd products, however this product works! We purchased two disney dvd's and they both quit working within 1/2 hour! I sent them both back and purchased this one. This one works on battery, which lasts about 2 1/2 to 3 hours on a charge. You can also plug into a home outlet or a car charger..awesome! Durable and much better than the kind that has the flip up screen and it has TWO headphones included! I would buy it again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad design","review":"Beware the product warranty only covers 90 DAYS. My one is broken after 5 monthes.

I wrote an e-mail to the manufacturer and until now I haven't received any answer, I tried to return it to Amazon but since the 30 days return policy has expired I can't. I tried to return it knowing that a discount will be applied because it's after 30 days... and I can't. So, you can be paying a $100 bucks for a one month DVD player. I DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL THIS ITEM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow,Did I Get A Lemon?","review":"Okay, i've read all the glowing reviews , the ones that made me purchase the unit and all i can say is wow! This player was horrible, just horrible.From the time i opened the box, the screen didn't have a protective film on it and the screeen was covered in swirl marks, like a bad car detail job.Playing the dvds brought another problem,the player can just stop and freeze up controls with no warning, in addition the player etched the outside edge of the disc,,,and we are talking etch, not scratch!The only good thing out of all this was that i got it from here, Amazon, and they took it back no problem.Maybe i got a lemon, who knows, it's sad because the feel of the player makes you think it is good quality plus they give you a bunch of extras(headphones ect), but locking up and etching the dvds is not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out, junk, horrible customer service","review":"Watch out for these guys.

I bought it from Amazon as a XMAS present for my son.It worked great and came with everything you need. Then it died and simply would not work. Purchase with caution. I do not think this is a product that is very well made. It is great out of the box but I doubt it will last more than a few months.I did by the protection plan from Amazon for $20.00 and after paying for shipping received the full purchise price back. That was a pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful player, both ergonomic and economic","review":"I bought this DVD player after much research across the net for a decent and economic player. I came upon this model and eventually purchased it. It has been wonderful. It is fully featured, able to hook into the TV, comes with a case to attach it to a headrest in a vehicle, and comes with many things inside the box. It comes with 2 sets of headphones, a car tape adapter, cords to hook into the TV, case, charger, Li-Ion battery (usually get about 3 hours out of it), and a car charger. I heard of the shady reputation of Coby, but this product is built to last. It has a firm rubber casing and has been dropped before, and it came out in complete working order, minus a scuff or two. It's beautiful screen is quite nice, but the brightness may be too high for some, so I turned it down. It is also hard to see in sunlight, with most screens of its type. I heartily recommend this to anyone looking for a DVD player built to last, but is also easy on the wallet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Value, but AC Power Issues","review":"We've had this player now for about 3 years and have gotten some GREAT use out of it. The picture is fabulous, and it's one of the few screens that, when mounted on the headrest, doesn't get washed out by the sun. Sound is very good, and even better in car with some noise cancelling headphones. Alas, after about 2 years, the AC adapter plug outlet on the player failed and the system wouldn't take a charge...seems the constant plugging and unplugging caused the internal plug to push into the player and not make contact. Got it fixed at a mom & pop shop for about $30, but 12 months later, same thing. That said, we're buying another one because the pros outweighed this one con, and we have a headrest mount for this player already that works very well. If we can get another 3 years out of a new one, we'll be satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but junk!!","review":"I bought this unit for my grandaughter. It quit after 6 months. She is 29 years old, so it was not because of abuse to the player. It had a one year warranty on parts, but, guess what!! Coby doesn't stand behind their warranty. She called their customer service with the warranty in hand, and was told that the warranty they had in their computer files was totally different from the one she received with the unit. She also was told that she would be better off just to purchase another one. Also, a repair shop stated that parts are virtually unavailable for Coby products. Please, DO NOT BUY ANYTHING COBY!!! TOTAL JUNK"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works AWESOME for a few weeks.","review":"I purchased this unit for my daughter to use in the car on trips. She watches Elmo, SpongeBob, and the Muppets, and she's happy. After two or three weeks, I no longer had a happy camper in the back seat. The picture went out of phase, discs wouldn't load, total disappointment. I called the vendor and was referred to Coby. Getting in touch with Coby has, so far, been an exercise in futility. If anyone can help me, I would really appreciate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't last the 2 year warranty","review":"I have purchased 2 of these DVD players. The first time I bought one, it lasted about a year then the remote quite working, even after I replaced the batteries, then a week later the player just wouldn't turn on anymore. I wasn't rough with it, only used it at home. I got my money back. I figured it was probably a bad DVD player, so I went and purchased another. It lasted a couple months longer than the last one and it did exactly the same thing when it broke down. I don't understand why these DVD players quit like that, but they just don't last. If you buy one, get it with the 2 year warranty so you can get your money back when it breaks down, because it will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"We purchased this last year for our son to use on long trips. He's used it a total of 6 times since he received it, and the last time he tried to use it something started overheating and the player locked up. I don't know what is shorting out and I shouldn't have to dig around in a DVD player to find out what's wrong with it. Very disappointing quality, the warranty is poor, and I can't honestly recommend this to anyone I know due to these shortcomings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works fine....for a little while","review":"We purchased this item in May 08.

Didn't even last a year before it stopped working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable and awful customer support","review":"We bought this unit for the rare long car trip that we take with our 1 and 3-year-old little girls. We used the unit during 5 or 6 trips since we bought it 9 mos ago and it has now stopped working. It will play for maybe 10-15 minutes and then will freeze up and become unresponsive despite trying multiple different DVDs. I think it may be overheating. A call to customer service was a waste of time. We were told the one year \\"parts\\" warranty only applied to \\"external\\" parts. If you must buy this unit consider an extended warranty or buying with a credit card that will warrant the item. Better yet, stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Resistant but...","review":"Ok, I need to start with an accident. I was at the gym, watching a movie on the treadmil... And you know what happened next... the DVD player went down and hit the treadmil and then the floor! The player was open all the way and the movie was also on the floor. I was surprised to find that the player was still intact and almost without a scratch! Great design Coby! My only concern with this player is that sometimes the image get stuck in the player, just like when I press the pause button, while the sound is still going on like nothing. Then I have to rewind or forward the movie a bit so the image and sound match again. It happens only once in a while and I can fix it right away so I'm happy with this unit anyway.

Mercifully it avoids all the moralizing that either tries to discount or confirm the homosexual component found in the more ususal accounts.

This book will come in handy to me as I start learning cosmotology in Aug. I too one day would like to create make-up artistry for the stars. It is inspirational to know how you got into the business, I'll have alot of work to do since all the action is up North and I'm in sunny FL.

But if you want to see a makeup artist stroke his ego by being associated with big Hollywood names, then this is the book for you.When I got this book I believed it would provide me with detailed information on how to apply makeup and what I could do to improve my look. Instead I get approximately 10-12 pages of information that I could have read in a beauty magazine. The remaining pages are filled with photos of the women he has made up such as Brandy, Patti Labell, and Tyra Banks. Then you get to hear about his life. Big Deal.The saying \\"Don't judge a book by its cover\\" really does apply to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"No tips just ego","review":"I orginally bought this book about 3 years ago and even then I thought it was terrible. Its just simply too outdated, i know it was written in the 90's and the brown toned makeup on every person definately reflects that. I got this when I was looking to get into makeup and how to apply it and this is where the book falls short. There was only photos of people he had makeover and very little description on how to acheive the look. Most of the book was just photos of famous people and a section on his life and where he comes from, how he started. blah blah. Maybe if you find this book in a Half Price Books for less than $5 then it would be worth adding to the collection.I would like to see his new DVD that just came out to see if he actually shows you how apply makeup and if his looks have kept up with the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very basic","review":"If you are a pro.

Only the first few pages give VERY general makeup tips. The rest of the book is just a showcase of Fine's \\"work\\" with a really weak explanation of how he did it.

The server's makeup was flawless and I complimented her on it. She then went on to tell me about the book and how it helped her achieve that look. I immediately rushed to get it and have enjoyed it tremendously. The major flaw with it, however, is that it only gives info on creating one kind of look. Sam Fine suggests earth tones for women of color and the effect is wonderful but no woman wants just one look. The book needed to at least address changing your make up according to your attire. The look he suggests is appropriately neutral but may leave the truly fashionable woman wanting for more. The info and pictures of the celebrities are great. Otherwise the book is wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's nice but...","review":"I enjoyed looking at the pictures in this book. However I really expected to find more information I could use.

Then things begin to go terribly wrong. Someone is out to get Emily.What a letdown! This book is a replica of the first! Okay, the relation between Emily and Nancy is different and Rich is somewhat harder than he was in book one, but everything else is way too similar.If the author doesn't have anything new to add to the story, he shouldn't write a sequel. This is a complete waste for anyone who has read the first Stepsister book.

Their \\"Rock in a Weary Land\\" really rocks. I liked \\"My Trouble is Hard\\" by the Southern Revivalists also: very plain but effective singing by soloist and backup group.

In a few minutes, I saw a wisp of smoke coming out of another, smaller hole about 8 feet away and covered it as well. At that point I was pretty sure I'd found a burrow.

I have taken to drilling a hole in the end that does not come with a hole, cutting the fuse in half and putting half a fuse in each end so I can light the other end after the first end goes out. Getting them lit now is more difficult because they changed to an ( apparently ) cheaper fuse. The old green fuse worked well, but the new red fuse barely burns at all.

So this is the best case scenario, a entire tunnel filled with smoke, knowing the gopher wasright there.

Thus, I rate this mildly effective because he was obviously woozy but faaaaarrrr from dead. For all the warnings of how toxic the gas is, it seemed pretty mild and i think tear gas may have been a better choice.I give it the one star because it was easy to use and honestly did slow the vermin up but I don't have time to watch them this closely and would rather have a \\"once and done\\" formula."},{"rating":"1","title":"This works from 2 days to 2 weeks.","review":"I used this products for many months in my backyard and most of the time it only keeps Gopher away for 2 days.

It's not so much a novel as it is another diatribe against Eastern liberals. The characters are cardboard cutouts, spouting all the familiar cliches. There's a liberal clown (Andy) who acts as a dateboard, and a contrived plot in which dozens of evil escaped cons are brought to justice through the efforts of the brave gun-toting civilians after the Feds turn their backs on the problem. In an effort to show how demented the villians are, there are graphic rape scenes and murders.In addition to the political angle, I just don't think Johnstone's skill as an outdoor adventure writer is up to the quality of Stephen Hunter, Gayle Rivers, or the granddaddy of them all, Geoffery Household (now, unfortunately, out of print)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Stupid","review":"This is the first Johnstone book I have read.

To say that the characters are cardboard cutouts would be an insult to cardboard manufacturers everywhere. The escaped convicts are completely interchangeable, as are the protagonists.

The seemingly phonetic pronunciations of the vocalists overshadow the rest of the work. The music is more varied than on other Midney albums, more funky, but it is gimmicky as well and at times the strings are listless. Midney seemed to be repeating himself with the string arrangements by this point (1981). Laughably, the \\"sensous vocals\\" (as the credits actually read) are attributed to a \\"Charmaine.\\" The male vocalist Kevin Owens remains unidentified, surely to his great relief. When Midney's album ran only about 30 minutes over 4 songs, was it really necessary to recycle a track from an earlier USA-Euro album (\\"There's A Way\\")?

The album is great for novice Marley fans that may not be in possession of this already classic material.

Starting with action, it keeps the reader entertained and on their toes, all the way from page 1 to the end on page 365. The main character, Nevada, is an easy-going kind-hearted cowboy who was (and still is) the infamous Jim Lacey, a noted pistolero of many of the western states. Nevada, or Jim Lacey, interacts with members of the Ide family, especially Ben Ide and his younger sister, Hettie. Starting in California, the storyline meanders southeast, eventually ending in Arizona and centers around the Mogollon Rim. Readers who loved Mr. Grey's beautiful and accurate descriptions will be pleased to find them again. There is a sprinkling of words and phrases that might be spelled differently than what you are used to; it's just a gentle reminder of prose of that era.

For all their claims of it being uneven, my fellow reviewers almost cover the full spectrum of the album when citing the 'good cuts', the only three songs ignored so far being 'Punch & Judy', 'Souls' and 'Mad Hatter'. And even these three songs have very interesting constructions.While it is undeniable that their music took a turn in the eighties, accusing the Stranglers of a bland sound is exaggerated, and that any other band could have made this album is fallacious. The proof is their distinctive sound and style: any song on that album can unmistakenly be identified as a Stranglers song.In short, if you're new to the Stranglers there are other places to start (Raven for their early period, Feline for their new wave style), but if you already own a few records from them you should check out this underrated album."},{"rating":"1","title":"The album too far","review":"One thing I remember affectionately about this album is winning a newspaper competition by writing a review of it which said that 'if they write music this bad it is no wonder that life shows no mercy'. I also remember trying to give away my copy to my girlfriend of the time- but she thought it was so bad that she left me!! There were three excellent songs on this album- 'Skindeep', 'No mercy' and 'North winds blowing'. The rest was quite dire. I have no objection to the Stranglers evolving but this was just bland nonsense and the over-production attempted to cover up the fact that there was very little here. Easily the worst Stranglers' album till that point but unfortunately they kept spiralling into blandness after that. Gone were the musical conversations between bass, guitar and keyboards- most of this could have been done by just about any other band. Save your money and buy one of the earlier albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"I guess I am the best reviewer of this album since...","review":"...since I've listened to it when it was released in 1984. The best Stranglers album ever? maybe, at lest the one with the best songs. There are some low points, too, I really hate Mad Hatter, No Mercy and Spain. The best ones, no doubt are Let Me Down Easy, Laughing and Souls. The first two are A major while Souls is in D minor. Their atmosphere is intense in sophistication, balance, rhythm and a 100 percent brilliant harmony. I don't think this is a pop album, besides, I could say it stimulates some sort of childhood sensibility. I recommend to slow down a bit a half-tone these 3 tunes (also including Skin Deep) to understand and taste them better. North Winds is also an excellent tune, the darkest of the album. Ice Queen is an excellent intro. Uptown and Punch and Judy go hand in hand.

Now if your a true Reggae or Buju fan you would know yes he did sound like that back in the days because I have many mix tapes and records with him on there sounding like that. well to keep a long story short this is a must buy IF YOU LIKE OLD BUJU TUNES."},{"rating":"1","title":"this album is a bunch of buju bul-----","review":"I am a true Buju fan and not once have I heard these tracks on the islands.

The couple demonstrating were real and natural and really into one another. Sex is a dance and the video cuts back and forth to an indian dancer and drummers. The music is sexy and makes you realize that sex is about rythym and sensuality. Very different from other position videos that show the women with too much makeup and garters on (get real!) This is a real couple enjoying one another and enjoying the dance of sexuality."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like a Dance Video","review":"-and we were not looking for \\"porn\\" Kenneth Ray Stubbs, Ph.D., ! We were looking for more of an instructional-type based video based on the various positions in Kama Sutra which I thought this video had to offer (at least it advertised itself as such). My husband and I were *very* dissappointed and felt cheated out of our money. What a waste! I would have given it 0 stars if it was available. And what did I mean about it was \\"More like a Dance Video\\"? Because it showed dancers 90% of the time with flashes of a couple \\"making love\\". I am an extremely unhappy customer and would *beg* of you *not* to purchase this item if you think that you are going to learn anything from this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Good Money","review":"If you're looking for an instructional video to learn more about the Kama Sutra, or even to expand your sexual repertoire, do NOT buy this video if you can help it. While Dr. Stubbs may be a brilliant sexologist, he is definitely not an inspiring filmmaker. The dancers were odd, the poetry was crunchy, and some of the music was even dubbed over the original, which made for awkward dance intervals.While the female demonstrator of the Kama Sutra positions was a beautiful addition to the video, the oaf-like characteristics of the male were a bit distracting. Plus, some of the freeze frame shots of the positions were difficult to make out. I doubt some of those positions are very comfortable, but if you are simulating sex with your partner (as the couple did in the video), I'm sure you'll be fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kama Sutra of Sexual Positions Video: A tantric Vision of Lo","review":"Please do not waste your money on this video.

The chestnut cover and solid binding make this book feel like it has substance. And the packaging does. This book would make a lovely part of a gift basket. However, it lacks the basic usefulness of THE NEW DIARY, by Tristine Rainer, or the richness and interesting format of LIFE'S COMPANION: JOURNAL WRITING AS A SPIRITUAL QUEST, by Christina Baldwin. It's one of the prettiest books on this subject, but for a book that took less than an hour to read, it didn't inspire me to spend the rest of the morning writing. Instead, it offered some general suggestions in a \\"wouldn't it be nice to write\\" kind of way.

The most useful bit of information I came across in this Developer's Guide is a blurb about a bug related to Authors fields. The Domino chapter is sadly poor and basic. I learned more in a day of experimenting and using the \\"Working With Lotus Notes and the Internet\\" book from Lotus than I did from this chapter.

Everyone should have a Mama like Baby Rose's but for those who can't, reading about her will help make up for it. Mama's mission in life is to make the world a better place, starting with her children, who seem to think the world is fine without her added touches. Mama's genteel manners are mostly lost on Rose, aka Warrior Woman, who has her own ideas about how the world should be run. Fortunately for Mama, Warrior Woman is there to deal with loose goats, manic cows, and snakes inclined to make social calls.

When it arrived, it was not set up. If you don't know how to set it up yourself, it can cost around $80 to have a pro do it for you. My sons violin teacher kept it for a week trying to get it tuned. He couldn't do it. He said that once he gets 3 strings tuned in, then the 4th goes out. He hated to admit it to me, but he said that it was just a poor quality violin.He recommended a Suzuki beginners violin. I returned my Cecilio and got a Suzuki. Wow! What a difference! It arrived set up, and tuned. The quality was obvious. My sons teacher was very pleased! Check out the Suzuki's!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cecelio Not Set Up Well","review":"I would stay away from this brand, and instead go with a name brand violin. Mine had pegs that were drilled in the wrong place, which caused the pegs to slip when the weather changed. The strings were inexpensive and broke quickly. I spent almost as much as I paid for this to get it working properly, and because the pegs were not properly drilled the holes began to get cracks in them. When my child is ready to move up to full size I will buy a name brand, not an inexpensive violin. You cant get away cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it less than 1 star...","review":"I would!! I'm a beginner String Orchestra teacher, and I had a number of students purchase the Cecilio instruments over the past few years.

I was somewhat surprised at first that it had a Parental Advisory, but after hearing I can see why. The songs are great and really fast, which is how I like it. I was sick of half the songs before hearing this, like Dammit and Pathetic, but the energy and volume of their live versions made me love em again. Great chat in between the songs. Most of it is about Tom's bent weiner but...anyway. Great CD. Great band. Great all around.;"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but too much Enema revisited","review":"This was a very good CD, but a lot of it is just the Enema songs done live, and Blink just doesn't change them up enough. Songs such as What's My Age and All The Small Things, for example, have been overplayed already, and remain exactly the same on this record. The one exception to this is Going Away to College, which really gets new life here and sounds much better than on Enema. Also suprising are the Cheshire Cat and Dude Ranch songs, which now have the harmonies they lacked in their original incarnations. The between song banter is also great, so in a way this album really is something special, and that's not even including a near perfect Dammit to cap off the whole thing. Coulda been better, but still an excellant, fun album, and well worth a listen by Blink fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Avid punk fan","review":"This album is great for any blink fan!!!

HOWEVER, if you have any taste in music, or any decency as a human being, do not buy this album or be caught listening to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE MOST HORRIBLE CD TO EVER HAVE BEEN MADE","review":"DONT EVER LET YOURSELF HEAR THIS CD. I washed my hands and face and recited the 23rd Psalm three times after hearing the first track. The \\"Family Reunion\\" song made me sick--to ever imagine that someone could write a song like that and let children hear it is awful. Teenagers these days are condemning themselves just by buying this CD, and it serves them right if they all don't get to go to heaven. Look what they're bringing this world to.A Christian person would never touch this CD, and I think we should all stand up against the sinners at the record companies who make this nonreligious nonsense. I think everyone who bought this CD should go home and read their Bibles until they feel clean enough to enter a church again and beg for forgiveness. None of this satanic junk should ever be allowed to hit the market, and if it were my choice, not a single teenager who has listened to this CD would go to heaven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it for the jokes and Man Overboard alone","review":"This CD is one of the funniest CD's I own. It's not Blink 182's best display of music, but it's definitely their best display of humor. From all the in-between song jokes to the 28 bonus joke tracks at the end of the CD, this proves that Blink 182 is the funniest and sickest band on the planet. As for the musical half though, with the exception of the new studio track Man Overboard, I don't really care for the rest of the music that I have already heard on other Blink CD's. I recommend this CD for both brand new fans and hardcore fans who want their humor and arent looking for musical perfection."},{"rating":"2","title":"All of Blink's best songs plus a new one","review":"Blink 182's latest cd is one of the best live albms in a long time, and up there with Face to Face's live album.

But they aren't. While some of the songs seem a bit \\"fixed up\\" if you saw the show, and a lot of the Enema songs sound similar to the CD version, the Dude Ranch and Cheshire Cat songs sound refreshingly different. Not only do you get 19 live songs, you get the humorous antics of mark and tom between songs, which gives it a more concert-like feel. Not an album to play for the parents though. So if you were unfortunate enough to miss this great tour, or don't have Enema of the State, grab this CD, pop it in the stereo and crank up the volume to almost unbearable levels and enjoy the next best thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money..","review":"..if you're older than 13. Being a huge fan of \\"Enema..\\", I was extremely disappointed with this. The between-song banter is embarassingly vulgar, immature, and lame. There's no humor to it at all, they just seem to be trying to out-swear or out-gross each other. I outgrew that stuff in middle school.Save for decent versions of \\"Adam's Song\\" and \\"Going Away To College\\", there isn't much to recommend this musically, either. The vocals are sloppy, and in general, the studio versions of the songs are much better. The incessant shrieking of 14-year-old girls is really grating, and ruins even the better tracks.Maybe I'm too old (27), or I got to the party too late (the only other CD of thiers I own is Enema) but this was a huge let-down.

Everything seems to lack intensity and drive, and the music often loses its sense of direction. Standout tracks include Corner Pocket, Pearl on the Half-Shell, and Ice-Pick Willy, but even these tunes lack a certain drive. Where's Wayne Shorter's wailing saxophone?The group sorely misses Jaco Pastorius on this album. Victor Bailey is a formidable player, but lacks the imagination that Jaco brought to the group(at least he did when this was recorded).Not a complete waste, but not worth your money unless you are a real Weather Report/Zwainul/Shorter fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is some of the best guitar I've ever heard","review":"No exaggeration.

However, sure would be nice if the instructions would include mounting templates that you could place on the wall to mark to assist in mounting. The instructions do not tell you the number of inches from the center for the mounting screws--if you are going to center the TV on the wall, the screw mount for this is 6 or so inches to the left of the center--so most likely you will not have a stud. You have to be an engineer to figure out the placement!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to put up, works great!","review":"Took me all of 3 minutes to put this mount on the wall, its strong and has a good quality feel when adjusting.

TV attached very easily. Has been on the wall for over a year with no problem. The only reason I did not give five stars is that while the are articulates side to side, it apparently does not tilt up and down. If you are lying in bed you can not tilt the TV down to see it better. Otherwise a very solid unit for the price. All the other arms were much more money. This is an excellent value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what pictured here or Peerless' PDF!! Specs wrong too!","review":"I'm downrating this product BEFORE I actually use it to hopefully catch your attention BEFORE you buy it! I read a bunch of reviews here, mostly favorable. One noted the itme pictured here on Amazon is different then what came. TRUE. It is also DIFFERENT than the item in the PDF from the Peerless site!! Seems there are 3 LCS-KLA'a but nobody (Peerless) has bothered to revision them ie. -1 -2 -3 etc. What I thought was the one in the PDF was the correct one, WRONG. The one pictured on the Peerless site IS the correct one. So it has a flat/squareish TV side plate with eight ROUND screw holes (not tear shaped) and it does NOT roll +/- 5 degrees. If you've ever hung a TV before tear shaped screw holes let you hang the TV on the already wall mounted arm EASILY! The 5 degree roll lets you correct a less than perfect install. I'm am currently waiting for a call back from a Peerless tech. I showed the CSR the bad PDF."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of level","review":"Very strong and the price was great but....I am a professional builder and the mount is out of level. I mounted it twice using a 4 foot level and the monitor was out of level both times. I recommend attaching the monitor to the mount, have someone hold the entire setup against the wall and level it. Then mark the location of the two screw holes."},{"rating":"1","title":"wall mount","review":"This wall mount is not useful because it does not tilt up and down, so the only good view would be straight on. If you do not plan on viewing your flat screen television from a position that is exactly level with it, then I suggest you buy one that tilts up and down. After paying $50 for this one, I got one for $10 that titled both up and down and side to side. Most wall mounts for flat screen televisions are over-priced and useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"I boutht this product because i had an urgency in the office. This came out better than I thought... it is very sturdy, we are currently using it with 17\\" monitors.

It is not well built, thus it sags and is near impossible to get your TV to be level. My TV is currently level, but only because I jammed a piece of cardboard into the articulating piece. I would not recommend this wall mount"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything should be this easy!","review":"Great wall mount, I highly recommend this product. It is very sturdy, easy to install and can't even be seen once installed. Great price too. I used it on a 20 inch Vizio tv."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only tilts left to right","review":"I wanted an arm to mount a third monitor above the two on the desk. I liked the idea of an arm so I can pull it close when I need to see detail. You can imagine my disappointment when the \\"easy, one-touch tilt and up to 180 degrees of swivel\\" only referred to left-right swivel. It is completely useless for my purpose. I tried installing it sideways, but the monitor is too heavy for the arm to hold up.Additionally, I'm not sure if the fault is my monitor or this device, but my monitor has an indentation in back to fit the mount's metal square. This metal square is a tiny fraction of an inch larger than the indentation, rendering this product double useless, if such a thing is possible.The only good feature is that the cardboard box it came in is nice and sturdy, so it will be great for mailing Christmas presents in 10 months. If I realized I was paying $25 for a cardboard box and some garbage, I would be totally satisfied with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine does not tilt, and it is difficult to level.","review":"As a previous reviewer noted, even when using a level before drilling holes in the studs, when I hung the mount, it was not level. It took me 3 tries and 3 separate holes in my wall before I could get it almost level. Also, the description states that it has fingertip tilt, but mine will not tilt at all, no matter how hard I try. Otherwise, it does fold within 2 inches of the wall as described. I would recommend attaching the TV before attaching the mount to the wall as this helps with the leveling process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleek and cheap","review":"I used this mount for a DLP projector because I liked the price. The design can be improved to allow the tilt be 90 degrees. Still an extra fixture/adaptor can be an accessory for mounting DLP purpose. I made the adaptor by myself since I am an engineer. It works fine for my home theater. The screws are now long and strong -- imprevement from previous reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Device","review":"What can I say?

It swivels very nicely but, WHERE IS THE @#$%ing TILT??!!!!!! I bought this product because of the company's quality, also because I need it to do both tilt and swivel. \\"It didn't deliver\\"!!!! It is useless to me at this point and it's past the 30 days. Thanks, PEERLESS!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay, but...","review":"Overall a good product. I did notice, however, that in some positions, there is enough \\"play\\" in the pivot joints to cause the TV to be tilted somewhat. Also, the adjustment bolt(s) to change the angle of the mount are too tight to the point that I rounded off the hex cavity in one of the bolts attempting to loosen it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy, works well.","review":"The arm is sturdy and works well. It'd be nice if it had some sort of cable tray, but perhaps that would have made it unacceptably thick (the TV sits an inch or two off the wall when the arm is folded flat.) When folded flat, the TV is not centered on the bracket, so the bracket is a little assymetric when extended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Kindergarten book, Kindergarten Earth Science","review":"This is a good Kindergarten book (for every K classroom), Kindergarten Earth Science, Geology, all about rocks. There is something stable and comforting about rocks. They don't change so quickly, they can be found everywhere, they're not dangerous unless someone throws them at you. Geology is a stable science, unlike physics which is used for controversial activities like nuclear warheads or nuclear energy, Geology is a peaceful kind of Zen, even for Kindergarteners. (The mountain grows, but it grows so slowly, that it isn't threatening). This book all about different types of rocks and children's use of them, is a picture book worth giving to a Kindergarten or Pre-K child, especially boys. Good book for the classroom, good book to read to children. The book is somewhat poetic, but not a poetry book.

Pictures are nice the message okay I thought it needed a little more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I bought this book for my 7 year old grandson who loves rocks. It is not a colorful book at all with pretty pictures of rocks but he loved the story. It talks about all the different kinds of rocks you might find. (example:a skipping rock, a chalk rock, a moss rock) It doesn't identify the rocks as granite, sandstone, etc. but it talks more about the places you would find rocks. After reading the book, my grandson and I went rock hunting and he mentioned several times about things we had read in the book. He loves the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously Disappointed","review":"I purchased this book, based on reviews, and was very disappointed. I purchased it for an 8 year old boy to spark an interest in rocks and to share our family's interest in rockhounding with him. I really feel the reviews are somewhat misleading. This book has no specific geological information or specific identification of rocks, which is more along the lines of what I was looking for. This book is written in a very \\"artsy\\" manner, almost like a poetry book. It has large pictures of kids looking for rocks and is written in an overly simplistic style. I was so disappointed in it, that I went out and bought a book that I could see before I bought it, and settled on Peterson's First Guides - Rocks and Minerals. I know it's not specifically geared towards kids, but it is a great field guide, is PACKED with actual information and was less expensive than If You Find A Rock. With this book, if you find a rock, you won't know what kind of rock it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for young child","review":"My son (5 years) really enjoys this book.

The on-screen controls are not labeled, but easy enough to figure out once you play with them to see the effect on the display when you change them.The Samsung 955DF would have been my 1st choice, but was perenially out of stock - I looked at this one in a store, and is comparable in image quality - albeit about $60 cheaper. This monitor is solid in my book, and looks fantastic against a black hutch, much better than a beige monitor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Choice","review":"Although having only used the monitor for all of 1 day, my initial reaction is nothing but positive. The image quality is really good, especially at 1024x768 - colors were sharp, games looked fantastic. The only minor flaw is the on-screen control panel - less than intuitive - although you can dial the monitor in how you want it, it takes some doing, as the monitor is black, so you cannot see the labels on the buttons - once you dial it in, this becomes less of a problem. After reading the first review, I was a bit skeptical of this monitor, but gave it a try - had the Samsung 955DF been in stock, that would have been my 1st choice... But, if you want a black monitor to go with your surroundings, this is as good as I've seen - #1 Samsung 955DF..., #2 Sceptre P98VB - you can't go wrong with either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Behemoth","review":"It's a monster for the slavophile.

The characterization of Major Kira seems really wrong.I've read any number of Star Trek novels that were flawed. Interesting ideas that the author didn't quite execute on. And those kinds of books can still be a lot of fun to read. Bloodletter was not like this.

The box clearly states: New Stereo Recordings by Original Artists. All the songs are indeed by the original artists, however, they must have been recorded by them at some latter date as you can hear the difference in their voices. So, if you are a Doo Wop aficionado and desire the original radio versions, this set is not for you. But if you would just like to hear these great songs by the original artists when they were further along in their careers, this is a fantastic set, especially for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't do anything","review":"Beware of cheap formulas to enhance male potency.

A Perfect Circle has put out a Cd full of Hard yet soft and meaningful lyrics as only Maynard can do.

Maynard's voice is amazing and Billy Howerdel's guitar playing is great. All of the songs are good but the ones that standout the most are The Hollow, Judith, 3 Libras, Sleeping Beauty, and Thinking Of You."},{"rating":"2","title":"aPerfectCompactDisc","review":"So, yes, everything they've been saying is absolutely true...except for that bit about APC sounding like Tool. Forget that. I won't go into detail about how phenomenal this CD is, just read above (or below. Whichever). Quite simply, I can't stop listening to this CD. I, too, was skeptical when I first heard that Maynard had this \\"side project\\" (how I hate that phrase)in the works, but the final result, manifested here in Sea of Names, is a masterwork. Everyone needs to own Mer de Noms."},{"rating":"2","title":"A work of art","review":"I have always had great respect for Maynard James Keenan and I think Billy from APC is a great song writer that knows how to tie in Maynard's voice. The band did get a big start probably from having Maynard and being able to get the promotion to get the first singe, \\"Judith\\", on radio airwaves. They didn't need much promotion after that because the song was heavily requested and the CD shows that this is definetly not a side project. Songs like \\"The Hollow\\" and \\"Judith\\" show resemblence to the heaviness and rock sonic textures of Tool but there are songs like \\"Rose\\" and \\"Orestes\\" that show the true beauty of this CD. This is a disc that you can put in and will take you on a musical journey all the way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost greatest","review":"Their songs are what you call artistic. They really put some work into it. They should go a long away if no problems arise. Some of the better songs are \\"Orestes\\", \\"Judith\\", \\"3 Libras\\", and \\"Rose\\".

I heard a song off Mer De Noms, (Judith) and it was alright. I bought the CD on a whim, and I'm glad. It's a very diverse, and also very deep. ( go ahead, argue with me)The lyrics are proof that god loves us and wants us to be happy. Magdalena- I'd sell my soul, my self esteem a dollar at a time...

It strikes the very soul of people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"I consider this the second best album of 2000, and it would be on my \\"essential albums to listen to\\" list. There's no need to compare A Perfect Circle to Tool, as that's been overdone. Mer De Noms is a musical masterpiece, and my personal favorite track off the album is \\"Magdalena\\". It's literally like how many people put it, A spiritual experience. The lyrics are quite stellar and intricate, as well as the vocals, guitars, drums and bass. I like how some of their songs are played in C# tuning.Of the 12 tracks, there's but one I consider filler, and that's renholder.How about I put it this way: If you are expecting a mind-altering, out of body experience, pick up this album. It's that damn good. I am unspeakably excited for their upcomming album as you might expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Album","review":"Mer de Noms is one of my favorite Rock Albums (I am also a big fan of Classical, Blues, and Folk). While many reviewers compare APC to Tool, I see them as something quite different, and in many ways, better. While I like many Tool songs, some of their earlier work lacked maturity, and had a certain redundancy about it. APC combines musical maturity with a full, rich sound, and provocative lyrics. There is also no denying that Maynard James Keenan has one of the best and most distinctive voices in Rock. One reviewer called his voice \\"fragile yet powerful\\", which I think is an accurate description. I highly recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT","review":"i bought this album in spite of the tool connection, not in lieu of. i like this cd much better than ANY tool cd. it is subtler. the music uses minor over major changes to evoke a dark, atmospheric mood. yes the singer for tool is here but this is a different beast altogether. the melodies are edgy and haunting, the lyrics subtle and thoughtful. this album is so different i do not think words and reviews truly hit the nail on the head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Billy and Maynard make a masterpiece","review":"This is one of the best albums of the year without a doubt! No one in the world tops Maynard James Keenan when it comes to singing. His voice mixed with the melodies constructed by Billy and Maynard make a sound which is simply spectacular! I have never heard an album which has hypnotized me like Mer De Noms. This is a must have for any fan of Maynard and a must have for anyone who enjoys the work of two geniuses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff but do not expect TOOL","review":"It is perhaps unfair to compare this project to TOOL just because maynard James Keenan is at the front. A PERFECT CIRCLE has a sound and rythm all their own. Yes it is reminiscant of TOOL due to Keenan's involvement, but this less angry, more lyrical and maybe braoder on an emotional scope.Naturally it cannot match the artist breadth of TOOL's best work, but in another plain of being this is almost as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"I'm sure everyone knows that Maynard from Tool is the singer of the band, and so you probably think that it's gonna sound a lot like tool. In some ways it is reminiscent of Tool; however, it's different. If you wanna know what it sounds like relative to Tool, I'd say it sounds like a more mainstream version with a variety of musical instruments coming into play. A lot of of tool songs have really really weird structures while a perfect circle is a lot traditional. Mer de Noms dabbles with more instruments than any tool album. It's not as brutal and angry as say Opiate, but still interesting and definitely has it's moments of greatness. All the members of the band are extremely talented....I like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good LP","review":"Must say I was a little disapointed after I listened to it.

I had hoped for a continuation of Keenan's incredible work in it. After reading a lot of these reviews, I am kinda surprised. . . am I the only one who absolutely loves Tool and can't see it in this one? I know it shouldn't be compared to Tool, but Keenan's voice is so distinctive you can't help but consider it. The music just seems bland, for lack of better words. It doesn't have the depth of, say, Aemima. . . no real rises and falls, no climax. . . you can jump to any part of the song and hear the same sounds. Sorry, but this one made it's way to my shelf of stuff I don't listen to"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything You expect","review":"As far as the music goes; great CD, good quality, of course though that's realative based on taste.As far as seller goes; fast service, good sturdy packaging, great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I thoght it would be...","review":"This is a very good cd, but don't buy it if you think that it will be like Tool or the song Judith. Most songs are more similar to 3 Libras and Hollow. They are still great songs, but nothing like what I thought I was buying. If you liked 3 Libras or Hollow, then this CD is a must have. If you prefered Judith, listen to the CD before buying. Another thins: Parental Advisory!? What!? My CD didn't have a sticker, and it's probably the cleanest rock album I own. If that kind of stuff offneds you, ignor it for this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This album set Maynard in a different direction from Tool.

Working at a bar in DC, we bought this CD because we liked Tool, and though we were the only ones who played it, my fellow staff members and I had to stand stock still whenever \\"Orestes\\" played or whenever \\"William's\\" notes started up.

I like also that the songs are not too long and there are no long spaces of silence, such as on the TOOL albums. Although TOOL has its merits. They seem to focus more on instrumentals but they are incorporating some aspects of APC. It's a good cd to listen to if you want to listen to rock but not too hard of stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maynard shows that he's human.","review":"A Perfect Circle definently does not sound like a sideband, because 'Mer De Noms' is an awesome CD, and I even prefer it over 'Aenima', but definently not the masterpiece 'Lateralus'.Circle is quite a different band then Tool, so if your expecting the same band again, your not gonna find it here. You will however, hear Maynard Keean (Tool's singer). His voice is so extrememly good on this cd that it is hard to describe. But I would say the best way to describe his voice on is emotional and beautiful. As for the rest of the band, they are quite good, and they definently know how to hold their own. Two of the members are currently in the band Zwan at the moment.To put it simple, if you enjoy rock music you need to listen to 'Mer De Noms'. Not all the songs are great, but most of the content here is nothing short of awesome.Best Tracks: \\"Three Libras\\", \\"Orestes\\", \\"Judith\\", \\"Hollow\\" and \\"Brena\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Album","review":"This album has the sound that has aluded me for years in popular music.It's heavy, yet quiet, mad yet thoughtful.As the title of the group suggests, their music spans all types of alt-rock music.Don't get me wrong though, they sound like NOBODY I've heard before.They have a style all thier own.Any comparison to Tool is a severe mistake in my opinion.The only thing that sounds like Tool on this album is obvious, Keenen's voice.In my opinion this album is much better than any album Tool has released.Go out and buy this, it's one of the best albums of 2000."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"The more exuberant, lively guitars that Failure's guitarist bring this band are a nice transition from Tool's low end, distorted deep guitars. It is really nice to hear Maynard's voice with a high intricate guitar part instead of always a low one like with Tool. I find this CD to be a lot more listenable than Maynard's work on Tool, and that's saying a lot because Tool was what made me one of his fans. This CD doesn't have the tracks of bizzare noises like Tool did, it is mostly slow tracks that are very easy to listen to with great lyrics. There are also some great heavy tracks like 1 and 4 that totally kick bilko. This CD is best for a Tool fan that also appreciates the work of the bands Failure and some indie metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Circle rocks!","review":"Based upon hearing Judith on the radio lately I was expecting to get a Tool-like rendition of Maynard's same old angst ridden diatribes. I was wrong. A Perfect Circle comes forward with a lot of the energy that can be found in Tool's music but it's lacking that wicked cutting edge that makes Tool so raw and powerful (A fine thing indeed!). The Hollow is my favorite track so far but they're all pretty good.As can be expected from Maynard, A Perfect Circle's music is well arranged and delivered intelligently. These guys are solid musicians playing intriguing music and this disc was worth every penny. For the die hard Tool fan this disc will satiate your appetite until Tool releases their new album later this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something for Tool fans","review":"If you're a diehard Tool fan and you're looking for a new taste of Maynard, you'll get it here. It's not as dark as the Tool releases, but Maynard's vocals are enough to buy this album. Tracks 1 & 4 have a Tool influence. Tracks 5 & 6 should see some radio air time. It's great that Maynard is trying out some new stuff, but what I really want is another Tool album, please! By the way, Josh F. does some great drumming as well as Tim A. on this album. Get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So perfect","review":"I dont think that I have heard anything better than A Perfect Circle. Judith and The Hollow are the two best songs ever! I dont think any other band is as melodious and awesome as apc. buy this... NOW!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"gorgeous","review":"like tool, the music is often dark, atmospheric, emotionally charged. but here, over the warm guitars of billy howardel, maynard keenan shows a more feminine, beautiful persona than that of tool. we always knew his voice could be moving, but not as touching as it is on brena or orestes, or 3 libras. songs like magdalena and the excellent judith are more robust, the latter being a fierce attack on those things we replace god with, or how we view him. some of the music is heartmelting, soothing the soul, and giving after each listening a new awareness. it's hard to explain, but once you've got used to the album you will probably, for a few months at least, hopefully put aside numetal, and experience an album worth so much more than most that are produced nowadays. music for your soul.definitely one to put high on your wishlist."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Maynerd","review":"It's about time that I can listen to something that isn't fake and worhless. Im glad that this album came out and that it doesn't sound like tool, I like all the tracks and all of them like me"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ummm....Is this Tool?","review":"My first thought upon hearing Judith was, \\"yes Tool's finally releasing a new album.\\" Then I found out that it was in fact not Tool, but A Perfect Circle. Since Maynard (I could listen to him sing Klingon Opera) is my all time favorite vocalist I had to have the album anyway. I was not disappointed. Although Judith does sound a lot like Tool, APC is by no means a clone. Billy Howerdel is an amazing songwriter, and Maynard is an uncomprable lyricist. Together they make one hell of a team. This cd differs much from Tool. It's more mellow, more melodic if you will. And with songs like The Hollow and Thinking of You, Maynard shows a softer side that many never knew he had. A must have for any Tool fan, and a should have for any fan of great vocals."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine first album","review":"Mer De Noms is an excellent first outing, but don't be misled by Judith. This was actually a poor choice for a single because, while it is a fine song in its own right, it is also quite a bit heavier than the rest of the CD, and is, in the end somewhat misleading.This is not to say that I dislike any of the songs on Mer De Noms, however. On the contrary, it's an excellent album in its own right. Maynard James Keenan's vocals are as powerful as ever, and Billy Howerdel proves, once again, his great skill as a composer.There seems to be an overwhelming penchant for comparing A Perfect Circle to Tool, simply on the basis of Maynard as vocalist. Don't be misled, this band is much closer, in terms of their sound, to Rush or Blue Oyster Cult, than to Tool.All in all, I was very pleased with this album, and recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true perfect circle","review":"This is a very good album. All the musicians compliment each other very well! The dymanics go from a pretty acoustic guitar with beautiful string arrangements to heavy melodic guitar riffs. The music really compliments the lyics as well. I would highly suggest this album if you like atmospherical music with great lyrics!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another level","review":"I'm a huge Tool fan so getting this CD was a must. First thing I noticed was there's actual singing and chorus on this. \\"Judith\\" and \\"Thomas\\" are the only songs that sound like Tool, and that's not a bad thing. \\"The Hollow\\" would be my favorite but it is too short. \\"Orestes\\", \\"3 Libras\\" and \\"Thinking of You\\" will make you glad you bought this CD. Hopefully this won't be just a side project, A Perfect Circle is a legit rock band."},{"rating":"2","title":"To good to be true.","review":"When I got this Cd and forst listened to it I didnt know what to expect. I found a whole new world of musical genious and I found that Maynard has the best voice ever. I think the best song on the CD (the stand out)is \\"rose\\" which by all means is a great song. If you buy this Cd like people have said don't expect it to be like something else, because its not. Trust me on this listen with a open heart and mind and you will instantly fall in love with this band."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Circle... Perfect","review":"I can listen to this entire album every day... at least ...and never get sick of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich, Melodic, & Heavy - Too bad it runs under 45 min","review":"A Perfect Circle has created an excellent disc. I've been spinning it incessantly since buying it. While there are echoes of Tool throughout the album, the songs are indeed unique. I feel that Maynard showcases his voice here more than on the last Tool release, where he was often burdened by effects. Here he is vocally at his best, with melodies that soar over the rhythms with power and emotion. The heavy tracks rock, and the ballads are potent and meaningful. Buy the \\"Judith\\" 4-track single for 2 excellent live tracks. In fact - instead of this disc, buy the BOX SET for $6 more and get 3 live tracks and the Judith video.Enjoy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best rock album of 2000 ... until the new Tool release","review":"This is the best hard rock album I've heard in a long time, and it was a nice treat to hear something new from Maynard James Keenan, the lead singer of Tool. His lyrics and vocals on this album are top notch as usual, but the songwriting and the rest of the band are not up to par with Tool. This comparison may be unfair, however, because the style of A Perfect Circle is very different; the music is much more mellow and the lyrics are much more sensitive and less aggressive. I recommend this album to anyone who misses the quality of hard rock from the early and mid 1990's, and to anyone who is a fan of Maynard's voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not enjoy it","review":"I just did not like it. I regret getting it really. But I have it and I am stuck with it. Can't send things back cause you don't like them."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best!","review":"This is the best cd I have heard in a long time! If you like Tool, you'll like this one. Its not as hard as Tool, but that is what makes it special. The songs are beautiful and spiritual. You have to buy this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ambient and beautiful","review":"for the first time, maynard's voice actually shines above all the instumentation..not to say the music isn't good. it is. imagine if tool grabbed steve caton, of tori amos fame, and let him work his ambient guitar magic, while maynard wrote songs about love and loss as opposed to how stupid the music industry is. that's what a perfect circle is..it's the side of maynard that a LOT of people, including me, have been waiting for for a long time..and it proves maynard's voice is one of the best in alt-rock today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes they rock, sometimes they don't","review":"Mer de noms is a good cd. It has some very good tracks which rock like the hollow and judith, but I don't like the soft ones. A Perfect Circle is a good band I guess but they should do more rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound bleeding into one","review":"I've been a longtime Tool fan and an admirer of MJK's vocalizations, but A Perfect Circle left me cold. Compared to the current crop of popular metal flooding the airways these days it does little to distinguish itself and while its musicianship is skilled nothing about it really screams out to be noticed. The songs follow the same formula throughout and in the end all blend into a single sound. Where are the songs that stand out? Where's this album's Prison Sex? Where's its Sober? Where's its Learn to Swim? I'm sure the Korn and Limped Biscuits fans will love it, but that's not saying a whole lot. And what is it with Maynard's bands that they don't include lyrics in their liner notes?"},{"rating":"1","title":"DID ANYONE ACTUALLY LISTEN TO THIS CD?","review":"I'm seeing the already ridiculous amounts of 5 star reviews and i'm stunned. I had great expectations for this album. Then i put it on and nothing stood out. The songs go nowhere. The snare drum is awful on this thing. When you listen to Stinkfist from Tool's Aenima, at least the snare kicks which helps to drive the music. This stuff is boring. Judith is the only song that saves this album from being a total disaster. I don't know. Maybe I heard a different album than the rest of you. Maybe i just like Tool too much. Whatever it is, A Perfect Circle just doesn't cut it. Feel free to email me ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring CD","review":"This is SO boring. If U R A Tool fan Than U know what a good CD is. This is not 1. It is boring and lacks Good songs. The only good song is Judith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lured in by \\"Judith,\\" lulled by the rest...","review":"After hearing \\"Judith\\" and \\"The Hollow,\\" I was sure that I was going to love this recording. Well, I have to be honest and tell you that those two are NOT representative of the rest of the release. \\"Judith\\" was a great move for the first single--as its aggression and power will have most Tool and Maynard fans running crazed to the record store. The rest is a collection of immaculately-recorded, huge-sounding and average-to-boring songs. I have listened and listend to Mer De Noms--and can find no reason (besides the two I bought it for) to continue listening further. Be warned..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mer de Tool (Watered-Down Tool)","review":"Okay, so maybe this \\"isn't a side project.\\" Okay, so maybe Maynard gets to flex his vocal range a bit out of the glottal shriek he favors for Tool (a band which I have followed from the very beginning and which continues to impress me). Okay, so maybe I've just grown up since the time that I found contemptuous atheist rants engaging. Fact is, this is basically overrated goth metal, not terribly inventive - but that's not what ruins the record for me - it's the production, especially on the drums. The snare sound is pure 80's arena glam - I hear it and I think Spandex. The guitar tone on most tracks is reedy and thin. If this is unintentional it's unfortunate, as many of the songs would be both tougher and more tolerable with a bit of warmth and fullness. If, on the other hand, the chilliness is the result of the vaunted \\"all-digital\\" sound that the participants of this \\"not a side project\\" are so proud of, then all I can hope is that Maynard doesn't quit his day job."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very disappointing release.","review":"I don't like Tool but I thought that since \\"Judith\\" wasn't as hard or aggressive as the songs you would hear on a tool album, I had high hopes for A Perfect Circle, especially since Trent Reznor had invited them to open for NIN on his tour. When I finally bought the album, I was sadly disappointed. With only 2 good songs on this album outside of Judith--those being \\"Rose\\" and \\"3 Libras\\"--all the rest of the album is rather average and sometimes just outright bad , especially the song \\"thinking of you.\\" While I may not have liked Tool at least I had a measure of respect for them. I have no respect for A Perfect Circle"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn.....","review":"I am going to compare them to Tool, I know I shouldn't, but I can't help it, I'll compare the lyrics, Maynard's lyrics for Tool are incredible, his lyrics on this album have their moments, but are really lacking. \\"Judith\\" and \\"3 Libras\\" are excellent songs but thats about it, every other song is ordinary. If I just listened to APC and hadn't heard anything from Tool, I would probably rate this a lot higher, but I know lyrically, Keenan is capable of a whole lot more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tool's feminine voice","review":"Assured release from Keenan and a different, melodically dark company, successfully replaces crunching riffage with a slightly more soothingly eccentric palate, which produces the rare rock side project release beyond major reproach. Arguably more appealing than the increasingly bloated stagnation creeping into Tool's creativity at the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine Band","review":"Though not as good as Tool, A Perfect Circle is a good effort with a unique sound, interesting lyrics. Not recommended for all (the \\"metal heads\\") but those who enjoy rock melodies are in for a treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, yet just as good","review":"Maynard changes styles, perhaps a bit drastically in some areas, but still makes a awesome album. From the flowing melodies of Orestes and Sleeping Beauty to the feirce Magdalena and Judith, and the in between ones like Thomas, this cd contains a variety of styles, all of which are brought to life through the inventive music and Maynard's awesome vocals. He is one of my three favourite song writers. Although it may not be particularly hard, any Tool fan would like this. Be warned: most of it is mellower than the popular single Judith, but it is really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful music","review":"What can I say? Maynard James Keenan and Billy Howerdel have not only produced a great amout of hype for this cd, but have done what many musicians have declined to do...they backed up the hype with a timeless masterpiece. Very rarely have I been able to describe a cd in this genre as beautiful without it being some sort of sarcastic insult. But that is just what \\"Mer de Noms\\" is...beautiful. And quite powerful at that.The first single off this cd \\"Judith\\" sounds hauntingly familiar to many a Tool song. Yet, it is songs like \\"Magdalena\\" and \\"3 Libras\\" that set this cd apart with their melancholy yet assertive stance.Lets just hope that Maynard and the gang decide to give it a second go and bless us again with another exquisite cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Cd's out there","review":"A Perfect Circle has it all, heavy guitars, kick-ass bass, heavy drums, and best of all the incredible voice of Maynard James Keenan. I would recommend that you pick up a Tool album first to get a taste of Maynard's voice and style of music and then buy A PerfectCircle. Some say that this is a side project while Maynard says that this cd is not a side project. This has yet to be determined. The only way that this can be settled is if this group can stay around as long as Tool and can keep the same type of fan base throughout while still picking up new fans along the way. The three best songs on this cd are: The Hollow, Magdalena, and Judith. The other songs are pretty good too but those three stand out above all the others. Sone paople claim this is Tool for your kid sister. I disagree, this is Toll for ALL Tool fans. They really hit the nail on the head with this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking!","review":"A Perfect Circle is my new favorite CD. It gets put up right next to Nine Inch Nails and TOOL. I am proud to admit that i am a HUGE APC fan. This CD has insipred me many times since the day i got it, which is the day it came out. I had been anticipating this cd for a while. It is one of the cd's that is hard to find. The uniqueness of this CD adds to its quality. Maynard has one of the most beatiful voices that i have ever heard. It is a great album and one i wont dare ever forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums of the summer","review":"This album, however undisclosed the release may have been, has proven itself to be among the best releases of this summer. Although Judith may have been the premiere single from this album, there are plenty of other songs that will make this album shine for a while. 3 Libras should be the next single from this album, although since radio stations are known for making consistently poor choices, who knows? This album is definetly worth the investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"ambient. beautiful.","review":"i first heard of APC when i saw they were opening for NIN on the american leg of the fragility tour. as such, i began listening to some mp3's of the stuff from APC.let me make this clear ahead of time: i've never had a problem with tool, other than the fact that the band seemed like they could do so much more with maynard's voice. especially after hearing him sing with tori amos..i knew maynard had to do something else. where his voice could be the instrument it was meant to be. enter A Perfect Circle. with guitars as ambient as anything played by steve caton on a tori amos album, and maynard's beautiful, passionate lyrics that are actually [gasp!] taking themselves seriously, this album keeps playing in my stereo over and over. and over. from the opening strains of \\"the hollow\\" until the end of \\"over\\", this is a journey you need to take."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWSOME CD","review":"this is a rockin cd. it's got judith, the hollow, 3 libras. besides some weird songs like rehol?. I really suggest it a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five stars","review":"A Perfect Circle definitely has a promising career as a band if they continue to produce music such as this. I agree that this music kind of has to grow on you, but with songs like judith and magdalen, how can you not go and get this cd. This is finally some original music, and not the cliche type of music that I have heard for the past year and a half. I liked Tool and with Keenan coming to a perfect circle, I decided why not, and i went and bought the cd. Although it was nothing like Tool, I was still very impressed by dark sound and excellent vocals. I believe if the artists want it to, this band will have a major impact on the music industry and it will finally dispel the rap-metal trend that has degraded the music industry over the past couple years. This is a must buy album and I strongly recommend that you buy this off Amazon right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"You know that question \\"If you were stuck on an island which one album would you bring with you?\\"","review":"Well I used to say it would be this one! I absolutely love this cd. Although now thinking back on it I think I would need to bring a Tool cd with me to the island. Tool is phenomenal! Maynard is a good part of the reason, his voice can be fluid and soothing. I always tell people who think Tool is \\"too hard\\" to listen to A Perfect Circle first. This album is a bit softer but has some harder songs too. Mostly you can just feel the music has such a deeper meaning to it than most albums that come out these days. I have two of these cds, one for my car and one for my house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than tool?......maybe.....maybe not","review":"WOW!,I've been waiting for this to come out and my wait was worth it! I'm a big Tool fan and I was hopeing that A Perfect Circle and Tool would be twins. To me they are not. But this cd is just a good as any Tool album. Maynard said \\"Tool is one half of me, A Perfect circle is the other\\" It really shows because maynard pores himself into every song. The best songs are \\"magdalena\\" \\"Judith\\" the touching \\"3Libras\\" and \\"Thomas\\" The other songs are great also. Please don't pick this up expecting blaring guitars and angry lyrics on every song. It does have that on a few but not all of them. Please pick this up if your a Tool fan. You won't be disapointed. Tool is not dead eather! Maynard hopes to make the greatest Tool album yet! It's gona take a few years though. Buy this. It's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best side projects ever","review":"Far to often side projects from musicians never seem to be as good as you expect them too. Either the music is to much like the musicians other band, or the music is to different. I am happy to report that this is not the case with A Perfect Circle. This is without a doubt one of the few side project successes.The music on Mer De Noms is beautifully haunting and incredibly original. The music harsh and intense as well as soft and moving. Each song in unique and stands out on the disc. Judith (the song that most people are familar with) is just one of the fantastic songs that make up this great musical collection. A Perfect Circle has a hint of Tool in it--yet it is also different from Tool (but in a very good way). This is a great disc that all rock fans should pick up. I say it is one of the best albums of the year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"4 years of waiting.....","review":"I can't stop listening to this cd. I think I'm brainwashed. I loved Tool but I understand now that A Perfect Circle will appeal to a much bigger audience therefore the transition had to be made. This band is on its way to the top fast. I knew this was coming though. The last sentence of the last track \\"Third Eye\\" of their last album \\"Aenima\\" from their second band \\"Tool\\" (Tapeworm was the first) says \\"prying open my third eye\\". That's exactly what he's (M.J. Keenan) doing now with A Perfect Circle; only this time he's seeing much clearer out of this new vision. Buy this cd. You won't stop listening to it........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who's heard of Tool?","review":"Mer de nomes doesn't sound like any Tool cd. Maynard's vocals with the backround music make this album kick butt.

GO OUT AND BUY THIS CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not Tool, but hey....","review":"I am a diehard fan of Maynard James Keenan and Tool, so of course I was more than excited to hear that there would be an album out with with Keenan to hold me over until the next Tool album release. A Perfect Circle isn't quite what I was expecting (maybe I just expected Tool incognito) but it doesn't give Keenan a bad name. The drums aren't as strong and the lyrics aren't as meaningful as they are from Tool, but hey... A Perfect Circle just might have something. Maynard's voice on the album is a bit like when he did the song on the Replicants album. Overall, A Perfect Circle isn't as rich and meaningful as Tool, but they never claimed to be Tool. It was worth my money just to hear Maynard again after so long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mer de Noms...","review":"I happen to think Tool is one of the best bands ever, so if you are looking for something similar, but slightly less metal, pick this one up. 3 Libras, Orestes, Thinking of You, and Brena are all great songs. Oh, and by the way, \\"Mer de Noms\\" does not mean \\"Voice of the Gods\\" as a previous reviewer suggested. \\"Mer de Noms\\" is French for \\"Sea of Names.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"better than tool! much better than tool","review":"A Perfect Circle is a whole of a lot better than tool.

I heard Maynard was forming a new band. I'm a big Tool fan and I really wanted to see if A Perfect Circle and TOOL would be twins. They are not. But You can still hear tool influances in many songs. This is not a disapointment at all. A Perfect Cirlce blends heavy, angry emotions and peaceful sounds perfectly. I can't really say if Tool or A perfect Circle is better than the other right now. I miss Tool. But in my mind A perfect circle replaces them nicely. my personal favs are \\"Magdalena\\" \\"Judith\\" and \\"Hollow\\" But the rest are great. Pick this up if you love Tool. You won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable","review":"This CD is awesome, every song on it is so tight, so well put together, you can almost (almost!!) forget about TOOL.

I thought 'hang on, isn't this the episode when the goths turn up in dawson's creek'. I couldn't believe how much praise this shallow commercial grunge/indy album got. Diverse my arse! There is some nice music on here but it's marred by maynard james keenan just endlessy going whooooooooooooh to show of his voice. The highlight of the album has to be the fantastic rose though, a lovely lo-fi song, if only the rest of the album could be the same. If i was you, i'd avoid this album and save up for machina by the smashing pumpkins...which is how this album should of sounded.

This is the reason REAL Tool fans had to wait so long for Lateralus to come out. This CD is just bad. There are a few good songs (\\"Judith, 3 Libras, Rose\\")but the rest are just little 2-3 minute pop songs. None of my friends who are also Tool fans like this CD. I would bet anything that if Maynard wasn't in Tool that this CD wouldn't have even gone gold. Maynard does have a great voice, and it shines through on almost all the songs, but the music and lyrics really are bad. I highly doubt that if your really like Tool you will like this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tool all over again...","review":"It seems that since Maynard is going to do music with Tool for the time being, he's found some people to be in a band to mimic Tool. I know APC fans will say APC is more than that. I don't think so. The worst is their song- diary of a mad man, I believe - where they do the \\"we're going to sound like Tool ripping off the Cult and the Cure all in one song\\" thing. Please, Maynard, you're incredibly talented and above having to rehash the whole Tool thing outside of Tool. It's just like David Byrne going solo and just doing the whole Talking Heads thing all over again on Uh-Oh.

Max suppplies the humor, while Morse and Lewis provide excellent sparring throughout. Add in a couple of vignettes from the tour group's participants as well as a minor mystery surrounding an antique and historic piece of jewelry \\"The Wolvercote Tongue\\" and we have a very good episode - well worth our time.

We do experience periods of several days where the temperature is never above freezing. During that time, I did not see any melting action at all. The granules provide some traction on outdoor stairs, but the ice was still there, not melted and I was using generous amounts.

Not so much for hips, since my dog keeps falling down on the ice it's totally ineffective at melting.Since the ice melting seems to be its primary purpose, it's really not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution- This will kill your lawn","review":"I used this product over an Illinois winter.

I once had a girlfriend who liked to party all the time, after she heard the Eddie Murphy song, and her pancreas ended up exploding, while her liver became as hard as a granite brick. All this sent me into a tailspin of my own self-induced partying revelry.So you see, just because a hot Hollywood star like Eddie Murphy thinks it's cool to party and \\"get down\\" on a frequent basis, doesn't mean that it is.I myself choose to follow the clean living style of such entertainers as Slash, Robert Downey, Jr., Scott Weiland and the lead singer of Thug Three Times (TTT).Barring the lyrics, this Murphy record was his best one of the '80s; it set the bar for future alternative music.

This book fails on this count. On more than one occasion, a concept (e.g., \\"trimmed mean\\") or a function (e.g., \\"range(x)\\") is mentioned without being defined, only to be presented as new later on. This is very frustrating and prevents a new student from working through the book fast. As some other reviewers remarked, the index is a complete disaster, which only makes this worse. It is nice that the book comes with a package of problems.

You are working on something in R and need help with code, but first you have to hunt for 30 minutes though Verzani to find it! Most of the time it isn't even worth it - the author often presents the wrong way to program first to show you how NOT to do it, which is completely useless because the reader doesn't know how to do anything in the first place! The index is horrible, and the topics are all out of order. Horrible reference for an already extremely frustrating computer program.

Why do so many people take \\"Interview\\" at face value? Did they not listen to the whole song? Same with \\"Spoiled Girl.\\" Simon is COMMENTING on the dangers of narcissism, not indulging in it.

Solid B+ effort with the trio of TOBB/CBH/ABM being solid A+."},{"rating":"2","title":"An undeserved bad reputation","review":"I don't know why everyone, including critics & fans, picks on this album. Perhaps its lack of commercial success makes it an easy target. And OK, it isn't the best Carly Simon album, but if you like her voice and if you like her sense of humour, you will find plenty to appreciate here. They are both in fine form. Only 'Tired of Being Blonde' strikes the wrong note for me. I think 'My New Boyfriend', 'Come Back Home', 'The Wives....'

Twice when I was pulling this wire through, I found unexpected \\"ends\\" in the middle of the spool.

I have to wade through these songs to get to the ones I like and then one of the main songs I ordered the cd for, isn't on this one. It's like bait and switch. The case was cracked, too.

All I have so far is an image of Anna enjoying her surrounds on Cumberland Island. I don't know why I bothered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really liked it.","review":"One of the things I like most about Nevada Barr books is that the main characters seem like real people. In addition to the interesting story lines and unconventional crime solving techniques, there are no trite, sappy, easy ways to deal with relationships, just as there aren't any in real life. That's one of the things that makes the stories so good and so real"},{"rating":"1","title":"great story, but not a great reader","review":"I'm a fan of Nevada Barr and enjoyed the plot of this book, but Cindy Williams makes this one hard to listen too. She reads like she is racing to the end in a performance with all the passion and variety of a lump of coal. Buy the book; it is an engaging story. But wait for an unabridged audio version read by Barbara Rosenblat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Book of the Century","review":"This book was, in our opinion, certainly not the book of the century, but it had a few good points. The story of an older, somewhat moody park ranger that enjoys skinny-dipping off the coast of Georgia isn't exactly the type of thing that normal high-school students would usually indulge in, but the book was interesting mostly because of the plot. It was easy to become enthralled with the mystery happening before Anna Pigeon's (the park ranger) eyes, but the story was frequently interrupted by a completely unrelated topic. One can only be bothered that these \\"interruptions\\" make the story hard to follow, and even harder to believe. There were so many twists and turns in Endangered Species that it makes it easy to compare this book to a bad, made-for-TV movie on CBS. The story probably relates much more to the older people of the world, so if you aren't in that category, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This author has a wonderful gift and her Anna Pigeon books are an important addition to the genre. The outdoorsy Park Ranger background themes are interesting and colourful and truly complement the mystery in the story. What is wonderful about this author is that when she says Anna is tired, sweaty, drunk, cramped, etc, you can really feel it!I would recommend this and any other book in the Anna Pigeon series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unendurable","review":"This book was on somebody's Amazon.com LISTMANIA for Sea Turtles, so I hunted it down. It is only vaguely about sea turtles, in that it is set on an island in Georgia where sea turtles nest. There is a sea turtle biologist introduced at the very beginning of the book, and then he disappears, so it's obvious that he was involved in the crime.There are way too many characters in this book to keep track of and most of them are not believable or likable. I wish this book had at least been fun to read but it was tedious and I ended up skimming the whole thing, looking for any sign of sea turtle interaction. Skip this book and send your $6.99 to a sea turtle hospital instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly inept attempt at adventure","review":"Beneath all the metaphors, similes, and unendingly long and unnecessarily descriptive passages, there is a story, but if you don't die of boredom trying to find it, you will surely lose any sense of continuity. Ms. Barr should take a lesson on how to tell a story with wit and purpose from Patricia Cornwell, who can bring life to characters and impart needed historical perspectives at the same time. After reading reviews of this author, I borrowed three of her latest books, this being the first I read. I doubt I'll bother with the other two. A total letdown, and I am a very patient reader with less than excellent authors. Pass this up and get the Kay Scarpetta books instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great textbook!","review":"I've been searching a long time for a Japanese textbook that was truly effective.

It progresses in a way that actually makes sense and helps you really retain the information. I've learned more from this book in just a few weeks than I have from all the others I've tried learning from over the last two years. I will definitely be purchasing the rest of the books in this series and using the wonderful online companion as well. I've already recommended this series to my friends and family that are studying Japanese and I would recommend it to you too."},{"rating":"1","title":"An ok book","review":"I really enjoy this book a writing practice but to learn Japanese from nothing it isn't that good for. First, it doesn't give you all the pronunciations that you need to know Japanese(ie desu is pronunced deh-sue and dess depending on how it's being used),it just gives you the very basic of the basics. Second, to learn Japanese you need to know how it sounds and how to speak it. It would be a great series if these two things were changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!!!!","review":"THIS BOOK IS HORRIBLE!!! I bought this thinking it would be good but this book is not worth the money. I looks like someone copied and pasted random online lessons and book it all in a book.

The book starts from the very basic of Japanese grammar and starts building on it without making me feel overwhelmed. And that's saying something as usually I suck at grammar. It also teaches hiragana bit by bit, reviewing the ones learned before in later chapters. As bad as my memory was, I was still able to remember the old stuff while learning the new. I personally find it easier if you skimmed over the next chapter a day before you actually do it, kind of like how you preview the material before going to class. One thing about this though is there's no cd to learn proper enunciation. So instead, I try to learn by watching Japanese drama and catching vocabularies and phrases I learned in their dialogs. Overall, excellent book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Japanese from Zero great way to boost your Japanese!!","review":"I bought the set of 3 books last year and thought that the first one was not going to be much of a help because I already know Hiragana, Katakana and the first grades of Kanji, but it is great and fun to use the first book.If you are new to Japanese, this book is a great way to start as it name implies, it goes from zero to a grand level of fluency, loved all the vocabulary that I learned on the first book and which is a lot more interesting are the cultural clips it has in some of the lessons you will learn some things that a school wouldn't probably teach you, books 2 and 3 are awesome as well.For anybody interested in learning Japanese I would recommend this series Japanese from Zero, the three books, and you have to dedicate a lot of time into it but it's totally worth it, Regards"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Doorbell Cover","review":"Very nice detailing.

To be fair, there isn't much competition when it comes to medical dictionaries, it's either Stedman's or Taber's. Stedman's update is usually 4 to 5 years, but you'll only notice the lack of new words if you're in the research field. Taber's tends to release a new edition every year or two, plus you get more words at a lower price. In terms of the definitions in Taber's, it's written to be just a bit more considerate for the layman. Whereas in Stedman's, you would probably need to be at least a medical student or higher to make the most use of it. Best solution is to get both, at least one of the two definitions will make better sense to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Choices Out There","review":"I've owned this dictionary for 6 months and the pages are already falling out.

Great for a young student but if you are planning on entertaining a few people it would be wise to opt for one you may have to pay a little more for.The only thing I was disappointed with is the quality of the Pegs (they seem to slip alot not allowing the strings to be held tight enough to hold the bridge in place). This is surprising especially for the supposed List Price of $249.95. Other than that it is pretty good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't maintain tuning and only produces scratchy sound","review":"Upon opening the case, this violin, bought for our son, does not feel like a toy. We soon discovered, however, that the tuning pegs are extremely poorly designed and manufactured. They fail to maintain tuning for any longer than half a minute. The peg and hole system is so loose and imprecise that we could actually see the pegs unspinning all by themselves as the strings were tightened--even after trying repeatedly to push the pegs further into the holes. Another major noticeable flaw is the impossibility of playing any decent, clean violin sound, no matter how much rosin we passed on the bow, which was properly tightened (my wife is a former violin player and attested to this). With tuning pegs that seem to belong to a cheap toy and do not maintain any tuning whatsoever and with a bow that only produced scratchy sound instead of clean musical notes, we believe this product needs to improve such flaws prior to being offered in the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good violin for you money","review":"I bought my new violin on 12/29/2006, I received on 01/03/2007, with one day off new year day, that fast then I expected. the violin delivery in very good condition, expect G & D strings lose and can not find production document, I think everything is \\"OK\\", the bow and violin coombine very good sound, compaired with my old one bought on 1983 with $250 , You will feel you are luck to find one.

It gives you a full value for half the price of other violins. Since it is a full size,it allows you to play it for years without outgrowing it. Many full size violins cost around $119. It is very durable and the string material lasts up to 10 months of regular play until weathering wears out the strings. However, this is not a professional violin on which you can do good trills and vibratos. This shouldn't be a problem for first time players though. Another downside is that its regular case does not provide the protection that this product needs. An accidental shove to the wall can cause severe damage to the bridge and pegs. The owner should be very careful while travelling or buy a hard case. Other than that, I recommend this violin to any beginner player who wants to get the most out of a violin."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH IT","review":"Not worth the money.

We looked on a few other sites after already buying this violin here, and found that we could have instead of paying $110, only paid $80.

In the end it became nothing more than an advertisement for abstinence until marriage. The characters had external quirks and lots of them (some very annoying, like the overweight black woman who ends almost every sentence with \\"uh-huh\\") but their inner lives were flat, uni-dimensional, caricatures of godly Christians. The biggest conflict in the book was the narrator arguing himself out of more than a few kisses with his new girlfriend (who of course thanks him for really respecting her enough not to kiss her).

In retrospect, it was underrated. Perhaps it is best described as light metal, with some progressive touches. The musicianship is excellent, with solid guitar work, and pleasant organ backgrounds. The vocals are smooth, with nice harmonies. With the exception of one cover, which seems out of place, the songwriting is inspired, with interesting melodies and unusual lyrical themes.

The sound is very good, however, and that makes up for NINJA'S shortcomings.It is known that this album was the reason that Joe Bouchard departed from BOC and mainly for the direction of the music that left him more than a shade dissatisfied.But...never to fear...in 1988 Blue Oyster Cult released their best album...the monster known as IMAGINOS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wonder","review":"Yes, I wonder that with such a low level of regard that this disk costs so much.I especially like \\"Dancin' In The Ruins\\" and \\"When The War Comes\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE B.O.C.

Longtime keyboardist-guitarist Allen Lanier (who these days looks worse than Keith Richards) was smart enough to stay away this time out. There's also a lot of outside songwriting on this LP, which wouldn't bother me if the songs were decent, but they're not. What we have here is one good song (\\"Perfect Water\\"), one decent outside-penned \\"Burnin' For You\\" re-write (\\"Dancin' In The Ruins\\") and a whole lot of songs that aren't even worth mentioning. Why Koch reissued this turkey over the also-out-of-print (and far superior) \\"Imaginos\\" is anybody's guess.

Bloom's songs are just plain stupid; \\"Make Rock Not War\\" and \\"Beat Em' Up\\" (can we say conflicting philosophies) are the worst songs in the band's history,at least up to this point.

As for Alan not performing any of this material, I guess he changed his mind as Perfect Water is part of their usual set list now. BOC's sound has evolved over time similar to Rush.

The whole process was amazingly hassle-free. I found Part 1 of the book (the section for parents, which contains complete information about the psychology and physiology of \\"toilet learning\\") fascinating.

There's a banner that runs across the upper-right-hand corner of the book's front cover that reads, \\"The classic bestseller.\\" I can certainly see why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toilet Learning","review":"EVERY parent should have this book. We read it to both our sons and we didnt potty train them this book did. Its great bonding time too because you read it every day to your child starting way before they are old enough to potty train and by the time they are old enough- the works done for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"this worked for us","review":"I thought this book was very helpful for me as a parent and also for my son-- i love that the photos are of an androgenous child so that it could work for a boy or a girl. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks...but no thanks","review":"First, Somewhere on Amazon.com I read that the pictures in this book are FULL COLOR. They are NOT. I did not find this book helpful at all as far as showing the pictures to my son while he sits on the toilet. He has no interest in looking at these cartoon people. I've never seen a kid have less of an interest in anything in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"At first,","review":"I thought while watching this, \\"Why do I continually let these Sundance crackbabies convince me to spend my money?\\", and was ready to shut it off after a half hour of indie not-as-clever-as it-thinks 'comedy'. Then my wife blurted out, \\"Its Macbeth! Shakespeare's Macbeth!\\" The movie immediately got better, because I finally understood the motivations, the burn, and Andy Dick. From there on I was able to supend my disbelief and watch it all fall into place. Made solely for fun, from what I can tell, so soak it in, lighten up, and buy the Cliff's Notes so you can be in on the joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange movie","review":"Hmmm. I originally bought the movie because I am a Christopher Walken fan and he stars in it. I was disappointed that there are only a few scenes which he is in and his character lacks depth. Not typical for Christopher Walken characters. The movie is lame at best and would be like something you'd find late night while you're flipping around the channels when there is nothing to watch. Don't waste your time, thumbs down on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"fabulous","review":"I didn't even realize at first that this was a riff off of Macbeth, but I got the joke and I enjoyed it.

Before you know it, they've killed him and turned the restaurant into \\"McBeth's\\" with a huge M arch. Just like the original story, Pat and Mac start freaking out a bit when McDuff (Christopher Walken) doesn't accept the scapegoat they set up and starts investigating Duncan's murder further. All does not end well.Everyone else I talked to seemed to love this, so maybe it was just me, but apart from the three furies (Andy Dick is one of them) who tell McBeth's future with a magic 8 ball, and Christopher Walken's vegetarian,gentle McDuff, this all fell a bit flat. The comedy did not really stand out and all the characters are played so unsympathetically, that who cares what happens to them. Occasional glimmers of smart dialogue, but mainly this left me wanting to go read the original again."},{"rating":"2","title":"clever spin off of macbeth","review":"Great little movie.

I bought this thinking that it would be superior as its direct from Warner Bros and paid double what the old UK DVD cost me and was hoping for a much better quality print. Im finding after many purchases of WB Archive discs that even though they are coming from Warner Bros they are not always that great quality, in fact picture quality on many is below what they show on TV in the UK, why is this???If you want this film try to get the old Odyssey DVD, its far better.I bought it then sold it on ebay afrer getting the better british issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED!","review":"Had the pleasure of seeing you the foodtv network with david raggirio, and boy did your outdoor chicken cookout with your family look good! couldn't wait to see if you had a cookbook out, and you did, i bought it.... went through and marked all the recipes i couldn't wait to try...still trying to figure out which recipe is the one shown on the show i mentioned above....anyway my first recipe was \\"Owens plain ol' baked wings\\" i followed the recipe to the letter! honey, those wings still ain't \\"crispy on the outside!\\" it took me turning up the heat, draining the water left in the pan, and cooking those wings yet ANOTHER 45 minutes before I saw crispy! please tell me that was a typeo?

I was just terribly disappointed. If I'm not mistaken, Olive Ann Burns didn't even get to finish this novel before she died and someone else took it over and had it published. Makes me wonder if she would've done it better or just scrapped the whole idea of a sequel if she'd lived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing after Cold Sassy Tree","review":"Burns' work was not completed by herself, and the transition of authors is painfully obvious.

The finished section was ok, but reading the author's notes as to possibilities that should, could or would happen next were very unfulfilling.

Unfortunately there is not enough of a story in this book to be classified as a sequel. I finished it feeling very unfulfilled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaving Cold Sassy","review":"Those who have read the marvelous \\"Cold Sassy Tree\\" by Olive Ann Burns will be sorely disappointed by this sequel. There is none of the charm and story telling mastery of the original novel in this pitiful book. It seems to be put together hastily and by people who did not care that it would bring shame to the original. Olive Ann was ailing when she wrote the few chapters of this sequel and it is almost as if a different person were writing it. It seems rushed and does a wonderful job of destroying the main characters that the original developed so beautifully. If you have read Cold Sassy Tree and are wondering whether or not to read this sequel, be warned, if you read it you would have a bad taste in your mouth and will feel cheated.This book will take away from the warmth that you felt when you finished reading the fine book, Cold Sassy Tree.Those who decided to go ahead and print these few chapters did Olive Ann Burns and her readers a disservice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tribute to Cold Sassy and the late author","review":"Olive Ann Burns died far too young. She had so much to offer and I am selfishly saddened that she did not live long enough to leave a large body of works for us to read. She had started a sequel to Cold Sassy Tree and left many notes about how it was to develop. After her death, her close friend and editor compiled those notes to produce this unfinished sequel of Will Tweedy's life. It is frustrating that the story is unfinished, but I was thankful to read what was written. The book also includes a long reminiscence of Olive Ann, her life, and her struggle with the illness that eventually took her life. She was a remarkable woman and I thank her editor for taking the time and effort to prepare this for her readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad","review":"this was a very sad book knowing that it wasn't completed due to the author's untimely death, so it leaves one unfulfilled and sadened.

There were some good shots of the blonds and redheads but not much else. Don't be fooled by the cover! It's not near the word of hardcore. The only thing close it the Girl/Girl fake 69 part in the beginning. If you are looking for hardcore than look at Spice they offer some good scenes that involve girls touching each other much more naughtier than Playboy. Playboy just does have any hardcore at all simply put. Save your money and buy something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Camera Work","review":"The camera work was poor in this video.

No Way.","review":"Indeed, it explains XML and DTD's pretty well. But probably, you're looking for more. Especially when the back-cover mentions \\"Coverage includes 'XSL', 'Converting HTML to XML', 'WIDL',...\\" The book merely 'touches' these topics. For real implementation instructions, it redirects you to the Internet. Other books offer you the same thing AND much more (eg. the 'XML Bible' for great XSL-coverage and 'XML by Example' for a Java-point-of-view)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Boy! It finished teaching HTML....","review":"I thought this book was supposed to be teaching us XML but it goes on about HTML and how it is the distant cousin of XML and how XML is soon going to be the parent of HTML. The author hasn't even tried to get in-depth of the whole XML concept it seems as though the author just wanted to get a book out and here was a great opportunity for her. The author gets into a subject and does not explain it there and then instead you are referred to another \\"Skill\\" in the book. That becomes frustrating. If you really want to learn XML better get another book, you will be wasting your time, money and mind on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst book","review":"From the beginning of the book, the author stated that the buyer of the book will eventually \\"get their hands dirty\\" in later chapter. That's what I have been hoping for. After I have finished almost three quarter of the book, I still have not seen any hand-ons tutorial that I could do. All I got from the book was long-winded explaination.My advise is, find another book if you really want to learn XML."},{"rating":"1","title":"XML in \\"what...\\" time?","review":"Warning: Do not buy this book! This was one of the worse technical books ever printed. If you are a serious programmer (which you should be if you are learning XML) you will be wasting your money if you purchase this book. For the first 150 or so pages, it is about HTML and it's basics. It attempted to explain about XML and DTD like other XML books but it seemed like the author lack the knowledge of XML. For every 10 lines of sample XML codes, there are 30 pages explaining each code and syntax. Examples are useless; they have no real world functions besides for displaying on a web browser. If you are looking to learn XML for integration and real world applications, DON'T WASTE MONEY BUYING THIS BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book will make you cry tears of pure boredom","review":"A horrible book. Possibly the worst ever written. If you want to learn XML, please go somewhere else, or at least read through some of this book before buying.

I WOULD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a help!","review":"I appreciate this book immensely because of the practical approach that Dr Latham uses. He discusses principles of character as lived and taught by Jesus as found in the Holy Bible. He includes real life scenarios and situations that illustrate typical responses to problem behaviors but more importantly the Christlike actions parents can take toward problem behaviors. He quotes scripture to increase understanding of the significance of applying the principles and associated benefits therefrom.

I do agree about the breakdown of the family but I don't agree it is the fault of gay families.Besides the opening chapter this is the best parenting book I've ever read. And should be read by every Bible quoting parent who continues to hit their children. Would Jesus hit his kids? No. Would he ridicule them into behaving? No. His approach is so life-affirming and respectful, it's a breath of fresh air.Throw the other child-hating, violence-advocating books way and get this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Demonstrates How Well These 3 Religions Can Interconnect","review":"This book is an inspirational work taking a look at people who classify themselves as Christian or Jewish, but who commit themselves also to the teachings of the Buddha.

All three traditions are ancient, but spiritual practice is new and exciting for anyone who engages themselves in it's wonderful arms. All three paths take practice and dedication, not one of them we simply understand \\"right off the bat.\\" This book truly is fascinating in it's representation of all three dominant world religions and how one can successfully utilize the very best of the teachings offered by them all.

If a well trained Secret Agent Man can't escape, what hope would you have?Patrick McGoohan, who also co-created the series, stars as Number 6 a former government agent who won't reveal to anyone why he abruptly quit his position with the agency.

A and E advertises the special features in vol. 1 including deleted scenes and clips. Actually, these are a couple of short b-roll clips without sound. In other words, they are literally a 30 second shot of a file cabinet and then a silent shot of some other prop. These are just scraps from the editing floor...not even outtakes. It's just an a stupid reason to claim \\"special features\\".As for the show itself. It looks great and if you're predisposed to like this kind of stuff...it's great.

This particular CD - The Black Russian, falls short of all his other productions.Outside of 'A Child Is born' (which can be found on his Anthology), the rest of the music is just not good.

What a piece of junk! My son is almost 9 months old, and although he liked the sounds and look of the toy it is very difficult to push, turn, pull the buttons. He would rather just chew on the toy then play with it. Plus, it was broken. One of the pop-ups comes up every time you push another button.

Very disappointed with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful - little fingers will get hurt in this toy!","review":"My son loves the Baby Einstein video tapes, so we had to show him this toy when we saw it at the store. He was delighted in playing with it for about 5-10 minutes when suddenly his little finger got stuck in one of the holes (where the characters pop up and down). He screamed and could not get his finger out. I had trouble getting his finger out also because the character was wedged against his finger. This toy is not safe. It should be redesigned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much better alternatives out there","review":"My son is almost 7 months old and we tried this in the store. He has a Sesame Street pop-up toy that he absolutely loves, but even though he can close them by himself, he has a very hard time manipulating the levers to open them. I was hoping to find one that was better suited to his little hands. This toy is the complete opposite of what I was looking for. This was just as hard if not harder than the Sesame Street to work, and he just didn't care for it anyway. I found the Fisher Price Bobble & Giggle Pals for less money and he LOVES it. The levers are just the right sensitivity for him, not too sensitive, not too hard. The animals play different sounds each time they are opened and even play music. I highly recommended the Fisher Price one over this. It isn't here on Amazon, but I've seen them at Walmart, Target and Toys R' Us stores."},{"rating":"1","title":"This toy doesn' t work well","review":"This toy is defective and doesn't do what it is advertised to do. The sounds play even without the animal popping up.. Music is supposed to play after each animal pops up, but most of the time it doesn't play. The cow doesn't reset without playing with the milk bottle. There are a LOT of sharp edges, and I wouldn't let my child play with it without me constantly trying to keep his hands out of the animal holes... Overall this is a very poor quality product that's getting returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE A TRIP BACK TO RETURN THIS TOY!","review":"I totally agree with the other negative reviews!!! Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews until after the purchased the thing. The edges are sharp and the buttons are way too difficult to maneuver.

My 10 month old really enjoys the Popin Pals and can manipulate it with ease.

We press the bone button and the dog pops up with the bird. We press the green button and the bird pops up with the dog. We press the cheese button and the mouse doesn't pop up at all. EVER. Pushing the animals back down, the dog pops up on his own accord without us touching anything. My daughter quickly grew bored of this toy and it's unpredictability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk Junk Junk","review":"I have never written a review before but had to because this toy is the worst toy we've had.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money !","review":"We received this as a gift for my son and he, like the others who have commented, has gotten his fingers pinched while pushing the animals down. There are sharp & pointy edges, the triggers are to hard for him in his age group (can't pull the milk can or turn the dog bone), the bird never stays shut & dog will pop up without any sound....it's delayed.

The booklet states that 16 gimmicked cards are enclosed, and then proceeds to describe only 15 such cards - omitting the gimmicked 8 of clubs. The trick is simply not mentioned anywhere in the booklet. I checked the publisher's site, and it has the same product description as Amazon. It also has a page preview link - guess which page it calls up - yes, the \\"Eight of Clubs that makes a matchstick levitate!\\" page.

It also comes with a very thick instruction book, written by 'Mr. Mysterio', a magicicain from the 20's.

Plus, this collection features nifty pen-and-ink ilustrations by Burton himself and rare photos of his earlier works. However, the material spans only up to Ed Wood (since this was published in 1995), which is duly unfortunate since the book's format keeps things interesting for the reader. Otherwise, the readers are likely to get a sumptuous serving of Burton's off-kilter insights.

The book is great if you're longing for some back ground on his movies. I wanted a little more of Tim talking about Tim-it lacks some personal emotion and depth. (Maybe I'm just too nosey).

Couple of chuckles (theme song was good for a chuckle), and a few good barbs at world leaders, but overall a snoozefest.

I was not sad about losing Alec Baldwin, Matt Damon, or George Clooney (I changed my mind). I still love those panthers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes!","review":"This is a really bad movie. I'm a fan of the South Park film and was expecting the same sort of thing with Team America: the witty satire, the sharp comedy, the clever songs. Instead, Team America turned out to be an unfunny bore.While watching this movie, I spent a good deal of time trying to figure out where exactly the comedy lies. What was I supposed to be laughing at? The dialogue isn't clever, but rather predictable and clich��d. The characters are either stereotypes or archetypes drawn so broadly as to not even resemble anyone remotely life-like.Nothing in the film was shocking or surprising. Even the sudden bursts of profanity had a ho-hum quality after watching South Park. The much talked about marionette sex scene was simply stupid and I can't believe it got so much press.I was really surprised at how little I liked this film. It was truly awful. Thank god it was a rental and I didn't actually spend money buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfair!","review":"I thought people weren't ALLOWED to make movies like this in America! Roger Ebert was right--anyone who hates Hollywood like this is a NIHILIST! If you can't love Hollywood, can you really be capable of the greatest love of all? When I cry my way through the Academy Awards, I feel sorry for the kind of people who made this movie. Is it funny to see a Tim Robbins puppet burned to death? Is it funny to see Sean Penn's arm ripped off by a panther/house cat? Is it funny to see Janeane Garafalo's head blown inside-out? Okay, that one was funny, but even Goebbels got a few gags in now and then. The point is, those fine actors are only guilty of caring and of having an opinion. We will never have a tollerant society until people like Trace and Matt are silenced, outlawed, sent to Gulags, and then silenced again.

I canceled the download before it was halfway complete."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak, Empty, Garbage","review":"The main problem with this witless mess is that the gags are stale out of the bag. Most of this material, in fact, was old when it was used in Hot Shots part II. However, what is most offensive was how it lets Neoconservatives completely off the hook. The inept World Police take all their orders from a computer, rather than a venal Bush-like weasel. In fact, Kim Il doesn't come off half as evil as the Hollywood celebrities; who are guilty of having opinions. For this the filmmakers blow their heads off. Cute. This film has no audience because it jumps into an issue in which real lives are being lost, and plays the whole situation for cheap nihilistic laughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mean, boring and nauseatingly dumb movie","review":"I can't believe the creators of much loved SouthPark could come up with such brainless nonsense.

It's absolutely guaranteed that SOME part of \\"Team America\\" is going to offend you. However, even that part will make you laugh. And the parts that don't offend you will nearly kill you.I still can't believe how hard I laughed at this movie. I missed huge chunks of it, as I tried to get myself under control. This is EASILY the funniest movie I've seen in the last 10 years. The only movies that I can think of that hold a candle to it are \\"Young Frankenstein\\" and \\"Blazing Saddles\\".If you're easily offended, don't even bother. You may spontaneously combust. It's that bad.If you can take this in the spirit it was intended (stupid, gross, offensive humor for it's own sake), take a deep breath, don't try to eat or drink while watching, and have at it.

Unfortunately, this film is technically creative with the puppets but otherwise an over the top experiment with crudeness and a very weak story. The moments I found humorous were few and far between. Caught myself falling asleep several times (despite coffee). With all the hype this movie received, and the long delay before DVD release, I expected far more. This one is going to the used bin. Agreeing with other reviewers, this is definitely not a family film (not that I ever thought it was)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Team America - World Police (Uncensored and Unrated Special Collector's Edition) ~ Trey Parker","review":"Team America - World Police (Uncensored and Unrated Special Collector's Edition)~ Trey Parker is a splendid movie and a brilliant work of satire. It attacks the smug attitude of Hollywood, Broadway, and with songs like \\"I am so ronery\\" and the pearl harbor song which totally slammed the movied and the acting ability of Ben Affleck. The movie pulls no punshes and offends both democrats and republicans equally and is quite explicit both in terms of crude language and sexually with the sex scene with the puppets. Trey Parker and Matt Stone are brilliant and this piece of work is right up their with Swift when it comes to biting satire and is one of the best movies in the last decade. I loved it and I will see it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not near as funny as South Park","review":"And the politics suddenly go righter-than-right (but still well to the left of Attila the Hun). I thought I'd like it a lot more than I did. There are some funny moments throughout, the sex scene, the puking scene, the Team America Theme Song scene. The plot is not exactly suspenseful, if you say it's a comedy and doesn't need a plot, the comedy is pretty sparse. For the whole film, you're waiting for something really funny to happen, but it never does. Some people complain about 'perceived political content' well hello, it is a comedy about politics, much more so than say, Austin Powers or even Maxwell Smart (remember him?) That would be fine, regardless of what tack it took, if it was a really funny film, but to me it was a wasted opportunity. I'd like to laugh at this film. But I can only laugh NEAR it, it seems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been a great movie, but....","review":"Team America had all the ingredients for a really great movie. By utilizing the Supermarionation-style puppetry and merging it with pop culture and political satire, it could have been the most original movie of the year. Unfortunately, Trey Parker and Matt Stone seem to be addicted to vulgarity, and the flurry of f-words in their theatrical films would have made Richard Pryor blush. The few clever satirical points they made were overshadowed by the foul language, graphic sex, and gratuitous violence that was peppered all over the film. I was particularly turned off by the ridiculously long puking scene, as well as the homosexual encounter between Gary and his boss.Ultimately, I found Team America: World Police to be a disappointing waste of time, when it could have been a tribute to those wonderful Gerry Anderson kid shows we watched back in the 1960's."},{"rating":"1","title":"very funny but its too overblown for me...not the worst","review":"I think Trey Parker and Matt Stone out did themselves on this project. I admit they did an awesome job on the whole movie with the choreographed action scenes but what the hell is up with the puppet sex and the 2 minute puking. It was South Park but in puppet version but I didnt like it that much. Though I thought the fact that the bad guy was Kim Jon Il was hilarious and his puppet is awesome and him singing a song was better. The Team America theme song was funny too and also that fact that they made those celebrity puppets and killed them all was a riot as well. Best parts are all with the Kim Jon Il puppet. Very, very offense in everyway and if you can handle that sort of thing it's fine but sensitive people beware, this is not a rejected episode of Thunderbirds its way different. Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ha, ha, ha...NOT!","review":"This movie did nothing for me, it was incredibly corny, and I felt that the writers were whingeing just to hear themselves whinge!I'm giving this movie two stars for the songs, which even though they were childish, still made this otherwise mundane movie bearable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"I'm not a huge Southpark fan, think its fairly funny when I stumble across it when channel surfing, but don't go out of my way to track it down. This movie, however is hilarious. No one goes unscathed. This movie brings some perspective to American intervention overseas, moronic celebrities with an insufferable sense of self importance, evil dictators, the UN, the French, country music, gays, straights and many more. Sure it is crude humor, but it is very funny. The songs are hilarious, the dialogue is clever and just watching the puppets made it all the more absurd and funny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST MOVIE IN THE ENTIRE GALAXY!!!!!!","review":"I'm quite sure Team America - Unrated is the best movie I will ever see in my entire life..... and.....

I agree with what one other reviewer said about they could have used more voices. Also, what is it about Matt Damon being only able to say his own name?Also, Kim Jong-Il is one of the best movie villains of 2005! I've heard he loves Hollywood films. I'd dearly love to see his reaction after viewing this one!Funny, but PLEASE don't rent it for the kids!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I watch it over and over","review":"My personal top 10, so I was very happy to find it on Amazon Prime. If you don't like this movie, you've probably always voted and/or never smoked pot (exceptions, of course). Among many other things, they do a great job of making fun of every American action blockbuster (hence the poor script and excessive explosions). Trey and Matt sweat the details.Best enjoyed by the people who see the far right and far left as equally ridiculous and hilarious. Just different brands of crazy, silly, BS."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny as hell","review":"leave it to MATT and TREY to rip virtually everything the united states does and stands for a new one . the soundtrack alone is priceless . ripping off the lame THUNDERBIRDS as a launching point for humor and commentary was inspired . while difficult to watch in a mostly empty movie theater , once at home you're free to laugh with abandon while watching one of the funniest films ever concieved . seeing MOORE blow himself up is worth the price of admission alone . genius . flawless . thanks guys ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch it with no great expectations.","review":"Everyone had told me about how great this movie was, so I was really excited to see it - I have a very un p.c. sense of humor, and think that South Park is actually not too bad. (except it went over board with the whole AIDS thing, like Team America - that's one thing, along with rape and domestic violence that I think shouldn't be 'made' to be funny)However, this just wasn't funny at all. It was total potty humor - no intelligence at all. The only funny thing was the President of China's song - where every 'L' is pronounced 'R'.I give it two stars due to how well the puppets where handled, and the sets where great - it's visually amazing, so turn down the volume and you'll have a more enjoyable experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"whaaaatt","review":"Absolutely had to get this according to all the \\" in\\" people.Well , I have to take their \\"taste\\" from now on with a grain of salt.Am open to all kinds of movies ,from drawn out superslow Swedish art movies to bang em up vitrol violence ,and this is some kinda Kult movie ?Guess I'm not joiningDull and boringLost half my brain trying to find something to give me a smirkMost of the sex scene we already did at grade six in art classwith the teacher looking bored to deathJanK"},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"I loved this movie, the reason is that it didn't get five stars is because of the sex scene they put in this movie.

This is laughably the SAME THING as South Park. With the SAME VOICE overs and TOO MUCH of the same crass humor. I should have listened to the reviews that say that some people never mature past 16, it looks more like 12 to me.It's just South Park with marionettes. These guys should call it quits. It has become boring. Their creativity has expired when it comes to making this kind of thing. Yes I looked for the nuances and the smart humor \\"hidden\\" within, yet is done so tastelessly that I cannot say I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I fell asleep","review":"America - F yea!That's the best part of the movie. I watched it due to the hype. How can so many people be wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Team America World Police","review":"I was disappointed with the film as a whole even though it started well for me. I bought the DVD primarily because of what the film makers did on the South Park series as well as being a big fan of the Thunderbirds series.The first thirty minutes of the film was great since it not only had the Thunderbird feel but with more edge and more hard core on the action sequence. The film then subsequently faded and dragged on with the story meandering on around the lead character. I was most disgusted with the love scene since it was irrelevant to the film but felt it was created just to turn people off. I could do with vulgar but it was also crude for me and very repulsive.Overall a very credible effort from the makers since it is really hard work putting together a feature length film with marionettes but their jokes and treatment may work fine with a thirty minute cartoon, it became quite unbearable when it went beyond an hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vulgarity Overshadows Message","review":"Yes there were some great political barbs but who wrote this, a pimply group of 13 year old boys?

That being said, the crude vulgarity factor of the film is high (and disgusting). The \\"F\\" bomb is dropped so much that I was turned off. Body function scenes don't win Oscars from me either, so the film lost some stars from me over this, also. This could have been so much better if it had been less of a gross-out film and more of a satire."},{"rating":"1","title":"targets are clear","review":"The politics of this film are quite clear. Just take a look at who's targeted. Cheney, Wolfowitz, and co are left alone while anyone who criticised the war in Iraq is presented as dim-witted friends of Kim Jong-Il. Neither the Bush government nor the Israeli government face any substantial critical commentary, while Arabs are represented on the whole as brainless psychopaths and anti-war activists as not much better.I must say that I am/was a fan of South Park, and I even laughed at Orgazmo. But this was not funny, indeed I'd be surprised if anyone bar the more jingoistic sections of American public found it so. I really can't see the joke in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"90 minutes of not laughing","review":"It's as if Fox News outsourced comedy writers and puppeteers to produce a right-wing extravaganza for prepubescent boys.

I'll give you your restraint!","review":"Not that this needs another review, but...a lot of funny stuff here that would have been great at an R-rated level of grossness. The filmmakers could use a trusted friend who can say to them, uh, guys? This could still be funny and even a lot funnier (and to more people) if you'd just show an eensy-weensy bit of restraint. [...] It was a lot more than I needed to see. Similarly, the incessant F-bombs wear you out eventually. This is too bad because some of this stuff is hilarious, like the opening scene in which Team America \\"saves\\" Paris while destroying the Louvre and the Eiffel tower in the process, and the scene in which Kim Jong Il captures arms inspector \\"Hans Brix.\\" Although it's \\"ronery\\" at the top, as Kim points out, this film spends a little too much time in search of the bottom, and then digging deeper when it gets there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh?","review":"I used to be a big fan of \\"South Park\\". Then after I felt it ran its course after a couple seasons, it kept going and going and going, so eventually I stopped watching it (not having cable helps a lot). Anyway, \\"Team America\\" came out on DVD and I felt that since this was supposed to be a little more \\"sophisticated\\" than \\"South Park\\", I'd give it a shot.Amazingly, except for their parody of \\"Rent\\", the entire film was way too serious and straight and the novelty of having marionettes wore off after a few minutes. I was bored. I sped through the end. Sorry.Also, Trey Parker and Matt Stone should really work on some different character voices. All of their character voices sound like Terrance and Philip, and although those voices seem to work for those obnoxious characters from \\"South Park\\", they come off as extraordinarily irritating in \\"Team America\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heck no!","review":"I agree with the person above who said that \\"Team America\\" was not very funny, especially compared to the creators' other movie, \\"The South Park Movie.\\" Both feature vulgar dialouge and images, but only the latter is really witty.The first few moments of the movie seemed promising, but after the first fourth of the movie, things went downhill, relying on recycled crude jokes. I expected the humor to be potty-level, but it never elevated above that. Nor was their depth to the humor, as there is in the Simpsons or The Family Guy. In fact, this movie is worth flushing down the toilet.Good aspects of the movie: The set was creative, and it was an interesting and ambitious idea to use puppets instead of real actors or animation.I also recommend along with another comment-er that if you still desire to view this movie, that you rent the movie and not pay to see it at a theatre--and split the cost of the rental with friends, because otherwise you may still regret that you paid too much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"team america juvenile attept at humor","review":"What a heap of junk!

Yeah, but it's still homophobic. And not in a good way. Or a funny way. Or even in an outrageous way - it's just tired. Funniest bits are the songs and when they play up the limitations of using marionettes. The average South Park episode is a lot funnier."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNBELIEVABLY Bad","review":"Wow. This is one of those films that you struggle trying to convey how bad it really is. But put it this way. I bought it on Pay Per View and downloaded to my DVR. After sitting through the first fifteen minutes (fast forwarding a lot), I finally gave up and just put it at x4 speed. It still dragged.If you're a South Park fan, don't think that this will automatically mean you'll like this movie. South Park is fast moving with some depth and wit. This film, despite being 3D puppets, is flat and wouldn't know wit if it blew it up (which happens a lot in this movie).It's not funny. It's not well done. It's a waste of time and money (I finally zipped through at x300. It still dragged).The bottom line? Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie ever viewed","review":"What the movie is about, from what I gathered, is a team (World Police) that wants to kill off the terrorists. They want to recruit someone, and well, basically if you think of the typical format, you have the movie. guy comes in, doesn't want to join, later decides to, runs off, other guys in trouble, he comes back, has to save the day, and does.I am Conversation, and this is mostly bashing left wing liberals, but that didn't make a difference. This movie was horrible. If I was home, I would have turned this off within the first 15 minutes of it, but I was at my sisters house and I didn't have my car with me (under repairs), so there I sat, a whole 98 minutes of garbage.Watch American Carol with Kevin Farley.

I'm beginning to think with all the earthquakes in California maybe the best thing is to have a huge one where the entire State of California will just fall into the ocean. Then and maybe then will someone of talent make movies that are enjoyable to everyone. Right now there is no more talent in Hollywood, nither actors, producers or directors. This film made me feel embarrased that the rest of the world sees what little talent we have in america."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-hyped, predictable and childish","review":"The problem with this film is not that Trey Parker and Matt Stone have taken a politically-incorrect stance in this film, that they attack popular entertainment figures, or that they are offensive and use stereotypes - these are all excusable with a good script. Sadly, contrary to everything said about this movie, the jokes are repetitive (think scene after scene of the same gags being wheeled out, puerile physical humour and bland, childish satire which misses the mark), and the puppets are poorly animated, often the source of \\"look how jerkily they move\\" comedy, which fails to impress. The problem with this movie is not that their understanding of world events is shallow and trite, and that they utterly miss the chance to make the audience think, or to use clever metaphor or satire, so much as that the jokes are universally bad. Worth watching only because it's popular and over-hyped; then to fight the corner of far funnier comedies which go unnoticed."},{"rating":"1","title":"thinker","review":"This is the most vile movie I have ever walked out of.Low class boring, something only truly gutter based minds could think of.A true steaming pile....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"Hey, what else can I say?

Lots of stereotypes, bad songs, grossouts, and cursing (mf, f, etc.) make \\"Team America\\" an exercise in bad taste.It looked like a propaganda film from the Bush administration. American actors (F.A.G.) are made to look like collaborators with Kim Jong-Il, the very strange \\"Dear Leader\\" of North Korea. Americans who wish blow the hell out of everything are the heroes of this movie. Thing is, I wouldn't have really cared which side the heroes or bad guys were on if this movie was really funny-which it is not.

Not only is the war on terrorism put in it's place, but they also satirize a slew of other topics, such as politically outspoken actors and even the film industry its self with the use of mellowdramatic dialog and a cheesy (yet hysterical) soundtrack.

I seem to remember something similar on British tv, quite a long time ago, for kids. If you're in the right mood you might find it fairly funny. However, come to think of it, I didn't laugh once. Like the Amazon man says, don't expect anything subtle. Although the politics may be different, this seemed to me to be in the vein of Blazing Saddles, which I found to be a seriously unfunny film.

It could have used an extra twist.) The songs are funny, the politics are Parker and Stone's usual 14-year-old pseudo-nihilism, though they don't make ANY effort to lambast the right wing with the same tenacity that they do Tim Robbins and Sean Penn. There wasn't a single f'ing rightwing celebrity blown apart in this movie (and yes, there are many), and I wanted to see the Sam Jackson puppet take a howitzer to little marionette versions of Trey Parker and Matt STone.

Well maybe Michael Moore is slightly parodied: he carries hot dogs because he's fat. The characters themselves are weak, none of them are memorable.

More attention is given to the left than I expected, but there is some truth in how the F.A.G. confuses their celebrity status for an expertise in international politics and economics.I thoroughly enjoyed the main character's broadway performance (AIDS!) and the final showdown between Team America and the celebrities.

If there is indeed any satire in this horrible disaster it's so well hidden that i didn't detect even the tiniest trace of it.All the attempts at humor are excruciatingly bad, the dialogue never surfaces above that between 6 year olds, and ultimately this can only serve as propaganda for the cerebrally dysfunctional.Avoid it no matter what lengths you need to go to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Concept - Excessive Foul Language Ruins It","review":"Great concept, could have been better.

Beats me how anyone could resist an obscenity-laced, scatological puppet show that features copulating marionettes. Of course, the true controversy was that it was - gasp - politically satirical (nearly unheard of in American movies these days, but then, we live in a time where it seems to be dangerous to have an original, if candid, opinion about anything, much less politics). Is \\"Team America\\" good for what ails you? Probably not, but it is good for some gut-diving laughter. Come on, admit it, you're dying to sneak a peek, and alot of folks probably will when this hits DVD. Finally, America will know the truth about itself: we're a nation of closeted puppet-sex fiends. Amen to Parker and Stone for liberating us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Explaining the Bush Doctrine","review":"You may hate the Bush Doctrine or love it. Either way, this movie has the pithiest (and most unrepeatable/unprintable) summary of it ever. I am the mother of twenty-somethings and conservative, but I found the film hysterically funny. I did prefer the censored version that I saw in the theatres to the one here. The uncensored one was a bit too much for a middle-aged mom. And the songs are great. I may now almost have a soft spot in my heart for Kim Jung Il. And what cinematic justice for Hans \\"Brix\\"! All in all a \\"must-see\\" if you are not easily offended by college humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Simple Things In Life","review":"Team America reinforces the idea that sometimes simple is just better. Trey Parker and his associates show \\"South Park\\" showed that a piece of colored construction paper cutouts could turn into the lovable character named \\"Cartman\\". I love the simple stuff. I'm tired of all these big budget movies and then I leave the theatre and it wasn't even good. Lets take things back to the basics. I like this movie. What I like most about it is that its \\"cheezy\\". I love cheezy movies. These hollywood guys think that you need to spend 50 million to make a good movie. I think thats crap. Look at movies like \\"Team America, \\"FDTV\\" and \\"South Park\\". These show you that it doesn't take a big budget to make timeless classics. I love this kinda stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Movie of All Time. Better Than Citizen Kane","review":"This is hands down the single funniest movie made in the last 25 years. You want funny? Hans Blix being fed to man-eating sharks James Bond villain style; American \\"world police\\" entirely oblivious to the disdain of the foreigners who they are \\"protecting\\"; puppet sex; puppet vomit; puppet karate; a macho puppet who hates actors because, as a child, he was raped by the cast of Cats; the accidental destruction of the Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triumph and the Louvre (complete with a smoldering Mona Lisa) as the puppets \\"save\\" Paris; \\"Everybody Has Aids\\". This movie is a masterpiece!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly entertaining...............for just one viewing","review":"I waited until now to purchase 'Team America' the unrated version just when it was the right price. I got for $4.99. I have read the reviews and spoke to friends who had seen it and thought it might be worth owning it. I was wrong....upon watching it I realized it just wasn't that funny. Sure an occasional laugh here and there and ofcourse the sex scene was out of this world but that was it. I must admit the puppet masters did a great job but is this film worth watching more than once....I don't think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would Not Buy Again - Regret That I EVer Bought It!!","review":"This was a requested gift, so I bought it for a member of our family, but after learning about the graphic nature of it, I would not buy it again for anyone; I regret that I ever bought it to begin with!

Great movie. A MUST SEE!your friendThe Z-Man"},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie unlike no other","review":"Team America is a big action movie where the \\"actors\\" are all marionettes, but this is unlike any \\"puppet\\" movie you've ever seen. The attention to detail is incredible; be sure to watch the many behind-the-scenes featurettes on the DVD. The sets and special effects are on par with big budget action films, and the marionettes do things you wouldn't expect they could do.As you might expect from the creators of South Park, there is some crude humor and foul language here, but despite that this is a surprisingly mainstream movie. I find it more entertaining than South Park, and it will probably appeal to a wider audience.I recommend it highly for those who enjoy action films or animation (although technically it's not an animated feature) and aren't easily offended. The only disappointment is the lack of a commentary track from filmmakers Trey Parker and Matt Stone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough info. in description","review":"I'm sure these cables would work fine if I were actually able to install them onto my bike.

It \\"gets the job done\\" but my hair is always a tangled mess after I dry it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undeniably great music","review":"It's easy to realize Daniel Johnston's greatness after listening to this album. His talent shines clear as day and I believe that he belongs in a very select class of musicians like Blind Willie Johnson, Robert Johnson, Roscoe Holcomb, and other great American songsters. What more can you wish for from a musician but the utmost sincerity and a strong dignity to his or her music. Daniel Johnston bleeds honesty and truth. I've read many people refer to Johnston's music as nave, there it nothing nave in these recordings. Nave are the songs of miscellaneous pop divas singing manufactured songs of love. Nave are the songs of aging rockers wishing they could change the world. Daniel Johnston's music is an immense treasure trove of palpable spirit and emotion. Whoever digs it up will definitely be rewarded."},{"rating":"2","title":"RAW EXPLOSION","review":"These early home recordings of Daniel Johnston although not professionaly recorded explode with passion and wit. Songs that stand out for me are; from Songs of Pain: \\"Grievances\\", \\"I Save Cigarette Butts\\", Urge\\", \\"Hate Song\\". From More Songs of Pain: \\"Phantom of My Own Opera\\" and \\"More Dead Than Alive\\". Daniel is a songwriter's songwriter. He was great right out of the gate and these early recordings prove just that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly musical performances, brass not prominent enough","review":"If you are looking for a very inexpensive CD of these two symphonies, this recording will fill the bill. The performances are highly musical with some really gorgeous phrasing. The \\"Spring\\" symphony is one of the finest performances I have heard of that delightful work. The \\"Rhenish\\" is also very good. Unfortunately, the Rhenish requires an orchestra with an exceptional brass section. That is not the case here. The orchestra is certainly adequate but the highly important brass parts, especially the horns, are not nearly as prominent as needed. This problem is not that unusual. Quite often the strings will simply cover up the brass. If you like your brass prominent like I do, chamber orchestras are better since they use much smaller string sections. If you are not concerned about the brass, this recording is very fine, especially at the three dollar price."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES NOT WORK WITH MAC OS X AS ADVERTISED","review":"False advertising.

We formed a study group where we met/still meet weekly and really got to know each other better. There were several parallels with my relationships and the one that \\"fruitcake\\" and Ashley have. It was a great reminder to have patience (in prayer and in service) with what God is doing in your relationships, especially when you don't see what the outcome will be yet (God is so much greater than the demension of time).I would definitely recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to be authentic about their faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing song choices!","review":"For anyone who is a christian & gospel fan or even if you are not familiar with it, I highly recommend purchasing this CD/DVD combo.

Remember, that's Guitar Wolf- J-pop that kicks your @$$"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOUD","review":"This album is so LOUD that its LOUDness can only be accurately expressed by spelling LOUD entirely in capital letters. It is also incomprehensible, ear-splitting, misanthropic, headache-inducing, and frequently flirts dangerously with the ridiculous; ie, its great rock n roll (or as the Wolf might put it, its kick-a## motorcyle teenage leather-boy atomic rock). Buy it, crank it up and do permanent damage to your stereo AND your central nervous system - allright!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Exquisite.","review":"This is one of the best music tapes that Andreas has ever produced. It may well be my personal favorite. As a previous reviewer suggested, listening to it has the power to take you away to a most mystical and faraway place. It is a spirtual journey from which you really do not want to return it is so beautiful. I had the good fortune of seeing Andreas Volleweider in concert over twenty years ago while living in New Orleans. Not many people knew about him so the venue for the concert had to be \\"downsized\\" to the MacAlister Auditorium on Tulane University. I took a coworker along with me and she as really impressed. Andreas and his fellow musicians were so extremely talented. They played some instruments I had never even seen before let alone had the pleasure to hear. The backdrop of the stage was dark blue with shimmering white dots of lights creating an atmosphere as if you were outside under the midnight sky. This is music truly not to be missed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is vintage Vollenweider!","review":"I bought this release originally as an LP!! (I know, I am dating myself!) Then I walked to an electronics store and heard it on CD. I was stunned. I had never heard a CD before! I knew that I HAD to have a CD player and this Andreas Vollenweider CD to go with it. I still play this CD often, after 16 years! \\"White Winds\\" goes a long way to dispel the notion that all New Age music is tedious. Vollenweider is ingenious in his use of instrumentation. It is a timeless sound that will stay with you for a long time. If you want to try New Age, or Vollenweider, then this is the one album to get! You won't be sorry!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure magic","review":"As new age music goes, Vollenweider is in my opinion one of the best. An accomplished harpist, Vollenweider skillfully weaves different, and in some cases never-before-heard, instruments into songs that are elegant and unique. The tempo of his music ranges from slow to up-beat, but this is the kind of music you can really relax to. This album is my favorite, followed by Book of Roses. White Winds has the kind of music that you can close your eyes and let your imagination write the script for the scene/story that the songs are about. I highly recommend this album if you are in to meditation with music or just want music to be played softly in the background of whatever your doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive Rental","review":"This pump lasted me two months and then stopped circulating water.

I was expecting this book to be an expose on how celebrity is made and sold. Instead the book is insubstantial and states the obvious. Nothing illuminating about this book. I do like that the author is an animal rights activist. Yes, the book is an easy read, but it's also extremely shallow -- chock full of facts but lacking in insight. This book is just as shallow, artificial, and irrlevant as the subjects he covers. I was expecting to really enjoy this book but am sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets Hype-r about nothing much","review":"This is a book that doesn't accomplish what it sets out to do, and that is so much worse than succeeding at something less ambitious.Hype seeks to act as a tell-all about the Hollywood celebrity industry, but it wavers between asking the reader for a high level of respect and making crude, unfunny jokes that would be more at home in a celebrity gossip column.The book seeks to shock us, but the revelations aren't really so shocking. Are we so surprised at the prevalence of plastic surgery among the stars? It also seeks to entertain us, but the jokes are lame (such as noting that Jackie Kennedy's hairstyle is as stiff as the white collar shirts she was entertaining that night, ho ho!).Hype doesn't do anything overtly harmful, but I would think that someone looking for dirt could find a much more attractive package than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what you expect from 400 W","review":"I am not sure how Pyramid managed to restrain all 400 W into such a quiet noise.

Came across this from 1980, when I was heavily into Meco and his catalog of science-fiction theme disco albums. This falls far short of that, and is probably the worst album I have ever owned.

Even so, not all first beginners are interested. Not only there are no combinations, most of the basic movements and positions are done by rather amateurish ballerinas. Even for the professional ones, which are scarce anyway, don't expect anything anywhere near the Kirov, De L'opera de Paris or Royal Ballet... The overall production is so and so.

It stands up to lots of abuse-kids rolling on it or standing on it-and it just pops back up. So far, the fabric seems pretty durable. They avoided a zipper on the entrance and just used a couple of velcro squares which is much better since small children would destroy the zipper pretty quickly. It's big enough for a 2 year old to stand upright and will accommodate 2-3 toddlers pretty easily. The mesh at the top is nice because you can see in and make sure the kids are ok. And if they really want privacy you can throw a lightweight scarf over the top. For the price, this is a really nice tent and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money!

Use the lab book- it really cements the understanding of the topics and it is FUN! We had 2 other kids over when we did the marsh mellow experiment and they loved it!

Allusions to Shakespeare effortlessly incorporated. Vivid characters. Fresh, memorable metaphors. A touch of magic. Innocence. Deviltry.

Love in Idleness is good enough to warrant a second perusal, just to catch the delicious detail missed in the first reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"While I enjoyed the allusions to A Midsummer Night's Dream, one of my favorite Shakespeare plays, I found this book far from satisfying. Craig evokes the Italian landscape beautifully, but I couldn't get past my disgust with some of the characters. Betty is horrid, but she's supposed to be; the problem is with characters we're meant to view sypathetically. Polly is a spritless doormat, only slightly evolved by the end of the book, and her two children are among the most hateful, odious brats I've ever seen in fiction. Craig apparently writes children's books as well as reviewing them; I hope she doesn't think all children are as rude and insensitive as those she portrays here. Quite polluted an otherwise pleasant read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect summer read","review":"This book will appeal to those saearching for a classy romantic comedy. But between the jokes and the lyrical descriptions of Italy, as in Craig's other books, there are deeper questions being raised. The children in this updating of Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream take on the role of the fairies. Is this because we need the raw energy and passion of children to really see things as they are? Or are they just meddlesome trouble-makers playing with potions and cobwebs? The characters fall in and out love - and most importantly, as with Craig's other books, seek to learn how to be true to their own best natures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish it had been more than it is","review":"On the surface, this story seems to have it all to make a highly appealing read. The setting is Italy, the cast of characters large and diverse, ranging from precocious children to rich, mean mother-in-law. The relationships shift, and love is explored. What's not to like, right? Yet it never lived up to my expectations. It took me forever to finish it, because I was never fully drawn to the characters or the plot, and therefore never had that wonderful feeling of not being able to put the book down. Rather, I felt it more of a duty to finish it because I had started it. When I finished the book, I felt underwhelmed. I was surprised to read that it's a favorite of book clubs. Maybe it gives people an excuse to have their friends over for Italian food. Overall I am sorry to say I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfying","review":"The author does a nice job setting up the story, and developing the characters. However, I was deeply disappointed with the novel's ending. I don't want to give away too much information, but some plot lines seemed far-fetched, and too neatly tied up. I had high hopes for this novel, but was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mid-summer trainwreck!!!","review":"Oh, please! The reviews of this book made me laugh! Romantic Comedy? That in itself is a joke. I disliked this book very much. It was a major effort to even finish it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Controversial only because it's accurate.","review":"Length:: 6:43 MinsThe author's viewpoint is too accurate a portrait of female psychology to be appreciated. Women are not better than men and are not moral. We should expect that, just like men, they have their own agenda that we should analyze."},{"rating":"1","title":"Infidelity explained as \\"women are horny\\"","review":"All of women's marital infidelity is explained away as: it's hormonal and natural as women enter their sexual prime. they turn 30, more testosterone pumps into their system, they get horny, and need sex with multiple partners.if that's what you want to hear, then read the book and you can ignore the other aspects of marriage, including communication and commitment.The book is written as a dialog with her friend \\"Kevin,\\" in which she teaches him the ways of women. The book is based on a) her personal past of infidelity and b) her interviews with cheating men and women. She's not a doctor and does not have training; she's a \\"professional public speaker specializing in career development.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't afford it","review":"I'd love to read it, but I can't afford it. Why is this so expensive? I'll give it two stars because I like what she said on her website, but a book that's only 200 pages written by someone with no training is questionable. Highly questionable. She should bring the price in line with regular books and allow it to sell on it's own merit."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sucker born every minute!","review":"Will you really pay $125 for a book, just a 200-page book, not a collector's first edition, not a rare book, just a book?! David Hannum (not P.T. Barnum) said it well: There's a sucker born every minute. Forget the book and get a therapist and try something really challenging: like talking with your friends and your partner. You read the book and you're still not accountable to anyone to improve your situation. Jeez!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Women's Infidelity, A book of excuses, to help me forgive my infidelity","review":"The writer admits that she is not a professional. I understand that she has gathered her understandings in the form of conversations.Considering that her answers to the Male speaker is sometimes harsh I guess this book won't even help men.It is mostly an excuse bible for infidel wives so that they can forgive or justify their acts.More interesting the book advertises the right of the women to sleep and have sex with multiple partners and that they should not feel guilt of doing that or even being infidel to their family, breaking them and selling them."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Perfect Book of Excuses for Unfaithful Women","review":"Dear Men, if you want to give your wives the perfect book of excuses for their infidelities, then this is it!!! Perhaps someone should write a book to give men perfect excuses too??!!What of love and the willingness to be faithful and true to your partner? What about having the willpower to resist temptation? This is more like a Bible for women on how to explain their shortcomings. If I had a choice, I would have given this book a negative 5 instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"A complete waste of time and money. This book offers no real insight into what most people think and feel and certainly offers no real guidance or help to any persons who have been affected by an extramarital affair. Half-truths, suppositions and illogical conclusions. At times the author completely contradicts herself from one chapter to the next. I got the impression that the author was no fan of the male members of our species and in the end, offers no real solutions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Case","review":"This case is very sturdy and holds up well to alot of use.

Took it to be looked at and had to have new pegs and a new bridge. Nice looking instrument but disappointed I had to shell out even more money to get it into playing condition.After 2 months of having this violin we had an \\"issue\\" with it during a violin lesson. My son was putting his bow up to play something that his teacher had ask him to play and we heard a popping sound and the whole area where the fine tuner was popped off and slapped him in the side of the face.

His weekly show \\"The Jukebox\\" plays the best new music from the Arab world. This CD contains the 16 songs Farah picked as the best (so far) of the 21st century. They were all hits somewhere--Lebanon or Egypt or Saudi Arabia... A GREAT selection. All the songs are in Arabic, but this is top-40 stuff--very accessible to people who are new to Arab music. The only flaw of this CD is that it does not include printed lyrics. Overall: EXCELLENT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG how did I miss this?","review":"I have most of Wynton's, Branford's, and Jeff Watts' solo records, but I did not have this one.

You HAVE to get this record!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This album defines Marsalis as a great composer/improviser","review":"This is a seminal work, and defines the beginning of the post- or neo-bop movement in jazz, a resurgence in the form that continues through the millenium. Swenson, in his review for Amazon.com, decides to review this album in terms of Marsalis' subsequent career, and draws parallels to Miles Davis' group that are relatively superficial ('blinkered apologist'? Oh, please.). This album stands on its own in terms of compositional narrative, improvisational extent, and sheer passion. Subsequent albums have extended on Marsalis' deep roots in the Blues and bop, but 'Black Codes' remains unparalleled as a defining moment in a new movement in jazz."},{"rating":"2","title":"this doll is so cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"this doll is so cool. she is so beautiful. when i get enough money i may buy her for my collection. the Mystikat collection is way better than myscene or bratz. There are 3 other mystikats. this one is my absolut fav. 2 other toys that totally rock are trollz and gi-joe. Trollz are so cute there alot more cuter than the old trolls from the 60's. and gi-joe is just cool because he can take over the world with a snap of his fingers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"This is a BOOTLEG audience recording with poor sound.

OK, I'm probably the only guy in the world that spends many an evening reading old site reports on eastern North American archaeology, and the original Squire and Davis has been on my wish list since I was a kid. Well the Smithsonian reprint reviewed here has a problem that is unforgivable...one of the plates is missing and another has been printed twice in place of the missing one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for everyone","review":"If you're mormon, post mormon, motorcycle enthusiast, westerner, feminist, post feminist, or a reader who just likes a good story, then you'll enjoy this book.Richman writes truthfully about her experience as a new Mormon pioneer - paving her way out of rather than into the Mormon Church. She parallels her solo motorcycle trip from Nauvoo, IL to Salt Lake during the fall of 2001 with the faithful (and fateful) journey her decedents who traveled the Mormon Trail 150 years earlier.The motorcycle metaphors may tire some, but I thought they added to the story. On the whole it is a good story. I felt a connection to her sense of pride in the pioneering spirit of her family side-by-side with her inability to live with such unquestioning faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I am african-american and I have extremely poofy wavy thick hair. It is fine when wet, but when it dries, it looks worse than a full bred chow-chow dog. I thought this stuff would help with poofiness as my hair dries, but I was let down. It did nothing that a cheap can of moose can't do.I washed my hair and used their conditioner as well. I towel dried my hair a little and then applied the cream. It left my hair somewhat hard and as soon as I ran my fingers through my hair, it poofed - as usual. So, save your money. This product is not special at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF!

Regular price, 34.99, on sale 24.99.What I'd like to know is the actual cost in the making of a DVD.Season 3's episodes are well-written, well-acted and hilarious.I love Julia-Louis Dreyfus. She's one of the funniest comedians of the 21st century. A newer version of Lucille Ball.The remaining cast members are excellent actors, too.Each character does a fantastic job, well-suited to their roles, in a family-type atmosphere.I recommend buying Season 3 especially if you're a die-hard Julia/Elaine/Christine fan..Prepare youself to watch the complete season at one sitting. Buy a smaller bag of popcorn. lol. Toni"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps you Laughing!!","review":"I'm sad to say that i only found out about this show due to the fact that lifetime is now playing reruns of it. I loved what shows i saw so i decided to buy the seasons on dvd. The new adventures of old Christine is hilarious. I really wish the network that ran the show would have advertised a lot more and then maybe it wouldn't have been canceled. I would recommend this comedy to anyone who loves to laugh. I'm anxiously waiting for seasons 4 and 5 to come out on dvd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but only ten episodes because of writer's strike","review":"The ten episodes are very good, but because of the writer's strike during that year every show on tv was shortened in episodes.

Was disapointed that this DVD was purchased from Amazon and it is a bootleg copy. The originals were copied onto an inferior disk therefore it clicked the whole time it was played. Was suspicious when I first opened it that it was not the same packaging from Season 1 and Season 2 that I have. The disk was even a pinkish color not like the siver ones of regular DVD's. It did not say original in the discription when I went back and checked but I thought Amazon only sold original copies. Shame on you Amazon! Buyer beware. The only good thing about this is that Amazon does have a great return policy. The bad thing is, I have to reorder with someone else and wait for my new copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"New adventures of old Christine","review":"This was my third attempt at purchasing this season from amazon and all were defective.

Not all this songs work (\\"Walk Don't Walk\\"), but there's (as usual) great stuff here.

Here the Prince-patented blend of rock, funk and soul is harnessed for a more funky sound which includes tender gospel ballads. Some rap is added by Toni M to tracks like Jughead, Daddy Pop and Push. The two most soulful cuts are Stollin' and Willing and Able, and they're both excellent. Thunder is Prince at his best, while Creamed and Get Off are hook-filled pure pop delight. Get Off, especially, is loaded with those suggestive innuendos. Listen and turn purple where it matters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album!","review":"Prince explores all of the musical roots that are somehow show a more serious side. Live for Love was a very good example of how Prince uses many Keyboard elements. My favorite song on this album was Diamonds and Pearls and Gett Off. A must have CD for the die hard Prince \\"friend\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Precious Gems","review":"Diamonds & Pearls is the last truly great album by Prince. Employing his new band, The New Power Generation, Prince crafts an album of pop, rock & funk in his best tradition. \\"Cream\\" lives up to its title with its silky pop groove. The song became his fifth, and so far, last number one hit. The title track is luscious ballad as is \\"Money doesn't Matter 2 Night\\". \\"Jughead\\" is a funky jam while \\"Gett Off\\" has a gypsy like beat that makes it sound like it was recorded with a harem present. While this album doesn't compare to his 80's work, Prince steps up strong on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"This is one of the most underrated albums ever released..This is the first showcasing the N.P.G. with exceptional drummer Michael Bland and the vocal stylings of Ms. Rosie Gaines. The music is very enjoyable and diverse. The gospel of willing and able, the funk of Gett Off, the sensuality of Cream, the breezy jazz of Strollin', the beautiful love song Diamonds and Pearls, the thought provoking Money Don't Matter 2night and the bedroom burner Insatiable...If u don't like this album u don't know music."},{"rating":"1","title":"inconsistent at best","review":"Best track: \\"Gett Off\\" There are two or three other okay songs here (like \\"Cream\\", \\"Daddy Pop\\", \\"Money dont matter tonight\\").

It's far better than much of the antiseptic, boring material he churns out these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gem of an album!!!!","review":"One of my favorite albums by Prince would definitely have to be Diamonds and Pearls.

Many of them said it looked like the same footage on each disc just from a different angle or a different song from the same concert. I didn't want to believe it but its true. However, I would recommend that you buy disc 1 and not the set. It is the best and captures every side of Elvis you will see in the other two. The version of \\"Unchained Melody\\" was fascinating. Not only was it very emotional and definitely touched me, but also shocking how heavy he was and was filmed just two months before his death. It may sound crazy but for me it was like a farewell song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on guys.","review":"I mean I like this song (enough to buy the single), but let's alter it a little if we're going to call it a different remix. With a song being played 6 times or so, you want it to be altered more than they did. There is one other song on there, but I really didn't care for it. If you want to get your hands on 'Give it Away', tape it off someone else's cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"while this single gets a lot of criticism for having all the same song except search and destroy, i think it's really good.while the mixes are all somewhat distinct (my favorite being the rasta mix, which gives it a completely different sound) from the original, it's not necessarily a cd you'd pop into the stereo and listen to straight, more of one that you'd put into a playlist on your mp3. they're all a nice alternative to the album versionalso search and destroy is an awesome cover and i'm an avid lover of the original.well worth the three bucks.(other pepper songs i like are: sir psycho sexy, funky monks, behind the sun, death of a martian, coffee shop, my friends, pea, soul to squeeze, especially in michigan, lovin' and touchin', save the population, can't stop, this is the place, cabron, zephyr song, purple stain... hope that helps)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great single, but not their best album","review":"I liked this single but I think that it was better on the real album."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is soooooooo stupid!","review":"Face it. 6 bucks for one song?

It was and has always been about the shear joy of music, and that's what they brought to this recording.Exotic, Vibrant, and rhythmic fun! I can't think of any other way to describe it. It grooves, it rocks, and it makes you move and sing along.As refreshing to listen to today as it was the first time I heard it. One of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"A TRULY INCREDIBLE ALBUM!","review":"I recently listened to \\"Fear of Music\\" after not hearing it for about, say, fifteen years. So, it was fun to be reacquainted with an old friend.\\"Fear of Music\\" sounds as fresh and original today as it did when it came out in 1979. Unlike some of the Heads' later work, this album doesn't sound dated. It fits beautifully after the first two studio recordings, sounding both more assured and more experimental than either.I'm one who believes MTV killed rock music. Albums such as \\"Fear of Music\\" and \\"Remain in Light\\" would be viewed as unmarketable by today's major record labels. I hope lots of young people snatch up copies of both of those albums and really, truly listen to them. I think they will surely open up a few young minds. As for us older folks, we can look back, longingly, at the brilliance that was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fear Itself","review":"David Byrne always passes off the \\"Fear\\" angle/theme here as a joke -- but I don't buy it.

They're also poppy as a laundry basket full of poppyseed muffins, and this aural culture clash has been known to lead to vertigo -- don't look down...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Best Album","review":"David Byrne's songwriting was at it's highest level at this point and Talking Heads put out a classic album with this one. I can't even describe it...Even hardcore haters of Talking Heads will have difficulty putting this one down."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one is worth it!","review":"This is my favorite Talking Heads album. The quirky lyrics hint at paranoia and fear of everyday things like \\"Paper\\" and \\"Air\\". Some of the background music really enhances the flavor of the music like in \\"Electric Guitar\\". The funky rhythm in \\"Animals\\" has made that track a personal favorite of mine. If you are a Talking Heads fan, this is a must. If you're just into music, this is still definitely worth a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true rarity: pop music that makes you think","review":"My vinyl copy of the early Talking Heads album is in storage somewhere, but this album and Talking Heads '77 kept coming back to me, so I got a cd copy. Listening to it makes me a little sad, because it's so amazing. The songs are odd and interesting, they ask the listener to deal with their oddness, to apply Byrne's nonsense to real life. When you do this, say with \\"Paper,\\" the results can keep you going for a while. \\"Paper\\" - is it about lawyers trying and failing to reduce life to 81/2 x 11? Or something more general and philosophical - life as symbols on paper versus real life? Yet these songs aren't dull \\"art rock.\\" They are weird grooves that stay with you, innovative textures and spiky new wave hooks. \\"Animals\\" is hilarious and true: a man confronting the seemingly peaceful and self-contained animals and shouting, \\"I will not follow animals advice!\\" This is a work of art and it should be discussed, listened to and remembered."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"I know that David Byrne said something like, 'The better a singer's voice is, the harder it is to believe what he's saying.' To some extent I agree, but 'Fear of Music' (and a lot of Talking Heads' earlier catalogue, to me) is just unlistenable. His voice is twitching all over the place; it's irritating. That, and the music and lyrics aren't that strong; there's no substance in a song like 'Mind.' I find it hard to believe that they followed this alubm with the incredible 'Remain in Light;' it's like listening to two different bands. I know that they were capable of better - just compare this 'Life During Wartime' and 'Heaven' with the live versions on Stop Making Sense, and you'll see what I mean.That song 'Animals' is funny, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog loves it","review":"My Dog loves these toys.

Axel F on a bad day....","review":"I like all of Herbie's stuff from the 60s and 70s. I picked this one up on a whim, curious to hear what it sounded like, expecting it to be something of a mixed bag but hoping there'd be at least one or two pleasant surprises. It's godawful. Painfully cheesy 80s synthesizer (like a bad flashback to the Beverly Hills Cop soundtrack), together with a bunch of very tired sounding electric drumbeats, bad lyrics, weak scratching. I suppose this album has some value to a musicologist, as a historical document, and so on. But as something to listen to, ugh, to my ears the cheese factor is just way, way too much. I think it's great that Herbie has experimented with lots of different styles. But this album is an ugly mess better left collecting dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, reliable if it's trained right.","review":"This is a good introduction to street defensive styles. The instructor however is a little bit sloppy in demonstration and doesn't explain how to do some techniques correctly that can be difficult for some students. The optimistic attitude he shows is a great thing, but I would like to see him also emphasize some reasons why certain things are done, or why certain things don't work in certain situations.The material in the program is great if you have a little experience and know what to look for. It will get you thinking about your techniques in the right way. But it is a basic course and I was expecting a little more depth for a six disk set.Bear in mind I'm an instructor myself, and I can be a hard critic when it comes to these things. I really hate hearing people talk about things they think they know so much about, especially when those things can get someone hurt.This man is not one of those guys.I would recommend this over a vast majority of other videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fighting Westerner not worth buying","review":"Imagine my disappointment when \\"Fighting Westerner\\" (my hero Randolph Scott) arrived, dubbed by Front Row Entertainment Video of New Jersey who should be ashamed of the product they produced.

Read This Book!","review":"Luther made the discovery back in the 1520s that those professing the Christian faith lacked most if not all the basic knowledge to properly do so. He determined that if there was to be a true reform of the Church, it would have to begin at the level of the parishes, which is why he wrote this little book.Designed to teach adherents to the Christian faith the basics, the most rudimentary elements, of the practice of that faith, Luther wrote the Small Catechism for the instruction of children. The Lord's Prayer, the Ten Commandments, and Apostle's Creed, all briefly commented and explained. Simple. Elegant. Essential.What with hoards of people flocking to the free-style catharsis of the non-denominational, 'spirit filled' operations that likely as not call themselves 'worship centers' rather than churches, any remaining Lutherans need to cling closely to our own teachings. This is the best way I know of to strengthen that grasp."},{"rating":"2","title":"The evolution of pyramid building and their purpose","review":"The author takes a reasoned and wellresearched approach to the enigma ofthe pyramids.

The first Sprouts album, Swoon, was a gem, but this is even better thanks largely to Thomas Dolby's gifted arrangements of Paddy McAloon's finely crafted songs. Steer clear of TWG if you can't stomach heart-on-sleeve lyrics, angst, and soft melodic hooks. McAloon's music has an ethereal quality, which is complemented perfectly by Dolby's production and Neil Conti's (ex-David Bowie session man, among others) crack drumming. I'm not exaggerating when I say that this is as close to pop perfection as I've ever heard. The album concludes with \\"When the Angels.\\" The remaining tracks are nice add-ons, though they weren't part of the original album (which was titled \\"Steve McQueen\\" in the original U.K. release) and should be considered B-sides.

These balls should honestly be rated 1-star. I will give my reasons. First of all, I am a 1700 usatt rated member, and I have played with many balls such as joola, butterfly, nittaku, gambler, dhs, double fish, newgy, etc.The hardness of the balls are surprisingly soft. Many 2-star balls are much harder, such as gambler gold, butterfly 2-star, and newgy 2-star. So it feels really light when you're hitting and looping.The roundness and durability are good, but it doesn't really matter, because club level players won't use these. These balls are meant for garage players, or for robot and multi ball training.The price of these balls are okay at 24 cents a ball. But, Gambler 2-star balls sell for 20 cents a ball.Overall, not bad for the robot, multi-ball, and beginners.

This is not the same as a 3-star ITTF approved ball quality. If you are looking for a tournament quality ball, stick with the Butterfly, JOOLA, or Killerspin branded 3-star (ITTF approved) balls. I will contend that this is a good quality training ball but if comparing quality with the above mentioned brands this would compare to a training or 1-star ball.

The friend is usually in the \\"extended\\" version ofthe pose, which is different. She explains her movement. If you are a beginner -you do not need the extended version yet. Linda usually has great DVDs, but inall honesty, I think having the friend there, was distracting to her and did makeher put too much emphasis on the friend. The third area of the DVD is more likea warm up - and probably should have been the very beginning part of the DVD to help you warm up for the extended poses. Linda's \\"Natural Body Tune Up\\" is fantastic, but unfortunately is only available on VHS. Sorry! - this one - justdoes not get it for me.

His wife's mother is going through similar grief. While it would have been fascinating to see how these two people struggled through their pain, the author sticks a \\"play\\" in the middle of the novel to explore her theory of how oblivion equals true death. The space dedicated to that pseudo-play would have been better utilized showing how the two main characters recover (or not) from their grief and how Hart's theory proves to be valid (or not).I still think Josephine Hart is an excellent writer, and recommend Sin as proof.

Her tender delivery of \\"Give Me Time\\" is worthy of repeated listens, and the driving \\"What's It Gonna Be\\" is one of her most urgent vocals of all-time.That said, the true gem here is \\"The Look of Love.\\" Her voice is soulful, sensual, and silky. The musical accompaniment, which on Dusty records sometimes tends to overtake her vocals, perfectly compliments her here. This cut is worth the price of admission.Dusty is probably the greatest white soul singer of all-time, and this collection is a great starting point for newcomers and for long-time fans alike.

In this book, there is some writing from Al Gore, Nancy Pelosi and other politicians. There are ideas given on how people can be politically active in their community. With the great websites and ideas offered, you can't go wrong! The only thing I would add is more ideas, don't get me wrong, there are plenty of ideas in here, it's just that - with more ideas there will be more of a chance a person will actually do something. Also, people don't get involved in political change (even for their benefit) because our lifestyle is just made like that - just eat, sleep and work, don't worry about where your taxes are being used.

Perhaps these people are afraid of claiming their power as American citizens? Or perhaps they are too blinded by their beliefs they haven't even read the book, they just know that MoveOn as an organization doesn't support their ideas, and therefore deserves only 1 star.

There are no extra's that make this DVD worth it's money. The sound is terrible. There are no subtitles so you can't check if they put the right sound with the right movie, well it sounds like Elvis. Elvis presence makes this movie earn one star.

This film wasby National General Pictures in conjuction with NBC and it was great to think this hard-to-find Elvis film would finally be available on DVD. The joy was short lived when I played it. It is my opinion that this DVD is a BOOTLEG made off the worst video tape ever found in someone's possession. If this is not an illegal copy, then the individual(s) should be horse whipped. Somebody please release this film properly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Elvis, the actor","review":"This film shows that Elvis had the ability to act beyond the \\"typical Elvis\\" boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl movies that Col. Parker set up for him. Knowing that Col. Parker denied him opportunities to move forward in a career he loved is sad. \\"Charro\\" is every bit as good as any Clint Eastwood \\"Oater\\" western that flooded the movies. I read that Elvis was up for a part in \\"The Rainman\\" and \\"A Star Is Born\\", and both scripts were denied not by Elvis but by Col. Parker. It makes you wonder what might have happened had that road not been blocked. I loved Elvis when he was the new and bright star to a 14 year old teen who had to sneak out of the house to him in concert in Chicago. I still love him and introduce him through music and movies to my 10 grandchildren. Charro is a good movie and you can tell Elvis is having a really good time doing something he really loves.

However they were right. The movie is good the picture and sound are the Worse that I've ever seen. What a shame. I've seen super 8 videos that are of better quality. I hope someday one of the big movie companies,MGM or Paramount, will re-release this movie, in wide screen and in a better format. However if you collect Elvis you can't help but buy it anyway. Just don't expect to much. I'll be shelving this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The King of Pain","review":"\\"Charro!\\" (1969) gives Elvis Presley little support in terms of scripting and direction. However, there are a few noteworthy aspects in this dull western. The neck-branding scene is perhaps the most sadistic moment in Elvis cinema - it's rare to see the King endure such excruciating pain. In addition, his character doesn't break into song (a wise decision). An intriguing sequence finds Elvis walking across the Arizona desert with no rear projection or extras in sight. It's one of the few naturalistic moments in a Presley film. Overall, \\"Charro!\\" is another misguided attempt to duplicate the success of Clint Eastwood's spaghetti westerns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charro","review":"All you people who didn't like the Charro dvd I would like to buy it please let me know if you are interested in selling it"},{"rating":"1","title":"A No-Budget King","review":"The King is a rogue cowboy hunted by his former outlaw buddies in what is one of Elvis' lowest points in a not so celebrated film career. Yes, he doesn't stop what he is doing and burst out singing \\"Clambake, Gonna have a clambake\\" but that would have been better then this hard to watch western. I know EP was making a million dollars a picture by this time. The budget on this movie excluding his salary had to 10, maybe 20 bucks. It looks horrible. There is just no life in the movie. I know it was suppose to be a drama but come on. I'm an enormous Presley fan, just not so much with his acting movies. I'll blame the Colonel for that, but that's a totally different review for another time and place. Check out Change of Habit co-starring Mary Tyler Moore for a good acting role by the hillbilly cat and Elvis: That's the way it is for the real thing on and off stage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have Been So Much Better","review":"The movie is quite good showing that given the right material, Elvis Presley could have been an outstanding actor. This was a step in the right direction but too late in his acting career. I was hoping this DVD issue would show this movie off in great light. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The company have used an inferior copy and DVD just enhance any problems with the print. I hope in the future we will get a first generation copy for our collections.

Elvis himself loved this movie more then any he had done. He even liked this better then King Creole. I spoke with James Sikking (Gunner in the movie)and he told me that at the cast party Elvis told him that this movie had been his best so far. Elvis Presley in a beard and not breaking out into a song or dance...he must have loved it.

It's so awful words cannot describe. It looks cheap, nasty, badly acted, badly directed, badly edited with no story. It's just awful.What on earth was going on in his and the Colonel's heads thinking that fans would put up with watching this crap at the movies when you had the real deal in Clint Eastwood. Even at the time it was made, Westerns were going out of fashion.This was, thank God, one of the last movies he made. I'm a big Elvis Fan but could not bear to watch it twice.The DVD is bad quality, no picture clean up, no extras, nothing. What's the point?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Key Western Doesn't Cut It","review":"Elvis Presley's only movie that wasn't a drama or comedy with songs or a straight Hollywood Musical - the only Elvis song is the well-produced title song heard over the opening credits. As many folks have said, this one was an attempt to get Elvis in the Clint Eastwood mold and do something \\"different\\". It seems that the original plan to include exciting fight scenes (which Elvis actually excelled at!) and more traditional stuff was deemed politically incorrect at the time, so we have the star basically in a trance while the town he is supposed to protect gets constantly hit by cannon fire from his former friends. The storyline stays in neutral until the welcome \\"End\\". There are some interesting things from his post-\\"formula\\" era - unfortunately there is not one memorable scene in this film.

Second season was not very great. Third season is really not worth watching - very poor actor play, each serie is filled with long-lasting face shots, eyes darting and things like that, which are supposed to mean something, but eventually lead to nothing. Screenplay is also not good, the series are cut in the most strange way - first you get \\"now\\", then next moment it is \\"six months before\\" and then afterwards it is \\"five months after\\". That is the only thing which could hold suspense.Also all these long and fake face shots are repeated constantly, actors really need to do something with their play. Glenn Close is decent, though, but you could not make interesting series on one actress, when whole cast plays outrageously bad.

In a good way though! The movie is set in the distant future where everyone drives VW Bugs, Chelsea Clinton is president, kids like to hack into computers and play bizarre games with spinning milk cartons. Not only is the movie's layout a quirky, creative factory of fun, but it's characters are very appealing...and I'm not talking about Zenon in particular! There is Margie, the notorious anti-hero who is overly protective of her beloved Greg. Greg is a subdued sexual maniac who's always making subtle advances on Zenon whether they're miscalculated pick-up lines or head bobs. The villanous couple Mr. Windom and Lutz are almost live action versions of Mr. Burns and Smithers on the Simpsons. The music in the movie is great and you'll be humming Supernova Girl for weeks!

The only thing I really liked was the fabric...it is nice and soft. The first thing I noticed after putting it on was that I was much too 'pointy' for my taste. I just didn't like the way it shaped me. I wore it around for a day and it was so uncomfortable. I was either being poked or rubbed somewhere, or the bottom band would curl up.

The fabric is thin and does not \\"hold you in\\" as a sports bra really needs to do to be effective. Two stars because it does not do what it is intended to do.

But my problem with this bra came up in the summer -- once you are sweaty, the heavy cotton stays wet (and I am not a very sweaty exerciser!). This isn't too big of a deal if you're just doing a 30 minute run then promptly changing your clothes, but if you're going to be exercising for a longer period of time and/or can't change your clothes immediately, it's kind of disgusting and unhygenic to have the sweaty material against your skin.There are other bras that are more supportive and are made of material that wicks away sweat.

The noise cancellation is very good, especially against machinery noise. It can be used without the active noise cancellation function, and there is some difference in sound quality. Without noise cancellation, there is more bass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall Fine Product","review":"I purchased these headphones for use in by cubed Office environment. They work for all but the loudest and highest pitched voices. Satifaction just so so.I then used them on an flight from the East Coast to the West Coast and WOW what a difference they made. I think they were made for use on an Airplane fantastic noise reduction. The low pitched engine noise and surrounding sounds were all elimnated. The Gold plated plug works awesome.For the serious Air Traveler I rate this a perfect 5 out of 5 stars and a must have !!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice!","review":"Got these after a good review by the New York Times. Nice soft over-the-ear phones go a long way to naturally cancel outside noise.

Still, not really disappointed, and glad I saved lots of $ over other brands."},{"rating":"1","title":"duds","review":"We bought these based on a review in the New York Times.

I got these headphones, and for the first week they worked very nicely. Then the right earphone started to do weird things. I got a refund and tried again.The next pair worked fine for longer time (months). But now when you turn the noise cancelling function on, they make significantly more noise than before, to the point that if you are in a not very noise place you have to turn it off. Still helps in flights, but that's not aceptable for a $100 headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"bberesford122","review":"Great headphones for the money.

On long haul flights they are excellent, and with the multi-jack attachment you can hook into the planes audio visual system. The battery life is great also. I have looked at more expensive brands and felt that the price premium for a cool brand was not translated into superior performance in the headphones.

Cancels outside backround noise pretty good but not people speaking. My ears started to sweat after a while, while wearing them. Over all I liked them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Above expectations","review":"I was pleasantly surprised with these headphones. They are very comfortable and sound great (though I am not an expert). The noise canceling feature is easy to turn on and works better than expected with any kind of low frequency sound (air conditioner, airplane, etc). The headphones themselves (without noise canceling) do a good job at reducing higher pitch noises, like voices. The headphones come in a hard case that is very well made and have a detachable cord (which makes it easy to replace if you ever break it). The only very slight negative is that the richness of the sound suffers a bit when the noise canceling feature is on. All in all, I would definitely recommend these headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Ever","review":"These are the finest noise-cancelling headphones that I have ever owned.

They were used no more than 4 trips and the battery got stuck inside. Panasonic farms out the customer service calls to 'drones' and there is not much more to say. It looks like I will just throw them in a trash can now and upgrade to a headphone with a better warranty than 90 days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality AND the right price","review":"I just got a pair of these after doing some research.

Most reviews here are very favorable for canceling airplane noise, and for me, although in a VERY limited test of that (planes traveling above me), they totally eliminated the noise. But I bought these to cancel noise of my lawn equipment machinery. In that area, they are terrible. An inexpensive pair of Peltor (or similar) earmuffs is much more effective for that kind of usage.Deciding I wanted to return them, Amazon was FANTASTIC at taking them back and crediting my account. All delivery charges were paid for, including UPS picking the package up at my door."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It...

These headphones allow all the detail in the music to come through.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Earphones were defective upon arrival","review":"The first day I used these earphones in my house attached to the speaker control of my computer speakers they sounded good until I turned on the noise canceling button. Every time I touched the exterior of the right ear phone with noise cancellation on I would get a loud squeak in my ear. At first I thought it was the swivel on the earphone where they connect to the headset. I determined that it was an loud electonic squeak in the right earphone and a slight squeak in the left earphone when the exterior of the earphones were touched. I am disappointed. I am returning them for a refund. I will buy a different brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing","review":"Worth every $$$. Excellent quality of sound and the noise canceling feature.

This is the best set of headphones I have ever owned. They are compact and fit snuggly in the carry case, which doesn't take up a lot of room. Don't have to worry about them getting damaged if you throw them in a backpack. I love that the cord disconnects at both ends for compact storage. The noise cancellation is also great. I would recommend these to anyone who travels a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for my needs","review":"I am delighted with these headphones. My impression is that Panasonic, though not a glamour brand, turns out a reliable, well-thought out product. I also liked the reviews, so I purchased this item. I was bothered by radio and TV sounds bleeding into my apartment from the neighbors. These headphones all but completely eliminated it.The noise cancellation works primarily on base tones. They reduce the base in any sound you are listening to, also. And they seem to be designed primarily for noise cancellation and not listening to music. If you are a stereophile, you might want to pick another model.However, I am delighted with them. They do what they do very well and what they do is exactly what I need them to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Headphones","review":"These headphones are awesome. The audio quality is crisp and clean and the noise canceling is AWESOME. I work in a noisy place and these put me in my own little world of great music. They are very comfortable as well. I did some research before buying these and I made the right choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"My ears say, just as good as Bose but much less expensive...","review":"These headphones were a great choice! From my perspective, all positives and no negatives. I almost purchased the Bose headphones at more than three times the price I paid for the Panasonic product but I'm sure glad I didn't! I had listened to the Bose and these headphones sounded just as good to me. A professional musician might have a different opinion but frankly, I couldn't tell the difference. In addition, they are sturdy and well made as is the zippered case they come in. I find these headphones extremely comfortable and can wear them for hours on end. I don't know why Bose charges so much more for their product. I hope Panasonic doesn't see this review as they might raise their price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great porduct and great price","review":"These headphones were purchased specifically for airline use. I can barely hear anything with the airline equipment, even at full volume. I bought a Bose set for my wife and she likes those a lot. I have used the Bose for a few minutes and I was impressed, but wanted to try a less expensive pair. These are just a good at a much better price. I am not an audiophile, but the difference between the Panasonic and the Bose is very slight, if any. They are comfortable and allow you to hear the airline equipment much better than the cheap headphones they pass out for free. The carrying case is compact and well designed to allow a compact travel package which will not get crushed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken Within Two Years","review":"These are (were) uncomfortable to wear, and the tight fit eventually resulted in the plastic breaking on the left earphone, rendering the headset unusable. The noise reduction was marginal, in my view. The sound for music and DVDs was pretty decent. If they had not broken, I would probably have been reasonably satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item failed out of the box - suspect poor quality control","review":"I was happy to pull the item out the box, and immediately disappointed that I could only get sound from one side. Eventually I isolated the problem to a faulty stereo jack in the headphone. Insultingly, Panasonic made me pay to ship the item to their place in Texas, and adding injury to the insult, sent me a \\"factory refurbished\\" unit in its place. This should be illegal. I paid for a brand new item -- and received a used item that cost $10 more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noise canceling sometimes makes noise","review":"These headphones sound nice and are comfortable, but the noise canceling feature is flawed. It sometimes spontaneously starts to hum (as if it's stuck in a feedback loop), and you have to turn noise canceling off and back on again to get rid of it. This is annoying enough that I just use them as regular headphones, with the noise canceling always turned off."},{"rating":"1","title":"They were awesome until they died twice in 9 months!","review":"I wrote a great review after having these for a month. Out of the box the right ear died and Amazon replaced it. Now after just 9 months the right ear has gone out again! Now I have a piece of expensive junk that doesn't work.Do yourself a favor and pass on this item always. I should have seen it after the first one was bad out of the box and then in 9 months the same probelm happened, the right ear is dead and amazon won't replace it.Check out the Bose or anything else. Now that is what I have to do and I won't be doing it on Amazon now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead on arrival","review":"Like several other reviewers, my earphones arrived with the left side dead.

The right ear developed an intermittent crackling noise even when there was no cord attached.I shipped them back (at my expense) and Panasonic hassled me about fixing them under warranty. Eventually, they agreed and shipped me a refurbished unit, which works (for now). Now I just have to hope the second pair lasts longer than the first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panasonic RP-HC500 Better than Bose QuietComfort 2 & 3","review":"The good: Eliminates all the background noise without introducing any other annoying sound. They are much cheaper too.:-)The Bad: The blue light on the side (power on). Flight attendances think is a wireless headset.Details:I have used these headphones for a while now and being a previous owner of a QuietComfort 2 & 3 I can tell you they are much better.The main deference is that with the Bose headphones is that while in use I still had the sensation of having an annoying sound but with the Panasonic RP-HC500 I do not hear any of the plane background noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good noise cancelling headphones","review":"I brought these headphones after reading the reviews at this site which was very helpful. I found it to be an excellent choice and have used it on some of my international trips already. I have not compared it head on with Bose but it has 95% noise canceling ability. I didn't realize till now how noisy it can get in an airplane and how helpful such headphones can be.I read a review on Amazon where there was a complaint that sound from only one side can be heard from an iPOD. I ran into this as well and the solution is to flip the connections on the wire connecting the headphone to the iPOD. Refer to the manual so the right end is connected to the iPOD. Once i did that, it worked perfect with my iPOD, laptop as well two other MP3 players I had.Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase and thanks to Amazon for on time delivery."},{"rating":"1","title":"ALMOST a Great Product, Almost.....","review":"This is a solid product, but it has one major flaw. The sound from the speakers does not stay inside the headphones. The headphones are loud, this allows other people to hear what you are listening to. The noise canceling feature is great, but because the headphones are too loud to outside people, I am returning them...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"In terms of blocking noise, the headphones are okay compared to others that I've tried. Not exceptional, and the battery life is pretty poor, but they are decent. Otherwise, the product quality is terrible. I've had two pairs now (bought for me by other people, I didn't buy the same product twice), and both have snapped at the extension hinge on both sides after several months of use. I'm not using them in any abnormal ways, nor am I using them exceptionally frequently; the product quality is just bad. I will not be buying Panasonic in the future, and I do not recommend these headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Both sides of the headset broke","review":"My dad bought these for me for christmas two years ago. the noise cancelling battery lasted mere weeks, and the right side of the headphone broke after 4 months after an innocuous drop from the desk to the carpeted floor that shouldn't have been a problem.Less than a year later, the left side broke. the problem is that the ear pieces are held to the headgear by a flimsy plastic mechanism, which when broken cannot be re-attached, or even effectively glued back together.Not a good investment for the price if you need durability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding headset","review":"I got this headset to replace an identical one that I gave to my daughter. I tried the famous and famously expensive Bose models at their demo booth and really didn't find them superior. These headphones provide excellent isolation with the soft ear cups and the noicse cancelling is wonderfully effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal","review":"Very impressed with both Amazon and the headphones; they performed perfectly and the reviews on the product were dead on, which is what sealed the deal initially.The headphones were for my wife, for travel; she is very fussy and she loved them. She did leave them on the plane after the second trip but that was expected, after 10 or so trips, but the price was right. I will buy another set when the price comes down a little; it has gone up some, since I purchased them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excessive Noise Leakage","review":"I purchased these headphones and had to return them in one day because of the excessive sound leakage from the headphones. I was very impressed with the headphones overall for the price, but as soon as I cranked up my music even a little in a quiet room, the sound could be heard as far away as 8 feet with the headphones on my head! I took them to work and the person next to my work space could identify each song by name by listening to the music coming from the headphones! It would seem this is a sound issue that could be easily corrected by Panasonic."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPERB SOUND FOR THE PRICE","review":"AN EXCELLENT VALUE FOR THE OUTSTANDING QUALITY AND ACCESSORIES INCLUDED.THE VENDORS PACKAGE ARRIVED IN A TIMELY MANNER AND WAS WELL PACKED.

Not acceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I bought these in spite of the negative reviews and right out of the box they failed to work properly.

I did a lot of research to decide which set to purchase since I was unwilling to pay $300 or more. These I think are just as good as the Bose. I was able to try the Bose equivalent headphones out at an airport kiosk during a trip. Any difference in performance is not noticeable to me.

They are worth a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased!","review":"Panasonic RP-HC500 Noise-Canceling HeadphonesI purchased RP-HC500 based on earlier reviews. I have used it for about a month now. I am very satisfied with its performance. It was a relief to have these headphones during my recent air travel from NY to LA and back. I have not used any other noise cancelling phones to comment on comparative performance. My primary use is for listening recorded books.RP-HC500 comes in a convenient hard case. Power switch can easily be turned on and off. With the switch on, background random and low frequency periodic noise (including jet engine noise) is cancelled as claimed. Some high frequency engine noise leaks through, which I did not find annoying. I have used it at home in the kitchen.

I've had over the ear headphones with noise cancelling (Sennheiser) and in the ear, earbud, headphones and neither was as comfortable or as effective at blocking out noise as these ones. I haven't tried the Bose headphones, but from my perspective there's no way whatever extra comfort and sound quality you get from the Bose (and I doubt there is much difference, if any), it can't be worth the extra $200 or $300 you will pay for it. I'm very happy with my choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather painful if you wear glasses. Early life failure.","review":"Beware that these (and probably a lot of similar ear-covering models) can be rather painful if you wear glasses. The cups will press against the glasses' temples. The noise canceling feature failed on one side after about 6 months, and about 5 hours use. Why so little use? They hurt too much. Incidentally, the cups do a pretty good job of suppressing outside noise even without the active noise canceling. If the headphones had been satisfactory I probably wouldn't have reviewed them. There may be many happy but silent users."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality for the price","review":"Originally I purchased these headphones just for their noise-canceling, but now I not only love them for that, I love how amazing my music sounds when playing through these.

This is a very effective quietness relief. I enjoy watching movies, very clear dialogue and immediately covers back ground noises. I say \\"GREAT JOB\\" Panasonic and keep up the great work. Highly recommended if you have background noises in your area. I also used them when I travel in the aircraft, what a relief and makes a big difference in the movie watching experience in flight.

Europe would of course achieve their big breakthrough in 1984 with their AOR-oriented third album, The Final Countdown. By comparison, Wings of Tomorrow (1982) is much more of a hard rock effort. Still, it contains some fine songs, which hold up very well almost three decades later. Lead singer / songwriter Joey Tempest had an intuitive gift for melody, which really comes through on this album. The title track, along with Storm Wind and Scream of Anger are the most metallic songs, and feature powerful guitar work by John Norum. Some of the others are a bit slower, but still very engaging. This is an underrated CD. The only caveat is that at nine songs and one short instrumental, it runs only 38 minutes. Of the two editions that are currently available, the mastering on the UK version is superior, and closer to the original sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star for the Instrumental","review":"Everybody remembers \\"The Final Countdown\\" by Europe and that's about it. There is good reason for that. Europe stumbled upon a great keyboard riff, and used it to maximum effect on \\"The Final Countdown\\", the keyboard riff sold the song.Unfortunately on \\"Wings of Tomorrow\\" you don't get a cool keyboard riff, and while the music isn't bad, anytime lead singer Joey Tempest opens his mouth the songs are ruined. Tempest's vocals have all of the edge and rock quality of Michael Bolton. So while the guitar work is pretty decent, Tempest begins his \\"ooohhhs\\" and \\"ahhhhhs\\" and immediately makes the songs annoying, you will get douche chills for certain. I can't imagine paying more than $2 for this disk, and that would be for the instrumental \\"Aphasia\\"...but even that isn't all that great, but to pay over $20 for this disk is a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practice Made Perfect Algebra","review":"This is an easy to carry booklet (72 pages) with easy to solve step-by-step examples for algebraic equations.

Greatest Common Factor (GCF) and Least Common Multiple (LCM) are introduced purely \\"experientially\\", followed by problems that quickly involve large numbers and lots of factors. Prime Time does not explain how to find GCF and LCM or even how to check your answers. Furthermore, prime factoring is introduced after large number GCF and LCM problems. The book does not provide any counter-examples to explain why some approaches that a student might try \\"experientially\\" fail. The games are repetitive and require many computations, and there is no other motivation of the subject. In short, this book utterly fails to distill and explain the essence of the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Introduction to the Works of James Thurber","review":"If you are not aware of the world of author/artist: James Thurber, {1894-1961}, this wonderful book is a fine place to be introduced to his work.This book contains all the stories from: \\"The Owl in the Attic\\", \\"The Middle-Aged Man on the Flying Trapeze\\", \\"Let Your Mind Alone!\\" and \\"Other More or Less Inspirational Places\\". Thurber's dry wit and sense of humor is timeless. The stories found here are of an American tradition of great authors such as: Mark Twain and Bill Mauldin. And with the addition of 125 cartoons from Thurber's pen, this book is quite a feast for the eyes.I am not going to go into great detail about the contents of this book, as these pages speak for themselves quite nicely. I am a big fan of this man's work and I believe anyone who buys this will enjoy it greatly.James Thurber; \\"American Original\\"...\\"92 Stories\\"...FOUR STARS !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly Great","review":"This book is a mostly funny collection of Thurber's stories and essays. Many show off Thurber's keen insight into the foibles of human nature told in a deadpan funny way. Especially good are his stories that he creates from scratch, and his satirical stories. However I found his pieces on the English language boring and the section where he lampoons self help books to be petty and whiny. Also interesting is the glimpse you get into the culture of the 30's which you can only get by reading the daily writing of the time. In all a good book to read since it is easy to skip the parts you don't like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"Wonderful study guide! This book is out of print but ver good either way. I ordered it again since our other one was worn out, and I liked it so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic fantastic fantastic!","review":"I have seen the show 4 times in London and I have to say that the soundtrack is just fantastic! The original cast have moved on but Adam Garcia was a great singer and dancer in the show and encapsulated all that was Tony Manero. In my mind though nobody will ever beat Richard Calkin who played Monty. The song Disco fever does not do him justice but his acting did. A good alround cast soundtrack but lacking in 3 songs from the show (especially Disco Duck!). Great for all ages!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER?","review":"Hardly...If you like broadyway go see the show but skip the recording...this ones not the inspiration that SNF was.Bad vocals and a bland re-recording of orignals.the only hope here stems from 'Immortality' a great Gibb song but wait for a better recording of it on some best of broadway cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pulsating, foot-stomping, feel-good show.","review":"Our family saw the show in London on June 19. It was fabulous. Everything about it is number one -- music, dancing, stars, etc. The show was packed and the cast did three encores. You know a show is good when the audience is on its feet and singing/dancing with the cast during the encores."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst 7 Seconds album?","review":"I haven't heard every 7 Seconds album released, but this must be the worst one (I hope). I can't even listen to this. It sounds like a bad version of grunge or something, and the songs are really badly written. Treat yourself with a good 7 Seconds album like The crew, Walk togerther rock together, New wind or even Soulforce revolution (a good poppy album) instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating tale of gay buccaneers","review":"It's too bad this book is out of print. The stories and lives of Caribbean privateers (careful, don't call 'em pirates) revealed in this book are indeed intriguing. Some of M.S. Hunter's fabrications such as the existence of an Italian island in the Caribbean are a bit baffling, yet his rendering of a fairly utopian interracial (albeit a bit misogynist) buccanneering society is captivating. Though, granted, I picked this book up because of my interest in gay fiction, the book would be of interest to a general open-minded readership. The book's erotic passages are thankfully short enough not to interfere with the story which is far more interesting. Because of this novel, I am much more interested in reading other literature concerning the adventures of buccaneers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Write Topic...Wrong Book","review":"A very poorly written book. When I followed one of the author's hints about installation, it resulted in an unstable system. The system is to be dual boot and the author simply said modify the lido.conf file - no examples given. The information I collected about my system was never used in the install. Red Hat does a great job. The author did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please be careful with this","review":"I actually believe this stuff is potent enough to kill someone. My friends please be careful. I basically use 1 capsule and break it down into 5 dosage since it is so damn potent.And believe me it is potent but not in a good way. Increased heart rate, nausea, body ache all that but 10 times worse than you can imagine. You have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too strong for me!","review":"I have ordered the non-standardized Swanson Yohimbe Bark 600mg (discontinued) before and found it to be very comfortable to take, and it gave me plenty of energy without feeling \\"wired\\". I just got this oder of Yohimbe standardized to 2% yohimbe alkaloid content in the 750mg size and an hour after taking one capsule my hands are shaking and I am sweating profusely. Luckily my blood pressure and pulse have not gone up (I'm checking it every 15 minutes or so), but these reactions alone will be enough to keep me from taking this product again. I am even nervous about ordering and trying the 2% at 500mg.Maybe this would be ok for some people that have a high tolerance, but if you were happy with Swanson Yohimbe before and are re-ordering I would definitely avoid this and go for the lower 500mg 2% dosage!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Avril go home, here is the real thing...","review":"Anyone else find it funny that this album has a poppy punk song called Skatergirl that was released before the crappy Avril song Sk8terboi and yet sounds very similar? Are these girls going to sue? It is a crime that they have such a brilliant album that is far more true to punk than Avril's Punk-wanna-be Britney sound and yet are unknown in the States.

It's just a bunch of interviews and old clips, entertaining for a while. Some of the stuff that they reveil is actually quite interesting, and this tape could be considered almost like a biography focused around the time of his show. There were some new clips, but it really wasn't all that great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Excuse for Entertainment","review":"Tom Green is a sick individual. This DVD is just one example of his lack of class and intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom Green Show: Total Crap","review":"Hi!This is my review of the Tom Green show MTV issued video \\"Uncensored,\\" which SHOULD have been titled \\"Behind the Scenes and Boring Interviews With the Cast, Producers, and Anyone Who's Directly or Indirectly Involved with The Tom Green Show.\\"It is what I have just said. This is the SAME EXACT thing MTV broadcast during their \\"uncensored\\" week, and it is DEFINATELY NOT uncensored.If, however, you are interested in what exactly goes into the Tom Green Show, you might enjoy this! It's insightful, thoughtful and contains very few actualy full skits from the show, and even LESS unreleased/uncensored video!For a better view of TRUE uncensored (for the most part) Tom Green, check out \\"Something Smells Funny,\\" or \\"Tonsil Hockey,\\" also available on Amazon.com.This is soely my opinion. I LOVE the Tom Green Show, and have been following it for years (quit laughing!), but this is just another ploy for MTV to make some money. Well, they got mine.--Drake"},{"rating":"1","title":"Might as well be called Tom Greens producers uncensored.","review":"Now don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those Tom Green haters. In fact, hes one of my favorite celebrities and I happen to think that he is a comedic genius. Unfortunately, I have to give this DVD 2 stars and that is all that it deserves.The title is completely misleading, Tom Green Uncensored. I would have to say Tom is only shown in about 35% of this movie, and the rest of it are his producers telling us about the show. About the uncensored part, everything that has been shown bleeped out on MTV is still very much CENSORED on this movie.Not once is a segment from his real show seen on this in its entirerty, and some of his funniest segments aren't even on here. And for a DVD, this is some of the worst sound i have ever heard, even on VHS!Sadly, all of you Tom Green fanatics like me out there will have to wait for something more representative of this crazy and hilarious Canadian to actually warrant a purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wish This Had Been Reviewed Before I Bought It","review":"This DVD has a totally misleading title. It is fully censored, and to top it off, the cast keeps interrupting the skits being showed. Seriously, let me get you straigt--the cast commentary is not all that bad, and some viewers may actually be intereseted in it--but the fact of the matter is that they spend more time on interviewing the cast then showing the skits. To make matters NOT ONE SKIT IS SHOWN IN ITS ENTIRETY. You will see more if you watch the show on TV. You will sit down to watch this video and think \\"well, they still bleep out all the words and blur the ... , but at least I have some of the funny skits on tape\\" WRONG. You will see your favorite skits WITH SUBSTANTIAL PORTIONS MISSING. Each skit is only about half as long as it would be if it was airing on MTV itself. I am much dismayed ... ."},{"rating":"1","title":"A DVD about Tom without Tom","review":"This is the worst. There are no segments. Totally forgettable. And it's people talking about episodes without the episodes, and none of these people you care about. If anything, this would be an \\"extra\\" included on the DVD collection of episodes, not a DVD in itself. MTV bites.. I am so happy he left them. I cannot give it 0 stars, so the one star goes to the DVD interface. It was the only thing laughable about the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Don't be fooled by the title of this video, \\"Uncensored.\\" It is NOT uncensored. It's only a video getting a behind-the-scenes perspective on the show. It shows already seen sketches with crew members discussing them. They're all censored, just like on the show. Unless this is what you want, this video isn't nearly as good as all of Tom Green's previous releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just average music, with dumb lyrics","review":"As most of the people here in Uruguay I have heard of the peyote asesino as the local sensation. In my opinion is far from being a sensation, the music is bad and the lyrics are nonsense. Look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun CD","review":"The title exaggerates a bit. There are much bigger country hits than the ones on this CD, nonetheless there are some great classics that will have any fan bobbing their heads and tapping their feet.This was a CD we originally picked up in a truckstop on our honeymoon trip. We played it loud all the way to the Grand Canyon. We fell completely in love with an obscure song, \\"Blood, Sweat and Beers\\" (track 14). I have never heard a song more describing of the American dream, or more representative of hard working people like us that fell in love."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRU Da Crime Family","review":"Its about time....

Beats by the Pound finally came out with some decent beats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Put's No Limit back where they belong","review":"Da Crime Family is tight, could of been better, as in they have too many slow songs on it. HOODY HOO will be a hit so will TRU HOMIES. No Limit has been putting some weak stuff out, but I think Cash Money is giving some pressure. Speaking of them, all of the sudden No Limit is claiming Uptown, in NO LIMIT ARMY, which is like Cash Money's BG \\"CASH MONEY IS AN ARMY\\" on Chopper City. Overall bout time No limit came out with some bout it shit, but there is no Mystikal on here."},{"rating":"2","title":"# 1 C D by NO Limit this year","review":"This CD is very good. Unlike most recent CD's by NO Limit this one has good beats and tight lyrics. Master P raps on many of the songs. It's not as good as the first TRU but it's definately one to buy. Songs 5,7,11, and 14 on disc one and songs 1,2,5,8,and 13 on disc two are the best songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Master P has lost it","review":"Master P needs to spend a little more time rappin' and not making movies and playing ball.

The Cash Money Crew takin over the N.O. Why is P talking bout Uptown now? I thought B.G. and Cash Money was yellin that. They beats are soft. They have a few cuts but that is it,a few. This will never go platinum, just tin foil if they are lucky. Cash Money has been the best since U.N.L.V. P needs to stop shootin ball and start working on putting No Limit back together, like droppin some of these newer artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Limit Finally Returns With Some Decent Production","review":"No Limit did a good job with this cd but there were too many slow beats, mainly on the first cd. They also addressed all the Death Row hating on No Limit on the first track of disc one. Hoody Hoo (Track2) was good, as was tracks 3, 5, 8, 10, 13, 14 on disc one, and for disc two there were more livelier beats, such as tracks 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 15. Sugar Bear did some good production work on TRU, and they also introduced 3 new soldiers; DIG, Baby Soldier and Popeye. DIG is the only one of those three i think has talent. There are only 2 or 3 songs on this cd that were just horrible, out of 29. So this album is a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why would such an awful CD be produced?","review":"I bought this album because everyone I knew was buying it that day.

It was being recorded around the same time Cash Money was beginning to take away No Limit's crown. It shows, as the Miller clan tried a little too hard, and ended up with only a single disc's worth of good tracks. Among the VERY FEW standouts are \\"Hoody Hoo\\" and \\"Soldier till I Die.\\" Best advice--save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS CD SUCKS DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"this is what is wrong with the rap game right now.... NO LIMIT they suck. All they are worried about is how much music they can put out. they are not even worried about if it is quality. all of no limit sounds the same. if you are looking to buy a real cd buy some of death rows old stuff. that is really rap. And cash money is another good one. I am glad that cash money records is starting to take some of no limits spotlight because cash money has so many diffrent sounds and it is actually quality rap music.

It will not go down as the CD of the year, but it is a solid effort from TRU. One of the first things that jumps out at first listening is how uneven the CD is. TRU seems to have no middle ground, either the song is tight or it is totally wack. Da Crime Family would have been better if it was just a single CD. Da Crime Family does have enough tight tracks, to justify buying it. Unlike a lot of recent No Limit releases, I would buy this on again.

Plus it seems like they are just puttin albums out just to make a quick buck and not thinking about quality. Every song on here is just average and below average, they better get it together cause Cash Money is takin' over.

The first time he came out he was aiight even though it was kinda corny like mase. Now this is even worse. the wack beats and names he's coming with now has got to go.

I must admit I started scanning and skimmiing the book about half way through due to boredome, so I never learned why ole Andrew Lewis wound up in bronze."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"OK Action, But Needed A More Solid Plot.\\"","review":"A renewel of the Korean War always makes for interesting fodder. However, Douglass could have handled it better. Also, better editing was needed. I noticed too many errors and inaccuracies for the standard paperback. The action scenes were OK. The missions got tougher as the book went on. Still I think the SEALS should have encountered a tad more difficulties. Did not get a real enough sense of the danger they were in. Plus character development was really lacking. The book was basically a series of missions the SEAL Team went on in Korea. It would have been better to have one central plot with a few other little missions thrown in on the side. Concentrating a three or four of the SEAL characters would have helped. All in all, this book had the markings that it was rushed into publication."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad","review":"this doesn't work tellin you then truth i bought one and it didn't work don't the astropad either it also doesn't work don't buy ones like this buy the ones made by dreamcast the are the originals so they work for sure"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would Have Been Good","review":"I am sure that this would have been a good controler...but for some reason, everytime you turn your Dreamcast off, when you turn it back on the controler won't work.

How can that be? This man is writing social commentary about modern America that is searing, accurate and funny. He is a wry, funny, vulnerable and exceedingly clever Songwriter and talented performer. What is wrong with you guys? This is a man who can save America with his songs!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Album !","review":"This is one of my favorite recordings of the last 10 years. The songs are funny, moving, and highly intelligent. Randy Newman is a song craftsman of the highest order. If you have overlooked this one, I recommend that you buy it immediately!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful album","review":"I got this CD when it first came out and I didn't really listen to it until I saw Mr Newman in London with the Royal Philarmonic and realised what wonderful songs he was still writing and that I should go back to it. If you are worried that Randy Newaman has gone the way of Elton John and others then stop worrying and listen to I'm Dead. By the way, I read interviews with Randy Newman in February when he played London and he said that \\"I Miss You\\" is actually a song to his ex-wife and not a song about urequited love."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't get it.","review":"Maybe it's because I'm not American, but I just don't get the hype. There are some good tracks on this CD, e.g. Shame, but a great deal of it, although it may be 'clever', is unlistenable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Music Lover From Minnesota","review":"I didn't pay attention to the one review I should have, namely the Australian Music Fan. Her review is right on. This album is too 'clever' by half and like she stated, the whole disc overall is unlistenable. Although there are a few tracks on it that I like, the song 'Shame' was offensive to me. I understand his use of parody but failed to find it humorous in that song. Because he felt the need to express the sentiments he did on that track, it took away a lot of the enjoyment I might have gotten from the 2 or 3 songs I liked. I strongly recommend that anyone who likes Randy Newman skip this disc as it leaves a bitter taste in your mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Bad Love\\" can make you laugh after all!","review":"I love this CD! My two favorite songs are Shame and Better Off Dead. I love a songwriter that can make me laugh, and Randy's sense of humor is just my style! I have been listening to this exclusively for a week now, because it has it all...great music and great lyrics too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"It's a fine album, and certainly his most listenable since \\"12 Songs.\\" But the album's masterpiece is a little ditty called \\"Shame,\\" which is, to me, the antidote/apology for \\"You've Got A Friend In Me.\\" This song plumbs depths of depravity hitherto undreamed of in rock & roll, and when he finally says \\"Shut Up,\\" well... it's just one of those moments. Essential stuff, really."},{"rating":"2","title":"Newman's best yet!","review":"I was pleased to see Randy Newman back in the studio for a \\"regular\\" recording session. But what an effort it was. I think that for a total package, this album/cd is easily the best he's ever put together in one session. His satire has never been better or stronger (I'm Dead, But I Don't Know It), his songs of unrequited love were very touching (Everytime It Rains, I Miss You) and his always razor sharp wit showed with my personal favorite. (Big Hat, No Cattle) Song for song the album is tight, well written and well-performed. I've always enjoyed Newman's work, but usually his albums would have only 2 or 3 really top-notch songs. This one is enjoyable from start to finish. I hope he records again soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Randy's take on aging without grace","review":"This cd is a real mixture of musical styles (as usual) but with one dominant theme running throughout. Looking back is not always a pleasant skip down memory lane. \\"Every time it rains\\" and \\"I miss you\\" are both sad odes to lost but not forgotten love. \\"My country\\" and \\"Shame\\" are brilliant in their selfishness and honesty. \\"The world isn't fair\\" is a great political statement of raw reality and realism. While it isn't his best and really not as good as Land of Dreams it still beats the tar out of 99% of what is out there in music land right now. Once again, the genius shares his wisdom with those who have the ability to listen and absorb."},{"rating":"2","title":"A visual treat that captures the thrill of Lindy's flight","review":"Mike Wimmer's art grabs the eye immediately and doesn't let go. The brief, staccato storytelling is effective, but mainly as an augment to the beautiful visuals, perhaps contrary to expectations. Through the use of atmospheric colors and close-up views of Lindbergh and his plane, you're there to share the thrill, exhilaration, and terror of the solitary pilot. This is a perfect book to convey the excitment of flying--especially its early days--to young readers, and a fine tribute to one of America's great men."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Air Up There","review":"The Dramatic story of an American Hero, the first to fly over the Atlantic Charles Lindbergh. This was a great book with good information and dates about Lindbergh's journey. The illustrations were awesome, I believe the illustrator used watercolors to paint the pictures in the book but gave them a very realistic feel. The story was just enough to know what was happening, the dates, and how Lindbergh became an American hero. Would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPERIOR.","review":"An amazing CD by an amazing band. I had never heard of Tunnels but went to hear them play because of my huge admiration of Percy Jones. I was a big fan of Brand X--but this is different. Tunnels is a total collaborative effort between Percy and the incredible Marc Wagnon. His midi-vibes squeak, honk, rumble, and are everywhere at once.All three studio Tunnels CD's have something to offer but this live CD gives you a taste of everything this incredible band has to offer. You will be pleasantly SHOCKED."},{"rating":"1","title":"nintendo 64 controller","review":"VERY DISAPPOINTING PRODUCTThe new controllers are nice to look at but lack the stamina of the original controllers.The button joystick is much smaller on the shaft and breaks easily.Won't hold up to the use they should be designed for.Expected much better"},{"rating":"2","title":"SKILZ PILZ ! ! !

Brooklyn was a wonderful character that has been hurt and was fearful of being hurt again like so many women. Isaiah has been hurt as well but his desire for Brooklyn allowed him to pursue his desire. It was a great read from beginning to end. Now the supporting characters. I loved the relationship between Yasmine and Isaiah, I hope Ms. Byrd uses that type of friendship in future stories. I absolutely could not stand Macy (enough said on that).

Also- the metal arm is covered by rubber, but the metal basket (which is what is resting on the tub surface) is not covered in a material that will not scratch the inside of the tub! Also the thing doesn't sit level no matter HOW much you bend the arm - everything (soap/shampoo bottles/shave cream) FALLS OUT!! So far no scratches - ok - but we are also super careful.

Its a quick read and easy to understand.One aspect of the book that I did not like was its coverage of Quality Control. To me, i found the quality control method to be subjective and not useful as an instructional designer. Instead of using these wordy acronyms, I would have like to see Hodell emphasize the kirkpatrick model and the benefits of using it.

This is definitely the best book written on Al Capone and I've read many of them, including Bergreen's and Kobler's which were also good but this one had something more. Very well written, it shows Capone's strengths and weakness in equal measure. And, where his strengths are concerned, in particular his loyalty. As this book makes clear it was his alliances, his friendships, gained from a reputation of keeping his word and from being loyal, especially as a lieutenant to Johnny Torrio, much more than fear on the part of his enemies, that earned him respect and power.

Right out of th box I had dead frets. The neck looked a bit bowed so I loosened the strings to get the truss rod and -gasp- NO TRUSS ROD. But an allen wrench came with it so that became f***ing useless. I even bought a bigger saddle to raise the strings a little higher and perhaps cancel out the dead frets. Nope. After a month it just kept getting worse and worse until I got fed up with this piece of garbage, smashed it, and threw it in the burn pit. I expected a lot more from a guitar with the Gibson name. Hell, I just wanted it to WORK. I've been playing guitar for about 8 so I'd like to think that I know what a guitar should sound like and this guitar was comparable to a FirstAct guitar. It was a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED","review":"The CD stopped playing the first time I played it. I threw away the shipping papers and could not send it back.

No wonder my kids wouldn't eat them!!They are dry and taste like cardboard and anything resembling a chocolate chip certainly isn't because there isn't a bit of chocolatey flavor in them!!

No matter what I cook even if it sticks a bit if I let the pan sit in water for a few minutes I can literally rinse anything off of it.It heats extremely evenly, even on my cheap apartment, lopsided stove. I no longer have to worry about keeping all my food in the center of the pan to get it to cook evenly.The high sides of the pan is also pretty fantastic, as I don't make as much of a mess when I'm cooking.Overall, a fantastic buy and I love Faberware all the more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexpensive Teflon pans work great and look fabulous.","review":"I had fairly low expectations for these pans when I purchased them, but I needed something to use while I figured out what brand of high quality cookware I wanted to use, but I've been pleasantly surprised with them. The fit and finish is of good quality, they look nice, and they work great. That's not without caveats, however, any cheap Teflon pan can become pitted or scratched if you overheat them (Teflon melts, you know) or use metal utensils on them, and I can't say how well the finish will hold up over time, but if you're gentle with them they should last for a good while.

I owned this application for far less than a year, but as soon as I upgraded to Tiger, it became incompatible and I was notified I'd have to pay 20 dollars (on top of the 40 dollar original price) for an upgrade. Customarily, shareware upgrades are optional unless there has been a drastic OS change- a developer has to _earn_ upgrades by including new features or improvements. Bugfixes and compatibility fixes, in both the shareware and commercial software world, are usually free.And while markspace claims that Tiger is radically different than Panther, why did Pocketmac (the alternative PocketPC sync program) allow Tiger compatibility in just a free point release?

I'm on a Mac, I'd have believed that if it was a PC. But I did a fresh install anyway just to prove it was there software. I've never heard from them since. Now I'm on an android phone and they want $40 not for their zero customer service software. I don't normally leave bad reviews unless you really screw me over.

It heats up quick and produces steam well etc, but it performed far below what I thought were reasonable expectations.

You don't have to worry about stripping this bolt or bending/stretching it as long as you don't go berserk on this fastener.Cons:*Very limited usable size.

One difference between \\"Infield\\" and \\"Outfield\\" is that we see heaven in \\"Infield\\", and it is not a pretty sight. Disney's heaven is a dangerous, gloomy world full of mashed potatoes and evidently only right-handed people can go there because Babe Ruth made it to Disney heaven, but he had to convert to right-handedness.

I read the book in about two days - an easy read. Without giving too much away, the entire plot was obvious from the beginning except to all of the characters in the book. Some of the dialogue didn't seem very realistic. I often found myself thinking that actual people don't really talk like that. And the whole plot line involving Nora and her ex-husband was predictable and frankly not very interesting. I didn't really care what happened between them one way or another.

Rany Castillo's drumming was no way comparable to that of Tommy Alridge or Lee Kerslake; the bass of Phil Soussan is buried, there's no way to compare it with Bob Daisley. And Jake Lee, altough very skillfull, never had a real chance to compete with Randy Rhoads's ability to play and compose.This is not a bad album by any standards (Ozzy can't do that; he and his team are too much good for it).

I've come to expect crap from the once mighty singer of Black Sabbath and frontman to Randy Rhoads (thanks sharron), a parody of himself actually, but this was the first album of his solo career that was terrible and was a sign of things to come! When such a high star rating is given to crap, the stars have lost all meaning, and if you actually think this drivel deserves 4 Stars my advise to you is.. nothing. Don't mistake nostalgia for quality, sure it reminds you of a happy time growing up? but vote with your ear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough real research","review":"Considering the length of this book's bibliography I had supposed that it would offer some real insight into the moon and its effects. What I got was a lot of superstition, personal conjecture and rehashed mistakes. The assumption that thousands of years ago humans did not pay attention to the wandering bright stars we now know as planets is just one of the many misguided statements. Instead of reading and quoting real anthropological or historical studies about the moon the author relies on supposition and non-scholarly sources to create this book.If the author had declared her intent to write about her own supposition, experience and conjecture and then had really done so it would have been a much better book than this mismash attempt.The writing itself is disjointed and awkward. I would recommend giving this a miss, unless you really need to fill out your book shelves, or are rabidly collecting calendar, moon or astrological information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Curious but Not Effective","review":"Read this book and listened to a discussion from one of the authors. Most of the material is extremely offensive to any educated person. While the correlation between success and military campaigns is curious reading for military buffs - this material is largely non-applicable for a real business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very cheaply made...","review":"I bought this violin as a beginner, took it to a master violin maker and was told it was a cheaply made korean product. She explained and showed me why they are cheap, pegs will not stay in tune, the bridge isn't arched enough to allow a player to easily play all the strings without hitting the others, and my bow was so cheap is actually warps in the frog area when I tighten it, looking like it's going to break. Stay away from this product, do what i did; go to a stringed music store and buy a used violin. I got an $800 violin for $350, it isn't the prettiest but it sounds wonderful and it made learning MUCH easier!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good.","review":"Although the shipping was pretty fast, the item wasn't that good. I know it was only $100, so I should not have expected something really nice. Maybe it was the transportation, but the rosin case came broken. That's okay, but the fine tuner on the E string was also broken. It keeps falling out of place, so I had to be careful with the tuning of this string. The neck also has a problem. It isn't completely painted. Another thing about this violin is that there is a number 43 written in pencil, which you cannot erase (or at least I don't think you can). I guess the one I bought was #43rd violin for that batch haha. Also, it might have just been my luck, but I would not recommend this violin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cecilio viloin","review":"my son takinf lessons for the first time, teacher said this is best buy for new beginners.

This would have been funny if it hadn't wasted precious time needed to return it and get the right gift with only a week to go!

Thank you Amazon and UPS for making it so easy to return, that I appreciate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delivered Damaged - Returned","review":"Below is a list of the problems that resulted in my immediate return of this item...- Multiple scratches, blemishes & scrapes on the front of the violin- Strings were bent in several places presumably from poor storage- Bridge is very poor quality- 1 of the fine tuners is broken and the remaining 3 are warped- Wood shavings sticking up around the f holes- Pencil scribbling on the fingerboard- The instrument was obviously strung in a hurry and was done very sloppily"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this \\"instrument\\"","review":"As an elementary strings teacher, I highly recommend NOT purchasing this instrument. Some families ignore the advice of teachers and purchase these instruments. They ALWAYS need repair fresh out of the box and are extremely poor quality. The pegs are painted black to look like ebony -- they do not stay in tune. The strings break pretty easily. The bridge falls off constantly. The bow is cheap, cheap, cheap.If you have a child who is interested in playing the violin, spend about $20 a month to rent a good one from a reputable music store. Very few students who have violins like this one continue playing after a year. Some might say that the instruments are fine for beginners. Far from it; they will hamper a student's progress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money :(","review":"I really wanted this violin to be as solid as it looked. Certain pieces of it are well made, such as the chin rest--solid wood, very nice. And it comes with two bows, strings, and rosin--a great deal, even though one of the bows was overtightened out of the box and rendered useless, and both bows were slightly warped. Better that it comes with two, at least!But I was disappointed to find that within less than half times of gently using this violin during lessons, the tailpiece snapped, making it unplayable. Right in the middle of a lesson, too. I have it in for repairs, to fix both the tailpiece and widen the holes for the string pegs, which are far too small according to my teacher.I would save the $100 and invest in a beginner's violin in the $400-500 range, if you're serious about becoming a student. I wish I had!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great or even good for any amount of money","review":"Where to start. The Rosewood is not, it is some Chinese weed that is the color of boxwood and used to be marketed that way. It is way too soft to make pegs from, they easily go out of round and then you can't tune the instrument. They even admit that the fingerboard is painted, that is a sign of a very low quality instrument. The black paint comes off on your fingers and it makes it very difficult to resurface and almost all of this level of violin needs to have the fingerboard properly surfaced. The strings are really cheap Chinese no name brand and they sound just awful. They give you two bows because neither is any good. You will need to invest anothr $150-200 to make this instrument playable for a beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good and the price was not too bad.","review":"When I read one of the reviews, I did not want to buy the violin. I just wanted to rent it, but renting it would cost me the same as buying it.I do not regret buying this violin. It is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great violin for beginners to intermediate players!","review":"I hadn't played violin for almost 10 years and wanted to get back into it, but not spend a fortune doing so. So I opted, with trepidation, for this Cecilio. I'm so glad that my fears were unfounded, as this little squawk-box sounds GREAT! Thoughtful touches like an included shoulder rest and fine tuners just sweeten the pot. I couldn't recommend it any more highly.[...]Again, love the instrument and suggest you give it a try if you're wanting to begin or get back into playing violin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"My son used this violin for about 6 months. Now I feel it is time to get him a new one. I bought it because it looks nice and provides some spare parts. Very soon, I realized why. One of the strings was broken very soon. The bridge was out of shape after 3 months. Most important, it does not stay in tune. My son's violin teacher told me that it is very difficult to tune it and suggest me to get it repaired.I brought it to a string store. The guy told me immediately:\\" Did you get this online? It is not a good brand.\\" It would be at least $40 to repair it.I suggest you stay away from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS INSTRUMENT","review":"I repeat DO NOT BUY THIS INSTRUMENT. I work at a music store (I'm not trying to advertise myself or anything) and I get parents bringing these in all the time. They are horrible. The tuning pegs are never fit properly and the bridges normally need to be fitted too which is normally $40 in repairs. Without these repairs, the instrument WILL NOT STAY IN TUNE and a lot of times we refuse service because we cant guarantee the work. The tailpiece,fine tuners, and tuning pegs only fit the strings provided with them which are atrocious and super thin, so when you run out of them and go to a music store to get a standard string, they will not fit without drilling bigger wholes in the pegs and bending the fine tuners. I recommend going to your local music store and testing out violins and seeing the difference in quality. You can easily get a cheaper violin from a trusted store that can also give warranties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your child is worth more than this!","review":"This instrument is pretty. Hang it on the wall. That is all it is good for. I teaching beginning strings and have had this instrument come into my classes. I cannot get it in tune or if close, it won't stay in tune. The hairs on the bow all come out by the end of the year and I've seen the bows break in half. Do not waste your money. Your child is worth more than this!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"honestly a great buy","review":"I've had this violin for a weekI don't believe I could have been more excited to receive it after playing my nephew's viola over christmas. With everything this package comes with you cannot go wrong.I was worried it wouldn't stay in tune but it is. And make sure you go to town with the rosin to make sure the bow actually works. Most people buying this are new to bowed instruments and don't realize you need to cake on the rosin to make sound.Just scratch the smooth surface of the rosin with a knife or scissors to activate it.patience and have fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book fell apart","review":"I purchased this book after learning about it from an ad in Utne. The first part of the book was entertaining. Although it often had the academic qualities of a quiz from Cosmo, there were a few gems of insight into human behavior. It was terribly hard, however, to get past the author's overinflated opinions about her own abilities to control/influence others around her. The biggest problem with the book, however, was that it fell apart...both literally and figuratively...long before I reached the end. The binding was destroyed by the time I finished page 30, and I had to carry it around bound with a rubber band. Fortunately, the second half of the book also fell apart in terms of human interest, and I was able to give up on the scattered page hunting and throw it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool","review":"The Queen of RNB is back.Songs are enjoyable to listen.Couple of favourite songs, Free, Girl talk and Ups & Downs.A must for all Amuro fans :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd is awsome!","review":"I can not get enough of this music and the artist is so good!

Elvin (Elvin Bibiloni) gets evicted from his apartment. Fabian (J. Fabian) and a few guys help him move out. That is pretty much it. They encounter some problems and have flashbacks. The title comes from the drug \\"G\\" that they take, a liquid form of ecstasy.The stories are insulting and juvenile. The humor is coarse and immature. The film opens with a disclaimer, warning that the film is insulting to race, religion, and women who are typically called the \\"C\\" word. The film compares itself to South Park, but it lacks the cleverness. If you can't enough of the Howard Stern type adolescence humor, then this film is certainly for you.

When they are forced to part on less than good terms, Surt vows to destroy Borr and everything that he is. Surts curse will fall on his son, Voden, to face. Great use of Norse myths and introduces Babylonian (Assyrian?) legends in a rich, imaginative fasion. Don't know why Schmidt is not more well known."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terror's all right","review":"It's a shame that a group like Pavement will probably never be appreciated. Their world-wide fame should've come with Wowee Zowee. It didn't, at least not to the Radiohead/Beck scale. It also pisses me off that Blur did to Pavement what Alice In Chains did to King's X. Anyway, maybe it's the punk rocker mind-set of mine, but I sort of like Pavement unpopular. I'd hate to see a Pavement T-shirt on every teenyboppers back the way Nirvana used to be. They're mine to a degree, and I like every Pavement record ever made. I'll grant you that TT is not up there with the incredible Wowee Zowee or the tight Slanted and Enchanted, but it is a better album than anything I've heard since Wowee Zowee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beatiful record","review":"This so-called die hard fans are not what they claim. As a band Pavement had a natural process of evolution wich i really dig. I believe the music has gotten tighter of course and to me Terror Twilight is their best album yet, the most crafted and beatiful. Every album speaks for its period of time and this one does too in an incredible way, too bad fans can't see it that way, What were you expecting?, Slanted & enchanted and crooked rain were great too, in their time, but i would be disappointed seeing the band release this couple of albums forever. Besides that, Hi-Fi is a lot better and makes perfect justice to their music.P.S i just hope they don't split."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album - so stop your whinin'!","review":"To anyone that truly believes that Pavement has lost it or has sold out, I sincerely urge you to listen carefully to \\"Folk Jam\\" and \\"You Are a Light\\" again. Where else are you going to hear a lyric like \\"Watch out for the Gypsy children in electric dresses, they're insane/I hear they live in cremetoriums and smoke your remains\\"? They may have mellowed a teeny bit with age, but this is still PAVEMENT, folks.I'm especially perplexed by those who've decried the album's lapse in indie cred, then cite \\"Spit on a Stranger\\" or \\"Major Leagues\\" as the only worthy tunes, when they are the closest things to hit single material I've ever heard from the band. I suggest that you people just chill and enjoy what I think is the best rock release of year to date (and note that I'm not even a huge fan)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snore","review":"I'm sorry.....I love pavement, but that won't stop me from coming down on this record like a macho man elbow drop from the top of the turnbuckle. I can't knock a band for being extremely prolific, and wanting to change it's style a little bit after every 100 songs, but Brighten The Corners was Pavement turning on their blinker to leave the two lane country road that represents my musical tastes, and Terror Twilight puts them on the exit ramp. It's mellow, it's thoughtful, it's nicely produced, and it bores me to tears. Thank God for the Silver Jews."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, solid effort.","review":"With Brighten the Corners and now their current release, Pavement has seemed to settle into their own skin. Here's a band that thrives on pop hooks but never succumbs to predictability. Their songwriting has become more polished and consistent. They seem to have played with the production more on Twilight Terror that with their previous releases and with good results. Many of the songs have quite a bit going on in the background that may not be apparent at first listen. Spending a little time with this album will pay off."},{"rating":"2","title":"good-not great-pave album","review":"A middling pavement album is better than most bands could ever hope for. I totally disagree with the monkies who say that spit or carrot are what to take away from this album. Trust me, you are a light and cream of gold are the crowning achievements here. I mourne the absence of any Scott songs on this album. His songs have lent a sweet, other side to recent releases. It's fun to listen to him deal with getting older and domestication. I don't see how anyone can say this is a better album than BTC--no way. None of the songs on TT approaches the funky majesty of Blue Hawaiian or Type Slowly. I think they should switch back to Mitch Easter--he seems far more democratic. He also let them play without chopping off a great jam (listen to the end of speak, see, remember). Hey, buy the album and judge for yourself. Also, check out the b sides to carrot--they missed a couple of keepers there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle Brilliance","review":"This is a very dark album. Calling it \\"dull\\" as some people have done is misreading what \\"twilight\\" is. This is the time of day when things are muted and shadowy, lacking in extremes and definition.

What people call the best tracks, Major Leagues, Carrot Rope, Spit On... are in fact not the best tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just picked it up and it's great so far!","review":"Not quite Brighten the Corners but still probably the best album that will come out this month whether people realize it or not.

It was released in Japan about a month or two ago. And being a big Pavement fan.... I have been listening to it almost everyday. But the difference in this CD is the shortness. Pavement albums are good because you can put them on repeat all day and never get bored..... but this album is only 45 minutes.... and after a few times around you wonder why they couldnt fill a normal length CD.... Of course its great BUT............ I want more Pavement to play!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Past their prime","review":"This record is in the mediocre mold of \\"Brighten the Corners\\" and a far cry from Pavement's glory days of \\"Slanted and Enchanted\\", \\"Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain,\\" and the \\"Watery Domestic\\" EP.

Who are these guys and what have they done with Pavement?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pavements Best Album Ever!","review":"After repeat listenings of Terror Twilight and then comparison listenings of other pavement albums it is clear that their songwriting has matured for the better. The songs on Terror Twilight are more complex and interesting as well as better produced than any other Pavement. This alnum makes Crooked Rain sound like a demo for a high school band. Terror Twilight mixes sounds and genres into what is definitely Pavement's most accomplished album to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"They did it!","review":"Many years ago, Stephen Malkmus said Pavement would one day record the perfect album. Many thought it couldn't get better than \\"Slanted\\". But give this one some time and you'll sing it in the shower, hum it the car, drift back to its depth and humor. Exceptional work from a band already acclaimed for its exceptional catalog."},{"rating":"2","title":"block rockin beats","review":"Once again back is the incredible P. Pavement is number 1 in my books for the way they make me feel. Isn't that music after all? With sounds and words, the artist can make one feel as they did or would. Pavement makes me feel a little bit country and a little bit rock and roll all at the same time. And on this album, one can tell how the songs will sound just from their title. Except for Spit on a Stranger that is. The song is much nicer than the title. I would have called the song \\"loogie on a fellow plebian\\" though. Hey, to each their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensational","review":"No....I haven't listened to the album yet, of course. But it's obvious that I would give it 5 stars if it were out. I heard Spit on a Stranger once on the radio, and it was amazing. It was on the radio alarm...it sure woke me up too. Not because it was a loud song (which it isn't) but because I was so excited when I heard the words, \\"Spit on a stranger\\" on the radio, knowing it was Pavement. CAN'T WAIT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"you know it's gonna rock","review":"I would like to say that the tracks i have heard from the album are amazingly good. Same old Pavement sound.

I heard 4 of the tracks already, and while they're not breaking any new ground, the sound hasn't grown vapid. So buy it. Its pavement.

But they're still better than most anything around-and thats quite impressive for their 5th album."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is boring.","review":"This album is so boring that I've completely lost interest in the band. Brighten the Corners was weak, too. Neither album has the energy and wit of Wowee Zowee and the others before it. These slackers are really slacking it.

Buy the Spit on a Stranger EP instead. The five songs there (two of which were recorded in 1996) outdo everything on Terror Twilight (except for the title song, of course)."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Pavement?","review":"I know I haven't heard the album yet, but I doubt that most of the people who have reviewed this have heard the whole thing either. However, from the sound samples, I can tell that Pavement continues to go downhill, sliding towards radio-playability. \\"Spit on a Stranger\\" sounds like a bad Beatles rip off, and \\"Major Leagues\\" is pathetic. My advice is to stick with \\"Westing (By Musket and Sextant\\") and \\"Slanted and Enchanted\\"--they are masterpieces. Pavement has gone downhill since then. It's sad, but at least they produced two incredible albums worth of material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily their most polished effort.","review":"The hooks and melodies and stellar lyrics on this baby make it the most cohesive thing Pavement has really done in my opinion. I love Wowee Zowee for its quirky sensibilities and of course the debut is something special. Their other records also have their highs and lows. This one though has to be the most catchy and defined album of their career. You can say what you want about the band, and some people seem to think this is one of their okay records, but it's obvious after a few listens that many of these songs are superior to a lot of their older work. As I said the melodies, the instrumental creativity, and Malkmus' lyrics all work together here to create something that I call a perfect record. Not to say it doesn't have ANY flaws but I don't really see them. Check this out but work your way from the Slanted and Enchanted, their first record, if you want to see how much these boys have grown over the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hell Yea!","review":"I just got turned on to Pavement by a co-worker and i am loving every minute of it. I went and got all of their albums and they all rock. I would have to say in my opinion, which really is meaningless, this is their best ablum. Don't get me wrong S&E is great but i like this more indie-pop sound, it reminds me of my hometown boys, Built to Spill. Great lyrics, great playing, awsome production make for a dope album, I would have to say Brighten the Corners is right behind this in my ranking. If you like indie start with Slanted & Enchanted, if you like indie pop start here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pavement proves it again","review":"Nobody should have ever doubted that this album would be amazing. Pavement has created a unified album with the same amount of lyrical quirkiness and musical talent that has won fans over for years. They continue to move towards obvious folk and country influence, without losing their ability to craft a pop song with bite. The only drawback is for uninspired production."},{"rating":"2","title":"It gets good after the tenth time","review":"This album, like most Pavement albums, takes about 10 times of play before you appreciate it or perhaps let your mind adjust to it. \\"Spit on a Stranger\\" and \\"Major Leagues\\" are clearly the best songs on the album. Overall Malkmus' lyrics are once again solid and the band's musical talent is fantastic.It seems Pavement continues to become more and more popular despite any band member's attempt to market them into mainstream. I suggest a purchase for this album and for those fans who are dissapointed in the improved production and their attempt to move slowly away from low fidelity with this album, buy a cassette and play it on a $49 portable Sony tapedeck and turn the treble up all the way. You won't know the difference from their first album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great songs individually","review":"On first listen I hated the album because it started out with four slow songs instead of the mixing I was expecting, so it took forever to get the feel for the album. Now I only listen to it on \\"Random,\\" and I am so addicted to each song individually, I can't get them out of my head. I am a bit disappointed that Spiral doesn't have more of a presence lyrically, but I still love the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true Latin Jazz experience beyound expected","review":"After hearing this CD I just went out of this world. The way Jerry Medina hits those high notes and the rythmic and melodic interpretation is really an experience to share with those who really enjoy good music, specially music with that caribbean spiciness that makes you jump out of your seat! This is a CD that you can hear on and on and you'll never get tired because it has a fresh and innovative sound. Felling Alright is one of the best CD's I've listen from a Latin Artist in many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works just as described.","review":"Bought this to use with the battery starter.

Then this author, Verschuur, trashes Velikovsky. Verschuur states hackneyed cliches about Velikovsky that were part of the most disgusting scientific blackballing in history. Verschuur does not address all of the overwhelming evidence that NASA has devoped over the last 40 years which were all anticipated by Velikovsky. What about the 900 degree surface temperature of Venus, or radio signals from Jupiter, or thick dust on the moon (remember the footprints of our astronauts?), or the scores of other discoveries all of which Velikovsky clearly anticipated and Verschuur ignores while promoting his own daffy theory. As an objective writer, Verschuur is a failure, and as an observer of alternative science he is lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"An assorted collection of almost useles stuff","review":"I have owned this kit for about 3 months. You get a cheap cassette adapter to connect your jukebox to a car with a cassette player. This is not different from any cheap car adapter you get at your local pharmacy. You also get a power adapter for the car - this is also a general voltage adapter which plugs into the cigarette lighter adapter. You get another cheap pair of headphones similar to the ones that shipped with your Jukebox. About the only useful thing is the remote control which is of moderate use if you place your jukebox in a place that is inconvenient to reach directly when driving. It seems like a useful collection but in the end I only find myself using the power and cassette adapter. Then again, its not that expensive. Just do not expect too much or good quality - this is cheap aftermarket stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"The product that doesn't exist","review":"The vendor took my money and failed to ship the product. The dealer didn't notify me that the product was unavailable, and no refund was sent or offered until I specifically wrote and asked what happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"A collection of overpriced junk.","review":"Unless you really need the remote don't buy this junk. Even the remote is pretty useless. It has a two foot cord on it which begs me to ask the question \\"Couldn't you just as easily use the buttons on the player?\\" It also doesn't have a clip on it so if you're thinking of attaching it to something you best be prepared to slap some velcro on it. The cassette adapter is useless. I don't even know anyone with a cassette deck in their car anymore. The headphones are crap unless you like listening to just treble. No bass response at all. Turn the bass up on the player and you're listening to sweet overpowering distortion. The stereo cable can easily be found somewhere else. The car power adapter is a cheap, underpowered universal type. You'd be better off buying a 9v radio shack adapter with more mah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst experience ever","review":"Send me a generic/universal car kit instead of real car kit and off course it did not work no contact # for customer service on their website.

It includes Liszt, his premiere student, Reubke, and the usual French organ suspects.His tempi is always faster than normal. I have concluded he is challenging the boring \\"funeral parlor\\" image of the trudging organ sound that filled so many a people's minds and previous associations with organ music. This is all fine and dandy, but his music lacks soul, expression, and musical sense, not to mention acoustical considerations of the space.He's clearly well trained and has played a lot of rep, but I feel as if he's played this rep too much to the point where it is a mechanical action rather than a special event in his quotidian routine.If you want to hear agitated and lightning speed recordings of this music, by all means, buy it. If you want good organ playing, buy another recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contains two of the spunkiest, hippest tunes of the 1980s.","review":"Fishbone has gone through many changes over the past few years, and their sound has become more hard-core as the band has aged. This EP is their first major release, and it catches the band at an energetic and creative high. While not as polished or well-rounded an effort as the later \\"Truth and Soul,\\" this album offers fun, soulful, high flying dance music. It's a satisfying blend of ska, funk, rap, and good ol' creativity.The album is a must have for \\"Lyin' Ass Bitch\\" and \\"Party at Ground Zero\\" -- two of the spukiest, hippest tunes of the 1980s"},{"rating":"2","title":"BONE IN THE USA","review":"Truly Bone in the USA, I go back to 1986 with this CD to my days as a DJ for my college radio station. I took it to the next level seeing Fishbone live three times from Raleigh, NC (Hot 'lanta) to St. Louis, MO (Mississippi Nights). I was taken by the fact that they were something I had longed for all my life, a black band that was not afraid to rock.....Blending rock, reagge/ska and funk with irreverent socio-political undertones this band can best be described as an American equivalent of Madness. Going one step further and giving them their full credit every band which has followed (Living Color, Mighty Bosstones, No Doubt and Red Hot Chili Peppers) all trace their roots back to this EP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid EP. We need more music like this!","review":"I've owed The Reality of My Surroundings a few years now (it has the best songs I've ever heard from a non-mainstream band), and have heard the hits off Truth & Soul. I went to buy that CD from the used record store down the street, but they didn't have it, so I got Fishbone's s/t album instead. I had heard \\"Party at Ground Zero\\" before, and I've even seen the music video (crazy footage of the band and friends wearing fish heads while anticipating a nuclear war). Anyway, I loved the song with the video, but it's too repetitive without something visual to accompany it. It's still a good song (along with the rest), but I like a prefer many of the others more. My favorites are \\"Modern Industry\\" (where Fishbone salute their local radio stations as well as foreign ones from Sweden), the cool and laid-back \\"Another Generation\\", and the very funny \\"Lyin' Ass Bitch\\" (at first, I didn't realize the lead on the song was female and thought it was Angelo playing around)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used guides who you can't understand their English-unprofessional DVD","review":"I was very disappointed in this unprofessional DVD.....It is nothing but a traveler's personal DVD taken while traveling with guides speaking on them.....The guides are extremely hard to understand......I wanted a DVD with English but did not dream they would use someone you could not understand....I will never purchase anymore DVD's from this company....This was a waste of $22.....I just assumed it would be a professional DVD so this was my fault...learned a good lesson....don't purchase Discoveries DVD's"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blob, Blob, Blob","review":"It writes overhead, on oil and water, it flows nicely, has a nice color but it blobs every time I use it.

Wolf in sheeps clothing is 5 minutes of looping drums and bassline with cheesy 80's synth over the top. Finally Deeper Underground (Chillington Mix) tries to have a more darker sort of industrial sound which sounds pretty mushy and terrible, as the vocals do not fit in one bit with the music.Overall though if you want all the songs, be sure to get the jewel case version as the cardboard slipcase with trays get annoying and damaged easy and its easier to have 1 cd with all the songs on it rather than 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Japanese Pop Album in 1980s","review":"Many people say this is the greatest Japanese pop album in the early 1980s. Several million copies are sold in Japan. The creator, Eich Otaki, is one of the most respected composers and producers in the commercial popular music industry in Japan.Collaborating with Takashi Matsumoto, Otaki's melodious sound earns the romanticism of Matsumoto's lyrics and creates an unparalleled kind of popular music of that time in Japan. The outcome was phenomenal. \\"A Long Vacation\\" and Otaki's other compositions greatly influence Japanese pop music in 1980's.If you have lived in early 1980 as a young adult in Japan, this album must bring you back all kinds of memories of your old days. This is an important piece in the history of Japanese popular music."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Case of the Howling Dog","review":"This book was listed in good condition.

I am no professional soccer player and it couldn't live up to my standards. I wanted to use this to work on my shot for indoor soccer but it severely impedes your aim, distance, and strength, so the ball ends up nowhere close to where it would without using the kick medic.

On the first page was a revelation that answered questions I'd pondered over for years concerning the early failure of my first marriage. I have gone on to read several of his books, and each is excellent. These books are not the kind that a person can read quickly, only because they are so profound that they take a lot of personal reflection to absorb. Yet to say they are invaluable is a great understatement. They have continually helped me to understand my own behavior as well as that of others."},{"rating":"1","title":"My expectations too high","review":"While I have the ultimate respect and admiration for Margie Goldstein-Engle, I was extremely disappointed in reading this book. Written on a third grade reading level, it was more about her mother's pride in her daughter, than how Margie overcame obstacles. True, it did tell of her perserverance against many \\"hurdles\\" that stood in her way. However, I had expected a more personal account of what Margie thought and specifics about what she did to improve her riding skills, how she adjusted her riding to compensate for her size, how she paid for horse shows early in her riding, etc. This book did not meet the hurdle of my expectations, but my respect for Margie Goldstein-Engle remains high. I will save this as a gift for one of the very young riders at our barn."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mother's Subjective Point of View","review":"This was clearly written from a mother's subjective point of view. While it included many of Margie's accomplishments, it did little to describe how she actually overcame obstacles in her path toward professional Grand Prix riding. How did she obtain exclusive rights to horses from Hidden Creek's stables? How did she manage entry and travel fees before she was a recognized rider? How did her size help or hinder her riding? One reviewer's statement that this was written from a \\"mother's, third person objective point of view\\" is comical. No mother can write about a child, of whom they are so obviously proud, objectively. This was clearly from a mother's subjective point of view. This could certainly be considered a \\"delightful diversion\\" by any pre-teen. Serious riders should stick with the Chronicle of the Horse for factual \\"objective\\" information. And I,too, question why the Kelton Family's review was left twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for adults","review":"This would be interesting reading for a young rider. I expected explanations and descriptions about how Margie achieved her successes. Instead, it is more like her mother's walk down Memory Lane. It might be fine for a young fan of Margie's, but it is not for a mature, serious rider. I also do not understand why the Kelso family review was repeated and included twice in averaging the rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!","review":"I practically inhaled this book, which is not typical for works of non-fiction. I work in a library and grab up all of the finance books I can get a hold of, but this was the most readable and practical book of it's ilk thatI have come across. My favorite parts, aside from the personal stories, were the preventative measures that every woman should take to protect her assets and be financially independent. Kudos to all involved in this project. I just wish the authors would take on more subjects in the same style...... relationships, job hunting, home repair, you name it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Play often.","review":"There's alot of albums out there that scream 1980's. \\"Play Deep\\" is one of them. However, I don't mean that in a negative way, it just has that unmistakable 80's sound. In fact I love it, and I'm suprised these guys weren't more popular. Half of this album is pretty good, the other half, excellent. \\"Say It Isn't So\\" and \\"Your Love\\" are awesome pop/rockers, and I've strapped on the air-guitar to them many times. Another hit was \\"All The Love\\", and I really like \\"Every Time You Cry\\" and \\"Talk To Me\\" as well. The rest, still good.
