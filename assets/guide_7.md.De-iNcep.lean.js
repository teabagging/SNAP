I hope my friends and neighbors aren't this awkward and depressing behind closed doors, but if they are, it doesn't justify making a movie about them.

The illustrations are very attractive and cute, and they hold the attention of my toddler. She loves to open the pages herself to see what's hiding inside. The sliding mechanism in this book works better than the ones in similar books I've seen. My 16 month old toddler is able to open the sliding pages herself and with a little bit of \\"steering assistance\\" from me (helping her line the page up right) she can close the pages too. The sliding pages add extra interest and keep her entertained for longer than a regular book.The text is simple but cute.Overall a great book for home or to take to church.

I knew the basic historical dates and events, but I wanted to learn more about this relatively unknown period of Jewish history.Sandgren's book met all of my expectations. The stories are clearly based on accurate historical research, and they are well-written. They emphasize the life of the people rather than the decisions of the powerful. The author also ties the stories together in the epilogue by highlighting certain themes that emerge from the narratives.If a reader wants to learn more about the background or find suggestions about where to do more historical research, the endnotes will provide all that the reader wants. Another helpful feature is the detailed timeline at the end of the book.This is historical fiction at its best."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read!","review":"I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in early Judaism and Christianity. Although many of the characters in the book are fictitious, the stories allow one to understand how real people at the time might have reacted to the events occurring in their lives. As an example, to read the biblical passages about Ezra requiring the Jews to divorce their foreign wives is one thing. But, to experience this from the perspective of a Jewish family actually having to separate yields a very meaningful understanding.Not only is the book pleasurable reading, but it is based on solid scholarship with numerous reference and explanatory notes. One can appreciate the book as well written stories getting the scholarship as a bonus, or one can read it for the information, but in a painless format. Professor Sandgren gets an A+ on this assignment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uh, guys, this CD came out in 1987, long before they started cramming 80 minutes of music onto CD","review":"Why people complain about the fact that ALL CDs in 1987 had less than 70 minutes on them are beyond me. Guys, it was the technology at the time. They didn't start cramming CDs to their full 79-minute mark until the early 1990s, a few years AFTER this CD was released.Onto the disc. It's great. It doesn't have the sound quality (remastering) that later Pie compilations have, but the song selection is good. C'mon, \\"Live with Me,\\" with its hypnotic organ and Marriott's pained vocals, is a winner.For the casual fan, this is a good start - or the \\"Definitive Collection\\" that was released recently.Big fans might want to dig deeper into the individual albums, starting with \\"Performance: Rockin' the Filmore\\" and the Peter Frampton-less \\"Smokin',\\" which is great.Peace!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Antec's best","review":"First of all, thanks amazon for not listing the dimensions of this... it is 38mm deep, not 25mm like the other 120mm Antec fan in my case. The only reason I bought it is cause I had gift cards and needed one, so I thought why not put an Antec fan in my Antec case. WRONG, it was a waste of my gift cards. It is just too loud. I have a Sonata case and this is the loudest thing in there... and it is even hooked up to the PSU's fan controller power cords, which supplys minimal power. It is just too expensive for the noise.

I've run the unit 3-4 times the past 6 weeks, shot 200+ nails and have had zero problems. It takes about 65 seconds to charge from empty and 12 seconds to recharge when in use. I can get about 40 shots from a brad nailer and 10-12 shots from a finish nailer between charges. The handle does make it fairly easy to transport, but it is still heavy so I recommend buying a second hose to reach the work instead of moving the compressor. The motor is quiet in relation to other compressors I've heard. I can work next to it while it runs and my ears don't ring. The pressure gauges are easy to read and the pressure adjustment knob is simple to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"cute!","review":"I bought this as a christmas gift for a friend.

Short-changed....","review":"By putting out these two films on one DVD, I can't help but feel that Warner's has \\"short-changed\\" Contact by pairing it with such an inferior film like \\"Sphere.\\" In my opinion, Criterion should have issued their own DVD print of \\"Contact\\" with all of the extras. I don't even see it in upcoming Blu-Ray releases and it certainly deserves that kind of upgrade. \\"Contact\\" knocked my socks off when I first saw it. The day it came out on LaserDisc, I bought it. The DVD had many extras on it so I got rid of the LD and picked it up on DVD. It's definitely a classic 90's sci-fi film that is NOT getting the kind of treatment (like a release on Blu-Ray) that it so richly deserves.

It would appear to be a 'Complete Reference' but it's not. There is much instruction that simply doesn't instruct, typos, and lots of wrong information. The 'Advanced Word Processing Techniques' chapter of the Word section is especially disappointing. Auto-Chapter Headings, headers and footers that work? Not here. Thanks to this book I've been spending more time (and quality time at that) in the Word newsgroups (and getting straight info). Any reference that 'fluffs' itself up with large type, large pictures, generous line spacing, and page after page of hugely set keyboard shortcuts is simply trying to fill up space.

I was only about four or five when these songs flooded the airwaves, but each still strikes a sweet spot in my soul. \\"The Look of Love\\" just can't be beat-- it's perfect. Even less-familiar ones, like \\"Like A Lover,\\" are so beautiful that you'll be hearing its refrain in your head throughout the day. Mendes is a uniquely skillful arranger, and lead singer Lani Hall is exquisite-- a world-class voice, she clearly deserves more acclaim. Soon you'll want to hear EVERY song by Brasil '66.

But Mabel Riffle died in 1960, and Keene waited until 1976 to write this book. I recall also Ethel Post-Parrish-Riley, Camp Silver Belle medium, also attacked as a complete fraud and confidance woman. Ethel too died in 1960. What chance do either of these women have to reply to Keene's charges?

I expected more depth/detail about the emotional and physical aspects of treatment options. As a female I wanted more information about the devastation we feel as a couple towards our sex life.

Where I live, this class is offered through the YWCA, and our school gives a modified version of STEP to all incoming parents.Every day at our school we use the conflict-resolution model described in this book. I can think of two reasons it's so effective. First, it's very respectful of children, encouraging them to speak up and have their concerns heard. Second, the process takes so long that they soon learn to streamline it to resolve their issues without adult help. They usually come up with ways to solve problems that are okay with everyone.We use the principles in this book at home, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"hilariously awful","review":"Never before has a movie franchise completely called a mulligan on a movie.

Its about what a guy is doing right before a game and what really happens before all highschool football games. But there is no action what so ever.In my opinion, I like action sports with lots of complexity, suspense and a little touch of love. This book has almost none of that to me. This is my opinion though, If you are the person who likes getting ready for a game and the pregame stuff more than the game its self, then this is the right book for you. Not for action lovers. Great plot, and solid the whole way through.

The whole 248 page boook was one day long. The book describes everything that he thinks and feels. It has no plot, climax or anything like that.The worse part of the book is the ending. The whole book builds up on game then they don't even have the game. Its really dissapointing to find out you don't know who wins the game.The most vivid part of the book is how the auther describes the people. You can picture everyone in the book in your mind. I also think that the conflict is described extremely well. You know how he feels about his rival, Grooms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roughnecks, By A.

If the story is moving along it will eventually stop with a weird flashback that they usually already said a few pages back. Out of ten I would rate this book 4 because I didn't really relate to it and it wasn't a great pageturner. I wouldn't skip hanging out with my friends for it and I definately wouldn't clean the toilets before reading it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully hard, yet relaxing!","review":"As a mother of eight, I have nothing but great things to say about this exercise regimen.

They also spend too much time in setting up each exercise.Not so with Release, I've never felt such a deliciously painful burn in my legs and arms. No time is wasted in set up. The movements are simple and graceful, yet effective.I haven't seen a narrative style before, but think its brilliant! It flows with the music to make the killer exercises suprisingly relaxing.I highly recommend Release to anyone who wants to make the most of their exercise time.

I ordered this book from Amazon on July 1. Shipment kept getting delayed until the point that my order was listed as not shipping until after I took the test! I cancelled the order and tried to order directly from ETS, makers of the PRAXIS exam. After two weeks of waiting on them, I gave up. All along, I had checked out literature anthologies and literary handbooks from the library. I am so disappointed in Amazon, although the blame might lie with ETS for a lack of production. I thought this book would at least help me feel more secure, but it's not to be. Again, my recommendation is to browse literary terms, grammar books and anthologies of literature ... and know that even ordering a month in advance of the test might not be enough time to allow you to receive the study materials. Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too general","review":"I purchased this book hoping I would get a detailed list of test items, however I only got a general list of items that you may see on the test. It also came with one full length test that gives you an idea of the testing format and questions that may be asked. I was disappointed that there were not enough specifics. I would recommend you get a student high school literature book and following the content in that book. You would be better off. Stick to the test at a glance on the Praxis website.

I thought buying this book would be the greatest thing since sliced bread and it would be so helpful in my studying, etc. Well, it fails to let you know that one third of the actual Praxis II exam has to do with diagramming sentences and syntax. I know how to write a simple sentence, but I don't remember what a gerund is and where to put the adverb in a sentence when I am under pressure. The practice test in the book focuses mostly on what you have read and how well you can recognize writing styles. I was completely unprepared for the grammar section and it left me feeling like I failed. If you're really worried about the reading list I suggest picking up the Praxis book for the composition part of the test, which was much more helpful than this waste of $20."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice fabric, incorrect fit","review":"The look and feel of this seat cover is nice. Two issues, however:1)It does not fit as advertised on my truck seats. The bottom seat portion needed to be two sections, and it's one long one covering both driver and passenger seats, even though those two seats can be adjusted back and fourth separately. The backrest cover on the passenger side is made as though there is no fold down center console, so had to tuck a bunch of unusable fabric away behind the seat back on the passenger side. Looks bad. All this despite entering correct model and trim package in the order form.2) The fastening method is awkward, with some loops and lengths of string to secure the covers. There is not near enough of the string supplied; I had to supplement that with twine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect, a must have for all swings.","review":"This is a must have for all swings.

The ones I received were rated (printed on package) for 300lb each spring NOT 325lb as stated in Amazon description. They were the 4002 model too. Not a big deal for us, can seat my entire family on a set of these! I have had about 550lb of people on the swing before, and it's about a 100lb 5ft cedar swing. Their obviously wasnt any additional spring slack or cushioning at that weight, but they held up fine. They're rated much higher then the best swing hook lags I could find at home depot when I initially installed (200lb per hook). The springs here were also much cheaper then the only pair there."},{"rating":"2","title":"springing up life on the front porch","review":"With these springs you can watch the day go by once again! Sunrise, sunset, neighborhood kids going by on their bikes, dogs barking in your neighbors yard, mischievous situations brewing in the trees amongst the raccoons and squirrels, etc. These springs will actually work on your porch swing really well, and I'm surprised since my knowledge with the subject is limited greatly to just, well, a spring is a spring, lol. Not really sure if there's other types of springs that work more effectively or what. Either way the porch swing works so I don't have to dirty my bottom using the porch steps and watch my back for ants that may be crawling up my shirt.

Wonderful songwriting, terrific playing, simply gorgeous melodies and hooks. And one can see that they're also managing their careers the way a modern day band has to (I saw David handling the stylus on his Palm Pilot as deftly as his guitar pick).

The authors explain in a clear way how our self is a constant that all too often is parsed into pieces in order to satisfy the perceived expections of other \\"grownups\\".

I found that the sides of the plane were not square with the bottom of the plane. The iron wedge that holds the plane iron at the proper angle was visibly thicker on one side where it met the base. This caused the plane iron to be extended higher above the base on one side. To achieve a uniform cut, I have the plane iron set at a slight angle to compensate for this problem. The plane iron is not very well made. The opening cut in the plane iron for the adjustment screw was off to one side and I had to file it out so that the opening was centered in the blade. The iron itself is much softer than any of my other plane irons so it will become dull faster. I would not recommend this plane to anyone. It would be much better to invest in a quality plane."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy!!!!","review":"I purchased this microwave and in less than six months it quit working.

The book is blissfully brief also as the information is boiled down into clear but simple tips. I expected lots of cleaning and care information, which the book includes, but I was pleasantly surprised with the bonus information on buying furnishings or appliances, setting the table, writing a thank-you note. I liked the section on organizing and storage too. My only complaint is that the book came shrink-wrapped, so I couldn't see what I was getting (and how complete this book is) until I paid for it and opened it up. I bought it on faith because it was done by the Better Homes and Gardens people, and I'm glad I did.

This book would be perfect as a wedding shower gift or for a housewarming -- man or woman.As for context, this book covers just about every topic a young person needs to set up a new home or apartment. From organizing your 'stuff' to cleaning all kinds of surfaces, you'll find it here.There are sections about entertaining, safety, manners, and trouble-shooting your furnace, water heater, and other systems.Scattered on the left and right page edges are tips -- time savers, budget stretchers, household lessons, smart ideas, and more. They are included in the very extensive index.The five-ring format allows you to remove and take pages to the hardware or paint store. It also lets you add any tips or hints you may find elsewhere.If you are an experienced homemaker this book will be a little too basic for your needs.

I like the information on buying stuff (lamps, cookware, furniture, you name it) and on cleaning everything. I fear that I will be referring a lot to the stain removal tips! Giving a dinner party, setting a table, and other niceties also are included. I like the focus on de-cluttering your place and storing our stuff.

The stories were often scattered and irratic, lacking clear plot, character development and resolution. Some stories would have made better whole novels, and others, I am sorry to say, should have been left out of print. Still, I enjoy her writing style and the presentation of worlds in many ways similar to our own but with added elements of magic and fantasy. I hope Ms. Pierce's next endeavor is more along the lines of the Firebringer or Darkangel trilogies. Those were truly great works of literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great costume. Not for Renaissance period though - no Pink was permitted","review":"I bought this for attending Renaissance Festivals and later found out that PINK was not permitted or worn. The base layer to this costume is a BRIGHT barbie PINK....which renders it only a Halloween costume -- not for Renaissance at all. BUT I plan to cut the lower half bright pink off the under garment and add a brown layer. I can easily replace the top barbie pink sleeve/bust area with an under garment that is cream of buff.The Dusty Rose second layer on the skirt is a good color and can be kept. The corset is simple and has gold trim - which also wasn't allowed on PEASANTS clothing. But hey, it's 2009.For the price it's a great addition to your Halloween costume collection or if you're willing to alter it - you can make an inexpensive Renaissance costume.The head band that is included is horrible. Don't expect to wear it. But it's a good cat toy! ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Labor of Love","review":"This is just an incredible cd package. Buy and watch the DVD movie first to fully appreciate this. Allan Slutsky and others really put a lot of thought, work and love into this deluxe compilation. It is really just magic. The second cd with the original snakepit Motown recordings, without the vocal tracks, is absolutely priceless, revealing the true source of the Motown sound.Also, I have to put my two cents in on the Joan Osborne performance of What Becomes of the Brokenhearted. This has to be one of the great perfomances of all time! Certainly my favorite.

The pairing of these terrific musicians with a group of today's artists was nothing short of brilliant. The young audience of today, who may never have heard the Motown of the past, will be able to snap their fingers and tap their feet when they hear the likes of Chaka Khan, Joan Osborne, Ben Harper, Meshell Ndegeochello, Gerald Levert and other great artists of today, give their interpretation of classic Motown hits, coupled with instrumental tracks that no one has ever heard before this CD. A collector's dream at the very least!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Of course the new artists are \\"standing in the shadows\\"","review":"I will attempt to keep this review short and sweet. This album is a compilation of old Motown hits, with the vocals done by contemporary artists. On the whole, I thought it came off very well. Some of the criticism of this album relates to the \\"new vocalists\\". One has to remember you cannot go home again; you cannot step into the same river twice. So, of course, in the ears of the reviewers the new vocalists can't touch the originals. I'm not sure that I disagree on that point. But to put this whole project down because of who was selected to sing the songs seems whiney. The newer artists do a very credible job carrying the burden they are asked to -- being compared to the originals. This is a fun album and should be approached in that context. Consider it a tribute to the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Funk Brothers","review":"So if you buy this album you get the reunion of the Funk Brothers, who were the band backing up Most of the greatest MOtown Acts ever, the supremes, stevie wonder, martha reeves, etc. but this album combines those great songs with current artists singing some great kick-ass songs. Just buy it, your gonna love it (if soul and R&B is your thing.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I expected","review":"Two cd's. The first is phenomenal. Various artists doing Motown showed that the instrumentals were as important as the vocalists. Various vocalists were exceptionally pleasing. The second cd. mainly the instruments through out the cd. Just proved that both instruments and vocals are needed. It was boring, spent too much time waiting for someone , anyone to sing. Nothing.

I know that the cast, previewed subject matter and film location sounded good. Somehow though, it didn't live up to much of its promise for me. While the cast was filled with some solid professionals, the storyline and the direction--the direction in particular--just didn't cut it. The interaction between characters wasn't credible, probably because of the stilted dialogue. The location of the film - Menorca, I think - was truly beautiful and the best part of the production. Otherwise, I thought this was something that you might expect to see on cable TV's Lifetime channel. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pleasant movie for a Sunday afternoon","review":"If you are not too busy, and you want something to pass the time, this movie is OK.

Through most of the movie I was confused about what I should be feeling about who, and by the time the end rolled around (after two hours), I felt like the film expected me to care more than I actually did.The locations are beautiful, Tucci is great, as usual, and I was glad to see Rhys again, but the movie is lacking overall.

I miss the saga books that are big and focuses on a main character and the secrets and deceits yet uncovered. These books in the \\"Orphans\\" series should be longer instead of less than 200 pages. Don't get me wrong, I have read and re-read all the books from \\"Flowers In the Attic\\" to \\"Olivia\\", and adding the Orphans to her books is terrible. I hope there will be better books coming out like the \\"Logan\\", \\"Landry\\", etc. series.

I wish these books were longer, and like most everyone else I wish they weren't so much alike. I have read every series sine Flowers In The Attic. And this new series only dissapoints me because it seems a lot more immature. There really isnt any good hot and steamy scenes in these books. I know the girls are young. But so was the girls in all of the other series. The real VC Andrews could take something that is totally wrong and immoral and make you wish it would happen. \\"Like the brother and sister in FITA\\" I just wish there was more of that in these books. Now I am just waiting for Raven, and hoping there is just a little more action in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"same old same old","review":"It was just like Butterfly, I knew what was happend next in the story.

The book did not have the greatest stuff in it to really like, like Crystal did. I hope Runways is really good, better than Brooke did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very similar to Butterfly.... time to get the girls together","review":"The release of the VC Andrews orphans is getting too long and exaggerated. Obviously, all these girls will be getting together. Brooke was very disappointing in that it depicted almost an identical story line to Butterfly - instead of dancing - it was pageantry!

I just think the publishing house is taking a bit too long releasing them!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"so far the orphans have been terrible","review":"I am a huge V. C. Andrews fan, I love each and every one of her series, except this new one. I like the idea of the miniseries like the green mile from stephen king, but these books are so immature, I feel like their Fear Street books, when I'm used to adult novels from v. c. Butterfly and Brooke were so alike it was silly, same overpowering mother trying to turn them into something they're not, now I'm sure Raven will be just like Crystal. Since the Runaways is supposed to be a full novel, I just hope it makes up for this boring series. But being the devoted V. C. follower I am, I must buy these books because it puts the illusion that V. C. is still published novels. I can't wait for Muted Voices, the Logan series was very good. ~Tom Nordlum"},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible. please stop putting out these books.","review":"I was absolutely thrilled by the books that V.C. Andrews wrote...The Heaven Series, The Flowers In the Attic series, and My Sweet Audrina. Since she died @1990, this repetitive drivel has been published in her name. I bought the runaways series because I got a deal on buying them all together. I use them as coasters now. The books seem like they have been cut and pasted from Andrews' other novels. I will never buy another V.C. Andrews book. I'd give this series 0 stars if I could"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay.","review":"This book was obviously aimed at young teens and pre-teens, which alienates all of V.C.'s older fans that she has earned over the years. Of course, I had to buy it anyway.I felt that Brooke's story would have been much more interesting had it been put in a longer book. Also, the book was a complete rehash of Butterfly. Extremely trite and predictable, yet better than Butterfly or Crystal. I wouldn't recommend this book for adults, not even die-hard fans of V.C. Save your money and buy the full-length Runaways instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah :-(","review":"I have to admit and agree with many VC Andrews fans -- these 'new' books written under her name are getting worser by the second! I'm a teenager and yet, I find these ORPHAN series to be very immature and unrealistic. It's totally unlike VC Andrew's original magnificent writing style. These books are more two-dimensional, lacks depth, and lacks mystery. Boy, it is a 1000 times more refreshing to reread the Casteel series which was originally written by VC Andrews. I really don't recommend these new books in the Orphan series unless you are under the age of 12."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Brooke","review":"Brooke is yet another tiresome little book in the Awful Orphans Miniseries.Makes use of the stock characters 'Vain Trophy Wife', 'Emasculated Rich Guy', 'Bitchy-Rich-Girls who are frightened of Sport' and 'Persecuted Waif'. The Second last stock character-of well off private school girls being bad at sport (and the way All Girls Schools are portrayed in VC Andrews novels generally) is so innacurate that this reviewer assumes that Andrew Neidermann has spent his whole life in a cave. The only good thing about Brooke is that the heroine is a sporty girl rather than the usual VC Andrews 'Artist'. Aside from that sliver of originality in this otherwise stereotyped, formulaic miniseries, nothing good can be said of Brooke. I strongly recommend against buying this waste-of-paper-that-pretends-to-be-a-book, no matter how cheap it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brooke- Bringing in the younger generation","review":"I have read the whole orphan series. Butterfly, Crystal, Brooke, Raven and of course Runaways. I enjoy V. C. Andrews. This is a series that will bring in a younger generation of readers. Brooke is about an orphan who finally finds adoptive parents, and learns from then that even with parents you can still be alone in this world. I recommend this whole series . I feel that teenagers would get the most out of this series. Yet I do recommend it to all readers, Especially parents of teens. Teen life has much turmoil and this series can show you the extreme that you may not have experienced."},{"rating":"1","title":"REALLY BAD","review":"MY OPINION OF THE BOOK CANT EVEN BE SAID, I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY BAD.

Andrews novels. Brooke is a novel in The orphans Miniseries. When this book is read, keeping up with the novels is absolutely necessary. Brooke is the middle of a series, and starting them all over is a must! It is very good and makes you feel what she is feeling. It can relate to everyday life and the troubles of trying to be someone else. If you like this or are interested, try starting from the beginning. The beginning of the V.C.

The Rowenta was too expensive to repair or replace for only three years of service. I purchased this one based on Consumer Reports review. I followed all of the instructions to the letter. The iron spit and spewed water on the very first use. I gave it the benefit of the doubt, drained it, allowed it to get itself together for a few days and tried again. I was sorely disappointed with its performance as it did the same exact thing.

After reading the directions twice and waiting for the iron to get hot it didn't get out the wrinkles from my clothes. Some tops I ironed twice and it didn't even look like I had ironed them at all. My previous iron was another T-Fal model that I had for 10 years and I loved it! I would not recommend this model.Instead I would recommend Black & Decker which I purcased from Target two days after receiving this T-Fal model.

This iron was rated highly by Consumer Reports and the reviews here, along with the features of this iron, had me sold. As much as I really wanted the iron to work out it simply didn't. The major problem was the constant leaking or dripping. I was cautious in filling the tank properly and tried all the settings to attempt to stop the leakage, to no avail! The iron did heat up and removed wrinkles properly, but I know the excess water would eventually leave watermarks on certain fabrics. Also, I'd been spoiled by a much longer cord on my old iron. So, could only return the iron.Having never returned anything to Amazon before I was pleasantly surprised by how terrific they were in handling the return."},{"rating":"2","title":"great steam iron","review":"Overall this is a very good iron.

Save yourself the pain... get something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent product **UPDATED (17 NOV 10) **not so much..:(","review":"This iron definetely performs better than other highly expensive models out there. Much better than the last Rowenta we bought which leaked and didnt provide heat like this one does. My wife complains that the Tfal uses the water too quick, my logic is that is due to the great amount of steam produced by the iron, therefore the water usage increases. This iron will save you money, you will not need to buy starch for most of your casual clothing. Good performance (almost industrial), light and smooth, and no leaks so far. In my book, this one is a winner.UPDATE:The iron is leaking now,I miss the amazon return window for a couple of weeks, Im returning the iron to TFAL for service or replacement.

Large water reservoir keeps refilling to a minimum. Temperature and steam controls are easily adjusted. I had liked my first T-Fal Ultraglide so well, I wanted no other iron.

Basically, the water pump packed up, and would not automatically dispense steam when placed on a shirt. It would only give out steam when the button was pushed.Called Joe @ their customer service...the guy had a real attitude problem and did nothing to keep me as a customer.A 1 year warranty does not cut it for this kind of product in my opinion.Will not buy a TFal iron again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it","review":"I like the iron but the burst of steam is a little hard to get to work, but it still works really good so far.

I bought this after reading several of the more positive reviews and it seemed a fairly good deal (paying a bit more for a quality brand name).On a less drastic note, the iron has no middle ground between being so hot as to ruin the clothes and not hot enough to actually do its job. The steam function on the iron does not work at all.WORST of all, the iron actually LEAKS BOILING WATER while you use it.

It is a painted surface. The first time I used it, it felt like I was running sandpaper over the fabric. And it does not get better over time. The surface also has white stripes painted on it to give the user the impression it might be teflon, but it is just paint. It also has the words \\"ultra glide\\" painted right on the ironing surface. All just marketing, but it does not glide. Another downside of this painted surface is that it does not transfer heat very well, so I could not get the wrinkles out of cotton fabric. Eventually I bit the bullet and got me a proper Rowenta iron. A bit more expensive, but oh, it is so much better. It works like a dream. After the first use of the Rowenta, I threw away this T-Fal, after only 3 months of use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Iron","review":"I've owned this iron for 15 months; the amount of use has been infrequent, about once a month to iron a dozen items.

Then I went to iron some curtains with it and found that it only maintains heat for a few minutes and then cools down while in use. It was impossible to iron a pair of curtains.I called Tefal to enquire about warranty to be told I have to return it to a service center (at my own cost) and then wait six weeks for it to be repaired or replaced.

The surface is truly amazing! In addition, the iron has excellent steam force that applies even steam to a garment. One small caution is to adjust the heat setting a little lower than you would normally set on other irons. For instance, if you are ironing cotton, set the heat dial lower than the cotton setting.The iron also has a large reservoir for water so that you do not have to fill it often. The steam has a self cleaning device in the water inlet to prevent clogging from lime build-up.You will love this iron.

It heats up quickly, slides easily, steams very well, and stands the most securely than any iron I have previously owned. I am actually enjoying the weekly ironing more.

I was actually excited about getting what I thought would be a good, new iron, after using a broken down Black & Decker for a few months. The FIRST TIME I used it - it started spewing water through the bottom plate. I tried several heat/steam combinations, along with waiting for it to heat up properly and giving it time to reheat - all to no avail. And then good luck making sense of the 'CLICK\\" diagram for the cord coming out of the iron. Again - I tried pushing the cord in and pushing the button and the reverse, to try and make it work, and it didn't. The button was useless. When I called the T-Fal toll free number - they generously offered to send me a shipping label to send it to a repair facility for warranty repair. I don't feel I should have a brand new iron 'repaired', let alone be out all of the time necessary for shipping. I should receive a new one."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great iron!","review":"So, this is what my hubby wanted for Christmas, an iron? But it had to be the T-Fal Ultraglide because he ALWAYS checks Consumer Reports before we buy ANYTHING.

I didn't want to store the iron somewhere else away from the ironing board, so I gave it away. (I didn't know if I could return it since there was nothing wrong with it - it just didn't work for me.)

Where the colored part of the handle meets the white part there is a slight gap. After a very short time it starts to wear on your hand and if you have a lot of clothes to iron it becomes really annoying. I went back to my Rowenta because the handle feels much better.

However, the Manual should be consulted in depth prior to use of the iron, and its precautions adhered to."},{"rating":"2","title":"T-Fal Steam Iron","review":"I am very pleased with this steam iron.

It had no stickers on soleplate as it said in manual, figured someone must have sent back also.Second of all it says not to use tap water if your water is softened, and also not to use distilled water. I had never heard of an iron that wasn't distilled water compatible. So if one uses hard waterI envisioned down the road a month or so, was the steam just emitting brown spots all over my clothes.

Glides smooth and irons well","review":"I bought this to replace an old GE iron I was using. I mainly use my irons for casual button down shirt, some slacks, and jeans, nothing heavier or more delicate than that. My old iron didn't steam too well, and didn't glide over fabrics easily. This T-Fal FV4379003 Ultraglide was a vast improvement! Spending a little bit more was worth it for a quality product. This iron glides smoothly over cotton and denim, gets rid of wrinkles easily, and puts out plenty of steam. Also comes with a little plastic steam cup to pour with. It heats up quickly, and has a lot of different fabric settings, most of which I don't use, but it's good to know they're available. The Easycord system keeps the cord away from the soleplate, and the auto shut-off feature is handy (when the unit is upright) if I leave the iron on.

This T-Fal iron has abundant steam, but it claims to be dripless. Not only does it steam, it dripped all over the place. I followed the instructions in the owners manual for what to do when the dripping occurred. It didn't help. I was very disappointed and returned the iron and bought a Kenmore. It doesn't steam quite so profusly, but it doesn't drip either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Iron!","review":"This is a great iron. I have purchased so many the past few years and they never got hot enough or gave off enough steam and it would take forever to iron something. This iron was listed as the best at Consumer Reports so I thought I would try it. The price was very reasonable unlike some that cost almost $100. and still don't get the job done. This iron gives off the right amount of steam and gets hot enough to iron my clothes. Sure makes an unpleasant job go a lot faster. I highly recommend this iron!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy","review":"Great Iron for a Very Reasonable Price. Light weight, great steam and the easy cord is a very nice feature.

Like all Flora's books all this one is designed to do is promote her cult of Meglomania. The books are self published pieces of vanity press designed to lure the true seeker into her sham of a cult. If you want to learn meditation try reading Eckart Tolle or pick up anything by Yogananda!But if you still think you need this book let me give you a spoiler. Try this: Sit quietly, imagine there's a cord of energy running from the base of your spine to the center of the earth--that's the \\"amazing\\" grounding technique you'll pay upwards of $200 dollars to \\"learn\\" in her classes.Still think the book's worth the hype?Didn't think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull bluegrass versions of Moody Blues songs","review":"This bluegrass tribute to the Moody Blues is not a sacrilege and it doesn't desecrate that band's legacy, like some of the negative reviews claim.What it does show is that the Moodies songs don't translate well to the bluegrass genre.

Please, if you're a true Moodies fan, you realize the band's music is about sophistication and deification. Let these bluegrass musicians go cover Aerosmith and AC/DC songs, because neither of those bands has any etherialism or class either. Of course Justin Hayward said he loves this crap in an interview; he was being polite because he's not friggin' Elton John who would probably vomit if someone covered \\"Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding\\" this way as well!This isn't a tribute to a great band as much as a desecration and blasphemy. Everything magical about the Moodies' music is sucked right out of these representations, especially my beautiful and cherished \\"Late Lament.\\" It's just like someone peeing on your gravestone and claiming they came to water your flowers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money to pay for something awful","review":"I would not buy this CD. In my opionion no one has ever been able to sing or play a Moody Blues song that sounded right or close to the orginal. I don't care if they put their own twist on the song.

Read it and you will understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hobbit is the best.","review":"Maybe it's just me, but the Lord of the Rings was a long, difficult read. I'm glad I read it, but it has no value in terms of rereading it. Too much background and plot, not enough action. The whole Good-Evil battle and the loss of magic and elves, etc. seems to me to weigh the work down.

I have read many many books, and none even come close to J.R.R. Tolkien's books!! I have read it a total of 12 times now within the past two years. I was introduced to the Lord of the Rings when I was 13 and I haven't been able to leave it since then.The Lord of the Rings drew me in and let me live in Middle Earth with Frodo and Merry and Bilbo and the rest. I got to meet Elves, and battle orcs, and look upon the Nazgul. Middle Earth came to life around me!The Lord of the Rings has also shaped my own writing style. After reading it, I got inspired to write a book of my own, and it has helped me in many ways.For anyone who hasn't read this amazing trilogy before, I strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys fantasy.

If you have seen the movie and haven't read the books yet, congratulations on taking the next step. Read them. On the other hand. . .maybe you should reconsider buying the box edition with the movie scenes pasted all over it.Why? I enjoyed the movies, but reading through the last few chapters again a few days ago I noticed that the book experience was totally different from the passive movie experience. I would try to distance myself from the images associated with the movie as much as possible while reading this. If you really loved the movie, you're doing the book a great disservice by constantly comparing the two. Let Tolkien's charming, unique style take you on your own journey through Middle Earth. . .leave Mr. Jackson's vision for the silver screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid This Edition","review":"This one star rating applies only to the cheap and tawdry presentation of this edition.Tolkein's novels are obviously towering classics of modern world literature. They should be read slowly, treasured, and read over and over again.This edition is not at all suitable for such reverential handling. It would be fine for throwaway pulp fiction - but not for a great masterpiece such as LOTR.The paper is cheap, rough, and unpleasant to the touch. Typography suffers as the characters bleed into its overly absorbent surface. This makes the already small font even more difficult to read.The layout is crowded, the cover art mundane (taken from the movies), and maps of Middle Earth, which every reader will want to consult along the way, are very shabbily rendered.I was embarrassed to have inadvertently purchased something so deficient as a gift. I apologized to the recipient when I saw it, and quickly replaced it.Don't make the same mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my top 5 favorites, (and I have an English degree!)","review":"Warmly, vividly descriptive.

She has no idea what a wonderful ride on which she is about to embark!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique and the book that started all","review":"I read the book every couple of years for the last 16 years. This are the books that started all. Without this, there would not have been all those other pseudostories. The setting, the plot, the characters, everything was fantastic then, and it is still wonderful nowadays.He did a fantastic job and nobody will ever surpass it. Is like saying that some sci-fi moovie will be better than Star Wars. They may try, but it won't happen. When somebody does the FIRST, ORIGINAL THING, everything else is just trying to be as good, but can not pass it. Let face it, the originals are always based on original thoughts and ideas. No references, no past works... after that, everybody else can use that work as a reference.Regarding the story is simple. The eternal clash between good and evil in a fantastic universe.This is a MUST READ for everyone.

The one ring is found by the halfing on his way to defeat a dragon and share its treasure with his fellow dwarves. the war of the rings has begun, Sauron's wraiths are unleashed, attracted by the malefic power of the ring.

For those of you who are so embittered by the racism you either experience or imagine in the world, try to keep in mind that these books contain a message of hope that truth, honesty, and courage will perservere in spite of the evils around us. And I might remind the two of you who complain about evil always being portrayed by the color black...the witch who was so evil and wanted to destroy Narnia in the chronicles by CS Lewis...she was the White Witch.

And I know that sometimes it was a tad predictable that almost all of the major characters survived, but hey, Boromir and Theoden died, didn't they? To me, these books are the standard by which all other books of any genre are to be judged. And they are not simply a story; they are a full account of an entire land and its battle against evil.

The story flows endlessly from page to page, with suitable breaks in the storyline that allow a person to put it down for such needful things as sleeping and eating, without the usual cliffhangers of other novels. Tending to be riveting at first reading, the second reading reminds one that the series is a good 7000-8000 pages long.

This work is of increadible imigination and style. The story itself is superb and the charecters are wonderful. Tolkien creates an entire world and populates it with wonderful and frightening creatures. These are books to get lost in and you are sad when you reach the end.

I know there are probably going to be a lot of people offended by this review but that is perfectly alright by me....not everyone thinks Tolkein is the 'genius' of the fantasy genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"hated this","review":"I know there are a ton of people that think these books are the greatest, I don't.

The real front cover, which was painted, was replaced by printed screenshots from the movies. In my opinion it can tell who reads it now - stupid children who were arroused by the movies, and now want to sit down and read the books ('cause somebody told them there were several scences not to appear in the movies and to appear in the books). If you're a stupid kid, go on and buy it. But if you're not, do yourself a favour and buy something else.

The reading content is fantastic. However, I recommend you not buy the boxed set printed by Houghton Mifflin. I've only read my copies twice and the pages are already falling out of the spine.

Like all good literature it stirs all the emotions. This is not only the best fantasy I've ever read but the best story I've ever experienced.I just finished reading The Hobbit to my 10 year old son. I would read him a chapter each night. He would call me at work each day just to be sure I would be on time to read the next chapter. Can you imagine a 10 year old boy running to the shower each night without a fuss? And then coming downstairs, handing me the book saying, \\"c'mon Dad\\". His exictement over this story is a memory I will treasure for the rest of my life. What a wonderful thing to share with your son. Thank you J.R.R. Tolkien!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different than anything you've read.","review":"Definitely an outstanding set of books, you expect a great epic, and you get it. In a way. The hero is really not so, but really an anti-hero, a humble creature driven by fate? to a grand destiny. His greatest assets are his luck, and his good feelings. Surrounded by war and violence he never kills anybody and avoids hurting the creature that would kill him if given a chance. Frodo (and for the case so do Bilbo and Sam) is not an \\"epic\\" hero, but a real flesh and bone hero. I have read TH & LoTR about three or four times and have allways discovered something different. Don't read it if you expect fast-paced action, or hate intricate descriptions. Read if you don't consider time spent reading as wasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord of the Rings is a must have for ANY fantasy lover.Kewl!","review":"Lord of the Rings is a beatifully written book that blows all other fantasy books out of the water! It depicts true heros and real adventure. Though a long read, LOTR is worth it. SUPERB!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AN OUTSTANDING EXPERIENCE","review":"Although I'm quite fluent in English, I read this wonderful book in it's portuguese version. Later on, I read The Hobbit in the original version. I assure you: the magic is the same, no matter the language it was verted to. Spiritual realms, fascinating creatures, epic battles... the most remote and hidden feelings that lay in human soul arises strongly in Tolkien fantasy. The Lord of The Rings trilogy is a book to remeber. Forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just a 10, but borderline 11","review":"Simply put, The Two Towers is 33.3% of the best book ever. The others of course are the Fellowship of the Ring and the Return of the King. Some consider this as a trilogy, but its really just one long, awesome book. Action, adventure, majik, different races.. Everything to create an awesome work of literature is here. If you enjoy ANYTHING that has to do with science fantasy, TRUST ME!! Tolkien will be your favorite author on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"A long swim, but worth it!","review":"I was first introduced to LotR by a friend when I was in High school. I read it twice over since the first time, and have always come away with the same impression. These booka are a heavy read ... but well worth it. I pits the most unlikely heroes against deep dark forces thatthreaten to overwhem to world.If you are a person who expects to understand everything you read, you will be sorely disappointed, because there are many references to a mythology upon which these stories are based that is never fully explained.In the end, good triumphs over evil, and the world is finally at peace, and you are left with a peaceful, satisfied feeling after reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This began my love affair with literature.","review":"This epic story, spread over four books, was what planted the seed of reading in my adolescent mind over 20 years ago. I have read the trilogy several times and enjoyed it more each time. I recommend these books for anyone who is interested in fantasy literature and even for those who are not. This work would also be an excellent gift for a young person. You could start them off on a lifetime of reading pleasure and stimulate their imagination through literature in these days of video mind melt."},{"rating":"2","title":"A family read","review":"As others have said before me, this is a truly inspired work. Rather than reiterate the 400 previous posts, I'll just say this is a book the will create a thirst for reading in a child. I would strongly suggest reading the Hobbit to your young ones, and then letting them read the rest of the series on their own. These are the only books I have read more than twice and it certainly got me away from just reading comic books.

It sounds like it was edited with a chain saw. several scenes didnt make sense causing your brain to come to a screeching halt, The tolkien version is a wonderful read, this is just a very sad imitaition"},{"rating":"2","title":"What can you say about a classic...","review":"It is very nearly superfluous to comment on The Lord of the Rings. No other work of fantasy fiction comes close to the depth and breadth realized by Tolkien in this master work. Yes, it's about the age-old conflict between good and evil set in a world populated by men, elves, dwarves, hobbits, wizards, and orcs. But at the heart of The Lord of the Rings is a moving tale of loyalty and friendship that reminds us how the relationships we forge in life can sustain us through our darkest hours. This is fiction at its finest -- fiction meant to savor and to return to again and again. It has the power to frighten, to uplift, and to break your heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, what else can one say: it's the best","review":"If you try it that is. I know a lot of people who shudder at the tought of reading an 1000 pages long book filled with ancient genealogies, people with unpronouncable names and strange creatures. Well, they don't know what they're missing, this book is undoubtebly one of the all time greats of world literature. This is the original, without tis one no Harry Potter, no Pratchett, probably even no things as Stephen King or a whole load of other stuff. I you haven't already read him now is the time cause even if the movie is great, this is still so much better.PS: Hobbits rule supreme"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lord of the Rings","review":"First Tolkien, a linguist, created a language. Then he created a world for that language. The result is one of the seminal works of 20th century literature. This year, the epic has finally and wonderfully been translated to film. I predict a sudden and huge demand for the books, and envy those who will be coming to the written work for the first time. The full, three-dimensional and all-absorbing emersion in Middle Earth is only fully realized with the first reading- I wish I could read it again for the first time. But the work is so textured and rich that subsequent readings, no matter how frequent, can always mine a new detail or nuance previously missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's worth it for \\"The Hobbit\\"","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love LOTR. But sometimes it can get a little dark. However, The Hobbit, which keeps adventure, suspense and straightforward action without getting too depressing, is in my opinion one of the best books of the century - possibly even the world. LOTR is most likely the most intresting trilogy ever written - but I must confess, Frodo Baggins just does not compare with his dear Uncle Bilbo. While they have the same level of adventure (though some could plead Frodo's case on that one), Bilbo has more all-around personality. I was so sad when he went crazy over the ring! ........ But that's just me. Feel free to think otherwise. But I'm warning you - if you buy this set, buy it for The Hobbit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning! Product not as shown! (Product picture fixed)","review":"... it is a cheesy \\"movie edition\\" covered in photos from the movie. Each side of the box features a large photo of a character from the movie (Frodo, Sauron?? and the Ranger). Also each book, except the Hobbit, also has movie photos on the cover, spine and back. Frodo on the first book, sauron on the second and the Ranger on the third. The Hobbit actually has a nice drawing/painting on the cover of Gandalf walking in the shire toward Bilbo's house but ont he back it reads \\"THE LORD OF THE RINGS IS NOW AN EPIC MOTION PICTURE TRILOGY FROM NEW LINE CINEMA\\".Some may say the content inside is all that matters, which is mostly true, but if given a choice between a movie edition and a regular edition I would easily choose the regular edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERCHARGED TAX on 1st Day by AMAZON.com","review":"This was my 1st purchase after the State started collecting tax through Amazon.com.

Tolkien have a marvelous appeal. Those of us who have read them and love them wish we hadn't, so we could read them for the first time. What's not to love about them? They're beautiful blend of paganism and Christianity, their pathos, their humor make them, if not the best books of all time, then at least the most delightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Trilogy","review":"Folks, I'm not typically a genre fan--be it Science Fiction, Fantasy, Horror, etc. I'm more interested in literary fiction, and since most of the stuff written in the above genres is simply laughable (Robert Jordan, that Lord Foul Bane junk (horrible), Terry Brooks, etc.) I often do not delve into the world of pop fantasy fiction. But Tolkien is a rare find, kids. He's written a fantasy series that holds up as literarue. Tolkien, an Anglo-Saxon specialist, has given us a modern-day Beowulf, Sir Gawain, and Fairy Queen all rolled up in one. Before Professor Tolkien, one had to go back to those old texts to read fantasy. Thank God, Tolkien decided to give a try at writing one himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"These books have got to be the greatest novels written.","review":"The best novels I've ever read.I read them everyday and have three videos made from them.

I also talked to friends about it. Of 10 people asked if they actually got throught the whole book, only 3 did! Why, because everyone else either gets bored after the council of elron, or whatever, or at the council! I myself got stuck at the damn council! It took me months to get pass it!Listen, want to know the trilogy (And I don't say this often, because I love to read) GO WATCH THE MOVIES! They are well done and pretty close to the story!Going back on the last note, the book does have some great points. One such thing is some characters that play interesting roles are not in the movie. That is the only reason I liked the books, all the missing characters!Sorry if I'm ruining your reading experience!If your a big Tolken fan, have fun! This is the book for you! Else, stay away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tolkien is the Homer of Fantasy","review":"What Homer is for ancient mythology, Tolkien is for modern fantasy.

No one has equalled his feat. Lord Of The Rings is simply the best fantasy tale ever written; it's depth, description and plot are second to none and it is so thoroughly gripping that once you pick it up and get through possibly the only bit that could be described as boring (in my opinion not) - the Party - you will not put it down...it is so realistic, that you will forget that you are reading a book and you will feel all the pain, fear, joy and expectations of Frodo, Gandalf, Aragorn, Sam and others.

There would be Brooks, no Goodkind, no Jordan, no Feist, no Martin, etc. etc. etc. It takes literature of a high degree to spark such fascination and enthusiasm in readers and writers alike. It took something like the Lord of the Rings.To be sure, The Lord of the Rings is a mythical tale, a legend documented in detail by a faithful historian. It's paradoxically fantastical and yet so real. The characters are archetypical, but that is how they should be, for legends are after all, the beginnings of all fiction. Everything about it screams refinement. It seems like a good tale passed down from generation to generation, with all of the diluting that occurs along the way.Don't get passed by the bandwagon, jump now! Buy this collection immediately and be a part of literary history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Books Ever!

First off, the type is very small and difficult to read and the books are very difficult to open. Also, these are the commercialized version where none of Tolkien's original vision is seen on the cover. I prefer the editions where the reader can see how Tolkien viewed Middle Earth as oppose to Hollywood's version. To put it simply, I didn't buy the books to see Hollywood plastered on the cover, I have the DVDs for that. This is a very poor edition, not very readable. Cheap, but not worth the money. Buy a different edition!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series but not the best","review":"I think rarely does one say that the movies are better than the books. However, I think this is the case. If this is the first time reading these type series I strongly suggest reading George RR Martin or Terry Goodkind. These are much easier reads.Don't get me wrong I like these books but there really kinda slow compaired to the other authors out there. I am fortunate enough to have all six books bound individually. You do want to make this part of your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hobbits, Dwarves, and Elves.","review":"J.R.R Tolkien is an awesome fantasy writer. The whole series is really long , but it's worth it.The way Tolkien discribes his scenery is awesome. When you read the book it's like you're you are right smack dab in the middle.The imagery was awesome throughout the whole book. You could see everything. An example of this is the battle of Minas Tirith, and th battle at the black gates. Tolkien uses major to describe the weapons, the smells, the scenery and everything else. You could see the battles.A perfect example of dialogue is how the elves talk, which is way different from the way the dwarves talk. The elves are more refined then most other kinds of people. They are more polite. For the time and the kind of characters the dialogue was correct. J.R.R Tolkien is the best fantasy writer ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why this is the best book ever!","review":"I have only read the first book so far but in reading the first few pages it became my favorite book. I love J.R.R. Tolkien books because when I read them im on an adventure through time and life. I'm only 14 and I don't really like to read. But when I read The Hobbit it made me want to read and theat's why i'm looking for the sequils at a reasonable price becuse I don't get a big allounce. If you choose to reed the hobbit I sugest that you buy them all together because you will find you can't put them down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book but pretty racist in an ignorant way","review":"Okay, Okay, I read through every other review and saw maybe 10 reviews that gave this series less than 5 stars and a couple of those reviews were just attention grabbers. I give this book only two stars because it is racist. I just read the Chronicles of Narnia a similar set of allegorical fantasy books with racist undertones. Both series deal with enemies (called calormenes in the chronicles and i-can't-remember-what in the rings) that have dark skin, while the good guys have blond hair and fair skin. They are the same sort of racism found in Aladdin. If I remember there is even an incident where the enemies are called \\"darkies\\" in Chronicles. I recommend these books if you can get pass the ignorant racism that unfortunatly detracts from otherwise great series."},{"rating":"1","title":"immature","review":"I read these books when I was 14 and I was thoroughly impressed I loved them reread them and all things Tolkien. But since then I'v grown up physically and mentally and after starting to read them again and realised how stupid it truely is. I'm greatful for these books because they motivated me to read bigger and better things but I shudder to think how so many are so big about this fantasy nonsence. The heroes like Gandalf and Aragorn are infallible saints while the enemies are black evil creatures with no morals whatsoever. It reads like some Christian propaganda story for adolescents. If your an adult don't bother with this farce, it passes itself off as an intellectual book but its really the product of an old arrogant man's daydreams.

I read 400 pages, I was sooo bored I coulnd't read it. I've finished every book I've started, except this one. This guy doesn't have sence for time flow. I mean, come on. One of the main characters dies and he writes \\"...and so and so died. The mourned a while, and kept moving.\\" Goodness, it was horrible!After reading the hobbit (An alirght book I'd give two stars) I'd expected something more. Not literary garbage.

People need to get past tradition of what they grew up with and that the hobbit was there favorite book as a five year old. that's exactly the point though in my opinion- the book is childish and doesn't compare to some of the fantasy writers of our time. people need to get past there hang-ups that with this being a legend of the time and see it as it is- childish and just plain not very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I'm sorry, but these books are boring.

I will be truly surprized if any other book surpases this one in the 21st century, this book marks the zenith of literature, and all other Fantasy or Fiction past-Tolkien is just commentry and interpretation to his work. This is the canon of Fantasy. The Lord of the Rings will Expand your consciousness to new horizons, it will lift your spirit to such hights you didnt even know were possible. This book refines your Intellect, your emotions and your spirit, I know of no other book which brings such a strong and blessed effect to all these 3 at the same time. I am not kidding, if you havnt read this book you do not know to what hight literature can lift you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the Movies","review":"This is my first read of the Tolkien series - and I really enjoyed it. I waited until I saw all the movies first. His descriptions are terrific, this can be seen in the movies, which match the books quite well. Ideal reading for anyone who enjoys fantasy reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing Journey into Middle Earth","review":"Although they bear little resemblance to each other, Robertson Davies' DEPTFORD TRILOGY and Tolkien's LORD OF THE RINGS are far and away my favorite fictional trilogies. The high number of \\"10\\" ratings from these reader reviews shows how much others have enjoyed reading Tolkien."},{"rating":"2","title":"An ingenius literary masterpiece","review":"Being a legend of 1,086 pages, the Lord of the Rings is truly the only book one can read and feel like you've stepped off a train which has transported you from Tolkiens' world and back into yours. It is by far the longest book I have ever had the amazing pleasure and honor to read. I highly suggest you take part in Frodo's adventure with his faithly servant, Samwise, in a overly valiant effort to overthrow the dark lord, Sauron. It is a tale of triumph and defeat; of death and glory; and of sadness and great joy. If you do not read this book, you will be doing yourself a great injustice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest journey through fantasy ever!","review":"I have recently read The Lord of the Rings and I think that it has the best story line ever. All the names and poems create a perfect atmosphere for this book. However, I only recommend this to a mature class as children will have a hard time grasping it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tolkien is the Master","review":"Is there any question as to what the greatest fantasy work ever written is? NO--it is clear that Tolkien's construction of a vast universe of history, language, and intrigue are far beyond that of any other writer to date. Tolkien has created a masterful work with strong characters, a powerful plotline, and a veiled examination of the innate good or evil nature of every human being, and how that nature can become corrupted by evil or salvaged through redemtion. There is nothing that can compare.Harry Potter who?"},{"rating":"2","title":"simply the best","review":"My 6th grade teacher gave me \\"The Hobbit.\\" That is what I remember most about him. The book led me to the LOTR and I have re-read the series quite often since.

I read it for the first time in the fifth grade and have reread it several times since. Each time the characters seem richer, and the story more complete.

They're also good quality. As for the books themselves, I think the author spends too much time trying to make his version of the world what you imagine while reading, and it makes them very dry and dull books, when the plot itself is rather interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Perfect for any fan of the famous legendarium, all the history of Arda is just a book away!

He has seen the movies already and in excited to read the details in the books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad audio quality","review":"We purchased this for a long road trip in the car so we could listen to The Hobbit. The story is an amazing story and this review is NOT about Tokien's writing...it is simply about the recording/audio quality.I am a fan of the concept of AUDIBLE.COM, but I avoided one of the options here on Amazon b/c of their (in my opinion) poor audio quality. Well, this one was worse than my past audible.com experiences. The volume and the clarity was inconsistent (at best) and at times, depending on the chapter and the character, it was very hard to hear their dialogue. We constantly had to change the volume to either hear the character or to turn it down so we didn't blow our ears out. AND the voices/characters were...cheesy, to say the least. I know there are 14 main characters and then tons of ancillary voices, but some of them just sounded like they were the other characters only whining. It was quite annoying.So - buy an audio version of this book - just not THIS audio version!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent fantasy for all ages","review":"The last stand of a world in a lost time. The Lord of the Rings is the ultimate \\"getaway\\" read for young and old.This trilogy of books written so long ago is beautifully written by the ultimate wordsmith of our time; J.R.R. Tolkien.It will take you to places and introduce you to characters only found in dreams, and let you experience the epitiomy of evil personified only in nightmares.A true epic, where the Wizard Gandolf is Obi Wan Kinobi and the Dark Lord Sauron is \\"Darth Vadar\\"; only Lord of the Rings is the prototype of them all!I've read all of these books seven times and still enjoy every word.

(well, i still am, 14, but then i was 12) sorry if i offended anyone"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something New Every Day","review":"What I learned today (from the review entitled Mass Deception):I learned today that the literary use of darkness to convey an evil or sinister feeling (act, person, etc), though generally accepted for the past, oh million years, is overtly racist and therefore (deep breath) anyone who has used this technique is quite obviously a racist and their works are bad bad bad. Well, thank God I read these reviews or I would have remained shamefully ignorant and would have kept reading disgraceful works by hateful authors (Hemingway, Dickens, Vonnegut, Tolstoy, Woolf, etc.)Personally I think Tolkien is a bit long-winded, but still these works are classic and full of adventure.(By the way, did anyone else notice the negative impression of jewelry in these books? Quite obviously Tolkien was Jeweleryphobic.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow delivery","review":"I would not order from this seller again as it took way too long to receive the order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best fantasy ever and one of the greatest books of all time.","review":"I first read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings when i was 14 years old, and ten years later i am still in love with them.These books are easily the greatest fantasy novels of all time and have spawned more spin offs then any other book ever written.You cannot call yourself a fantasy fan, or even a literature fan, if you have never read these books. They are a pure masterpiece and a timeless classic that will stand forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only thing wrong with it: it's too short!","review":"Tolkien has refined the art of fantasy, and this book is a long draught of it. Overall, it is a classic epic of good versus evil, but it is steeped in the mythology of Middle Earth as well as the beautiful songs of the different races of the lands. The story is about the quest to destroy the one ring of power which has fallen into the hands of the hobbit, Frodo. Unfortunately the only place it can be destroyed is in the very heart of the enemy's land: Mordor. A classic, I'm telling you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"This is one of the best noval in the whole world, and if you like fantasy, then I will highly recommand this book. If you like humors and twisting plotling,then I won't be recommanding this to you because there are hardly any humors.reading age: 15+"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Story: The Lord Of The Rings","review":"What can I say, this is the best story I have ever read! It's a classic! And even though it can get a little slow and monotonous at times, it's a book that everyone should have to read. I mean, Tolkien has created a whole world through his writings! It's like a bible, with the Lord Of The Rings as the New Testament, and The Silmarillion as the Old. I am reading these books to my sister now, and she loves them just as much I do. These books are one of the best classics of all time! =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"These books are facinating!!!!","review":"I love these books! They are great for pretty much all ages. If you like fantasy stories with magical creatures, wizards, and dark sorcerors you should definatly read these books! In the stories you follow Bilbo and Frodo Baggins through their adventures with dragons, orcs, and and spiders. They are on a difficult journey to destroy the One Ring. There's lots of suspense, I could hardly put it down! I also recomend seeing The Lord of the Ringd:Fellowship of the Ring movie, its also excellent!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"What can one say of Lord of the Rings? It is the greatest fiction of all time. I'm serious too. Im a big book buff and I truly believe Tolkien's literature is the best. The most in-depth world ever created, with history, struggles, and societies rivaling our own.On a side note, I saw the movie, and Jackson did an amazing job translating the book onto the screen. Its not completly true to the book, but it is impossible to be exactly true.My recommendation: If you havnt read it, read itIf you have read it, read it again!Also, read the Simirillain. Its a hard read but worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete collection received and enjoyed","review":"I ordered these books about 2 weeks ago and received them in less than a week. Delivery was timely and the well-packaged. The box cover was a bit worn but for the price and for a casual reader like me, all is good. This set is primarily to read and then share with others NOT to collect, its got great artwork and rather large letters but don't be annoyed if a page or two are folded or if the box show shelf-wear. Overall, I rate this buy 5 stars because it is exactly what I expected at a great price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth a Re-read","review":"In anticipation of the movie, I picked up the Lord of the Rings trilogy last summer because I had never actually finished reading it as a kid. What a difference 20 years makes! I found the writing crisp, intelligent, witty, and engaging - all the qualities of a great book, in my opinion. The only drawback in my mind was Tolkien's over-doing it a bit with the life in the Shire in the first book. That's what I couldn't get past as a kid and it nearly stopped me cold again this time. But then again, who am I to criticize a work that's truly become a cultural icon?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I have always loved these books, they are without equal. I like this edition because of the extra notes and appendices (one can never get too much hobbit-lore) and because the book-size allows a font-size that is easily read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I was looking for.","review":"I prefer trade paperbacks to mass markets which is why I chose these.

I remember each of these books vividly as if i had read them yesterday. Tolkien brings you into his world so completely that the reader loses all concept of time. I can remember reading for 8 hours straight as a kid...not wanting to put these books down and leave Tolkien's world. Tolkien had a profound impact on my enthusiasm for reading as a child. There is nothing that even compares to his works...The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings trilogy is a must for everyone. I have taken a few days off of work to reread these books...I am also giving the box set to everyone i know with young children...."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hobbit/Lord of the Rings","review":"Anyone reading this is familiar with the books. I bought the boxed set so that I could re-read them. I hadn't read them since I was a kid, and forgot much of the stories. Reading them again with an adult mind, brought much meaning and clarity from them, and I would recommend to anyone that had not read them as an adult, to read them again.The books, physically, were well bound, and printed clearly. I was dissapointed with the maps, but could, with a little help from a magnifying glass, make out most of the important points.If you have only seen the movies, and not read the books yet, I would highly recommend reading them. The movies were 'ok', but they don't begin to touch the whole spin of Tolkiens tale. A picture may be worth a thousand words, but not an epic story as this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The lord af the box set","review":"If you like the lord of the rings then this box set is a must buy. It is like buying 4 books for the price of 3.5. Now thats one sweet bargin. I realy like the lord of the rings books. but I like them even more when they come in a box. If you like books that come in a box and if you like The lord of the rings then you better buy this box set. It is a once in a lifetime opertunity. Do not pass it up, or you will regret it for the rest of your entire life."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE HOBBIT/COMPLETE SET","review":"I Have this complete set.

I was only in second grade at the time, and finishing up the Narnia series; I didn't read it until that summer...and then discovered all I'd been missing.After devouring The Hobbit, my mom got out her tattered old copies of the three Lord of the Rings books for me. I went insane...LotR is, as anyone who's read the books knows, even better than the Hobbit. Now, nearly five years later, I still continue to read and reread of the heroic, enchanting, and epic tale of Frodo (a kind-hearted Hobbit burdened with an evil, mind-possing Ring of Magic)and the Company on their quest to cast the Ring into the Cracks of Doom...therefore destroying it and saving the Middle Earth from destruction."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible read!!!","review":"I was floored by this book! For the longest time I was told to read this book, so I thought I'd give it a chance. I'm glad I did.This is a story of how a simple man becomes a hero. Meet Bilbo Baggins, a simple hobit who enjoys a simple life. He's never had an adventure, and never wanted to go on one. His life was changed when he met Gandalf, a great wizzard. Gandalf and his troops wisk Biblo off on a great adventure in order to find treasures....and a adventure he'll never forget. On his adventure, Biblo will come up aganist creature that nightmares are made from. In the process of his quest, he gets a ring of invisiblty. My favorite part of the book is when Bilbo was drawn into a contest of riddles. I also like the songs that the different people sang. It added so much to the book.Tolkien is a genius, pure and simple. He has a very unique writing styly. I look forward to reading The Lord of the Rings. I highly suggest you read this book. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful epic fantasy, but may be too complex for some","review":"I am a 7th grader, and I wanted to read some good fantasy. My winter vacation was spent reading the entire \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy along with \\"The Hobbit.\\"What this is is an amazing epic adventure, that starts out kind of slow in \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\", but quickly picks up pace until it's amazing climax in \\"The Return of the King\\".

The first time I read the book I didn't want to put it down. I walked down the school halls reading the series, completely unaware of anyone else and usually sidestepping people at the last moment. When I got near the end (last hundred pages or so) I wanted to put the book down so I could make the experience last but I just couldn't. The raising of the shire is awesome. one final thing, the first time I read this I skipped over the songs and poetry, but the second and third time I read the trilogy I read the songs. SOMETIMES I SUNG THEM. Especially the song Legolas and Aragorn sing when they send Borimor to Raurus Falls. DO NOT SKIP THE SONGS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The books have allways been and will ne one of my favorites!","review":"I have allways been enchanted with the characters of the Hobbit series. Tolkien has a way of putting you in the book with a three demensional feel. I feel as though I'm right in the middle of the action. He is an excellent writer, and keeps my attention, and if for some unknown reason I have to put the book down, I come back to it as soon as possible. I would recommend this book to people of all ages.

I don't know if I like this book better than David Edding's Belgarath, because LotR had a LITTLE too much description (I, being 14, probably have a shorter attention span than a lot of more mature people) but at times I got bored, but after a half of a chapter or so it jumped back out. If you like fantasy, you must read this book, or you'll never understand the full extent of the fantsasy genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"Good Book to read in an airplane or bus or train, to kill time.

I'm tempted to return them and replace them with newer versions but that'll be a huge hassle.I don't know about the typos or anything, but I checked out the maps and I wasn't sure if they were the ones in the original stories, but who knows.

Tolkein put this fantasy land into words. You could almost see the creatures in their surroundings. I think that the way he wrote the book is almost like the movie. you can easily invision the pictures given his discriptive writing. I think you should read this book because it shows you a way of determination and courage and how one simple hobbit can go from a peacful simple life to an amazing adventerous one and of course he has his friends to help him along the way. Over this amount of time that he is on his adventure he gains the respect of the other creatures that are with him. I highly recomend this book to all adventurous readers! Thus the adventure begins!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lord of the Rings- the fellowship of the ring","review":"I am not an avid reader, however after reading this book I am compelled to read the final two in the three part series. This book captures the mind while putting you in the adventure with the hobbits and friends. The only downside to this book is all the decription of various towns, locations, and family history. There are maps that help to lay out the land. This is a book for all ages, and hey now there is a movie for those whio choose not to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this edition","review":"Everyone knows the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings are wonderful stories, and I fully agree. The reason for my bad rating of this PARTICULAR edition of JRR Tolkien's works is that the books are riddled with typographical errors, some so severe that they change the meaning of sentences, effectively reversing the author's intent. One example: \\"The Breelanders locked their doors at night, which was also not unusual in the Shire.\\" The word \\"unusual\\" should have been \\"usual\\"--i.e., the Shire Hobbits don't usually lock their doors at night. But exactly the opposite idea is conveyed by this typographical error! And there are many more errors where that one came from. I counted THREE errors on ONE PAGE! AVOID THIS EDITION at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tolkien is tops, but this edition shaky on QUALITY","review":"I got this very boxed set the other day and The Hobbit fell apart on first reading. The cover just peeled right off as I read through! Boo to the publisher (Ballantine Books, NY) for messing up a classic of literature. Worse, I found spelling errors too... needless to say I got a refund and will get myself the Deluxe Edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great box, too bad about the books","review":"Fans of the Peter Jackson movies may enjoy having photos of the actors on the spines of the covers, but the books are printed on cheap paper in an eyestrain-inducing small font.

I must say Rivendell bored me to tears--so i quit reading and have only recently completed the series.

I mean, yes hewrites beautifully and he created a world so deep and detailed.So I guess The Lord of the rings is a great book, in the sensethat it's a nicely crafted piece of word art and creativity.However, I usually like more selfcontained stories where moredepth is given to less characters. This story goes left andright into thousands of sidestories that are not all veryinteresting. The full story itself could have been containedinto one 400 pages book instead of three painful tomes. Thisoverdescriptive and dragging work, \\"masterpiece\\" is highlyoverrated and I only recommend it to people who have a LOT oftime to kill.On the other hand, the movie was totally awesome. It grabbedall the essential aspects of the book and bundled that intoa superb film. Leaving out all the uncessary babbling thatmake this book a painful read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paper back?

If you are going to buy the books (and many of us already have them) why not get them as they were intended? Bound in leather with that musky smell of aged paper.

I have another edition with the original maps, and yet it says this is the only edition with the originals.

A great story line with complex plot. In maybe 3rd grade i read The Hobbit for some reason and i stopped near the middle of the book.

I just finished the last book of the series (Return of the King) and now i am going on to read The Silmarillion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good lookes, Good bookes","review":"Ok... First the books are great and whoever does'nt belive me should go see the movies - the Hobbit is in a simple fun type of word selection the Lord OF The Rings is more complicated but that's what it is famous for.

What Prof. Tolkien wrote was not just a story, but an entire world with such depth and detail, that you would swear you are reading history. This IS the standard for fantasy literature. Many colleges teach courses on these books. In fact, many of the aspects and interpretations of the story are debated and studied as if they were history. For those who enjoy these, be sure to jump into the many books on the history of middle earth and also read the biography of Prof. Tolkien, which gives a fascinating account of how the entire middle-earth saga sprung from his \\"hobby\\" of creating his own languages...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Masterpiece","review":"I first read The Lord of the Rings way back when it was first released. The Hobbit was originaly written for his then very young son Christopher, and the tale grew from that simple story. You will never forget the charcters once you meet them. Characters like little Samwise (a Hobbit), a lover of gardens to the many lords and ladies. It is a classic tale \\"Good vs Evil\\". The original set I had fell apart from reading and rereading, till I had to buy another set. If this is your first time I do suggest you start with the Hobbit and then work your way through LOTR. Tolkein himself I feel to be a real genius, his writting is brilliant. Unfortunatly for us he died before finishing what he felt to be his most important work and that book was completed by his son. I miss him sorely, but his memory lives on in his works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely, the best of the genre...","review":"After picking up the Lord of the Rings off my bookcase, I dusted it off and thought, \\"I OUGHT to read this...\\"Well, I started reading and couldn't put it down.

I saw the review that said this is 'iPhoto for windows'. It is, and probably even better. This is the cleanest, easiest to use program, of any sort, I have seen for Windows. It does a fantastic job organizing photos; it will make some simple adjustments (red eye, 'enhance', crop to standard sizes); it does the cool slide show to music that iPhoto does; it prints magnificently; it will automatically transform your photos into email size, and launch your email program. It's *the* photo program for the non geek.

One of the cheap plastic hinges was already broken and the other broke while taking it out of the box. The only good thing about the Potty Pal was that a step stool came with it, which we still use. This seat is made of a more durable material and has strong hinges. I like the fact that the seat can be held in place when not in use so visitors are not even aware that they are using a special seat. I am so happy that we no longer have a separate potty or a seat insert in our main bathroom that I am purchasing a second seat for our other bathroom. The only reason I did not give this product five stars is that the seat will not stay up when my husband uses the bathroom, as another reviewer noted."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible terrible","review":"the IDEA of this seat is fantastic. the issues i had were 1- the seat doesnt fit every toilet, 2- the seat does not stay up when boys need to use the toilet and 3- it gets FILTHY when boys pee. if you have girls only the seat would rock LOL. i clean my toilet EVERYDAY regardless but i found myself having to scrub all three parts after every use. not cool. great idea like i said but i wish they made them specific to the toilet you own."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a very nice seat!","review":"We've tried other seats on the market - even one you install and flip down (that one was lovely, poked you in the back if you were an adult user!).

Great product overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good seat.","review":"Well, this seat does the job and my son loves it. The two drawbacks are that my husband has to hold the seat up whenever he uses the bathroom...also when I go to empty the mop bucket sometimes I forget and get splashed with dirty water and the shape of it is a little strange. Instead of a nicely downward curved shape it sort of curves up. I've pretty much gotten used to it and the benefits definetly outweigh the negatives. It's a good seat, well made and I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Familiy Seat","review":"Great for my son & helps him use our family potty.

It's easy to install and makes it much easier and cleaner for my toddler to use the toilet. There's no removable potty to remove from the regular toilet, which makes it cleaner. When my son does \\"go\\", because he is a boy I may need to do a quick wipe uder the seat and then it clips right back under the regular toilet seat lid. It's more secure and thus safer than those potty seats to place ontop the toilet. We used one prior & I always felt like my son would either fall in or fall off. the only drawback is the clip that holds the small seat under the lid is tight & difficult for my son to undo himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"introduction to song writing","review":"The notion of songwriting is watered down--but for the beginner that wants to have a foundation--a decent book.However, the problem with this type of reading is that the field of songwriting is saturated--that any book might be able to provide better quality.Buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good information for the novice","review":"Well organized, with six separate chapters.

In the lot of what has been written about UFOs and aliens, this book is as original and provocative as the best of Wilson. Although I consider myself quite well-informed about the subject, the book never bored me, and I found Wilson's scope on the subject very interesting, thought-provoking and very entertaining.

Another positive is that it seems Louise has found a new harmony partner in the bassist, Nicole. They trade harmonies on a few songs, which was quite absent from Resolver.

It's got an intelligent storyline, interesting divers characters and cool martial arts. It's obvious that the film was an ambitious learning-while/by-doing-project. So there are a lot of things one could mention about the insecure novice things that are also part of the movie. But what made me happy about it, is the passion and dedication that Nathyn Masters and his microbudget cast and crew put into this film. That shows. That inspired me. And it entertained me, of course. (Four out of five stars, in its context. Expect the next one to be six out of five.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tooo sensitive!","review":"Great idea but mine kept turning on all the time for no reason.

Bacon","review":"Exceptional book, written with the average Joe-Citizen in mind. We have lived in the San Francisco Bay Area for about 15 year, but never dared to walk San Francisco like this before. Saw this book and realized what an understated gem it was. Maps and Illustrations are fun and helpful, too. Many interesting anecdotes about the city's history and interesting spots. Walk took 6 hours, was invigorating, and amazed after it was over how much we had seen up close and with more knowledge about the sites than ever. Took friends from Australia with us, and they commented that they thoroughly enjoyed the walk, too. Recommend it without reservation. By the way, a few of the other ratings are somehow at \\"0\\". This throws off the book's ratings from the two (so far) who have rated it at \\"5\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good ideas, bad fiction","review":"I enjoyed this book overall; I'd happily read nonfiction from this author, and I'd love to see the roleplaying campaign this story is obviously adapted from. (Which puts it above Ed Greenwood's books...not that this is strong praise).That said, the ending is one of the most poorly-designed and anticlimactic set pieces in the history of fiction. Allies and villains pop up and fall down like rodents in a whack-a-mole game, and display about as much depth and character development. Many parts of the plot read like the author came up with them by rolling percentile dice and checking some sort of random adventure table.This is a book I could happily quote from, but not one I could recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good storyline and world, didn't dig the prose/style","review":"I randomly picked this book up from the local library, and while reading it was simultaneously entertained and annoyed.Zielinski uses a unique style of writing which is unusual, and, quite frankly, didn't appeal to me. Take a look at a page or two before you buy this, to see if you can stand it.If you can stand the style, then you will appreciate the characters, world, and environment he has created. I was particularly fond of the characterization of anything worth buying being priced in terms other than money.

I've read most books covering the appearances of Our Lady but this one has to be the best on the subject. The author gives some early history of the sufferings of the Roman Catholic Church from the Islam invasion to the Protestant Reformation and how the Catholic Church dealt with all these turmoils. Prophecies are explained as to not BS you about how God is offended by our sinfulness. Great reading and every appearance from Guadelupe to Medjugorje are all covered as well.

Pretty interesting at times, but otherwise belongs to the long line of mundane Star Trek novels"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"I have listened to many Star Trek books, and I have liked some more then others. This one was by far the worst. The plot line is overly simple, there is no development of characters(all are flat), and the writer clearly did no research into the Star Trek universe (the Romulans in this book used PHASERS!!!). A woman reads this book, but most of the characters are men, so it makes it hard to visualize Captain Picard giving orders on the bridge of the Enterprise in his deep commanding voice. No offence to women by that, but there are some things that women simply cannot do, and imitating Picard is one of them. To close, I will simply rephrase the main point of this paragraph: DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 Hearts Collide","review":"Captain Picard's artificial heart and a legendary heart of awesome power collide.

This album is an embarrassment by any standard and the sooner it goes out of print the better. Davy Jones' voice has not aged well at all and Peter's (which was never anything to get excited about to begin with) is in even worse condition. No wonder Mike passed on the reunion invite. \\"Heart and Soul\\" is decent but it's all downhill from there. Very pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is without a doubt the WORST Monkees album ever!","review":"ANY of the Monkees' 60's albums are better than this synthesized garbage. As with most albums, there are a couple of highlights (Heart & Soul, Every Step of the Way & Gettin' In). But even those song aren't good enough to merit buying this album. The songs lack any heart, and is mixed in such a way that any melody the songs may have had are overtaken by overpowering, 80's style synthetic sounding drums. What suprises me about Rhino's reissue is that they didn't include their other songs of the era as bonus tracks(That Was Then, This Is Now; Anytime, Anyplace or Anywhere & Kicks)--ALL of which are better than any songs found on this album. If you MUST have a reunion album, stick with Justus(which features Mike), but I STRONGLY prefer Pleasant Valley Sunday any day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third album as a trio","review":"Pool It! is 41 minutes and 44 seconds and was released in August of 1987. Pool It! reached #72 on the U.S. Billboard Album chart. I am guessing due the fact that four Monkees albums came out in 1987, that is way Pool It! did not do better. This was The Monkees first reunion album less Mike Nesmith. Just like previous albums the trio used studio musicians. Two of the songs from that album managed to chart, but not that well. Pool It! does not seem to have the magic like previous Monkees albums.

There are two, maybe three tracks that are decent enough to have been album cuts in their heyday. The rest are bad, generic pap, most done in that 80s style that hasn't held up well at all, has it? This is nothing but a quickie made to cash in on their popular reunion tour."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR MIKE FANS!!","review":"I realize that some people like this album, though I don't know why. This is my absolute least favorite Monkee album. At times, I'm ashamed to even own it. Maybe it's because I'm a Mike fan and he's not on this album. Or, maybe it's because I don't really care for 80's music and synthesizers, even if it is the Monkees. I do not recommend this album to Monkee fans (especially Mike fans)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Banal and Pointless","review":"Reunions are usually never a good idea and this abominable album proves this. This CD doesn't really even sound like the Monkees, the empty 1980's production values lack warmth and expression, the songs are far from memorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK album, could've been better, could've been worse.","review":"I remember all the hoop-la this album got when it was released in '87. Right before the Monkees were banned from MTV, they were showing Heart and Soul and one other... That Was Then This Is Now.... I believe, about once an hour. I haven't had this tape in awhile, I bought it in '87 and it busted about '90 or so. But I remember that it sounded like it was put together very quickly, kinda like their concert in '86, very hurried and up-tight. I'm a tried and true Mike fan, but I don't dislike this album, it's got great 80's sounding music if you like that. Though not an *outstanding* Monkees album, truthfully, how many *outstanding* albums did they have? I'll definitely buy the cd again... some day."},{"rating":"1","title":"80'S HORROR","review":"Quite possibly the worst album ever made. Prepare to hear a group you love (?) tarnish their canon and their flaky reputation almost beyond repair. They tried to be contemporary ... and sadly succeeded. The trouble being that this was 1986 - a year when the majority of pop music, film, fashion and virtually every mainstream cultural arena was devoid of any talent or taste. How on earth did The Monkees fit in so perfectly? 'Pool it' languishes in a digital MOR hell, that from the makers of 'Pisces...' and 'Headquarters' is still nothing less than shocking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Come Back","review":"Very good try from Mickey,Davy & Peter. This CD came out in 1987 after there 1986 reunion tour. Good songs,Plus good vocals. Mickey and Davy did not play on it. Peter did played on one song.

Cucumbers, tomatoes, green beans, etc. Yes, I follow the direction carefully. I sprayed in the evening after the sun was going down, I mixed it slightly 'less' strong than it called for, after seeing the big burn your plants warning on the side of the container. And I spray just a few leaves of each plant, so not to kill anything. Just like the direction stated. There is nothing in my garden I could use this on, as it burnt everything, except a woody plant (blackberries). Also it stinks so very bad, and it stays with you for some time. Oh and reading the container it seems to me that it will only kill what it hits, no residue effects. Ok so that's my review, hope I saved someone this $15.00 lesson."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best kept secrets in music today","review":"Metropolis Records was so smart when they signed this band to their label. I saw this band live in San Francisco and they were simply sensational. What makes them so appealing is that they combine so many different genres (new wave, goth, industrial, pop) into one explosive product, and they can reach a very broad audience.I'd really recommend this band to anyone, they're a breath of fresh air amidst an otherwise uninspiring music scene right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romance is breaking every heart in two...","review":"Creepy lyrics, gothic overtones,a good dash of pop and electronica. This is quickly becoming one of my favorite albums. I havn't found anything else that sounds really like this at all. Chibi's voice is really soothing as she sings about death and lost love. My favorites are \\"Blue\\", \\"Lover's End\\", and \\"Happy Birthday\\". Can't wait to hear more from this band. I love the stage-names of the band members :D. They are on Metropolis records which is awesome. If you are looking for a electronic enfluenced death-pop album that is easy on the ears, pick this cd up, you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Own brand","review":"The Birthday Massacre is a one of a kind band. There music feels goth, with hints of electronica(but not to be confused with Neo-goth, or Eletronic/goth), and fused with the odd flavor of 80s pop. Intresting to say the lest. There compareable to no one in style much like Mindless Self Indulgence. When bands like these come around its hard not to take notice cause such orginal sounds turns into such ear candy. Its a virgin sound to your ears and to that asepc its a true treat. There closest compareable sounds are that of a Zeromancer clashed with London After Midnight. More so the later then the former. The only issue is that some of the music although catchy, gets bland after numerous listens. I dont like to plug other bands, however if your taste brought you this far i suggest giving London After Midnight a try...a bit more darker with a harder male vocal lead. Despite both bands showing clear differences they still go hand and hand it so seems."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE CHILD DEVIANT","review":"All of the songs on this album follow the same format...they begin with hardrock guitar sounds..the lyric sections are backed by a layer of 1980's pop beats..and the chorus sections take you into the whole neo gothic metal feel. Despite the consistency of this album...it's quite catchy and hard not to like. Unique female vocals, excellent musicianship, and overall, with this being a debute album, The Birthday Massacre have invented a style of thier own. as for thier perky image, they do look like another dark and bubbly \\"Hot Topic Band\\"...But, in truth, they are kinda creative and original. If your not caught up in being a gothicly correct purist who thinks all new music is fluff...you'll probably find yourself enjoying this album. It's different...yes, it's verry, verry, goth, ...but it's also kinda fun and playful in an unusual way. It's a good record.

Coming from the South, and Appalachia, he was also a rare voice for racial unity and a defender of the working man in the 1930s, a position that cost him a number of jobs and led to attacks by the Klan. Overall, I found his work to be really inspiring, even today.There is a strange review below that calls West a beat poet. I don't know what that reviewer is referring to. The beats were an entirely different movement, in another time, and another place. The review is quite odd, actually, and out of place and disses a man who gave his life to the cause of social justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of trees, time, toil.","review":"Beat poetry was the low point of American literature.

He abused alcohol for 40 years, and admits he used it to avoid dealing with strong emotions. And, he didn't stop out of any sense of responsibility to himself or those around him, but because his aging body couldn't tolerate it anymore. With this background, is it all surprising he fell into a depression?And maybe it is helpful to place blame, if for no other reason than to be honest and not leave readers with the impression that depression is a disease like any other, that strikes out of the blue.

For a very personal glimpse into depression, I would suggest reading AN UNQUIET MIND instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful revelation","review":"In a mere eighty-four pages, the late William Styron relates with incredible depth his own journey through depression and the causes of it. Among the most profound elements that Styron mentions is that depression is a disease of loss and at least this reader was impressed by the author's boldness in being able to tell of the months he endured his own trauma followed by an ultimate recovery.\\"Darkness Visible\\" is a book largely about hope. As he points out, most people experiencing depression, even in its darkest forms, do survive to live another day. He acknowledges that much is still to be learned about why certain people are prone to depression and what more can be done to help those suffering from it. The remarkable service that William Styron has given us with regard to this disease is heartfelt. I highly recommend this book for its honesty and insight."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Courageous Memoir About Battling Depression","review":"William Styron is a great writer. Most readers and movie-goers are familiar with his book 'Sophie's Choice'. Most readers, however, are not familiar with the fact that William Styron had been battling with depression for most of his life.This book is only 80 pages long but it is very deep. It deals with Mr. Styron's battle with depression. It discusses his self-medicating with alcohol. He also uses prescription medication to combat his depression related insomnia (ambien). The sleeping pills made his depression even worse. He faces a despair so profound that he is unable to motivate himself to attend an event where he is to be presented with a prestigious literary award.For anyone who has suffered depression, who has a loved one or friend with depression, or for anyone interested in what depression is, this book will is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darkness Visible","review":"This insightful book views suicide from the side of one who has suffered from a desire for self destruction.

It is a quick read, an essay really, that chlonicles Styron's struggle with depression at age 60.When I finished the book, I was beyond disappointed. In the book he does nothing to describe how his actual \\" recovery\\" came to be.. He talks of his hospitalization... but he says group therapy didn't help... he made somewhat sacastic remarks about art therapy..and he doesn't really express too much regarding medication that worked for him...So... I believe I expected something different. I expected a book that would fill me, as a depressive, with hope and fellowship... My expectation was WAY too high.I would not recommend this book.

Also the way he both decides to live and the way in which he overcomes his depression seems glib and unrealistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Narcissism to the tenth power.","review":"It's been said already in other reviews, but Styron clearly romanticizes his depression and applies a kind of artistic elitism to depression that exlcudes those who don't live a so-called \\"creative\\" life. (Styron regularly appears on television with other \\"artists\\" and Mike Wallace, the journalist, a kind of unspoken code: this is about \\"creative types.\\") This is a very small book with very little to offer. He talks a lot about his alcoholism but fails to connect his many years of drinking with his depression. Of course, it is known that alcohol is a depressant and, like other drugs, kills brain cells and diminishes the brain, in general. There's a part of Styron at work that embraces his depression. He identifies with it and, I believe, his writing this slight essay was his way of keeping it. I found the book redundant, slow, at times unclear, and offering, quite frankly, nothing of value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"I thought this was feeble; banal, unsympathetic and evasive.The author starts by telling us that in suffering from a depression, he considered that no previous writer had been able to communicate what depression felt like. He ends with the fanfare that, on re-reading his own novels, he discovered himself to have been remarkably intuitive about depression.He's tiresomely repetitive of the same bald point - \\" ... and then I knew I was really ill ... I was really ill and I knew it ... nobody understood how really ill I was ... and I really was ill ... really.\\"The man strikes me as a Charlie who, on the evidence of his trite writing here, learned little about himself, little about the illness or nothing about others at all.A pompous little snivel book. Forgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little disappointing","review":"After all the hype I'd heard about \\"Darkness Visible\\", I found it a bit disappointing. Styron is clearly a great writer- few would dispute that. Nonetheless, I found his description of the subjective feeling and experience of depression to be somewhat lacking. Of course, it's very difficult to describe any subjective mental state, but nonetheless I didn't find his attempt too compelling. On the other hand, the book is very well-written and stylistically pleasing. Avery Z. Conner, author of \\"Fevers of the Mind\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Critique of Darkness visible","review":"The author did not offer any insights, such as specific symptoms or specific approaches to improvements. It essentially tells the reader that depression got worse after sobriety, but then got better. No insights for reader to take away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting First-Hand Account of Severe Depression","review":"This autobiography of William Styron dives into his own experience with severe depression. Although he was winning critical acclaim as an author, he went further and further into depression to the point of hopelessness and suicide. The book gives a great account of his personal experience and how he was able to recover and find happiness in his life again. Very interesting to hear about a much overlooked disease from the viewpoint of someone who has been there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich and Profound","review":"Styron is unquestionably an amazingly gifted writer. In this intense depiction of clinical depression, Styron describes in the elegant prose he is so well known for, the onset of his depression, alcohol and prescription drug abuse, and he vividly recounts how it feels to be caught in the grip of mental illness and suicidal ideology, penned in a style that I've never seen in a memoir before. He later goes on to tell of his seven week stay in a hospital and his recovery.This memoir is completed by a brief biology, photos, and an actual letter. I recommend this book for anyone who suffers from depression, anyone who loves someone with depression, or anyone who is a fan of Styron's."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing heartfelt insight into the truth about depression","review":"I could not help but be comforted by the the words of William Styron in Darkness Visible. As his novels intriqued me and delighted me this account of his experience with depression gave me support. It made me realize that no one is safe from this dreaded affliction. What I felt Styron put into words. He made my craziness feel a little less crazy. Styron is a wordsmith of the highest caliber. This book should be read especially by families of those suffering from depression. It gives such vivid descriptions of what it is really like to suffer from depressssion. Sometimes it becomes more real when one so esteemed can express what it is really like. He made me feel just a little more normal and understood.

What a coincidence. I was looking for Styron's 'Lie Down in Darkness' and found this one. It struck me that what Styron describes in 'Darkness Visible' was exactly how I felt in that very moment. My biggest problem was that people I thought were good friends turned away from me because they didn't understood my illness, thought I use the word 'illness' as an excuse to be lazy, or use it in order to blackmail them. Styron had the same experience. I wish more 'healthy' people would read this book.

But I read his portrayal of that experience with the same kind of horror that one might feel when a family member gets drunk and ruins a party. \\"Say, isn't that your brother over there?\\" \\"Who him? No!\\" I felt Styron was pompous in the rendering of his suffering, eager to use his illness to prove his depth, his brilliance, and his place with great writers.

It began after he quit drinking or actually drinking quit him because his body reacted to alcohol and he simply could not drink it.We all deal with depression at some point of our lives and for some folks it grabs hold of them.

This album is BEAUTIFUL; mostly anchored in hard-bop, but diverse, with blues, ballads and lot of drive. The band is excellent, no small thanks to Slide Hamptonwho played some mean trombone, arranged the stuff and wrote some of the songs.But, in addition to originals, there are some trully magnificent readings of jazz standards - I can't say which is better: uptempo version of \\"You don't know what love is\\" or quartet version of \\"Shadow of your smile\\"...This music, recorded in 1969 is timeless in the best sense of the word, accesible to jazz fanatics and general audinces (IMHO)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic album.

I do not wear hearing aids but have trouble understanding the voices on the TV and I can understand every word (no longer need captions on TV).

I couldn't find a good set of wireless noise canceling headphones so I decided to try these. They were able to remove the high frequency noises but the low frequencies (people's voices) were more pronounced than without the headphones. It was very annoying so I sent them back and have been using my RS 120 set at work instead. The RS 120's don't drown out the background noise as much but it is much more tolerable than having random low frequency noises.I didn't notice a difference in performance between the two so for the price the RS 120 set is a better buy and I actually prefer them as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Sound","review":"Comfort: 3.5 -- keeps ambient sound down, but no adjustment for larger head.

A good purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like listening over a cordless phone circa 1985","review":"The headphones are comfortable enough, and other newer Sennheiser models are probably fine, but the RS 140 model uses analog RF technology. In this day and age, unless you are using them inside a faraday cage, analog RF is not going to be very listenable -- nowhere near as good as a wired connection.I have several pairs of wireless digital speakers in my home, plus two sets of speakers attached to Apple AirTunes receivers, and all of them work flawlessly if you stay within range. That is the experience I expected for a $150 pair of wireless headphones purchased in 2009. I did not realize that these used simple analog RF transmission; I thought that the RF description was meant to indicate that they did not use infrared technology like some other headphones used to.Put simply, these are not the headphones you want. Sennheiser makes several other models that do use digital tech. Try one of those."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"Shame on you, Sennheiser!!! If I wanted to listen to hiss/static, I would have paid $20 at Walmart. These headphones are unusable for podcasts, digital piano, lectures, and almost anything other than loud music. In addition to the baseline static, the reception on these headphones is poor. If you want to use these things for anything other than a paperweight, be prepared to assume a catatonic posture. Don't even hope to hear anything other than in and out static while exercising. I read many reviews of this product before purchasing. What a disappointment! I also love the NO RETURNS policy for headphones. It makes me wonder if the people writing these reviews are field representatives for Sennheiser (or on drugs). I have other Sennheiser products (corded headphones and noise-cancelling microphones) which are pricey, but excellent quality.

While delivery was prompt, the product itself seems to have a problem with the headphone battery connection, which of course was not discovered until over a week after Christmas when my husband finally set up the system. Ace Photo Digital has offered absolutely no technical support; we have called several times only to be placed in the automated \\"hold\\" pattern, waiting for the next available representative and even after waiting once for over 40 minutes, we have yet to speak with anyone. For what we paid, this certainly is not the service one would expect. I suggest you not order from Ace Photo Digital or any other vendor until AFTER you contact the vendor directly to see what recourse you may have regarding technical support if any is needed. This has been a totally frustrating and demoralizing experience and definitely a waste of precious money."},{"rating":"2","title":"All I would ever want in a wireless headphone!","review":"Pros: Has incredible sound! Does not disturb persons trying to sleep next to you. Well padded for my big head.

I'm not sure I would change one thing, they are near perfect!Side note:(possibly a pro)I fell asleep in them, snapped the bridge across the top, Sennheiser replaced my 2+ year old set with a new set for $60.00!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved these","review":"I get great reception even away from my desk. The sound quality is awesome. I really like the fixed volume control. Once you set it, it stays. I tried a much more expensive pair & I had to keep adjusting the volume. I like my volume pretty low & these can make tiny changes in volume. I wish they blocked external sound better. I work in a noisy office & I can still hear what is going on around me, but they are much better than the open Sennheiser RS 130's I tried. They don't interfer with the phones & I like the freedom of going to the fax machine, copier etc. I tried a couple pair of noise reduction headphones, but I didn't like the hum they produced. The only thing I don't like is how they mess up my hair, but they are worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Headphones","review":"These are by far the best headphones I've ever owned. There comfortable, easy to install, and easy to recharge. Just set them on the bars and there recharging. Easy to use controls on the earpads for volume, balance, power and frequency.

I purchased the Sennheiser RS 140 headphones for my husband who often gets up during the night to watch TV in the next room. Since I'm a light sleeper this had often caused harsh words between us. Now he can wear his headphones, hear the TV better than ever, and never interrupt my sleeping. Neither of us is very technically savvy. But the Sennheiser RS 140 was so simple to set up and use, we felt like pros! My husband wears hearing aids during the day, but likes to rest his ears in the evening. The headphones really do help clarify sound and voices for him so he can follow the dialog better. And with the 150-foot transmission range, he can wear them all over the house and not miss part of his program. We are extremely satisfied with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"RIght Headset for the Cost.","review":"WIll save your marriage. All wireless products have slight interferences (iPhone near a speaker, anybody?) so the trick is to find a cost effective model that has the smallest amount of interference. Sennheiser has been creating audio gear long enough to know that this balance is necessary and they need to put their name on a product that meets above average standards. This set does just that. I really don't notice much interference at all. I like the positions of the controls and the function of them (they work! Yay!) The charging unit/transmitter is a smart setup. The charge lasts a long time, and how great is it that it's the holder for the headphones. Soon, there will be lighter weight, head specific models, but after all the reviews and research I did with this pair, I'm very satisfied. I use them quite a bit, so this is based on field testing. Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great when they worked","review":"They caome with a two year warranty.

There is way too much hissing. It is extremely annoying.

I really hope the 2.4GHz of the 170s does not have this problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Wireless Headphones on the market!","review":"The RS 140 is by far the best wireless headphone on the market. The hearing quality is exceptional. I am hard of hearing and turning up the TV only increases the volume, not the clarity. With the RS 140 the sound quality and discrimination is absolutely incredible. The electronic tuning (versus the manual tuning on the other models) is outstanding and is always in sync. The headphones itself are much more comfortable and fit over the ear to eliminate outside noise and make the sound quality even more superior. It is worth every cent of the difference between the less expensive models. I own the RS 120 and bought this one for another room. The RS 120 is good. The RS 140 is OUTSTANDING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea but more or less DOA","review":"Easy to set up. Despite charging for over a day upon arrival, the batteries would not work for more than 5 minutes at a time. Tuning sucks, constant interference if you move around at all.

Better fit, easy to replace rechargeable AA batteries, etc. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Way to expensive to have the sound quality of a dollar store headphone.

Such a shame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good but.","review":"These are good headphones when I can hear through them. I bought them to connect to my television so I could watch at night without disturbing my wife while she sleeps.

What is the purpose of head phones if they are dependant on having the volume turned up at the source?"},{"rating":"1","title":"over rated, over priced","review":"I've owned 4 sets of these Sennheiser wireless phones. Not only over priced, they are not compatible with most audio equipment in the sense that they have their own volume control which only works when the input volume is cranked to a disturbing level. These are represented as personal listening devices but when everyone within a 900 foot radius of the input device must tolerate the sound, I'd call these a complete FLOP. IF you seek wireless personal listening device, please locate a seller of TV Ears. They cost less and work flawlessly. Some ENT physicians actually sell them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality short on directions","review":"Went a bit nuts trying to make it work. Nothing seemed to be right.

Great sound. Durable headset if you treat it well. The problem is with the placement of the volume wheel on the back of the right earpiece. If you want to lean back on a couch or pillow and have the volume stay where it is--forget it. It will either turn down, or it will try to blow your eardrums out. This is a major design flaw, so I cannot recommend this headset for anything but upright activities where you are not leaning your head back against anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuts out; poor transmission over distance","review":"Well that was disappointing. We got an earlier Sennheiser headset that worked very well and could be used quite a distance from the house. This model cuts out, even inside the house, and doesn't cover near the distance the older one does. We plugged it directly into the satellite sending unit, and the signal still isn't strong enough to deliver consistent sound. It also interferes a lot more with the cordless phone. I'm going to buy a separate headset for the old system (didn't know you could do that before) for use outdoors.The pros are that the headset is very comfortable, the sound excellent, and the buttons very usable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great wireless headphones.","review":"Great sound quality, pretty comfortable fit, works decently thru walls.

I'm a little hard of hearing and frequently use closed captioned on the screen to follow the dialog. While some may consider frequency response or true sound reproduction their top priority in a wireless headphone, I have only one priority -- comfort -- since I must use headphones for hours at a time. I've used Sennheiser products in the past and found them to be among the most comfortable of the reasonably priced phones. This product is no exception. The only headphones I will consider purchasing are those that fit around the ear. This is true even for iPod use (I don't care how they look on me).I did not give this product a fifth star because there are more comfortable around the earphones at or near the same price.

With the wireless Sennheiser, I don't have to wear my hearing aids and the sound and tone is spectacular. Other people viewing tv can have the tv sound lower, while you blast away. I also, can turn the tv to mute and still hear out of the headphones. I have the 130 and the 140. One for my bedroom and family room. These are a must. Several of my friends were amazed by mine, so they bought them to. It's a five star product. Don't go anything else. I tried RCA and others. I can also, go out side the slider in the backyard and still hear the tv."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Sennheiser quality","review":"Pros: Well built, easy to use, simple. The sound, if it comes through, is well balanced and gives a nice, roomy reproduction, detailed trebles, punchy or warm bass as needed.Cons: Surprisingly high level of noise, uniform regardless of distance (i.e., within the room or next room). Base station changes volume when spectrum widens/contracts (e.g., bass heavy to wide) have to adjust on headset manually. Reception sometimes unreliable even a few feet away at various angles.Overall: Could be nice headphones, but I expect no such cons from Sennheiser.I would not buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad reception","review":"I was really disappointed by the performance of these headphones. The amount of static it transmits is unbelievable. Even when I'm just two feet away from the transmitter, I can hear noise and it doesn't even stay constant, it fluctuates which makes it impossible for you to mentally \\"tune out\\" the noise.Perhaps it's because of all the electronic noise and appliances in my area, but that's no excuse for bad reception at a distance of 2 feet. I wasn't expecting audiophile quality sound, but for $150 I definitely at least expect clear transmission within a six feet radius!Also, whoever thought of putting the controls on the rear was obviously no genius. It's impossible to lie down while wearing these headphones without messing up the volume and balance.Bottomline - Not worth the money - good features, bad implementation. Horrible reception unless you live in an extremely uncongested area!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Hard of Hearing","review":"This really has helped my dvd watching.The issues about volume control location has not been a problem-- if it is I suggest turning aroundand wearing left on right ear, it works ok.Would be nice if cords were longer.

As soon as I walk into another room the reception starts getting noisy. Two rooms away or about 45 feet the reception starts breaking up and is very noisy. The number of walls between the headphones and transmitter seem to be the biggest factor in reducing the useable range. More than three walls and they stop working all together. Unless you have a very large open space with few or no obstacles I would recommend you get a good set of wired headphones with a long cord as I wish I had done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Most reviews of wireless headphones I've read say that a little \\"fuzz\\" is in every brand. This set seemed the most promising, but it was extremely disappointing. The main reason for purchasing this set was to be able to work in my kitchen and office, each one room away from the source. I had to turn my head and/or switch channels constantly in an attempt to get good reception. When I got a clear signal, the sound was good, but even then it wasn't $130+ worth of good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over priced and not much better","review":"Sad to say these aren't much better than a $40 set.I bought this for my dad because the $39 set he had for 7 years was falling apart so I bought this more expensive set and was really very disappointed the original $39 set from 7 years ago sounded better when they were first bought than this set.Do your selves a favor and save a lot of money, buy a cheaper set."},{"rating":"1","title":"My earphone review","review":"The Sennheiser Earphones were well packed but that was all.

Joseph Tibbets"},{"rating":"1","title":"What they're not saying...","review":"I received mine as a gift which I appreciate very much.I feel I must warn people about a couple of serious design flaws I've run into with Sennheiser.My headphones are connected to my computer. Computers turn the sound off when not in use. These headphones note that the sound has been turned off and after a set time go into hibernation as well. Before doing so, regardless of the volume setting on the headphones, they emit four extremely loud annoying beeps. They are loud enough to hurt your ears and there is no changing or getting rid of it.They put the volume control wheel at the rear of the earcup.

Her mother smoked ..., had one too many one night stands, and drank too much. She never knew her father and her mother never remarried. But some how out of all of this she managed to blossom as a good, strong person. But she's put to the test when her mother gets in troulbe for drugs and she has to live with her spoiled cousin Jennifer, her cruel uncle Reuben, her sweet cousin William, and gentle aunt. Life dosen't get any easier for Raven since her Uncle and Jennifer seem to be trying to ruin her life. Will she be able to survie?I've only read another book in this series (Butterfly) and I found this one to be not so realistc but still a good read. I'm planning on reading the other two (Brooke and Crystal) with high hopes. VC Andrews is a talented writer or suspense and mystery. I hope her other books are just as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbraking","review":"I really don't like to read but someone suggested V.C. Andrews and the Raven was my first pick.

Raven and her mother lived in a run-down apartment until she got into more trouble then she could handle. Raven had no stable family life however she managed to be a great person who was strong willed and able to stand up for herself. She had good morals, and wonderful values despite what her mother may have done. Raven was put in her uncle Reuben's custody but before too long she was taken away. Read the book to find out why.VC Andrews wrote many books, and many series. One series that she wrote was about orphans. This series had many other books such as Butterfly, Crystal, Brooke, and Raven the book I read. I have never read any of the other books but it they're as good as this book I will. The way VC Andrews used figurative language was terrific. If you ever get a chance to read any of these books, do because they're written wonderfully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally and utterly disappointing","review":"This book left me wondering what the point of the collective 4 books was.I found this character to be weak.Her pathetic attempts to defend herself against her uncle goes against every bit of character that the author obviously spent so much time trying to build. These 4 books total lack of direction have left me with no desire to read Runaways when it comes out. I wouldn't waste my money or time!! As a personal note to the ghost writer for Miss Andrews, IT IS TIME TO PUT YOUR PEN DOWN!!! YOU STINK! You have gotten SO far away from Miss Andrews original style and imagination, that you may as well write the books under your own name and get the lousy reviews yourself, instead of staining the memory of a very good author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!!!","review":"This has really been fun reading these small series books. This last one was different in the way that she stayed with family members. Her uncle is awful though, and so is that Jennifer. I feel sorry for the aunt and the son. Of course, Raven too. I enjoyed reading it. I can't wait to see what happens in the next book, now that they are all together. They all seem to have their own little qualities and combined this should be interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Public officials will take comfort","review":"This is a book for your local government official and your state school teacher to take comfort from.Its reasonably well put together but fails to really tackle the principals of government - which is basically to make you do things you dont want to by force (otherwise it would have no reason to exist) and to do so in the name of 'public good' which usually only means the good of some politically favored people at the expense of others.Usually to the benefit of the governers themselves.Suffice to say I wasn't converted into the state's obedient lap-dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taking facts to wrong conclusions","review":"The author lost any remaining credibility with his assertion that the Framers wanted a strong central government with professional politicians. He draws this remarkable conclusion from the fact that the Constitution replaced the Articles of Confederation, which were inadequate to moderate the business of the new nation. He chooses to neglect or diminish the many limitations placed on Federal power to enhance his personal belief that strong central government is best.Similarly, he points to the replacement of the AofC's one-year tenured delegates with two- and six-year tenured Congressmen and Senators as proof that the framers had abandoned the idea of the citizen (non-professional) legislator.Read this book - if you can borrow it. Save your spending money for a more balanced offering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the mark.","review":"Wills fails to see the link between limited government and freedom. By definition, a person willingly gives up some of his liberty in order to be protected by the greater society. Hating the government is wrong, but limiting the government is wise. The founders (which were FOR limited government) rebelled because of an infringement of liberty. The Revolution was fought to throw out a government that was viewed as tyrannical. Many people view the US government today in the same light. That is why you have people that \\"hate\\" the government. Wills does not seem to be able to realize this point. If you are liberal, communist, or statist, this is a good book for you. I am none of these and feel that this book was irresponsible in its portrayal of those who fear a bloated bureaucracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"pro new world/anti american experience","review":"its clear wills is using current political correctness and his own acadamic-elitist beliefs to rewrite our history. by starting off with a total trashing of the second and attempting to prove that because guns were not in wills shows a total lack of unbias belief. (just what were people using to shoot dinner with then?) his assertation that the 2nd is unfounded because it allows uprising against the govt also is untrue. he quickly and easily will exchange the word government for constitution, completely ignoring the fact that the bill of rights is not about protecting a govt, but an ideal. he also never fully explains that the bill of rights was written and ratified in 1791...long after we had established ourselves as a country. a neccesary evil? maybe. a neccesary run-amok one? hardly."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Government?","review":"It is astounding how learned and educated people, like Professor Wills, can spend years reading the Founders and yet miss the main point: that an arbitrary and irresponsible government, such as we have now, where administrative agencies write, enforce, and judge their own laws, is the very definition of tyranny. I love my country and would love to have a Constitutional government, but I hate as much as Washington and Jefferson would anyone who is busying trying to turn American into Germany, which I fear is what people like Wills really want to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is booring and poorly written","review":"This book is badly done propaganda, an obvious attempt to cash in on the antigun hyteria so common in media today. It is a tedious waste of time no matter what your opinion on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read between the lines, just another pawn of the socialists.","review":"This book is just another attempt by the socialist left to break the American spirit of individualism. THAT is what made this country great. This author is just following an agenda of their own for a socialist, totalitarian America. The more people who are dependent on government, the more power they have, the less TRUE freedom we all have. The ultimate goal: socialism. I personally DO NOT want to have to beg the government to give me my money back that they \\"appropriated\\" through taxes. Don't be fooled; ultimate power ultimately corrupts. Distrust of the government is good. Contrary to what \\"revisionist historians\\" like Mr. Wills may say. God Bless a Free America."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book that will rankle the close-minded","review":"This book is not perfect. For example, it seemes to me that Wills misunderstands Thoreau's use of irony, and I'm not sure the causal link between Reagan and abortion clinic bombings is as strong as Wills suggests. But most of the customers who have reviewed this book either 1) haven't really read all the book or 2) are hopelessly close minded.That said, I'll just add that Wills's latest book is a masterful analysis of the very fiber of American society. I don't know anyone who LOVES the government, but Wills shows why it is essential to our well-being, how it is a vital force in making this great country what it is. Few people know more about the Constitution than Wills, but he is not (as some readers suggest) a mere liberal pedant. Sometimes the truth hurts."},{"rating":"1","title":"A muddled book on an important topic","review":"The book has some decent historical merit, but by coming down far on the pro-government side he ignores and misreads several key issues and people. Not helping his case against the militia/pro-gun argument is his citing of the discredited Michael Bellesilles, once thought of as the savior of the left and now accused of fabricating evidence. Additionally, the chapter 'A Necessary Good' is disastrous. The man conflates the existence of a division of labor (economic, not political) and of social norms and restrictions(social, not political) with the *necessity* and benficience of the state! By not proving that these can and would exist without a powerful state, he traps himself into a terribly fallacious argument. It reveals so much of the intellectual poverty of those who seek to glorify an organization whose roots and claims to legitimacy stem solely from force."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"To know the reason why- the questions are indeed the answers. This book won't/can't answer the questions, but instead gives you a tool to begin reasoning for yourself. Everything does happen for a reason and we often won't know until long after the event. Beginning the questions gives one the opportunity to start realizing some of the reasons, and can be comforting to those who are lost in the chaos.Rayna Gangi, author, \\"Forget The Cures, Find The Cause.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Absolute","review":"Though I believe the author offers points in which to ponder about soul progression and the afterlife, I hardly believe that she's entirely got the plan figured out. When one trudges through the chapters, it's as if she's actually interviewed God - too absolute in thinking. It would have been more enlightening if she would have presented her experiences and views as a perspective, not the law. Additionally, I believe she threw in too many client experiences that had no merit, except to show how helpful she's been to others. Mediocre read...buy it only if you find it at a garage sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be titled \\"Another book on The Other Side\\"","review":"The title of this book was very catchy and something I thought would be comforting in a time when things went horrible for me. I'd say about 70-80% of this book is about seances and \\"DP\\" (Dead People). I do admit I like 20% of the book only b/c that's what the book should've focused on...the fact that things do happen for a reason, only I wished the author emphasized on that more than she did. Sometimes Northrop kinda makes it seem like life is a destiny and at other times, life is but a free will. It's confusing. But overall, what she probably meant to say was our free will was how we determine our fate/destiny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul McCartney: Live Kisses","review":"Paul McCartney: Live Kisses is everything I expected.

I almost decided to keep it for myself, since the classic songs Paul chose, from the American Songbook, were songs he recalled and loved from his childhood. Many of you will remember them, too, as they are the tunes that stay in your head and you find that you remember ALL the lyrics, even after all these years. Paul also includes his new song, \\"My Valentine\\", accompanied by the great Joe Walsh (James Gang and Eagles) on guitar. Paul's wonderful running commentary, along with interviews with the likes of Eric Clapton, Stevie Wonder, Diana Krall and the show's producer, Tony LiPuma and others, add much to the presentation.

It was obviously written for the psychiatric community and not the general public but having been written almost 50 years ago it is also incredibly outdated.

They really don't fit on the component jacks on my BRAND NEW SAMSUNG LCD TV OR my DVD player! I had to force them on, it made horrific crunching sounds, and I probably damaged my equipment from pushing so hard on the jacks and spreading them apart because of the girth of these things. As you can see in the above pic, they can't fit side by side, so the jacks are forced to spread apart. I have really never been so angry, and I feel like suing monster.

Some of these stories, particularly \\"Mugic\\" and \\"The Calling\\", remind me of very edgy versions of Twilight Zone episodes with clever surprise endings. The last 3 stories are horrifying acts of intense inhumanity that some can inflict upon others. As some of the reviewers who complained about children getting their hands on this book, UH DUHHH, this is obviously not a book for the kiddies, but come on, why base your review on that fact. Lance also delves into the pathos of religion (which sometimes makes the news as reality, not fiction) and dysfunctions of the human condition.

This CD was purchased for a road trip as it was easier to bring one cd along than an entire collection. All of the songs are fun and easy to sing along to. With that being said I would recommend They Can't All Be Zingers to anyone who is starting out with Primus.

I think it would be a tremendous help to anyone interested in the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"There IS another way to understand this stuff.","review":"I came from a rather abusive/sexist church background and while I was still interested in Christianity (often out of fear of hell) I just couldn't resolve my problems with the religion. One of these problems was the sexism that seemed present in the Bible. This book is a short enough read and has enough infomation to have you questioning a lot of what you thought you knew after just a weekend. However, if you have spent years believing in the sexist interpretation of the Bible you may have trouble beliving this book, and you could write it off in your head as \\"doctrines of demons.\\" Overall, I found a defence for women talking in the church VERY comforting. If you need to take even more of the terror out of Christianity you might also want to read Liberating the Gospels : Reading the Bible With Jewish Eyes : Freeing Jesus from 2,000 Years of Misunderstanding by John Shelby Spong"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Godsend!!","review":"Truly an illuminating book on what Paul REALLY said about women!

One question confronts all Christians: if the New Testament says that women are not to teach and are to remain silent in the church, then how can women be ordained or serve in positions of congregational authority? John Bristow's book explains with responsible scholarship and Christian integrity what Paul really said about this and many other gender issues-- not what Paul's letters interpreted through a Greek philosophical mindset were misconstrued to mean.

The problem of this actor is that since he won the best supporting actor in the Deer Hunter, all the movies he decided to play a role... big time, no matter it's a mob story or anything else, except one movie that was seriously enough to be treated as a not bad movie, The Dog(s) of War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waves of Blood","review":"The Pacific War of World War II was fought from San Francisco to India. It involved vast movements of huge fleets filled with hundreds of thousands of men, locked in a death grip with each other to decide whose world-view would prevail. The beaches were soaked in blood.This collection of DVD's follows the conflict, fight by fight, as it surges from island to island in the great Pacific Ocean. The battle footage is not for the faint-hearted, for the struggle is lethal. These DVD's show the whole extant of the war, from the Japanese invasion of China to the start of the Korean War. This is one of the best DVD sets of it's subject matter for the price. In judging war, the truth is not always clear to us, so we must set it out for all to see. This Canadian company has done an excellent job of laying out the picture of a great war not so long ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hella H4's in a word \\"Outstanding\\"","review":"We recently went to Yosemite Natl.

It was like having daylight in a totally darkened setting. We saw game 4 blocks away thereby giving us plenty of light and warning on order to avoid a collision with these critters. These lights are awesome. I would recommend these lights to anyone who cares about the well being of their families and that of the park wildlife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful book, but definitely not complete","review":"This is a beautiful book on stenciling and many stencils are provided. But don't be misled by the title: it is not complete. Just about all the stencils in this book are of flowers and leaves (ok, an olive, one chicken and one duck stencils are also included). If you are looking for fun things to decorate a kid's room (other than flowers and leaves), this is not the book for you.Also, if you are like me and want to see the effect of a particular stencil on a room or looking for inspirations to use the stencils creatively, there are very few pictures of a finished room in this book.

It covers a great deal of territory, and it does so without the mind-numbing detail of, for example, Deitel's Java: How To Program. That said, it depends very heavily on its author's open source DocJava API. As other reviewers have said here, that library is not without its bugs, which are reproduced in the text. And the proofreading is less than perfect. I would not use this as a primary text for learning Java, but as an example of one way to build a library in Java. Another edition, with the code more thoroughly tested and the library code more carefully separated from the Sun library code, would improve the text greatly.That said, I learned a lot from the author, and from his frequent co-author, Maynard Marquis, who teaches at the same University."},{"rating":"2","title":"GO Rolfs","review":"This product replaces one I bought in Conn. more than 20 years ago.

I can comb or brush my hair easily after using this and my hair feels soft and smooth after blow drying. It has a very lite, clean smell. It's not too expensive and Giovanni doesn't test on animals or use nasty chemicals. I approve! My only complaint is that I wish it was sold in a bigger bottle."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars for product, 2 for container","review":"I absolutely love this conditioner. I am a white woman with naturally thick wavy hair. I enjoy wearing my hair with a little styling product to make it curly. The problem is I am a bit lazy when it comes to caring for my hair and I have to condition and comb through it in the shower while the conditioner is still in my hair or else risk pulling large clumps out as I attempt to untangle it. Some conditioners have left me still pulling out clumps of hair in a fruitless attempt to untangle it in the shower. Not this though, this conditioner makes my hair silky in the shower and I am able to comb though it with minimal damage. So five stars for this product, no matter what I try I keep coming back over and over to this conditioner. My only complaint is the container it is in, the container shape looks beautiful but makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to get all of the product out...please Giovanni, get better containers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite Giovanni Conditioners","review":"This is one of my favorite Giovanni Conditioners.

This move alone is a good reason to buy the video, however, most of the rest teaches moves that would help you if your drunk friend or family member wants a fight. He doesn't focus as much on wounding your opponet, mostly just stopping them or creating distance, that's why I only gave it 3 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"This book is so poorly written (and so obviously not edited) that it is difficult to deal with more than a page at a time.

Unfortunately, this book reads like a glommed-together survey of current research and techniques. Tips like \\"have a defined methodology for your project\\" aren't helpful to me. I really wasn't able to get anything useful to my day-to-day life out of this.On the other hand, if I was looking to write a paper on the field of stakeholder management, this seemed to provide a pretty wide introduction and set of pointers into the literature and current research."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Brief, but there are High Points","review":"This book tackles the subject of Jack Kerouac. After reading this text, I found myself asking \\"Is that it?\\" These are literally the shortest chapters I have ever seen, with several of them spanning only 2 or 3 pages. Compared with the other biographies I've read, this one is too brief and, in a place or two, seems to draw primarily from heresay.What I liked about this book was that it gave Kerouac a dimension of humanity. Too many biographies dissect their subjects with a mortician's instinct, and succeed in removing those people any trace of humanity they possessed in life - who they loved, hated, and what their failings were. For hard-core Kerouac fans, this book should be read, but only in addition to other Kerouac biographies to fill the holes in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse Than It Looks","review":"Christy's book was obviously written for someone doing a Kerouac paper in their high school English class. This is the type of biography you wish had never been published. The fact that it is in print seems to validate what Christy has written. There is so little presentation of known fact--more hearsay and legend than anything else. For instance, Christy claims Kerouac's last words were, \\"It must have been the tuna fish.\\" I'm shocked neither Charters nor Nicosia were able to dig up this information--but Christy was? Who will be the next self-proclaimed \\"Beat Researcher\\" to cash in on the Kerouac revival? This book is on par with \\"The Kerouac We Knew.\\" Yet another shoddy attempt at exploiting Kerouac's celebrity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review from an enthusiastic dog owner","review":"Emily Yoffe is an incredibly funny writer. Her tales of adventure/misadventure with her beagle had me laughing so hard I had tears in my eyes and had to clutch my belly in pain. I read this book on a plane flight and the person in the next seat surely thought I was out of my mind. It's not solely the hijinx of the beagle that are funny but the writer's thoughts and her descriptions of her life and actions that remind me of what it was like to be a new dog owner. Some of the other reviews that rated the book poorly picked out certain anecdotes in the book that the reviewers didn't find funny but I think if you read it with a light heart and memories of your first dog, anyone else will find it incredibly entertaining and hysterically funny too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of laugh-out-loud dog tales","review":"Yoffe's hilarious depiction of her conversion from a cat lover to the reluctant owner of a rescue beagle is full of laugh-out-loud dog tales.

Vicki G, Elk River, MN"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disturbing display of ignorance","review":"I was excited about this book. I was really hoping to read it and love the funny little stories that bond pet-owners together. But instead, this book delivered poorly-written tales of almost abusive levels of ignorance about animal raising, handling, and training. She describes keeping pets hated by her husband and daughter. She describes family members loving/protecting/not disciplining vicious attack animals. Every chapter--nearly every page--describes one of her animals urinating in the house because she could not control its behavior. It is this type of educated-yet-ignorant person who should not be allowed to have dogs unless they complete a 6 month internship with the monks of New Skete. Jeez, or at least read a book about dog behaivor before adopting."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is why shelters should interview people more carefully before allowing them to adopt.","review":"Despite her claims to be well informed, Emily Yoffe exhibits a total lack of enlightenment when it comes to the pet world. I don't know what dissapoints me more - the fact that Mrs. Yoffe is an incredibly poor pet owner, or that she decided to write a book about it. Her disdain for the animal world is appalling. Even the animals she claims to care for she speaks of in a distant voice, almost patronizing their very existance. If you believe these pets to be so beneath you, Mrs. Yoffe, then why do you allow them to share your home? Do the world a favor, stop taking in pets. You are not a suitable owner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Happy to remain ignorant?","review":"I'm a fan the writing Yoffe does for Slate, but she needs to either do some serious reading about animals (or, heck, just become a regular Animal Planet viewer) or give up writing about them. Writing about your own complete ignorance ought to be embarrassing for her, and certainly wasn't entertaining for me.I recently travelled to Asia and discovered that I knew very little about it, but I hope that I'd learn something about that part of the world before putting my limitations and irreverent assumptions in print. Yoffe did no such justice to the animal world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny","review":"I was eager to purchase this book based on the enthusiastic reviews both on Amazon and in print. Imagine my disappointment when I found that I could hardly finish the book! A dedicated owner of four intelligent, well-socialized, handsome and friendly Boston Terriers I was for one thing insulted by the malicious humor used by the author to discuss her encounters with Boston Terriers. Although she claims she always wanted one, she certainly did a job of demeaning their intelligence, socialization, looks (her daughter was afraid their eyes would fall out), etc. In fact, her comments about just about every other breed were malicious and I didn't enjoy the \\"killer dog\\" stories at all. If I had a relative with dogs like that I would never tell anyone. It was a struggle to keep reading and I never did find much I felt I could \\"laugh out loud\\" about. In fact, I found myself wondering if the author really liked dogs at all. Very, very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: Salon.com","review":"Salon.com and other ezine writters should be required to warn buyers with a special jacket label. This book was funny only because I was in the mood to read something light-hearted and comedic. But there's nothing special about this book. Obvious humor-writing formulas with the particular degree of humor that Salon writers are known for. The author swears every story is true, but there are just so many cases where its obvious a few yarns were spun. The retail worker who got tired of her desk?

Countless other films have shown this already: Lean on Me, Stand and Deliver, and Gruella again in Dangerous Minds, to name a few.. but so what?Perhaps it is because I am a sucker for inspirational films that give me hope in light of our human condition, but this film is an obvious winner to me.

I'm sure the true story upon which this disaster was based was indeed inspiring, but this movie was realized in such a leaden, ham-fisted and amateurish fashion, it took all of the self-discipline I could muster to keep watching through to the end. Barely literate high-school students, suddenly handed empty journal books, magically transform into brilliant writers. Character development, especially that of the school's faculty and administrators is limited to minimal cardboard stereotypes. Baffling subplots serve to make the film seem even more intolerably lengthy. Hillary Swank looks great, though.If you want to see a story about inner city education brilliantly and honestly portrayed, check out season 4 of HBO's \\"The Wire\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drama + Biography does not = Documentary","review":"Why does amazon list movies that are \\"based on a true story\\" as documentaries?

Theres fights everyday, students carry weapons, etc. She begins to learn the lives of her students and attempts to make a change so that her students can succeed.Excellent story. It portrays very nicely how these types of issues can lead to deadly violence and how the right education and support can help people succeed. Great acting. Great plot. Great directing.It does start to drag a little at the end and the ending is too perfect, but its minute details that dont keep this movie from being one of the best ive seen in a while. And surprisingly, it was associated with MTV films, who's films are mediocre at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth renting and owning!","review":"Yes, this is another movie about a gungho teacher inspiring underprivleged high schoolers, but how many other movies actually have an original plot? Shakespeare beat everybody to the punch, and some of his weren't original.The power of this movie is that it is true. Swank gives a stellar performance as does the actress who plays Ava. I felt the other English teachers are stereotyped and not realistic. The plot moved well, much better than the book.This is one of the best movies I have seen in a while. Since it does have so much educational merit, it is unfortunate that due to the street language most schools will not allow this one to be viewed. And, the movie would be totally unrealistic without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A+++++++++++++++++","review":"Strongly recommended for all people in a position to influence children or teenagers for the rest of their life for good.Inspirational for all teachers or teachers-to-be in the academic world & all parenting adults.

I work with juvenile youth who are incarcerated --as their teacher. Their opinion on why she was successful is \\"she didn't tell them to get over it, she told them to get above it.\\" They hit that nail on the head.

But instead what I heard was a poorly produced song. The singing was good but not that great either. It would have sounded better if they had went in a studio and recorded the song. I could hear wind, and her voice was fading in and out. Terrible. I suggest God Bless America for a better treat.

When she recorded it in 1991, it captivated a whole nation and beyond. The song was reisssued as a single in 2001, to reflect upon after 9/11. Although her version is magnificent from the 1991 Super Bowl, it just seems to be overdone. The song was issued previously for her 2000 Greatest Hits record, which still remains present. If you have her Greatest Hits record, this single isn't really worth buying. Still, Whitney Houston's voice is still a one of a kind melody, this song could always be bought as a backup for the free and the home of the brave."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good solid Version","review":"I Really enjoyed Whitney's Version.I still Prefer Marvin Gaye's Version the best overall.Whitney did put down a solid Version&a Must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings back a memory","review":"I bought this CD the first time I saw it. For years I had recalled hearing her sing the Star Spangled Banner live on TV during the Super Bowl, and wondered if I would ever hear her sing it again. The CD didn't have the impact of the original (how often do we remember a song sounding better than it actually did), but still is the best recorded version of our National Anthem that I have ever heard. I did hear R Kelly sing it live at an NBA game once, and if he has recorded that version, it would give this version a run for its money.

I fully expected a large number of differences between the two, so far i've been disappointed. There are a few advantages to the Ipaq and to Windows CE over Palm; seamless syncing with Outlook, a portable internet explorer that beats Palm's, the fact that with a portable version of Microsoft Money, i can keep my checkbook on my Ipaq; but with those exceptions, i'm doing the same things i was doing on the Palm. The ipaq does have some limitations too, the battery goes fairly fast, especially with the 16 bit color display. Windows CE, like all it's relative OS's, is a memory hog and i find i have to reset my unit more than i ever had to with my Palm. And at the price, it's difficult to rationalize the Ipaq over the Palm. I've spent the last few months thinking about it, if my Ipaq ever died, i'd more than likely get a replacement Palm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't leave home without it.","review":"I use to be the only person in the house able to program the VCR, but find I'm about the only one who cannot anymore...kinda left behind by technology.

However, what I've found is that if you can run windows, you already know most of what you need to know. All I can say after having it 2 weeks is that I won't leave home without it.

I don't play games or read books on it, so I don't use up the battery life that way. The worst thing is that unlike Palms you lose everything if your battery runs out!!!! Who ever heard of that. If you keep backing up to your computer you can restore it, but you really have to be on the ball with that, because if you don't too bad it's gone!

It starts off as a vapid pseudo-bio but the author never real gives us any authentic substance in the 300+ pages. He throws out names as if we are supposed to know defunct abstractions and pretentious writers and he skips the years 1932-1945 for some reason. About half way through the read he really let me down because he goes on to say one of the most incongruous and nonsensical things I have ever heard of, that Franco of Spain \\"was not really a fascist\\".

Baxter is innocent of Spanish, and this means that many of the documents related to Bunuel are...well, Spanish, to him.

I listened to it about 7 or 8 times the whole way through, and not one track really grabbed my attention... I understand that bands cannot, and should not, create the same thing every time around, but Engine Down, the guys who made a few of my favorite songs EVER, could have done more than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible ...","review":"This is the bands worst CD to date. It's total garbage. I wish I could get my money back. It sounds nothing like the previous three CD's. Instead, this sounds more like mainstream MTV garbage. I don't know what the two people who reviewed this CD before me was smoking, but it definately altered their senses for worse. If this is what progression sounds like to you, you can keep it. If nothing else they've progressed from best to worst in that order in reference to their CD's. They have been good live but if I even waste my time seeing them this time around, it's only because of These Arms Are Snakes or Minus The Bear.If I wanted something that sounded like Thursday, Lost Prophets, or Linkin Park, I would buy one of those CD's but I don't. So therefore, the band just lost a fan/customer.

His delicate, dangerous caricatures take on little eldritch lives of their own. His palette tends to the gray, brown, and olive, with delicate pen strokes for outlines and emphasis. A little story goes with each, and larger story ties them all together.There's a larger story still, outside of the story here. Glimpses of that create the spell that lifts the hairs at the nape of your neck - knowing that something is going horribly awry, but never knowing quite what. The basic idea is clever enough idea. The book as a whole, though, is a brilliant vehicle for that idea. It suffers from a few small flaws, but only a few and only small. I recommend this to anyone who loves the faerie (and not just the fey or fairy), or who loves fantasy art.//wiredweird"},{"rating":"2","title":"Goblins!","review":"This is a great book, exactly what I was looking for!

Maybe if it had taken place in a communist country as opposed to the US or another time period as opposed to the present day, it would have been more believable but that's a BIG maybe.

The topics they cover and the way the stories are told are meant, in my humble opinion, to question ourselves about what we do do under similiar circumstances. How would we treat our neighbors, those less fortunate, those that keep their hope despite the changes in their world(s), those that end up sacrificing their lives.

As a result, the whole world is thrown into chaos. \\"Blindness\\" is similar to \\"Day of the Triffids\\" except there are no triffids and the blindness is more gradual. The world has time to attempt a cure. Most of the movie deals with a group of people thrown into a quarantine (one of which still had their eyesight) and the resulting deteriorating conditions. None of the characters had any appeal. The plot was exceedingly slow at times and unnecessarily brutal at other times (as alluded to in other reviews).

Of course, to make it \\"look\\" like a movie, they had to throw in things like the crazy behaviour one would expect under these circumstances, but it's pathetic! I couldn't wait for it to be over, my husband and I kept looking at each other and laughing...

I was right. However, there are many flaws. The way they sing. On one song, it's all screaming like death metal (i hate death metal) and another song it's really clean. There needs to be some anger in between to really get the song into you. Another flaw is the guitars. My god..they could've at least tried to play it. In every song, you will hear the same chord repeated over and over. Super boring. I was falling asleep hearing this! Where's those catchy riffs (slipknot) and the clean to heavy parts (system of a down)? Sure this album is heavy, but heavy doesn't always qualify your album as one of the best. Think twice before getting this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it a lot","review":"I thought Kittie's sophmore release is a very good one. It's more melodic than their first release, \\"Spit\\", and the singer sings both very harsh (she can rank up there with death metal vocalists!) and very melodicly. Also, Mercedes (drums) uses the double bass drums a lot more often, and it adds a new heavyness to Kittie's music. While this album isn't quite as raw as their first, its still a very heavy album. I love how heavy and moody \\"What I Always Wanted\\" and \\"In Winter\\" are. Plus they get really heavy on the first two tracks. Their cover of Pink Floyd's \\"Run Like Hell\\" is very good actually, but its not as good as the original (I mean come on, who can beat Pink Floyd anyway?). I recommend this to any metal fan, or any new fan of Kittie's. Peace!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little beyond expectation","review":"This is my first Kittie album I bought (thought it would be Spit...). The songs I liked was \\"What I've Always Wanted\\", \\"Wolves\\", and \\"Safe\\". All of the tracks sound so distorted and rough, but that's what gives Kittie the 'energy'. What I really liked about this album was the variety of speed. Songs like \\"What I've Always Wanted\\" is a medium-paced song with slow vocal (both roaring and whining), and \\"Pink Lemonade\\" is a song with slow everything. I mean it's THAT slow. A song that can take only 2 minutes to sing takes 10 minutes instead. It also has a cover of the song \\"Run Like Hell\\" by Pink Floyd (which sounds ok).What I didn't like about this album is that it doesn't have any fast songs. And the riffs sound pretty much the same. They sould've used a variety of effects to create some different sounding songs (like LB). Also, Morgan is over-using her ability to 'roar'. She should 'whine' some more. And not all songs are good...A 4/5..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great cd","review":"Kittie has done it again. I don't think they're much heavier on this album, but it's a different kind of heavy. The band hasn't lost any of it's punch with the loss of a member. I'm not going to say that if you liked the first album then you'll like this one, because that's not true in all cases. I love both of their albums. I nearly wore \\"Spit\\" limp because I played it so much. And this one is equally worth wearing down, so go buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Purrfect","review":"Okay I admit I didn't think this album was as good as the first.But I did like it. And I do think they are pretty damn talented. I was really blown away when I saw them preform at the roxy here in Boston last month. I was totally blown away by their perfromance. The only regret I have is not seeing the band before Fallon left/got kicke out/whatever really happened! But I did hear rumors that Fallon is doing a solo album! woohoo!Otherwise I do think you think you should buy this album!

However ones that immediately caught my attention were In Winter, Run Like Hell, What I've Always Wanted and Safe. If you were to sample any Kittie album this should be the one. It's extremely melodious but not without being tremendously ferocious. -And if you do enjoy this I would highly recommend you listen to Otep's \\"Sevas Tra\\" album.

However there are some amazing songs on this album which balance out the ones I'm not too keen on. Definitely the best song is 'Safe' - its also one of my favourite songs of all time. A haunting piano refrain and Morgan's incredibe voice make this a gorgeous listen and if you can't hear the beauty of this song you must be deaf. 'Pink Lemonade' is also great, it went on for 11 minutes I think but it seemed no longer than 3 or 4. I don't understand why most people don't like 'Safe' and 'Pink Lemonade' because they demonstrate Kittie's versitality and also their talent - anyone with a penchant for power chords can make a good thrashy song with screaming but not many bands can hold your attention for 11 minutes straight with one song. Spit is more fun but this is definitely a more mature album with some outstanding songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS CD!!!!!!","review":"When I first heard Kittie..it was on a commericial for their \\"Spit\\" album..when I saw their video for \\"Charlotte\\" I was like...\\"sweeet!!\\" LOL!! :) \\"Oracle\\" is the 2nd album from Kittie...\\"Oracle\\" is more harder than \\"Spit\\"...(\\"Spit\\" is a great CD by the way!!!!!..so get it!!)...some great tracks on \\"Oracle\\" is \\"Mouthful Of Poison\\", \\"In Winter\\", \\"Pain\\", \\"Safe\\", \\"No Name\\" and of course \\"What I Always Wanted\\"...I don't know why people think \\"Oracle\\" isn't a great CD..Kittie has matured their \\"sound\\" and themselves..which is sweet!! but if u like metal music and u like Kittie's music..then get their CD's...:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as 'raw' as there debut cd 'Spit' but it's good!","review":"Kittie is back with there 2nd Cd 'Oracle' It is a good Cd Morgan is rocking harder on this Cd then with 'Spit' yet I only gave it 4 stars cuz some of the songs sound the same and it does not have the 'raw' sound that 'spit' had and I enjoyed that sound. They did a good cover of Pink Floyd's Song 'Run Like Hell' And the song 'Safe' is also good,It gives people the change of hearing Morgan's Singing Voice (not her Screaming Voice) If you are a Kittie Fan you will enjoy this Cd if not,I recomend getting there Debut cd \\"SPIT\\" (then give this one a try)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy","review":"From the first track to the last, all this band exemplifies is heavy, heart-grinding metal.

But Oracle is amazing I mean I personally would never thought Kittie would make anything like this after hearing their first album. This oringinal,poetic and the best Black Metal with Death Metal screams to make this album brilliant. I'm sure your thinking right now, \\"there talking about Kittie?\\" This album is somthing you must expirence. Kittie has matured and headed for a better direction.

The other just screams incoherantly. Who would you choose to front the band? I would choose the first one. Kittie chose the second at least on this album which was a big mistake, in my opinion. There's really only a couple of good songs, \\"In Winter\\" is the best and \\"What I Alway's Wanted\\" is also pretty good but it sounds alot like \\"In Winter\\". These are the songs the good singer sings on. I think Kittie are talented musicians, very heavy! But I think they'd have some success if they put their good singer up front and saved they screaming, growler for an occasional chorus or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slipknot with girls?","review":"That's basically what they sound like. Which is a pity because when the lead singer actually sings properly - instead of screaming as though she's having a particularly painful orgasm - she's actually got a pretty good voice.

Hopefully they can remedy the faults in their next attempt and bring them back to the brillance of their first album. Don't bother with this album unless you are a fanatic, and even then you will probably still be disappointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but Spit was better.","review":"I'm really glad that Kittie produced another album, but I think that Spit had much better songs. There was too much screaming I thought.

Spit was repetitive, but at least they sang, instead of trying to scream like some cheap death-metal knockoff. the drumlines which i enjoyed in Spit have been dumbed down as well, and are pretty much percussive mirrors of the music itself, rather than the counterlines that they had earlier. perhaps other people will like them, but after four years, i find Kittie to be a major disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Really As good as Spit","review":"I got both of Kittie's Cds for Christmas and after lisening to both virtually all the way through I fell in love with Spit (they're debut album) and only really liked two songs I really liked off the album where Run Like Hell and What I Always Wanted otherwise, it's just a bunch a screaming girls. They really needed Fallon Bowman or another bassist otherwise this isn't worth getting. Morgan or Talena's voice (I don't know which one screams)gives me a headache. The last song on the album is extremaly annoying to sit through because it's about 10 minutes last words: Buy Spit instead unless you want a headache."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Better Than Spit","review":"I have been a Kittie fan since the very beginning.

My opinion about their first album still stands, but this album is MUCH more refined than that one. It's more mature and varied offering from this great band. There's furious songs on here like Oracle, Mouthful of Posion, What I've always wanted, then there are melancholy songs like Safe, and In winter.There's even an 11 minute DOOM song???

The column A strategy is very useful and how to change it but the book suggests that there is only one way to sell which reduces the salesperson's credibility and natural flow.If you are looking for a strategy book Strategic Selling is great and covers the many different players in a deal.

I know so many people who are such huge fans of this band, and I can't figure out why anybody would want to listen to these guys because their music is so dull. Matt Mayes and El Torpedo is a band that you can just take their record and throw it in the garbage.There is only one reason why this band is popular and that's because of the Canadian content regulations the government imposed on the Canadian media back in the '70s. Matt Mays is one of those artists who gets played to death on Canadian radio, not for his talent, but to help the radio station meet its \\"35% Canadian content\\" requirements. Matt, all I can say to you is be thankful you come from a country where local music is mandatory, otherwise your career in music would have gone nowhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome, cheap decanter","review":"for everyday use.

Money wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ingredients changed","review":"I used to love this product. It was more of a leave in conditioner (they called it a moisture supplement) that gave my hair needed moisture without any greasiness, AND for the most part the ingredients were no cause for concern. I just reordered the product and was VERY disappointed to see that it is now called a 'curl booster and volumizer' and the ingredients read like all the other chemical laden products I was trying to get away from. I was worried this was going to happen. A respectable ingredient list always seems just out of grasp... Sigh. I still gave it a try, and it just makes my hair feel heavy, not greasy, just heavy and not moisturized at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want to like Deva but they just don't work for me","review":"I love the ethos of this company.

I am a solid 3B and i found that this made my hair really greasy looking even though it didn't feel greasy to the touch. In fact the ends felt dry. I tried every possible combination or product and amount and it just wasn't working. for the people I have seen this product work really well on is girls with wavy hair that want to work it into curl. then it is great but if you already have big curls it is just too heavy and pulls it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please keep characters straight!","review":"I see by reading another review that I'm not the only one that wondered what happened to a character in the story.

I realize it's an action book... but it went a little to far. I mean, yeah, Michael Murphey is pretty amazing but very unrealistic. He's too good to be true- which is perhaps the authors intent- but he's stretched it to the max.Although there is plenty of adventure in this book, I get the feeling Tim LaHaye is simply writing marketing more books. The ending was completely awful- a total cliff hanger and major marketing scam so you HAVE to buy the next book to even know if SOMEONE lives! Crazy. Ridiculous. I have a feeling this is going to turn into the next \\"Left Behind\\" series with 10+ books and loot galore. I'm not buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Europa Preach-To-Me","review":"Though I am not done, I am already bored and annoyed to death. I anxiously bought this book, hoping it would be okay. Every other line contains some sort of preaching from LaHaye and he puts in stereotypes about terrorists. What is he thinking. Preaching on every page...I know LaHaye's a Christian preacher, but this is taking it to the extreme. While trying to ignore the preaching, the plot is putting me to sleep. I would read some of Douglas Preston's and Lincoln Child's books instead. Try Brimstone, Dance of Death, and Relic and Reliquary. Those are real authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"You might want to skip this one...","review":"Europa Conspiracy is, first and foremost, nowhere near as fast-paced as Babylon Rising or even The Secret on Ararat. I was terminally disappointed with this installment from beginning to end. Even as a Christian woman, I found it too preachy, and I felt as if Tim LaHaye \\"dumbed down\\" a lot of the Biblical and historical references/explanations in hopes of attracting a more diverse age group. It also seemed as if he was including very adolescent-sounding dialogue and these bad explanations as fillers to make the book longer, while leaving out the action that caught my attention in the first two books of the series. At this point, the only reason I will continue reading this series is because of the cliffhanger at the end of the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"So, So","review":"Having read the first two in the series, I had hoped the author would learn how to write an ending. Each of the books had about the same type of ending. Good build-up until the end. It seems like he was trying to finish the book so he could start writing the next book.

I loved the first book, the second was not nearly as meaty, and this one is even less so. It seemed it was quickly written, and very much on a surface level. And the worst part was when they did not even catch a huge error in the storyline...there was a character that almost died. They were all so happy he did not die, then all of a sudden, Micheal was talking about what a shame his death was...what is up with that?? For the price I paid, that was just unacceptable, and totally sloppy. I do not like to think money is behind the quick writing, but...hmmm... The only good parts were the stories from the Bible itself...those were great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment!","review":"Like many others, I am very disappointed in this book. The storyline seems rushed, and the dialogue is ponderous. I found myself skipping pages of text obviously fabricated to inform the reader of some interesting facts presented in very boring ways. The conversations between Murphy and Bingham are the worst; suddenly Bingham seems unclear about his profession and his own faith. I missed the usual depth of biblical prophecy and scholarship that I enjoy the most in LaHaye's work. The best parts of the book are the Daniel flashbacks, but even they seem to be jumbled at times. And it seemed pretty clear to me that Isis became a Christian in the last book, but in this one she's still undecided. The last straw for me was the sketchy fate of Bingham--did he miraculously survive with the evidence of their find (for the first time in the series) and fly home to his family, or was he killed?

The battery life of my ipaq is about 3 hours, which is not enough for my needs. I'm also having problems with my old document files, which I can not delete until the unit is syncronized to my PC.

Maybe 4-6 hours in the standby mode while not in use and at best 1-2 hours when on. It must stay in the charger to be any good at all. Also, with no backup battery to hold data, a long day or trip is out of the question unless you can charge in route.

The customer service. They apparently lost my rebate information and refuse to discuss the matter. This isn't first time that I've heard of thtis happening.

But instead, all it does is keep track of my appointments at work. It freezes up often while using it and the battery lasts only a couple of hours on low power. It's absolutely rediculous.

This is really a stupid design flaw.- Problems with trying to synchronize with multiple computers using different types of cradles (USB vs. serial). When going from one to the other, more often than not doesn't recognize the device. Which means I have to do a soft reset to get it to work.- Trying to get Compaq to respond is like pulling teeth, painful and leaves you with a loss.Overall, if I had to do it over again, I'd buy the new Casio which is what I plan on doing in a few months anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good build, good sound quality but....","review":"Great sound and good looks.

It is true that this book covers everything you need to know. However, the trick is not to get lost in their ridiculously long explanations that are repeated over and over and over each chapter. Seriously, this book could be condensed to half the size. Further, they mention a couple sentences about a concept and then quit and say \\"more on this to come later\\". They probably do that about a thousand times. Truthfully, i just got annoyed by reading the book. It is obnoxious and everything, from their graphs to their flow charts, is made to sound more complicated that it has to be and is encoded in erroneous/needless fluff.

If you want to learn all the important points and skip the garbage that isn't important at all, like how pH monitors work, then buy the pocket version of this book.

There may not be as much images as you'd find in, say, Fox's Human Physiology (check out my review there), but for one thing, this is the comprehensive tome of knowledge if you want to know even the details, nuts, and bolts behind physiology.And even if you aren't really trying to teach yourself physiology or do this for fun, it always makes a great addition to the bookshelf of any physician or bioengineer.

It begins with the volcanic destruction of St. Pierre in 1902, and concludes with the Guatamalen earthquake of 1976. The chapters are informative and accurate, giving us a fascinating look at a few unfortunate spots on the globe. Each chapter is well illustrated with both color and black and white photographs, some of which have been tinted to good effect. Each catastrophe is covered in only a few pages. Enough to help the reader decide if he wants to research some more fully.Why are British books like this one so good? I have noticed that British publications are usually more creative and interesting than American ones. Perhaps it is because they look at subjects from a global perspective. Or maybe it is that the authors seek to educate their readers as well as entertain them. Whatever the reason, it is hoped there will be more such books to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and seemingly endless","review":"This book was recommed to me in an online discussion group for classics, so I ordered it and looked forward to reading it.

There are endless descriptions of what various members of the Fairchild family think and do during a long hot week.

I applied many of the tips in my communicating with men I worked with and the man I was involved with. I found myself coddling these men. I found that I was walking on pins and needles around these men, because I was trying to be empathetic towards their needs and less about mine. I then read many of Patricia Evans' books (e.g. The Verbally Abusive Relationship, etc.) and found out that I worked for and was involved with verbally abusive men. John Gray's tips and suggestions just made the verbal abuser's behavior towards me even worse. I picked up the audio book at the library just recently and listened to it.

The alien life depicted is both plausible and at the very edge of the possible. Depictions of alien life is so often stereotypical (e.g., Star Treks green girls and pointy ears) as it is hard to create anew while still being realistic and within the bounds of Science.

Many have delayed dialysis from 5-12 years. They all had to struggle with their personal physician and with their local nephrologists, many of whom do not believe that people will change their diet to avoid dialysis. Dr. Walser maintained a lonely struggle in this country to get others nephrologists to push a strategy that had a 2.5% death rate (unrelated to the diet) vs. a 24% per year death rate for patients on dialysis.This book presents a cheaper and far superior lifestyle as opposed to the costs of dialysis and ultimately transplantation (for those who are not too old). The real question, which Dr. Walser does not address in this book, is why aren't other physicians, especially primary care physicians, recommending this approach as a first line response for the ever increasing number of Americans with kidney disease? The strategy really does work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for Those with Kidney Disease","review":"This book is the best out there on Kidney Disease and how to manage it.

Some doctors will advise you about the low protein diet, but none mention the very low protein diet, which is evidently necessary.

Though tests have showed that this procedure may not be as helpful as Dr. Walser suggests, my nephrologist told me that I should be mindful of protein intake but not go overboard with trying to control it. He suggested perhaps 3-4 ounzes of meat, preferably chicken, turkey or fish a day.Dr. Walser's admonitions to take medication to control BP and cholesterol can also help other conditions.

Buy The Prince Instead.","review":"When I say not to buy this book, it's not because there's anything inherently wrong with it. Prince of Mercenaries is actually a great book. It's just that its content has been collected in a more complete edition. The first two books in Pournelle's novels of John Christian Falkenberg were The Mercenary, followed by West of Honor. Those two books were eventually stitched together into Falkenberg's Legion, which is now considered the first book in the series. There were three later books, Prince of Mercenaries, Go Tell the Spartans, and Prince of Spartans. The last two books were co-written with S.M. Stirling; all four were eventually collected as The Prince. Thus my advice, if you want to read Pournelle/Stirling's tales of John Christian Falkenberg - and you should, they're some of the best military SF ever written - pass on the individual books and buy The Prince instead, to have the complete series in one volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for Ortho Residents","review":"This is a great book for 1st year Orthodontic Residents.

This was one of her more notable TV appearances, which included turns on THE TWILIGHT ZONE, ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS, PERRY MASON, GUNSMOKE and several others. With \\"girl-next-door\\" innocent prettiness, Love was perfect for the Sci-Fi genere with wide, expressive, almost-other worldly eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Excelent!!!!","review":"i've got this mobile suit a couple of weeks ago, and i was a little scared because it's in japanese and all, but the instructions are very easy to follow and straightforward. The only thing about it it's that if you want to be 100% original like in the movie, you've got to paint it(sold separately), and put the seals that come in the package, that to this day i don't know how to use them. but still it's great fun building it, i doesn't take a lot of time, and sometimes you have to use ingenuity, because the instructions tells you one thing in the real world it's the other way around, so it's challenging as well, have fun whit the greatest mobile suit ever, THE SAZABI, i know i did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here Come the Aliens","review":"This is a great book that will leave young kids laughing uncontrollably!

Join aliens of all different sizes as they travel millions of miles to seize hold of the earth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Easy","review":"While this book was helpful in providing the areas you needed to know for the exam (the website for the exam provides that information for free), there is only one practice test and it is very simple - especially in comparison to the questions covered on the real exam. The study techniques were not helpful as I'd hope that whomever is taking this exam would know the strategies to taking a multiple choice mathematics test. I was very disappointed with this book. It did little in helping me to practice for the test. I would have liked to have more practice problems as they would help show how certain concepts will be asked so you can practice at breaking down the material and practice with the timing. If you want to practice completing the exam in a timely fashion, this book does not help you b/c once you take the sample test, when you take it again, of course your time will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"The problems presented in this study guide are not as difficult as the ones you'll do on the math content knowledge test. For a practice test I'd just use the free one provided by the ets website rather than waste money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"If you are preparing for the mathematics content knowledge assessment test, I would not recommend purchasing this book. It does not really give you any more information concerning study topics than the free literature on the website. The actual test seemed a lot more difficult than the book's practice test, which could give you a false sense of confidence and cause insufficient time management. Also, the study tips aren't anything you've never seen before. Finally, if you do purchase this book, at least you can sell it and get some of your money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother.","review":"This study guide was so misleading! Sure if you can answer the study guide questions with no problem you must be doing pretty good....not in this case, the actual exam was so much harder than the study guide lead on. I was very disappointed with it and what a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm...the others are right, probably not worth the cost","review":"The test in this book is pretty simple compared with the real thing...this is simply echoing the other reviewers, I know, but the book wasn't published before I purchased it or I may not have purchased it either. One suggestion, though: in studying for this test, review everything the test provider tells you to study, but do it in far more depth than any practice test they give you. It will be worth the time, effort, and especially the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Definitely not worth the money. The TAAG available on the ETS website as well as the free test content information is just as good as this book. The real test is much harder than the practice test."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea - terrible execution","review":"The idea of the structure of this book is great: teach visual basic by having the reader perform tasks. Each task is small enough that it can be described in 7 or less steps (2 pages). Illustrate the steps of the tasks with screen shots.However, the execution of the book is bad to poor. Many times the tasks are not tasks but just information presented as tasks. There are many editorial errors (spelling errors, inconsistencies between text and screen shots, inconsistencies between steps in a task) that make it hard to execute the tasks (I guess you could argue that teachs you debugging...). Maybe future editions of the book will be cleaned up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relativism","review":"Am extremely grateful for the time the author put into making this an outstanding book. A book of substance that engages the reader, towards a proactive paradigm evaluation of their own interaction with their own thinking involving how much society determines how we (Christians) perceive life and Holy Scripture and how followers of Jesus can make that decisive change brought on by having an introspective life style change in thought and external interaction in society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keeps dropping the connection","review":"When I first bought this XJack card, I thought that it was a great idea; I could collapse it so that I wouldn't have to eject the card when putting my laptop away. However, I have used it in several different environments with several different APs and it will drop the connection every once and awhile.Right now I'm sitting about 80 feet away from the access point and have the speed turned down to 1Mbps and it still drops the connection every couple of minutes.

This book was assigned reading for a programming language course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Goody From A Fun Series","review":"This later entry in the Modesty & Willie saga really delivers-- the second half is almost all action, and the plot is never too kooky to spur active disbelief.

Tried Centric because rotors were replaced with Centric too. So far so good the irritating squeal is gone."},{"rating":"2","title":"truly a masterpiece","review":"I read this book about a year or so ago and the memory of it still burns brightly in my mind. From the cunning layout of the plot to the kind of obvious but breathtaking end this book has kept me wishing for more every time I finish a chapter. The cataclysmic struggle between Drizzt\`s conscience and the dark primal instinct of the hunter rivals even the most famous books ever written throughout all time. In my opinion, this should be made either a video game or a movie, it would excell at both.I salute you Salvatore! To many more books of the life that has captured so many in its thrall."},{"rating":"2","title":"The continuation of a great trilogy","review":"This was another great piece of work from one of my personal favorite authors. This is a little more of an adventure book than the first when Drizzt fights all of the evil denizens of the Underdark. The ending was absolutely brilliant with a Star Wars like ending. Please continue the brilliant work Mr. Salvatore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best authors of today","review":"I have been a fan for years. The drizzt novels are some of the best books I've had the pleasure of reading. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Appears to continue to a good series.","review":"Many books in the series. Read the first two. Good adventure. Looking forward for more. Go ahead and buy. Worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Though this book was not the best in the DE Trilogy, the end sure made up for the rest. The fight against Zaknafein and Drizzt was briliant.

The Underdark is such a strange and exciting place, and Drizzt's adventures through it are a lot of fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeping the Legend Alive","review":"This was another of Salvatores great works.You HAVE to read homeland first, considering the plotline is indecipherable without having read it. The only problem is the beginning is too slow. After that, the magic begins.The re-incarnation of Zak was a memorable event for me, because i think Drizzt having to face his past was an EXCELLENT thing to do. The way the showdown is set up is pretty cool too. The end of this one sets an extremely new tone for the conclusion as well. All in all, i thought this was a great continuation for the trilogy. No Homeland , but still a masterpeice to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another outstanding Drizzt Do'Urden book","review":"Mr. Salvatore continues to impress me with his vivid characterization and fast paced action. A small dose of philosophy rounds it out nicely. This book was a page turner...just two nights of reading to get through. All of the hours enjoyable. A must read for Salvatore fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"One star is too much for this book. It is no where near as interesting as Homeland. The plot is linear, predictable and trite.Drizzt's new friends in this book are weakly developed leaving the reading feeling very undetached from the entire story. I would have tossed this book in the garbage a 1/4 of the way through but I was unfortunatly stuck on a plane with nothing else to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!!!","review":"Definitely a great fantasy epic and one of my personal favorites, The Dark Elf Trilogy-Homeland, Exile, and Sojourn, brings to life the story of a good hearted dark elf ranger named Drizzt Do'Urden and his adventures in the Underdark Drow city of Menzoberranzan in the World of Faerun. The books are so incredibly well written that the reader feels that they have been transported to another universe and are actually present among the characters, seeing what they see, feeling what they feel, sensing what they sense. RA Salvatore has truly outdone himself and has presented us with a masterpiece of literature the likes of which we have seen only in JRR Tolkien's work and in authors Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman's Dragonlance Chronicles and Legends trilogies. Duty, honor, bravery, magic, and swordfights are all about. A great trilogy indeed and a \\"must read\\" along with RA Salvatore's The Icewind Dale Trilogy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A magical and great read","review":"An amazing book, it offers a ample amount of magic and savage fantasy with just enough darkness to punctuate the savage world of the drow and the murderous intents of the surrounding creatures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read!","review":"I've already reviewed the first book, so I might as well review the second. It was almost as good as the first, but still deserving of four stars. I missed the interaction with the other drow, and really hope in future books there are some conclusions to what happened to all of them. I gave it four stars because 5 is genius level and I've only come across a couple of those. I really hope my daughter will one day read this book, and we can talk about it together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Performed well but leaked, manufacturer not responsive","review":"Had high hopes for these, as many people on VTXOA forum praised them (and the 412s).

Few know what an accomplished artist Nimoy really is. I first discovered his bent for poetry when I was in high school during the mid-70s and bought several for my mom for her birthday, as she enjoyed reading poetry from time to time. Nimoy's verbiage creates timeless visions in one's mind about the love of one person for another. I've tried to learn his style of writing, but have come to just sit back and enjoy reading the master's work instead. Now, after 30 years, I've discovered another poem series Nimoy has produced, from the time I first learned of his other talents, and couldn't wait to acquire it. I was not disappointed.

Wrong! I received the same 1995 book and when I complained to Amazon they sent me a replacement. Another 1995 book. While the information in the book appears good, it's describing conditions over 10 years old which could be a lifetime for a trout stream. The Clark Fork, for example, is described as \\"teetering between two possible futures-magnificence and ruin.\\" My online research has indicated the Clark Fork has continued to recover nicely from the heavy metal runoff from the mining but if this book were my only guide I would be skeptical about including it as a destination for my trip.If this book were up to date I would give it at least 4 stars.

He reports that with the clear and well-organized information in this book, he now can engage his neurologist in intelligent questions and conversations.

Here he shares his adventures with each tale a short story in itself with nothing to connect them. The writing is good and humorous and the author rather likeable. The problem with this book is that I found some parts interesting and others dull and uneventful. The spectrum covered is rather wide and lacks consistency. On the plus side, you can pick it up at a whim, choose a chapter and not worry about the previous one as it has no bearing on the one that you are reading.

However, I've just finished making the Arroz con Pollo recipe in this book, and I'm so annoyed that I had to write. The cookbook really could've used more careful editing. The rice to liquid ratio was so off that the rice ended up a gloppy mess. I know I shouldn't have followed the recipe blindly, since if I had stopped to think about it for a second, I would've realized that there was no way that the proportions were correct, especially when compared with the Arroz con Pollo recipe on Epicurious.com. What's even more frustrating is that the flavors of the dish were excellent, and the dish had the potential to be outstanding.

The ingredient lists are also brief and they are ingredients I either have in my cupboard or I know where to get them. Another thing that sold me on this book is the amount of pictures. I love seeing what the final product looks like. The laid-back style and informal narration of the book helps, too.

I find his book a reflection of who he is as a person, a professional, and as a chef. Years ago, he impressed me with his tenacity for food. His book, the simple but so delicious recipes, and his TV personality are only a reflection of who he is. His book is written in an interesting style, and the recipes are easy to follow. He makes cooking not simply a chore or a pleasure, but a passion.I recommend this recipe book as one that should be placed in every kitchen to someone who loves the taste, delicacy and joy of food.Barbie Perkins-Cooper, Author, Screenwriter and Playwright"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware Tyler fans: Food 911 or How To Boil Water this is not","review":"After reading these reviews and seeing that the title was \\"Real Kitchen\\" I assumed that this book would be more like Tyler's shows and full of his easy style of just whipping stuff up.

All the meals my wife exclaimed were better than recent outings to some of the local restaurants.Tyler makes things easy and the Ingredients are most things out of an oridinary kitchen. You don't have to go to some exotic grocer to prepare one of his great dishes.Tyler is a genious, as most of his recipes are different takes on recipes that have been around forever. He puts his own sense into the proportions of ingredents and VIOLA! you have an amazing tasting dish that is much better than some of the old recipes you use to cook over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome recipes & beautiful book","review":"I am in love with this book!

The arm bands are not adjustable but are rather stiff. I haven't had this device long enough to comment on the sturdiness. However, it seems to be well made. I think it was worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"The first day I had this product, I used it for about 20 min. when I had to stop due to the smell of burning rubber. This is the smell of the internal seals of the pneumatic tubes beginning to melt. The device simply cannot withstand 20 minutes of use due to heating of the tubes. After that I kept my workouts to only 15 minutes. This is not enough for a cardio workout, but as part of bigger routine it's ok. After 2 weeks of using it 2-3 times each week for 15 minutes, the step counter/timer broke. So I began timing my workout with the clock. Now after less than 3 months of use, the cable is so stretched out and the resistance so low that it is ready for the dumpster. I weight 155 lbs, so I'm well below the maximum weight for this unit. Denise should be ashamed of herself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke in six weeks","review":"My wife and I used this stepper for about six weeks before it broke. The unit has a steel cable that controls tension--the cable snapped. We had used it for about twenty minutes every other day, and we both weigh under 200 pounds. To make matters worse, there are apparently no replacement parts available for the unit. In light of that, I would rate the durability and value of this stepper as poor, and I would not recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works OK...but not nearly as well as hoped","review":"I ordered this to replace a similar version made by Sharper Image that I used to own, but this bears little resemblance other than the motion of stepping up and down. The tension control continuously needs tightening, which disrupts my \\"workout\\". As well, if you want some serious stepping action, this just doesn't offer enough resistance...no matter how much you tighten the knob. This is probably best suited for someone who only wants light aerobic exercise and doesn't like a hard and heavy workout, who also doesn't mind stopping every 5 to 10 minutes to adjust the knob...being careful not to touch the assembly underneath that gets hot from use. Wouldn't buy again, but can't afford to replace it and it's to heavy to return, so I'm keeping it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I thought this was a great little stepper for about 2 months and then it began to make a little snapping sound. Tonight it made a big snapping sound and crashed. It lasted a total of about 3 months which makes it not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I purchased this stepper for my small home gym I am in the process of putting together; I have no problem with the stepper, but it comes with a VCR tape not a DVD. Like most people, I no longer own a VCR player.

Then it is so hard to keep going, never mind using the arm toners. I thought I would get used to it and tried it every day for two weeks, but it was just TOO HARD to use. My husband tried adjusting the tension also and it couldn't get it to loosen up either.

Then about three days later I started having another problem with the monitor.... on the left side of the screen there would be a wave pattern every now and then, which would be enough to give you a headache and make you dizzy. I thought I would give CTX a chance because I heard a few good things about them.... boy did I make a mistake! It's back to NEC Multisync Diamondtron's and Sony Trinitrons only for me.

After 7 months and no progress, my husband purchased this product after reading many positive reviews. I started using lady-comp the week following christmas 2011. I followed all the instructions: entered 3 months of menstral history(valuable info to store into lady comp), used the alarm clock each morning, took my temperature and waited till lady comp said I was fertlie.

(Admit it - it happens to all of us.)There have been several crazy cycles over the last 20 months where for whatever reason ovulation was delayed... Knowing my own limitations - I'm sure that if I had still been making my own fertility charts I would be expecting our next child by now. :) No problems with LC. We now use this machine with complete confidence."},{"rating":"2","title":"If more people know about it, would bankrupt big pharma.","review":"Well, not really. Big pharma has plenty of other chemicals to push onto the general public. However, in an ideal world this device would kill the chemical birth control business. My wife and I have been using it for about 6 years. While using it we have had 2 semi-planned pregnancies--the first after 3 years of use, and the second after another 2 years. Both pregnancies occurred on yellow-light days. So this device really is very accurate! The only frustration we've had is the user interface, which is hard to use.I'm sure the reason more people don't invest in fertility monitors (aside from not knowing about them) is because they just don't trust the marketing materials. Well, we're just regular people whose lives depend in a way on the effectiveness of this birth control method, and we can testify that it really works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best things I've EVER bought!","review":"I actually use the pearly, the lady comps' less expensive little sister! But my sister bought a lady comp after I got my pearly. (She is still considering having more children and liked the idea of more features.) We both love our respective products. I've used my pearly for 8 months successfully and she's used the lady comp for 6 months with no unwanted pregnacy. If I had been educated enough to know products like this existed I'd have never took risks with the pill or depo shots! If you can follow a red/green light system faithfully, don't hesitate. Buy one and never look back. It is so freeing! So many women right now are poisoning their systems with all the junk on the market because they just don't know any better.Yes, these things are expensive and yes, you can probably manually do this but my pearly is so convenient and simple to use I'd spend the money all over again.

I really wanted to know something about the migration of (soft- and hardware) systems and the possibilities to deal with the many accompanying problems.What I got was a loose assortment of information we could read over the past decades in our trade magazines. Besides the misleading title, I also could not find an added value in the contents: no special selection or special assessments of the topics. Just contents thrown at the reader.Even many figures were just copied. What was obviously before in color is now in a blurred gray style. With the consequence that some legends can not be properly mapped to the figure elements.I do still consider upgrades and migrations an important topic and would be thankful for a good book on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I was very disappointed with this novel.

Mr. Fiorella concentrates on the most popular brand to be carried in Viet Nam, or any war for that matter, the Zippo. Who would think that a niche area of militaria collecting could be so broad with so many variations? From the slim Zippo to the cut-down variety, to Barcroft table models; those engraved in English, or in Vietnamese, carried by Americans, ARVN's, Cambodians, Koreans; Army, Navy varieties and Marines, this author breezes through all of these areas in clear-cut chapters with plenty of example photos and archival images. One of the most interesting chapters is to be found in the beginning of the book, about a subject that is best tackled first: how do you identify knockoffs? This book is worth it for the photos alone and is soon to be a collector's item. The only book you will ever have to own for this hobby.NAC"},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect collectors book","review":"This book is perfect.

At the end of the day, you'll feel dirty and appreciably less human for struggling through this slight, self-congratulatory, sanctimonious diatribe.Wilson doesn't seem to appreciate that without the reviled subjects of her ire, she would have no means of articulating just how smart and cultured and hip she is.

I suppose I'm a bit picky about book lights, but I tend to find myself disappointed in the strength of the light (or lack thereof), the brightness of the light (or, again, lack thereof) and the way the clamp works (or doesn't work, in most cases). I was happily surprised to find that this light met and surpassed all of my criteria. I bought it for use with my Kindle and have found it to be absolutely perfect. I can clamp it to the Kindle itself, my Kindle cover, a pillow or just about anything else. I've also used it with both hardback and paperback books and found it just as useful in those situations. The light itself is quite bright, and is a purer, white light rather than one of those that casts a \\"yellowish\\" glow to whatever you're trying to read.I strongly recommend this light if you're looking for something versatile."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit of overkill-reading a book, not performing neurosurgery","review":"The good1. Lightweight even with the batteries in.2. Super flexible neck-positions smoothly and stays in position3. Bright light-reeeaaallly brightThe slightly annoying1. The light is so bright and disperses in such a wide cone it's annoying to a partner sharing a bed or a fellow passenger on a plane seated next to you.2. Not dinging the rating for this, but no doubt there will be people like me who purchased this for some kindle reading. It works beautifully with the e-ink but is (obviously) not compatible with the slots that come in some cases. Which is fine. It just clips to the cover instead.3. It's obvious from the picture, but this light is obviously not great for travel. It doesn't fold into anything more compact.It's still a great product for a fantastic, unbeatable price, but wow there is such a thing as too bright.

I also use it as a flash light at night when I'm trying not to disturb my baby. I would recommend it for new moms, university students who share a room or people travelling on planes.

It is only 6 months old and it is extremely unreliable. The light \\"shorts out\\" whenever I move it. It doesn't stay bright, is constantly dimming while I read. If I fool with it or knock it it may turn brighter or it may go off completely. It doesn't even turn when I use the on/off switch. It seems to have a mind of its own. Very inconsistent. I'm looking for a new light right now and wanted to get this review in to warn others not to buy this one.

It is very lightweight, which is a good feature, but the light became worthless. Not worth the shipping cost to return it. I think with these types of book lights, you get what you pay for. I'm willing to pay significantly more to get one that actually works, but haven't found it.Update: Amazon gave me a refund without having to ship the product back, which is appreciated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super bright... Maybe too much?","review":"I got this light for my wife, so that she could read her kindle in bed. It works great, but sometimes it is too bright and i could not go to bed.

I'm not at all disappointing but there are a few things I don't like that I want to point out:- Although the base is small, it's a little larger than I expected. It's not really that grippy so it tends to slip around a bit. It works ok on paperbacks.- The light is quite bright, which is great for reading of course! But there's also a pretty good chance of disturbing a bedmate- I've noticed that the light flickers sometimes. Haven't figured out exactly what it is yet. Might be when it's warming up or a sign the batteries should be replaced. But it ends up stabilizing.Overall a purchase that I am happy with!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect reading light","review":"After trying out quite a few different reading lights this is finally the one to keep.

I don't even want to be nice about it. The light it puts out is uneven and tiny. The bendy antennae never stays where you put it, and just wobbles all over. The actual clamp is too big to be useful, because with batteries it's too heavy and bends your book in half. You want to read books in the dark on the go, don't get this crappy thing. You're better off with a pet firefly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Kindle, and not great Q/C","review":"I purchased the Multi Flex to go with my new Kindle eBook. Amazon recommends a different model, the Ultraflex2 by Mighty Bright, but they were out of that and this was on sale. They look almost identical in the pictures, so I figured it would work.First problem- did not work out of the box. I tried multiple battery sets, it would not turn on. At least in my case, the quality control is lacking.Second problem- it will not clip on to the Kindle. Only the bottom of the clip has anti-skid rubber stuff. The top clip is just plastic with not much contact area. It probably is fine for clipping to a normal book, but it would not provide a stable hold on the plastic Kindle. I do not know if the Ultraflex works better, but will find out.My rating is based on the Multi-flex not meeting my specific needs, and not working at all out of the box. If you get one that works (it appears most folks do) and you are going to clip it to a normal book, it might be a fine choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke within a month","review":"The light worked fine for about a month. It is similar to the Mighty Bright lights. I didn't think it worked any better than the Mighty Bright lights we own, but it seemed to be fine. However, soon the on/off button broke off and it cannot be used at all. We were disappointed with the low quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good start...but not long lasting","review":"I bought this with high hopes based on the reviews but the 1 star ratings nightmares happened to me too! This light worked great for about a month. When I left for vacation I was looking forward to late nights reading a good book with a nice bright light. However, when I started using it regularly, it started flickering whenever I moved it. Sometimes it's bright and then the next moment there is barley a glimmer. I was very disappointed and now I'm stuck with it because it \\"died\\" right after the deadline for a full refund :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Crap From China","review":"I was so impressed by the other reviews that I bought two. Yes, the LED is bright and has a nice spectrum, but after only a couple hours of use, it started flickering and won't stay on. The switch is completely flaky, and has lots of wiggle. Even the slightest movement causes it flicker, and I have to adjust it continuously to get it to work. Sometimes it comes on really bright and nice, but usually it's dimmer (when it's not flickering). And BOTH of them are like this. The spring in the clip is weak, and the body is made of a cheap, brittle plastic. It's unfortunate that there are few other choices available. I'm going to spend the $24 to get one from Levenger and hope for the best. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fulcrum Muti-Flex LED Task light","review":"I bought this item for my daughter who is going on a 6 month internship in one of the national forest.

I used a light over my bed before that used a regular bulb and the heat often got too hot for being so close to my head (even though heat rises). I love the LED bulb concept and it is a bright light. The arm will NOT stay in place well though. Sad! I move it an inch and it moves BACK a half inch. So it's a constant adjusting and re-adjusting while I get it right where I want it.

This light is bright, covers plenty of page at once, is perfect for when you're trying not to bother anyone else, and is very versatile in its flexiblity. I've used it every night now for one year, and it is just now starting to have a harder time holding its \\"head\\" up.

This light works better than I had hoped for! After reading reviews about how bright it is, I was a little nervous that it would disturb my roommate. I decided to purchase it anyway, because I tend to need a good amount of light in order to read. I was pleasantly surprised when I turned this on. It glows like a mini spotlight! The more you lift the lamp in the air, the bigger its cast is, thus the brighter it shines. This is great for when I need a lot of light, and I discovered that bending the light close to its base and pointing down greatly reduces the light. It's bright when I need it to be, and subtle when I only need a little light."},{"rating":"2","title":"it works","review":"The light works very well with my kindle as well as other things.

It's only used a few times a week and only for a few minutes at a time. The one I used daily was great for the first month and then it progressively started becoming dimmer. It'd then fluctuate between being really dim and working properly. I'm not sure if it couldn't stand up to daily use or if I just got a dud.

I just think that the switch is not well built."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good reading light","review":"Pros: lightweight, sturdy, lasts a long time, light is still bright enough to read with when batteries are lowCons: too bright for a reading light when batteries on full chargeThe third different model I've used and its great"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Light","review":"This little guy puts out a lot of light (compared to other book lights). I use it for a desk lamp. Most people would consider it too dim for a desk lamp, but it provides enough light for me to move around my room without bothering my roommates while they sleep. The only drawback is it's a little heavy for a book light but that mainly comes form the AAA batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good light","review":"It's a shame this little thing uses 3 AAA batteries, I was suprised. But the light output is pretty good in complete darkness, it gives a natural light look to it. I am going to use it for my soldering to add extra light to it, because my sister said she can't read her books like that. She is used to the yellow sceptrum lights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fulcrum multiflex LED Task Light","review":"It is about what you would expect from a booklight. The biggest concern was it was a bit more expensive than it could be. Takes too many batteries for such a little light. Booklights never last long so my suggestion is never pay more than you need - get the cheaper ones at the discount mega-stores and use it until it goes. Apparently, like it or not, we have become a society where things of quality no longer exist - just buy and toss."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was not what I was looking for.","review":"I needed a small light for my computer so I could work at night without disturbing my husband (having lights on). I was so disappointed to see how small this light was and to see that it did not put out very much light - I couldn't even see the keyboard to type. This was not what I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looked great - but broke in shipping","review":"The title of my review pretty much says it all. It was broken in the package when i recieved it. The switch that turned it off and on had broken off and the light was useless. I was kinda bummed - b/c all the other reviews were so great."},{"rating":"1","title":"not much of a light","review":"This may work for a very specific purpose but for general lighting it's not very practical. It's a weak light that is mounted with a clip, so you have to have something to clip it to. The on-off switch is not easy to find, presumably to protect it from being broken."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great and good price","review":"Use this light as a little night light for my 3 year old son. It gives him enough light to feel safe in his own bed. The batteries seem to die pretty quickly though. For the price, you cant ask for more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Multi-Flex LED light","review":"Light-weight, extremely flexible, big enough to fit on big books but not too big to be used on small/paperback books. Light source is bright and wide. Very pleased with this product"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fulcrum Multi Flex LED Book Light","review":"This reading light was just what I was looking for. I didn't think it was too heavy at all. Maybe because I always read hard cover books. I also use it for the bedtime books I read my girls. It's perfect for even the biggest picture books. Keep in mind though. If you're reading a book with high gloss pages that will reflect light it'll be bright enough to wake up your spouse. My only suggestion would be to have a dimmer setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for insomniacs","review":"I suffer from chronic insomnia and consider this booklight to be something of a godsent. When I wake up in the wee hours, instead of stressing out about disrupting the sleep of my partner, I curl up in a small corner with my booklight. The Fulcrum illuminates my magazine pages with a steady diffused glow that's not quite too bright or too dim either. One drawback is how the light is tinged with a cold blueish hue (think fluorescent blue) but I've been told this is a feature of most LED lighting devices. I carry this light with me everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Light for Reading","review":"This is a good light that works and I recommend it. Rather than wasting energy on a side light or turning on the light for an entire room, this little book light does the job. I would also recommend getting re-chargable batteries so that you do not have to continually buy batteries.The only slight issue is that sometimes you need to adjust the light to illuminate some areas of the book (primarily the corners or the very bottom of the page). But otherwise a great book light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This light is perfect for covering the entire page. It works well with both hardcover books and paperbacks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine","review":"I bought both this and the Mighty Bright to test them out. Both illuminate both pages of a medium to large size book. The Mighty Bright has a switch to use only one LED which can save on battery life. The brightness seems about the same on both (with the Mighty Bright set on high). The light on the Fulcrum comes out in a narrower range at the top (the shape of the LED beam is slightly triangular) so it might leave the top corners of very large books unlit. Though it costs a little more I prefer the Mighty Bright, the clip is a little less bulky and the option of an external AC power supply (haven't bought one yet) is nice as these do burn through batteries. Still, they are both the only good clip-on book lights I have tried."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the light?:","review":"Very weak illumination of book page - I would use in an emergency - and never regularly unless I had another source of light to help better light the page- disappointing result."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"As mentioned by other reviewers, the switches on these lights are faulty. The lights flicker/dim when the light is moved. I purchased two of these lights and they both had the same problem. The light (when it stays on) is better than my previous book light. Slight movement or any re-adjustment of the light causes it to flicker or dim or turn off. Unusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I am very disappointed with this light. It is bright enough, but it has a blue cast (I think that's the LED) that really casts a strange light on what you are looking at. My biggest complaint though, is that it creates a shiny reflection on whatever it is over, including books and notebook paper! Moving it farther away and closer, or angling it from the side or straight down, does not help, it's the stark quality of the light itself. It literally makes it difficult to see what you are looking at. Waste of money. I have other booklights in a range of qualities, but none that put a cold, bluish shine on whatever you are looking at. I much prefer the softer light of a standard bulb (or standard booklight), even if it is less bright.In fairness I will add that the quality of the item itself seems fine, the neck is flexible and long enough to direct in a number of positions.Still, if you are doing anything but knitting (could it reflect off of yarn?), this is not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible book \\"light\\"","review":"I actually bought TWO of these, thinking maybe the first one was just a dud. This is a great book light for about one or two days. Then it just gets dim. If you hold the switch back and press it down at the same time, or bang it against the wall it will brighten up, but once you bend it back over and go back to trying to read, it dims to the point of being useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book light","review":"I am very happy with this book light. I had a more expensive book light which finally broke. This light is just as good or not better than the more expensive little book light. The flexible neck is great, and the light is not as harsh as my old book light. So far it's even managed to withstand my 3yr olds abuse!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Light works...but the shade of light is blinding","review":"I know this is solely a personal preference...but trying to read a book that is illuminated by a LED light is BLINDING. it gives you a headache and makes you squint. Well, that is at least what I experience when I use this light. I went to a local crafts store and bought a single sheet of transparent light yellow paper and taped it to the light so that a yellow tint light illuminates my books. Now, the light is more natural looking and I don't have to squint and I don't get headaches. The LED lights extend the battery life DRAMATICALLY however...and I'm glad for that. I just give this a 2 star rating because they could have tinted the plastic lens covering the LED lights so that the light wasn't so blinding..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great As Long as It Works, But That's Not Long","review":"This item initially impressed me: affordable, compact, bright, easy to position. But within a couple months the on/off switch stopped working properly, and now it's almost impossible to keep from flickering. Not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book Light!","review":"I've had a few book lights, over the years and this is by far the best! It is bright enough to light up two pages, at once. Its neck is long and flexible, so it is easy to get it into whatever positions you prefer. It is sturdy enough that you could fall asleep while reading, roll over the light a few times, and it would be fine. The light itself is pleasant, not too yellow or too blue and not glaring. It also doesn't pulsate, like a CFL light I've tried. In addition to all of this good stuff, it takes standard AAA batteries! Those silly disc batteries are expensive and sometimes a pain to find. There's just nothing not to like about this light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved initially, but extremely short life span","review":"I bought this a year ago. It worked great for the first month or so and the bendable portion was stiff enough, but then it started flashing or turning off (not from lack of battery power) and I had to keep fiddling with the bendable portion trying to get it to stay on. Became progressively worse until now when it's virtually impossible to get it to turn on despite new batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and powerful little light","review":"This is a great light. It is super powerful and the neck is extremely flexible and easy to position. When the electricity went out, this little light calmed my 3 year old son as it was small enough and light enough for him to hold. I ordered a second one for my husband who likes to read at night. It is really super powerful and such a great price. You won't regret ordering it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long battery life","review":"We bought these for all of our preschools staff so they could read at nap time. They work great. Just enough light so you can read a book or magazine, but not too much so you wake up all the children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bright enough to read medium hardback book.","review":"Based on other reviews I expected this to be a bright light with a broad beam. It isn't. I wonder if I have a defective one.There's only one LED bulb and when I try to read at night, I have to keep moving it very close to parts of the page as I move down. It's easier to hold a flashlight.I'm very disappointed, but I destroyed the packaging and it would cost too much to return, so I've repurposed it as a keyboard light for the laptop. It gives just enough light to see where the keys are, but not enough to read them on the opposite end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bright for reading in bed.","review":"I wanted a book light because i love reading in bed at night and my night lamp is too bright for my partner sleeping next to me. turns out this book light is almost as bright as my night lamp itself. I have to twist and turn the neck of the lamp in a lot of weird positions to read without disturbing my partner and it's a real pain. It can be used as a task light though. It has a very flexible neck and it's easy to carry when travelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dosn't even work","review":"I guess it is possible that I got a lemon, but for whatever reason this won't even really work. I flip on the switch and it flickers for a minute and dies. If it does work for a few seconds it isn't bright enough to read by. Don't risk it, don't buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what we wanted.","review":"Great light for vacation, car/passenger reading or bedtime reading. Great price and light goes where you want it. We are ready to buy a 2nd one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice reading light","review":"This light performs its job well. However, there are times when flicker is noticed, although I notice it more than my wife does - and she is the main user, so we'll keep it but I wish it didn't have said flicker.

I read a ton of reviews on Toto toilets and this one was not as popular as other ones cited, however, I chose it because of the low profile height (I needed something that sat under a window and didn't want the tank to be too high). My plumber installed it without a hitch and it works like a charm! One flush whisks away everything, no second flush needed for even the most challenging debris. I have two other toilets in the house, and this is by far the best in terms of ease of cleaning (one piece), and flush power.

I found a good recipe for bread and wanted to try it for buns. I needed the buns to look like store bought so decided to invest in the pan. One of the big issues with baking gluten free stuff is that it can be sticky and you need to really grease your pans, even non-stick ones. Heck I've even had gluten free cupcakes stick to a silicon bakeware pan. Having used the Cuisinart cupcake pan without greasing, I tried this also without greasing. Voila! The buns baked up great and did not stick.I now own almost every type of Cuisinart classic non-stick bakeware and love it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this pan","review":"These muffin top pans are so hard to find so I was super happy to find it here.

It's simply no longer possible to bake anything in it without being ruined, and if I have to take the time to cut out little parchment circles every time, the convenience of the pan shape is kinda lost.

There was no weather condition or style of use that could have caused this (I used it on grass in a quiet, ordinary park), only workmanship defects. The binding is not compatible with the mat itself and now I expect fraying and further separation.

I really don't know why it's so highly rated. The rhymes are very long and wordy, and they don't roll off your tongue very well. In fact, I get tongue-tied while reading this one. There are too many adjectives, such as \\"An itty-bitty mouse, pitter-pat, tip-toe, creep-crawls in the cave from the fluff-cold snow.\\" Really? I think part of the issue is that the rhyming is inconsistent (one page rhymes, next one doesn't) so it really breaks up the flow. I also think the font is too delicate for reading in a dimly-lit room (when you're winding down for the night), which also makes it read to read.I don't like the story either - I don't want to encourage my child to know what not being able to sleep means!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not great quality..doesn't look new","review":"Ordered this book \\"new\\" and it came looking pretty beat up, wear marks all around the edges, the back has indentations/scratches all over it and there is black marker on the bottom of the book.

Also, the book advertised in the \\"look inside\\" feature has a \\"snore\\" button for when the bear snores and the book I received does not which is disappointing because I know my kids would have enjoyed that.

The story takes place in the cave the bear chooses to hibernate in. There is great fun following, as animals drop in. They start a fire, share tea, honey-nuts, and warmth and friendship, all while the bear continues to sleep.

Probably not in this book, but still a hungry bear is a cranky bear and a cranky bear is not to be messed with.The realities of hibernation aside, this fantastical tale feature s lively characters and warm illustrations by Jane Chapman.

He writes very basic sentences -- noun, verb, (sometimes noun).Anyway, a storybook like this is great to have around -- after all, he can help me out by reading it to his little brother. :)One page in this book should give you an example of the awesome language:Mouse squeaks, \\"Too damp,too dank, too dark.\\"So he lights wee twigswith a small, hot spark.It's a fun and clever book with some repetition -- very engaging. And in a non-threatening way, it's expanding my 3rd grader's language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful book - highly recommended","review":"I bought this book for my 8 months old baby about a month ago. The book is well made, the story is about a bear that sleeps in his cave through the winter. a variety of small animals escape from the snow into the bear's cave and have a small party there. The bear sleeps through the party, and in every other page the phrase \\"the bear snores on\\" is lots of fun. The story rimes nicely, and very catchy, the illustrations are beautiful, colorful and elaborated. Because the pictures are so rich in details every time I detect things I didn't pay attention to previously, my baby likes to look at the pictures even when I don't read her the story. BTW- there is no snoring button on the book, it's up to you to make the snoring sound effects... In short this is a very good book, sturdy, colorful, fun to read and can be a good bed time book."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this story","review":"Beautiful illustrations that fill in the whole page with things to look at and friendly characters.

She, like any 2 year old, goes in phases of loving it and refusing to read it, but I never tire of reading this one. The story is just fun to read, with a delightful cadence and rhythem (as others have said)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Karma Books","review":"I am pleased to find so many jewels by incident, and this is one of them. After searching for 'Karma', this book stood out as one of the least related to it topically, but I was interested in seeing Bear Snore On. It turned out to be a wonderful children's book, funny and fun to read aloud. Although not directly related to karma as a concept, the book seems to have a theme of friendship. The animals help eachother out, with fires and food, everyone making room for the next. Even when the BIG bear wakes up, growling and fussing, the fun doesn't stop & more room is made for them all to play.Fun, funny, and a touching message, Bear Snores On is dead on when it comes to good children's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite children's book ever!!!!","review":"If you are a lover of children's literature, you have to add this book to your collection.

It was an instant favorite with him and his mommy. I love to read it to him and he has to hear it over and over and over. The pictures are perfect, very friendly and clear. The text has a definite rhythm that is just wonderful to read. I believe the cover says for ages three and up - well my two year old is absolutely taken with it, and I don't blame him. I'm sure we'll end up with whole \\"Bear\\" line of books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific book!","review":"My 18 month-old loves this book, as do I.

But it isn't good, it is great. The rhymes are so much fun to read and the story is really funny.

It is destined to be a classic. The illustrations are simply gorgeous, and it is as though each word was chosen with such care that it reaches perfection in children's writing.I love all of the \\"Bear\\" books by this talented author and illustrator team, but this was is the best of the bunch. I look forward to seeing more of their books in the future!You will enjoy every moment of reading this with your child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful bedtime story","review":"We received this book as a gift before my daughter was born and it quickly became one of our favorites.

I think it should be part of every little one's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"My absolute favorite children's book!!!","review":"My son is now seven months old, and being that his mom is an avid reader, he has quite the extensive personal library already. Without question Karma Wilson's Bear Snores On is my very favorite of all the books to read on my kid's shelves (along with Bear Wants More). The rhymes, cadences, and repetition are nothing short of perfect--and the illustrations are fabulous as well. My son loves when I read the dialogues in different voices. For a child so young, a book of this length usually fails to hold interest by the half way point, but \\"the Bear books\\" are the exception to the rule.Hands down this book is the most fun to read and I do so at least three or four times a week, without getting sick of it. This is sure to be a favorite for some time to come and if I could recommend one book to new parents, it would be this one. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!!","review":"I have a 4 year old and a 2.5 year old, and this is their FAVORITE book. I also love it, it is so fun to read it to them.

If you have Chef's Quality cutlery don't bring it near this machine. It leaves a rough edge no matter which stone you use and simply isn't meant for good quality knives. If you paid a couple of hundred dollars or more for your set of kitchen knives, get them professionally sharpened. If you have run-of-the-mill cutlery this machine will do OK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Father Melancholy's Daughter","review":"Together with its sequeal, Evensong, this was one of my favorite reads. It had a depth and realism rarely found in fiction with a religious theme. The interplay between spiritual and psychological was fascinating to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing and beautifully crafted","review":"This is a beautifully structured novel with diverse and believable characters. Much of their realism lies in their unpredictable choices and preferences. Just as in real life, we may question their motives and actions; but they are what they are. Godwin has avoided stereotyping. Her descriptive abilities are at their best when she depicts her characters' most excruciating moments, which are the heart of the book.Although the ecclesiastical setting is essential to the story, the dialog is sometimes self-consciously pedantic. When the characters discuss theology, the reader senses that the discussion is primarily for the benefit of the reader, that the characters are aware of an audience. Nevertheless, Godwin's tale of loss and forgiveness more than overcomes this flaw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully written","review":"Ms Godwin did an excellent job with this book and her characters.As a Christian I enjoyed reading the theology, it was thought provoking and meaningful.There were parts of this book that were fairly predictable, where as other parts were surprising.If you enjoy a well written book, you should enjoy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gail Godwin's \\"Father Melancholy's Daughter\\" was terrible.","review":"I had to read a book by Gail Godwin for my Southern author's project in Junior English class. I chose \\"Father Melancholy's Daughter.\\" I found it hard to read, with no real theme. It is about a girl and her self-made responsibility to her father. The book went on and on for what seemed liek forever, and then the person who Margaret has hated for her whole life she turns round and likes. The book was not one I would EVER recommend to anyone, except maybe if I did not liek the person."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unorganized and boring book M.S. period 1","review":"This book took a while to get into and it was not in an organized manner. It did not evoke suspense because it gave away the entire story at the beginning of the book. When it told in the first chapter how Margaret's mother died after she went on vacation with a friend, the rest of the story just retold everything that happened before that event. I would get confused because at any time -since I couldn't tell when was the present- could be a flashback and change the subject completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was agonizing to read","review":"Who is giving this book 4 1/2 stars? This book was PAINFUL! First of all, it is WAY too long for the amount (or lack) of a storyline it contains. Also, maybe all of the people reviewing it are relatives of priests or something, but I COULD NOT COMPREHEND the weird father-daughter relationship. The daughter seemed to be schizophrenic - especially with her strange romantic \\"relationships.\\" This is the last Gail Godwin book I will read. She has lost her chance. If I didn't have to finish this for my book club, it would've been collecting dust on my bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parker Bailey Furniture Cream","review":"This is a great product.

The controls on the front panel are slightly more difficult to use than other monitors I've used in the past, but there are many useful features that can be accessed just from the front panel, such as displaying the actual refresh rate.The only negative comment I have is that when the monitor is in sleep mode, occasionally it turns itself on for a few seconds and then goes back to sleep. When it does this, one hears the clicking sound associated with a monitor turning itself on or changing resolution modes--it sounds like a relay switching on and off. I did not have this issue with my previous monitor on the same computer when the old monitor went into sleep mode.The options for resolution and refresh rate are exceptional for a monitor at the price I paid, and the picture quality is excellent.

I found Fisher's work thorough, and appreciated how he details several of the hoaxes that paralleled the investigation . Despite the many sources used, it is an easy read.I did read of criticism by others that this author is overly sympathetic to police, but I did not perceive it. As someone who has a law enforcement background and has investigated cases as well, Fisher (a former FBI agent) understands that hind-sight is 20-20--and as such focuses on what was done at the time and the reasoning behind the actions.With this book he provides a comprehensive look at a celebrity crime, and allows the reader to discern truth from fiction. This book is worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical Book for Practicing Church Pianists","review":"This is a good book, but definitely not for beginners. I would look for a reasonably priced copy, as it originally sold for under $20. His other book, Hymn Playing Kit for Pianists is also good, and more extensive, if you can find it. You need to be able to sight read music well. He gives practical advice on accompanying a congregtation (the four part harmony in the hymn book is really for singers), and such topics as intros, endings, and turnarounds. Advanced stuff, but practical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent overview of the politics of the era.","review":"Cherny does an excellent job of discussing politics around the turn of the century. He discusses the political deadlock between both powers when they were almost so equally matched neither could get any agenda passed. Cherny does an excellent job of discussing the many organizations that farmers organized to put pressure on politicians to better their situations. One of the main organizations he discusses is the Populists who made some gains in the Democratic party but realistically failed to make any significant changes.

I read the instructions carefully and used the technique as stated in the manual. It does take a while to get the hang of it. Just doesn't work. The edges are really ragged and uneven and do not last. I think the \\"sharp\\" I am feeling is just a bur the sharpener creates along the edge which is quickly flattened during use. I have a few knives it just simply won't put an edge on at all. Period. And I'm talking with about 20 passes on each side. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull em up","review":"Should of listen to some of the other reviews, but not me I am to smart. What a pain in the back side. To start you have to make 20 passes of each side of the knife in slot one, then you have to make another 10 passes of each side of the knife in slot two. And you much make them very slow. (Per the owner's manual) It took me hour's to do this and my knife's came out duller then when I stated. What a waste of time.

My daughter-in-law want to have sharp knives and I think she will love this sharpener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine - especially after the break-in period","review":"I've had one of these for 2-3+ years- am extremely pleased. It does take a few cycles to break-in a new knife that needs resharpening - just replaceing the edge that the manufacturer put on it (and I think they say that in their guide). And yes, it takes a bit longer the first few cycles.Now, I can do 7-8+ knives or so (all different sizes) in about 15 minutes - that's not too much time for me. Are they actually 'razor' sharp..... don't know. But they are more than sharp enough for us. I use the old 'paper slice' test. Before resharpening, they barely slice a piece of paper - after sharpening, NO problem (and I only resharpen them every 3-4-5 months or so now).For the price - can't beat it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've had mine for several years and have never been happy with it. Despite the magnets, it is difficult to hold the knife \\"just right\\", especially with knives that are curved toward the tip. And if you don't hold it just right, it chatters violently in the sharpener, which can't be doing the edge any good.Even if you do manage to get this to work the way it's supposed to, the knife's edge is simply not good. It's not terribly sharp, and what sharpness you have added to it is gone in a day or two.Considering the results and the amount of skill required, you're probably better off with an old-fashioned whetstone at 1/10 the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skechers & Amazon.com--the Greatest!!","review":"The shoe is really great--flexible and comfortable.

Also, it leaks toner so my printer is now a mess inside. I have never had this happen with a name brand cartridge. I give it one star for actually printing. I have emailed Radian support about the false error message and have not gotten a reply in more than a week.

This cookbook gives clear instructions on basic techniques as de-glazing, and it is exceptionally easy to follow. It also offers clear explanations on WHY to cook in a certain way, and its advice is solidly based on the results of experimentation. Best of all, this book has a number of recipes which are individually worth the price of the book.

Specifically, Tabak claims that Newton said of DeMoivre, \\"Go to Mr. DeMoivre; he knows these things better than I do.\\", which is totally out of character for the lengendarily harsh Newton, whose refusal to attribute any credit to his peers are widely documented. One will not learn any mathematical principles or how to solve problems.And why is Einstein on the cover. He would not be considered among the top 10 giants of this field.

I have it on vinyl and years ago paid $30.00 for the CD through a Japanese import. This is far better then his greatest hits because the entire album carries a flow on a theme. From the very start with the melody from \\"If I Only Had a Brain\\"I feel the same way about Cat Stevens early CDs, where the greatest hits is NOT the same as the original theme.If you like the flow of the original intent of an album and not a bunch of disjointed hits but to express a mood, wine, firelight and Bish's smooth vocals, singing about love lost and On and On - this is the album to get.

Definatly not the best movie in the series, but worth seeing if you're with a hot chick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new","review":"I watched this movie knowing it was a slasher flick and it was part of the 'After Dark' collection. I have to say, I'm not really all that impressed with that collection.Penny Dreadful could stand alone. The Hamiltons was a very good new look at an old theme. Those two were the best of the group.This could very well be the worst.Nothing new. Acting was poor. The action didn't take place until late in the flick. With other great slasher movies out there like Friday the 13th, Halloween, Black Christmas and so many more, I was sorry to have wasted my time on this one.It's schlock. Pure and simple. Just another display from no new angle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad at all...","review":"I picked up a rental of this at Blockbusters without much thought, assuming it's another one of those low-budget straight-to-video movies.

Just cuz I was expecting a genuine good movie rather than a flick with a holographic cover I got at blockbuster for a few horror laughs. I mean, the freakin guy from the show 2gether is in it. Anyway, horrible acting and what pissed me off is the direct ripoff of HO1KC. Shes a hitchhiker, wearing about the same thing as Baby, and is talking crazy, and even says 'I love this song' and starts dancing. Anway, the plot has about one sentence 'get stuck in the ride and walk around never really searching for a way out' thats about an hour of the movie right there. Honestly nothing happens.

I can't not even finish it, although I plan to try. The author assumes I have already bought into her hairbrained idea and gets into it too quickly. She is also a terrible speaker and uses the same words too often. She must say fabulous 20 times or more. She needed to get me to buy into her concept before just going right into stating that I met with everyone I am going to meet prior to my birth and agreed to a contract with them. I am just not buying into it in the first CD. I hope to find sometime to actually listen to the rest in case it comes to fruition, but right now I do not consider it worth my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clear writing, but convoluted premise.","review":"I give Caroline 2 stars since she is a talented writer.

I am deeply into eastern thinking, spirituality, self-help, etc. etc. etc. But, this truly is a book which had no connection to me. Not spiritually. Not in any way!I can guarantee you that I made absolutely no CONTRACTS based on any of the archetypes included in this book. Sacred or otherwise!I highly recommend borrowing this from the library prior to commiting to a purchase. If this book somehow connects with you after that, then by all means, buy it. I wish I had done that.I would have never purchased this had I even glanced through the table of contents first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sacred Contracts is a brilliant!","review":"Sacred Contracts is a brilliant synthesis of spiritual insight and psychology. Presumably based on the author's well known workshops of the same name. Sacred Contracts takes Jung's concept of archetypes beyond anything Jung himself might have imagined and brings the notion squarely into the 21st century.The author developed an enjoyable and ingenious process for deciphering your own Contract using a new theory of archetypes that builds on the works of Jung, Plato, and contemporary thinkers. This book is genuinely transformative in understanding the why and what of your inner self.I bought the audio version after reading the written version. Really use both. When I work I use Neurosync behavior modification software to make other improvements.

In this case I constantly fought the urge to fast forward. Her symbolism, archtypes, and profiling is so psychology based it makes them all seem crazy or delusional-something at $150/hr might take years of appointments to work through....... The real message here for me was, not everybody gets it.

I received the book, and it was too much information to get thru for me, so I returned it. I then, ordered the CD version and enjoyed it very much, until the 4th CD suggests you need the book to determine what archetypes you are.

Both are abilities and do not make you right about spiritual matters. So on what grounds to we base her authenticity? Well I have none. My own intuition steered me away from this book but I didn’t listen unfortunately.This book fails to perform what Myss promises in the beginning and is very boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sacred Contracts","review":"Disappointment describes my feeling about this book. The first four chapters are interesting for their historical and biblical context, but it was all downhill from there. The book lacked focus.

But if it was that easy, wouldn't you already be doing what you know you should be doing?What Caroline Myss writes will not help fulfill your \\"sacred contract\\".

The matter was not presented clearly in a logical sequence, it jumped here and there. I had to flip back and forth. The archetypes should have been listed in the chapter that pertained to them, instead of being stuck in the back of the book. Some of this book is divination, and I won't participate in it. I bought this book because someone saw it on Oprah and told me about it. I thought that it would help me. I did learn of the different archetypes that I am, and that helped me some to identify the things that I do. It was even painful to read about the archetypes and realize which ones that I was. I would have finished the book, but I won't participate in divination, as the exercise at the end is compared to the Tarot, or I Ching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Theology, not spirituality","review":"I saw the interview that the auther did on Oprah, which inspired me to purchase this book. Unfortunately, the book had little to do with the archetypes that were discussed during the interview and very much to do with the divine. This book should really be categorized as religion.

She has an appendix in the back listing many the archetypes and descriptions of each. However, in the text of the book she refers to archetypes which aren't included in the appendix, i.e. hermit, dilettante, sage, wizard, etc. These seem to be plucked from nowhere, with no description as to attributes similar to the format in the appendix.

However, this convoluted,complicated book encourages a level of introspection that can not be healthy.

Introduction points out the differing strategies and ideas discussed in essays about how women artists have been portrayed and how they ought to be in the future. Why does art done by male artists traditionally get looked at objectively as art, whereas art done by female artists is rarely examined without being explained or contextualized by the female artist's personal life or male artists they are associated with? The book also examines in depth, from multiple angles, the burning question of whether or not the monograph is an applicable format for studying the female artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Haunted Bookshop was great","review":"This was a great book.

I also recall this being one of the very few GYG books that was in our public library, so I definitely read this one as a kid. Anyway, the story mostly concerns your misadventures regarding a strange artifact called the Tiki Eye.

Many companies are pursuing offshoring to take advantage of lower wages in other countries. Chapter 5 shows how cost reduction can be strategic, and the other potential non-cost-based advantages of offshoring. Its treatment is also balanced, showing the downsides, costs, and risks of offshoring as well as the benefits. And it talks about choices companies have in implementing an offshore strategy.I am Executive Director of a research center on process management, and we have done research in this area. I know and respect Erran Carmel, the author, and Peter Schumacher, who co-authored Chapter 5. Peter's work is grounded in consulting that he has done at the Value Leadership Group, which advises companies on how to think beyond cost cutting and view offshore as an opportunity to build unique competitive advantage."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think it helps...really","review":"When I first started getting hot flashes about a year ago I took this product and thought it really didn't do much so I stopped. About 3 months ago they started to get way worse especially at night. I was getting about a dozen hot flashes at night and had pretty much stopped using covers. I decided to give these another shot. After about 2 weeks of taking one of these at dinner, I can honestly say that I am only getting about 2 a night now and they aren't as intense. I have even started using covers again!

That said, I would be particular as to whom I would recommend it. Set in the porn industry, it's certainly not for the conversative viewer or those who are uncomfortable with the subject of sex, dealt with in an adult and fairly explicit way.

The main problem with it is the quality of the coffee. We have tried many different brands of coffee, but all taste very mediocre. We also need to use more coffee in the filter than usual or the coffee tastes weak. Another annoying problem is intermittent leaking from the filter basket if the coffee pot and filter are not aligned perfectly. Even when I think the filter basket is all the way in, it still leaks sometimes, not sure why.On the positive side, it makes a pot of coffee fairly quickly, looks nice, and the timer works as expected. I guess it is not bad for the price, but next time I would spend a little more for better tasting coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"ditto on the leaks","review":"I am shopping for a new coffee maker now because I have this one and it leaks.

I bought it after seeing them on Amazon constantly when browzing through metal and progressive metal genres. From what I have read, the first disk is heavier, the second lighter and this one a mix of the two. The other reviews on here are mostly 5 stars. I just don't get it. To me this is really bland sounding mellow music. The only thing that saves this at all is the very good vocalist. One reviewer compared them to Katatonia, Anathema and Novembre. These guys don't come close to the atmosphere or feeling of a Katatonia disk. They are not in Novembre's league at all. They may be like newer Anathema but to me that is not a good thing. Another reviewer said if you like Agalloch you would like these guys. I love Agalloch but not this disk. I know this may upset some people but I just don't get moved at all by this.

There are factual errors in the answers (assuming facts not stated or outright misstatements), legal errors in the answers (incorrect statements of law), and grading rubrics that don't apply to the problem or are inconsistent with the written explanation of what the bar examiners are looking for. The error rate is high - of the 13 problems I've worked through from different sections in the book, 3 had at least one of these errors!

The moves exhibit excellent flow patterns and are extremely functional, and reliable. Not to mention these LEG LOCKS!... Each technique is shown from initiation to a finishing move.

But the regular charger just can't do it fast enough. So I was thrilled to find the Black and Decker fast charger. It works great!

It's like Sex and the City, without all the obnoxious and cliche female stereotypes. No drama of, \\"whens my bf going to call me! Oh no!\\".The only complaint I could have about this show is that sometimes the \\"cut scenes\\" they have of her just sitting around thinking or doing something, can tend to drag on.But I love this show, and for the price it was definitely worth it!A show all about a woman, that my male partner doesn't mind watching with me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Billie Piper","review":"I was so sad when Billie Piper left Doctor Who, but I have to say I love her in Secret Diary.

I am very happy with it. It is very easy to keep clean - and the crumb tray is SO easy to clean. No more opening little metal doors on the bottom of your toaster and dumping it upside down over the sink to get the crumbs out. The crumb tray on this Sunbeam model just slides out and because it's non-stick, you just wipe it with a damp paper towel and it's good-as-new!I like all the temperature options. Choices for frozen bread, pastry, degree of doneness, etc. The slots are wide enough for thick homemade bread or bagels and the extra lift feature is really nice.The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that I find that it's much slower to toast than my old crummy chrome toaster. I don't really see that as a problem - I just allow more time.This would be a great bridal shower gift!Please check out my other reviews of kitchen products and cookbooks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent aspect of Americana","review":"The man has been dead nearly 70 years.

It just seemed like magic until one day I sat down and really thought about what was happening when I used a sextant and calculated these formulas, and finally it all made sense. I could see how there was a logical method to what initially seemed like magic. This book will reveal a similar enlightenment to the reader who feels that computers are magic (as I did). My only beef is that the book did not have a comprehensive index. That would have certainly been a big plus because I can see myself referring to this book in the future. Also, I kept waiting for an explanation of how a million transistors can fit onto a single silicon chip and it never came. Guess I'll have to find another book to explain that bit of \\"magic\\".

In a way this is the book that I have been looking for for a long long time. As a programmer and a non CS graduate, this book has enabled me to understand in a great detail how a computer works and why it does some things a certain way.

However, the gravity of this problem is nothing in comparison to the horrifying lack of any sort of a ninja icon in Microsoft Word. If Microsoft were to switch to a ninja icon instead of that foolish paper clip, not only would consumers be more excited about using Microsoft Office, we would also be more willing to take advice on grammar, formal writing, and spelling from this lovable, wise, rambunctious, well-endowed, and family-friendly character.Instead, we are reduced to taking grammar suggestions from a bouncy, awkwardly cheerful piece of aluminum.

The selections for the first 11 months are ordered by century, starting with Ignatius of Antioch ; through Saint Ambrose and Augustine, Martin Luther, , John of the Cross, up to Thomas Merton and the Carthusians. A short biographical paragraph is included about each selected author. In the final four weeks are included readings from different times, to allow some link between the ages: for example from Augustine to Julian of Norwich.

The main character is a sympathetic hero who is well developed and easy to understand, even for those of us who didn't grow up with the Social Register and who went to college on scholarship.

It comes with 2 MB standard and is upgradable to 34 MB using a standard SIMM. It also has many other other advantages over the HP at a lower price.

When the white window is resized or minimized, the whole screen visibly lightens and expands. I can accept the fact that maybe this unit is defective, but the ViewSonic customer support is virtually non-existent: after trying for one week I have no response to 5 separate emails, the telephone support is inevitably 'busy assisting other customers' and 'experiencing high volume'.

For example, the author rightly touts the advantages of fleece and names brands, and while I believe it to be consistent with my own experiences, there is very little added in depth info. For as competent and experienced as the author appears to be, only 1% of his knowledge and skill seems to be put to paper.

Just like Jake didn't play like Randy Rhodes. I applaud Ozzy for picking guitarists with their own style instead of trying to find a copy of the original.

These spontaneous moments of clowning around are so real while you are deployed. One of the most moving moments in the film for me is the part where the camera shows nothing but the faces of the soldiers who were there without any exposition or explination.

Restrepo allows the viewer to fully experience the dangers of deployment in Afghanistan; Junger does a great job of capturing the reality of war - the fear, the waiting, the battle, the camaraderie.

Even with my experience I'm in awe of what these soldiers went through, and I recommend this raw viewing of a soldier's life on the edge.

No politics, no B.S., just the way it is. Very moving film."},{"rating":"2","title":"6 minutes a month","review":"I did not serve here, my involvement was in an earlier war in a different place. The film does give a great feeling for the terrain. If it gives an accurate presentation of the life of a soldier is up to soldiers who were there to decide. Keep in mind that the 15 months is edited down to just over 6 minutes of video per month of activity. This in itself can shift the perception of what went on, and is a built in bias in this type of work. Also it is much easier for the camera to get good shots of time at the base camp then when out patroling, and the camera is never out on point (that is just the way it is). I believe some background or added comment about the area and forces involved would have greatly added to the overall effectiveness of this film (of course depending how it was done)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good documentary of solder's in the field of war in Afghanistan","review":"If you want a good documentary of the solders in the field of war in Afghanistan, then watch this movie.

The troops are heroic; their task of defending a dangerous outpost compelling; and their having to deal with the local culture very \\"catch-22\\". But as a movie/documentary I found the film hard to warm up too. The character development of the real troops doesn't go very far for some reason so its hard to get to know any of the men beyond the Captain in charge. Add to that never actually seeing the enemy the troops are fighting and it adds up to a film I'm glad I watched and wouldn't be interested in seeing again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"All I can say is that if several crazy Americans went to another country and terrorized it, then that country came over here to, basically, get revenge...and all of a sudden one night my house was being shot at or bombed.....and it seemed to be an ongoing event, I would definitely arm myself with the best weapons I could lay my hands on to DEFEND my family. If they broke into my house, yes they would find weapons. If they killed members of my family, or friends or neighbors who I knew were absolutely NOT terrorists, I would be extremely angry, hurt, violated in the worst way.

One valley. One year\\" (imdb.com). American soldiers are sitting around talking, reading magazines, playing the guitar, and showing pictures of their families. This scene in the war documentary, Restrepo, directed by Tim Hetherington and Sebastian Junger, shows the raw emotion of soldiers in the middle of a war and the relationships among men that have been strengthened through tragedy. Restrepo has been praised by many, and it was The Group Jury Prize Documentary 2010 at Sundance Film Festival. It was also nominated for Best Documentary at the Academy Awards. This recognition is not just because of the interesting cinematography or the intense battle sequences, but because of the emotional scenes the directors were able to capture and the ways in which they put those scenes together to make the viewers able to connect on a deeper level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sales description","review":"The video is a great piece of work.

God is a nice God, but he is perfect and has no anxiety. So, I disagree with this and many other things Dr. Burns is saying. I appreciate his help in the book but it isn't affective to me. He says that if you surround yourself with you fear without a way of escaping it you would conquer your fear. That is not true. Some people faint or pass out when they have no way out.

Very difficult, the music suggests a slightly eerie, barren winter landscape, and for the more attentive listener, quite a treat. This music is not for Schulze's fans of his later rhythmically charged drum machine rock music, but for listeners of avante-guarde music, and the Stockhausen's and Cages of the world, this is really a masterpiece. Too bad Schulze didn't do more of this before moving into a more Progressive Rock arena."},{"rating":"2","title":"Earth, Water and Soul.","review":"I can only say this: This is as close as it can get to the sounds of the heavens.

Klaus Schulze here appears with a string orchestra on this album, recorded during a hiatus from Ash Ra Tempel.

From the classic 'kosmische musik' period of German electronics, this album will be a startling revelation to those accustomed to Schulze's later sequencer-based work of the 1970s and early 80s, or the MIDI-based work dating from the mid-80s and on.

I have a feeling that, in the end, he'll always solve the crime. If you decide to read these books, start with the first one, \\"Until Proven Guilty,\\" because it sets the scene for everything that follows.

Fraternity is another great song, not from the album and only available on import otherwise. The best track is the acoustic 'Ain't it the Life', The Dave's favourite song from the latest album.

I've used it to make at least a dozen cheesecakes and its held up quite well. I really like the 2 bowls that come with it, they are heavy and sturdy. I also like that you have 12 power levels and that you can gradually increase the power levels. The beaters are decent and much better then on other machines in this price range. I don't like beaters that are small and compact because if your mixing anything thick or dense like cream cheese, it gets stuck in the middle. This doesn't happen on this machine. It also doesn't take up that much room on my counter and is pretty easy to clean. I havn't used the dough hooks and probably never will.The bottom line - it's a decent mixer.It doesn't have all the features or power of a Kitchenaid but if your not going to use it the way Martha does or a gourmet cook would, then why spend the extra 100 dollars?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"My mom had a Sunbeam mixer for 20+ years. In fact, she gave it to me when she upgraded, and I used it for at least 6-7 more. When it finally burned out, I replaced it with this model. After limited use, I found that the beaters would no longer stay in the mixer. They apparently use plastic parts to hold the beaters in place, and the plastic wore away from the rotating beater shafts.

And if you are interested in linguistics and history, the way in which he uses words is an interesting foray into the changes in the English language since the book's writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author is Anti-Catholic","review":"In case no one knows or wonders why they might have a sour taste from this book, its because of Gibbon's espousing very Anti-Christian twisted sentiments in this book.Don't believe me? Go to the Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. Pages 564-65 clearly demonstrate his hatred for Christianity.This book is garbage...please discard and do not give to anyone you care about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Form over substance","review":"The design of the book is lovely. The photographs are enticing. The table of contents suggests a valuable and interesting book. But focus of the text, the information content, is excessively historical. If you want to know the spiritual significance attached to certain plants by various spiritual groups, you might like this. If you wish to create a sacred space and seek design help, there are better choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did anyone even look at the galley proofs?!?","review":"It must be said that this is a beautiful book! Photographs, paper, color, layout -- and the text could/would have been, too. But starting on pages 46/47, the text is totally dismembered -- big chunks missing [go from one page to the next mid-sentence and find an entirely different sentence being continued], and big chunks repeated. It made no sense to stumble through the next handful of pages, or try to read beyond: love the photos, but can't keep the book.None of the other reviewers here mention finding this mess. Are there different printings out there?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be great, but...","review":"I tried both the XBOX MC2 and the Universal MC2 on my XBOX with similar results: the XBOX wheel would disconnect at least once in every game, though I was able to press start to resume- with the Universal, the wheel would just lock up and the console had to be powered down completely. I could not even begin to recommend this wheel due to the inconvenience of this issue that seems to be pervasive, reading all of the comments here and on the internet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality - Don't Buy It","review":"Do not buy this. The controller keeps disconnecting and freezing up while playing games.This controller is cheap, which just shows, you get what you pay for. I would skip this controller and buy something better.DO NOT BUY THIS CONTROLLER AT ALL."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible experiance","review":"The MC2 racing wheel is total garbage! I worked with it all afternoon and tried to get it to work and I just got fustrated. It was so hard to steer and however you tried to adjust it, it wouldn't work right. I would rather stick to the regular controler. Don't waste your money on this steering wheel because you will mostly likely take it back to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"thanks for the reviews","review":"I was just about to buy this wheel until I decided to read the reviews. Thanks to all reviewers for your input. I'll look around for a different wheel. I just picked up Midnight Club2 and need a wheel. So far I've bought 2 items from MadCatz and they've worked fine. You win some and you lose some I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"amazon.com screwing","review":"i waited over 2 months for my racing wheel and after my shipping date was changed on me they sent me an email saying they didnt even have the product. not backordered or delayed but no product. 2 months of waiting to get screwed by corprate america. this company is really screwed up!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"F1 2001 Buyers beware","review":"Being a hardcore F1 fan, I eagerly anticipated playing F1 2001 with this wheel. However, the controller configurations for F1 2001 only allow you to select the A and B buttons or the triggers for upshift/downshift. Unfortunately, the butterfly shifters on the Mad Catz wheel correspond to the A and X buttons. So, semi-auto shifting has to be done with the A and B buttons on the wheel and are almost impossible to use correctly at speed. A major bummer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A great concept. Now if it only worked.....","review":"I've only tried it with project gotham so far, but even changing the settings on the wheel around, it's harder to control the cars with this stupid steering wheel than it is with the regular controller, because you can't decrease the wheel range far enough to handle the frequent cornering. If you were on a perfect oval track like stock car racing, it would probably be fine, but defnitely not designed or even tested much with the thought of actually steering something.If you insist on getting one of these, buy one used. at least that way you wont waste as much money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The bare minimum if you need a wheel and pedals.","review":"Currently, there are only THREE options for XBox if you want a steering wheel/pedal arrangement. The super-expensive Fanatec setup, the original Microsoft wheel (discontinued), and MadCatz. The Microsoft wheel is fragile and will not last. I had the MS Wheel, it broke and rather than spend hundreds on a Fanatec, I went with the MadCatz. It has NO FEEDBACK and it is otherwise a very basic setup. Steering resistance is a simple spring. Pedals work fine. The console is cheap looking. On a positive note, it has lasted quite a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buggy","review":"Like others, I found that this controller doesn't work. It \\"crashes\\" every few minutes - halting the game and requiring the user to press the START button to continue.If it wasn't for this significant flaw, I would have given it a 5 star rating. However, this flaw makes it totally unusable in my opinion. It was returned to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost but not quite","review":"I went thru two of these wheels before returning it for a refund. It was a good wheel but I got this same disconnect problem others mentioned. About 5 times a race (I always found it disconnected during a race - never in menus) it would ask me to reconnect the controller. I never got a response from Mad Catz tech on this subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible experience","review":"Tonight I bought this wheel and have been ATTEMPTING to play F1 2001 with it. However, I am having more trouble controlling the car than I do with the regular controller. The \\"dead zone\\" people have mentioned is very bad- I must constantly over correct- it is incredibly frustrating. I would just go with a Logitech or something else, this wheel is HORRIBLE."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe a copmany would try to sell this!!!!!","review":"I just recieved this wheel for my xbox for christmas and couldn't wait to use it. Sure the wheel is cool and all but what good is a controller if it doesn't work. Yes I am talking about the controller giving me a disconecting error in the middle of a race and having to start over and it happens all the time!!! The wheel also has a very bad deadzone in the middle making it very inaccutare. Don't buy this wheel, you won't be able to play your games with it. I can not believe that a company can get away with selling this thing if it doesn't even work correctly!!! It looks like I am not the only one with this problem since a lot of other people have posted about it on here, and I am sure mad catz knows about the problem but has done nothing!! Nice try mad catz, this is the second of your products for the xbox that has screwed up on me, you will never get any of my buisness again! This thing is going back tommorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not work for me","review":"I experienced the same problem as many of the other reviewers. Every few minutes, I got an error message about my controller being disconnected. There was nothing wrong with the cables. The only solution was to press Start every time it happened in order to continue the game. That got annoying very quickly! I bought my wheel at a local electronics store and took it back the next day. Save yourself the trouble and pass on this one until Mad Catz fixes their product."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible. don't waste your money.","review":"this film had so much potential. and for the first 30 minutes, the films was intriguing. then it just got surreal and stupid. it is so sad, bc the colors were rich and the cinametography good - yet the storyline was weak and dysfunctional, and the characters shallow. Also, the blonde woman is one of the worst actresses I've ever seen. She is what breaks the film. Pity."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad bad bad","review":"The theme is basically, girls only use other girls to learn how to please boys, for \\"practice\\", and/or to keep hymens intact for future husbands. The girls that fall in love with other girls only do so because they are crazy and want to be boys. In the end, boy gets girl and all is right again.... this movie sucked. Maybe you will like the story, but being a lesbian, it just made me sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sooo bad!","review":"Acting was bad.Plot was TOTALLY unbelievable.The female lead was obviously crazy which lead to an insane plot line.Movie had a weird overly dramatic / unbelievable ending.Please don't waste your time or money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WIERD!!!!!","review":"i rented it because it sounded ok and it was on my recomendations. I dont like the characters. The only one I liked was her husband because I found the wife to be a bossy flake, and as soon as I learend who the other chick was I stopped watching it because shes weird too.Idk maybe I'm weird but I cant watch a movie where the characters are already annoyign me in 20 minutes. Pluss it takes place in the 20's so its hard to relate to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too generic.","review":"I found the book to be a decent overview, but too general to be of assistance. A better document is the TLC FAQL written by Rob Mullen and found on-line at off-road.com. There are some errors in the info as well. For example, he lists the 3.0 l V6 as being an interference motor when it isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"non-specific","review":"Not very specific for any toyota models. Seems like a place for the author to discuss his own experiences with his land cruiser. No technical information whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"General Level","review":"I purchased this book but discovered it's not current, even for my 2002 Toyota Tacoma 4WD I believe this book just reaches 1999/2000s, and now there is a redesigned Tacoma with bigger engines and SIX speed transmission. On general level it covers some good points and has useful info, but lacks in specificity. I wanted to change my front brake pads, an easy thing to do, but found nothing in this book to help me. Definitely has potential for a totally updated book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best insight at a glance","review":"Fey and Rivin give an excellent guided tour through TRIZ. You gain a deep understanding of the process of innovation, of the ARIZ algorithm and the laws of technological evolution. After reading several other disappointing books this one is my first choice on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as expected","review":"Having owned other Pulsar watches I was anxious to try this one. The band however was huge and could not be sized down.I tried several jewelers and not a one of them would touch a Pulsar watch. Most recently the watch stopped working, even after a batter replacement. Owned watch for under a year. On the low end of quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gift Worth Receiving","review":"This book was a Christmas gift and came highly recommended. I visited Bay View, Michigan once a number of years ago and I could see it all over again from Hill's description of it. There were a number of twists and turns in the story that caught me offguard, but Hill tied all the pieces together very cleverly. I was also very moved by the events in the chapter where Detective Bell visits her parents in Waukegan. Had to put the book down for a minute to regain my composure.Being a musical person, I enjoyed the little bit of performance by a couple of the characters. I especially liked the session at the piano bar, an experience every would-be singer would love to have. Thanks for a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very addictive, great story!","review":"A lot of books don't get my interest quickly enough for me to finish them. This book caught my attention right off the bat. I read it in two days because I couldn't put it down. There are many surprises and unanticipated twists and turns. I felt like I knew each character and shared their feelings. Can't wait to read her next book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vanity Press published--don't buy if you like good writing","review":"I should have known. This book was self-published, which most times means the manuscript is not good enough to be accepted by an established publishing house. I don't know what I was thinking when I purchased it. The author's family and friends obviously wrote the reviews. Not even great mystery writers like Michael Connolly, John Sandford and Harlan Coben get five-star ratings. The writing was amateurish, the characters one-dimensional and the plot (or plots?) out of seqence, if that is possible. I didn't even finish the book--just didn't care what happened. From now on, I will check the publisher on the book before I buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor","review":"This novel is poorly written, with unconvincing characterization and unbelievable plotting. In some places there is too much detail, in others not enough. Instead of having the characters demonatrate their feelings or thoughts, the author told us. The whole thing just did not hang together. I own this book now but not for long!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fast -paced page turner!","review":"Suspenseful with surprise twists! It was a thoroughly enjoyable read. This book would make a great addition to your library or give it as a very special gift. It is appealing to both men and women and even some younger readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intense mixture of events","review":"This story has much more to it than meets the eye. One would never guess from the blurb on the back cover that the novel has so much depth. I'm a sticker for tying up loose ends and this author did this very well. Hats off, Ms. Hill. I'm waiting for your next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done!","review":"If you love mysteries, you'll love this one. I was intrigued from the cover to the very last word. All I have to say to the previous reviews is, Ditto."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too young to die","review":"Angela Allen was too young and too beautiful to die. She was found by her sister in her own bed, laid out as if displayed in a coffin, absolutely perfectly, not a hair or ribbon out of place. The detective called to the scene is suspicious right away and the investigation begins.It turns out Angela was a twin and so is Detective Hannah Bell. What impressed me in this story, was how well the author wove two stories together, the one her detective was investigating, and the one her detective was living. Detective Bell's twin sister had been missing for many years. Her pain was lingering. Angela's family pain was just beginning...or was it?There's a lot to keep track of in this story and sometimes I wondered why this or that element was included, but I found out why as the book reached its climax. Ms. Hill appears to be a new author. I haven't found any other work by her. I hope she will grace us with another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dead Angel","review":"This book is an excellent read! The author skillfully weaves many different aspects of the story together, making for a book that is impossible to put down. Action waits on every page. The intensity grows as the story unfolds, until it reaches it's final, heart-pounding conclusion. Very well written!"},{"rating":"2","title":"When's the movie coming out?","review":"This book would make a great movie. So, my question is, when will it come out? I've got the whole cast worked out. Seriously, this was an excellent book. I felt profound sadness for Hannah and her family. It's hard to imagine what it must be like to wonder where someone is for twenty-five years, looking into faces of young women on the street to see if maybe, just maybe one of them might be your missing loved one. Then there's the Allen family. Well, that's another kettle of fish. So much love in one family and so much evil in another. But, even in a family with evil in it, there is love. Anna was love. She tried her best in a bad situation. I'd like more from author Hill and I will wait for the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Texas Fan","review":"Despite a negative segment involving my state, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. There was a great deal of intrigue. I was holding my breath during the _________ oops, can't say that, don't want to give anything away, but I was scared just reading it! Hill has a easy writing style that makes her story easy to read, not necessarily easy to follow because there's so much to keep track of. In the end, she ties the ends up nicely and throws in a surprise or two. I'm looking forward to her next book. Is there going to be one?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Waiting For the Sequel","review":"This book is very difficult to put down. Even after you've finished it, the characters and story keep bouncing around in your mind. I thought it was very well written. Hurry, Ms Rowe, we're waiting for the sequel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Detective Bell is great! Detective Walker is funny!","review":"I liked this book. The story was easy to read, but I had to pay attention or I got lost and had to reread a few pages. The characters were very real. I thought I knew who killed Angela, but I was wrong. I wanted things to turn out differently for Detective Bell's sister. I was very sad about that. the book was well written, though I found a few typos that, as always, I blame the publisher for (it seems there are more and more of them in books). Anyway, I hope there will be more Detective Bell and Walker stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked the ending","review":"We really enjoyed The Dead Angel. Nancy: I liked the ending. It was different! Lynne: It's a real page turner. I kept thinking I had things figured out. Wrong!! Friend Ethel is reading it now. So far she loves it!! Congratulations on a great first book, Carolyn!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing new author can truly write!","review":"Summertime is my reading time every year. As a schoolteacher, the academic year keeps me too busy to read for recreation. I have found a new author to love this summer. Carolyn Rowe Hill has written an intriguing, highly addictive story in The Dead Angel. She apparently is new since I can find no other works by this author. What impressed me the most was that of all the books I've read this summer (20 so far), hers is as good as and better than any one of the others I read by better known authors. Keep them coming, Ms. Hill. I like your style!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sticks to the stories","review":"I'm not an avid reader, but someone recommended this book to me. It was easy to read and Ms. Hill didn't go off on stuff like so many authors do. As it was, I missed a detail here and there, but I liked the story very much. I especially like Hannah."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star for the effort, what little was put in.","review":"I read this book and stumbled upon someone elses review of it here on Amazon. Someone who is obviously in Mr. Zipper's pocket.This book is slow. One could read 30 pages into it and forget completely what was written on the page. The paper for Mr. Zipper's book would be better used in a hamster cage.No plot. No story line. No passion. Just dull words on a page.A good book to fall asleep with, if your goal is just that."},{"rating":"1","title":"ViewSonic E90FB and Cell Phones","review":"My employer just replaced an aging NEC monitor with this larger View Sonic. It is nice and bright and much flatter than what I had before, but not perfectly flat. Also, it appears to be extreamly sensitive to cell phones, particularly my Blackberry. Even with the Blackberry placed a considerable distance from the monitor, on a regular basis severaly thin black lines will flicker across the screen which is quite irritating. The other thing I have noticed is that even though this monitor is larger, I still get the same resolution. I haven't found a higher resolution output that works well with this screen yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"ViewSonic E90FB 19","review":"I can't wait till I have enough money to by another monitor. This ViewSonic(E90FB 19\\") is dark and it rolls like a bowling ball, I have tried everything to get this to work so I can tolerate it. No refund or exchanges were offered to me when I called them up. I have two othe computers that use trintrons and they are perfectly clear,These viewsonics are greatly overrated and I will never buy one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got money to waste? Buy a viewsonic!","review":"I bought this monitor because it was a top of the line model. Worked great, for only 2 years. All of the sudden, the lights went out and nobody's home. Not my card, or a cable , the clunky thing had some kinda bulb blow b/c the green light is on with NO picture. Only 2 years old and not under warranty. Also tried to get some help from customer svc. They said it was under warranty, then it wasn't and then directed me to a phone number to call for an authdealer. Phone number was a phone tree to no where. So, will I buy a Viewsonic product again? Hello no..."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as expected","review":"It is obviously too much to ask to find a toaster that lasts! I have been through several with this being the latest. The heat setting is stuck and cannot be adjusted. The handle fell off. Small appliances used to be built to last. My grandmother has had her toaster for YEARS! This started having problems after 6 months! Beware. Look for a better model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor organization, not much depth","review":"The book is organized alphabetically by the chinese slang words, which is not useful to me. I can imagine this being useful if you speak mandarin well and are trying to figure what somebody was saying, but for a reasonable new student, this organization killed the book for me.Each phrase or word is given only a short paragraph of description, and there is almost no other text. It is very dry.The computer terms at the end are useful since they are sorely missing from every other chinese reference I've seen. The book could be worth it for that.If you're looking for an introduction to Chinese slang, get Wang's other slang book, Outrageous Chinese, which is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent picture quality but disappointing image stabilization","review":"Over the years, I have used many Sony camcorders, including digital. With its HD capability, the little HDR-HC3 is impressive and easy to use. The minuses are not negligible, however. The electronic (rather than optical) image stabilization when combined with the light weight can sometimes make it a challenge to take really \\"steady\\" videos without a tripod. Because the pictures are so clear on HDTV, any shakiness becomes all the more obvious. For my applications, this was a serious drawback and I ended up returning the camera for that reason. The viewfinder is also inadequate, in my opinion, forcing one to use the LCD display most of the time while videoing--which is less than satisfactory outside when it's a bright day! Best try this one out before purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good camera but way over-priced and notoriously terrible customer service","review":"This was a great unit when it came out, but now it's just WAY over-priced.Mine just died after 2 years, and I'd only used it about 15-20 times. Sony wants me to pay more than $500 for a flat-fee repair. Unbelievable.Do a search online -- the error message I got was really common, and MANY people got the same $500 assessment.I'll never buy Sony again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product, you won't go wrong with it!!!","review":"Image quality is exceptional, the weight it's light and the camera is full of features. My only complaint it's that after spending over a thousand dollars, the camcorder desn't come with a Firewire cable and the sound recording could be much better. In general,if you are not a professional you can buy this great camcorder, that you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The original story with the original script.","review":"This edition of King's short novel \\"Cycle of the Werewolf\\" not only features the original version (with Bernie Wrightson's excellent illustrations) but also the original shooting script for the film adaptation from Dino DeLaurentis, entitled Silver Bullet. This was King's final shooting script and it differs from the release print of the film somewhat (the werewolf sings a beer commercial jingle after the first attack, etc.). This edition offers an interesting look at Stephen King's incredibly diverse talents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what I expected, at a good price.","review":"I have had this item for over ten years. It does a good job for me. It is more like pro quality, not consumer stuff. That means you can dump your camera if you are not using it properly. Wake up, pay attention, and tighten the clamps. I use a tripod in my work as a TV news photographer. A Video tripod costing $7000. This is not anywhere as fast as my Sachtler or Vinton heads and legs for my full size TV ENG camera (Sony DNW 90), but those are for TV, not stills. I picked this one for still photography until I want to spend a bunch more. This one is up to the task of SLR photography with a 200mm lens on it, or a Macro. For the money, the quality is top rate. Not carbon, but it doesn't have to be. Mine is made in the USA. I hope they still are...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will NOT fit a 2008 Mini S","review":"Just like the person who left a comment yesterday, I found these pads will not fit my 2008 Mini S Coupe. Wish she had left her comment a couple days earlier. I checked out EBC directly and found the proper part number is DP21789 for 'Greenstuff', DP31789 for \\"Red'. Since Amazon doesn't sell this model of Green, I guess I will go with the Akebono EUR1308."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"Jane Wattenberg's updated retelling of Henny Penny is full of rhyme, rhythm and very hip, very colorful language. My five year old can't get enough of this book. The photo illustrations are terrific with some silly surprises thrown in that all children will love to find and figure out. This is one fast paced, action packed, amazing book. Your family will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"A couple of disclaimers are in order, I think. I have never been a fan of soul. So I couldn't tell you if Joss Stone sings good soul, bad soul, or average soul. Second, I've never heard any of the songs in their original format. My guess is that if you absolutely loved the original versions of the songs, you might resent it that someone else is singing them.If I'm not a fan of soul, then why the hell did I buy this album? The only reason is the power of the Joss Stone's voice. It's absolutely amazing. Her range and abilities are wonderful, and she makes it sound like it is the easiest thing in the world. Furthermore, I don't get sleepy while listening to the music, which I usually do with other soul songs. The only quible I have is that I do think that 'Dirty Man' (track 5) is a bit boring, but then, there have been very few albums where I loved all the songs. If you enjoy listening to a talented singer, and to beautiful songs, then this is a great cd, and a steal at this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joss is Some Kind Of Wonderful...","review":"Believe the hype. Joss Stone delivers...and then some! This could easily be THE best album released in 2003! Joss Stone is a truly gifted vocalist! Christina Aguilera, Alicia Keys, and any other chick out there \\"pretending\\" to have soul should really take notes on Joss. Her voice is stunning, beautiful, haunting! There is no \\"filler\\" track on this album. Every song is wonderful. Each song is a total stand out! This is a gorgeous album sung by a girl with an incredible voice. Do yourself the favor and buy this album. You will NOT regret it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heartless 'Soul by numbers'","review":"Ms Joss Stone has released an album which will impress anyone who follows American Idol or any of the Pop-Star manufacturing TV shows.The interpretations of the songs are overwrought and slightly hysterical. The album doesn't make for easy listening, nor does it provide much emotional depth.Ms Stone's singing style is a mix of the aimless Beyoncé-style vocal mannerisms and a desperate attempt to sound like a traditional Blues or Soul singer. The result is pretentious, irritating and unnatural.I don't like this album even though I have sat through it a number of times. The least graceful debut from a singer I have ever heard!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...","review":"I absolutely HATE some of the songs on this CD. They're either stupid, boring, or EXTREMELY boring. I doubt the original versions were as uninteresting as she makes them. On the other hand, Super Duper Love is a likeable, happy song, and a couple others are too... but they can't save the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste...save your money and listen to it on the radio","review":"If you really want to hear some soul...just listen to Peggy Scout-Adams. This lady has vocals and smoothness unlike Joss who sounds as if she is grunting while she's singing. I know Betty Wright and Angie Stone (these ladies can sang) helped Joss on the vocals. So you might not be hearing as much of Joss's voice as you hear of the other ladies. If you want to listen to real music instead of marketed \\"white pop/black soul\\" then pick up a Peggy Scout Adams, Betty Wright, Karyn White, Anita Baker (old school) or more up to date with Angie Stone, Beyonce, or even a Tamia CD and then tell me if Joss has vocals compared to these ladies I think not. Joss only get credit for being a white girl that sings soulful song hey this is what made Elvis Prestley famous.It's all a racket people not real talent...because Leela James and Joss Stone sound alike but are we hearing about Leela, I think not because she's not white."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow","review":"Hey I saw this video on MTV the other day.It goes to show that MTV continues to play unispired music. Compensating style over substance.Please, do the world a favor and avoid this CD like the black plague. She has potential, but this CD is going by it in the wrong way.I mean you figure she could've waited a while before she did a cover of a White Stripes' song. I mean she could've at least waited for them to die or go to rehab."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you really want to annoy someone...","review":"I don't know what Joss Stone did to put her song in 2 Barnes and Noble bookstores because it's irritating and horrible. She's too young to be singing about Dirty Men because she probably hasn't experienced any relationships of her own.I didn't realize that these were songs sung by other people, it should just remain their songs, not Joss Stone's. There's a reason why this CD is 9.99 and it will probably be found in the 99 cents section of any record store soon enough.If you really want to pull your hair out, I'd buy this CD. If you really want to buy this CD, I'd wait a couple months when you'll find it in the clearance section of the store because it is not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The overrated sessions","review":"Anastacia has got an incredible voice, and yet nobody in this country even knows who she is, let alone listened to her records. She is the true queen of white soul, not this kid. I am not denying that Stone can sing--but her voice isn't that great. It is above average, but not incredible as people have made it out to be...and even in its glory, it is hardly distinctive. It's just reminiscent of any other white girl trying to sing black, really--or in Stone's case, a kid trying to sing black.Please people, go back to your saying that Britney Spears can sing and leave soul music to the grown-ups."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"This young lady has one of the most exceptional voices in our new generation of stars. She will shine bright for years to come. WOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great material","review":"Now, I have read a lot of the reviews on here, and yes, I do go to the lowest first just to see. Well, somethings I have noticed. Admittedly the album does take a little getting used to. But the majority of these reviews are wrtitten based on one song, a supposed White Stripes Track. Fine, but she is still a hell of a vocalist, and she didnt ever say it was original work. I like the white stripes, and all the other artists she has covered. But she brings another dimension to the music. I have also figured out that americans have a very limited vocabulary, SUCKS!! Now comeon, you guys are already seen as the most stupid people in the world, dont make it any worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just love Joss","review":"I think this cd is AWESOME and her voice is amazing!! I saw her perform on Conan O'Brien and I've been hooked ever since!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Eyed Soul Sister","review":"Joss Stone follows in the tradition of white female R&B/Soul singers such as Teena Marie and Lisa Stanisfield. Her strong, earthy voice shines on the breakout tune \\"Fell In Love With A Boy\\". I loved how she slowed down the soul classic, \\"The Choking Kind\\". She also does an excellent job on the bluesy \\"Dirty Man\\". Hard to believe she's 16 years old and from the UK! I truly hope that future projects from her continue to showcase her soulful vocals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensational","review":"I must say Joss Stone was a surprise to me. After I read everyone's review I still was not sure about getting the CD, but I bought it and I am glad. I called at least 3 people and told them about Joss Stone. Her style is different from any 16 year old that I know. She is great and she is going places! I am still listening to her CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"unbelievable","review":"When I saw this young lady on Conan O'Brien I could not believe what I was hearing or seeing. I went out and bought her cd the next day. I went to a number of stores before I found it, but it was worth the drive. This is the best cd I have bought in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul Sessions Rock","review":"Joss Stone takes me back to when R&B was king. Her style with the powerful way she expresses herself reminds me of Aretha Franklin and Janus Joplin yet she has her own personl style. She is one of the most exciting rising stars of this day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Throwback","review":"Back in the day, soul was a genre unto itself. Today's pop icons pretend to be soulful, and I'm sure Beyonce and Mariah Carey are what pass for Soul amongst today's record buying public. These are the teens that wrote 1 star reviews of this record based on Joss's cover of Jack White's music. If you're knocking a soul cover of a neo-punk garage band...you just don't get it. (Cover songs SHOULD be different, but that's another discussion) People that couldn't tell Joss Stone from Al Green aren't going to understand this album, but that's ok.My own expectations for this disc were pretty low, but I was pleasantly surprised. She sings with a passion beyond her years and does a fine job paying her respects to some pretty fine music. It's a record that seems out of place in today's \\"pop\\" market, but with a mix of old and new this album is a success."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the.....","review":"Music like this is why the music world at the moment is in the crapper. Why does anyone need to cover songs that aren't really that old, and then do a poor job of it? Is that what it takes to sell a cd, give a woman lyric to a hit song that's fairly new and say \\"do this\\"? Why are the White Stripes or others letting this go on? I have a good idea, Britney Spears can't put together a decent song/cd, maybe she should cover Dangerously In Love by Beyonce, Megalomaniac by Incubus, or some other hit song that won't be too old by then. I would love to hear her cover Radiohead, and I am sure they would too."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING CD","review":"I have to say that I wasted my money on this CD. It was sooooo boring.

Sorry all you little people but you got no sense"},{"rating":"1","title":"Joss Stone sucks.","review":"I'm not a fan of Joss Stone at all. She truly sucks, and shouldn't have had TRIED to sing The White Stripe's song, \\"Fell in Love With a GIRL\\" She sould of came out with a different song for her first song. She messed the song up, and shouldnt be able to sing anymore. I dont care if shes only 16, she sucks. She needs to come up with her own songs. She knows nothing about music, and cant sing for crap. SHE SUCKS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A true Joy to the world of music","review":"I first heard 'The Chokin' Kind' from a promotional cd, and I felt the chills when I listened through it. Joss has such a powerful voice. Then I found out she is a 16 year old girl from the UK! I was in shock. She has genuine talent. The whole cd is definitely a great cd. It's really rare for me to go out and buy a cd, and if I do... it must be because I really enjoy a song of the artist. In this case it was a good risk. The cd has a variety of songs but all within the same feel. 'The Chokin' Kind' is definitely my favorite song, followed by 'Fell In Love With a Boy.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"A sensational debut of the year so far!","review":"In short, an amazing new talent with an equally amazing voice!It's certainly one of the most, if not, the most refreshing young talent to have come from across the Atlantic Ocean! Her voice & the selection of \\"raw\\" & ingeniously produced soulful songs are addictive and grows upon you as you listen to it again & again!From \\"The Chokin Kind\\" right down to the last track - \\"For the Love Of You\\", you'll enjoy rare and yet, some \\"familiar\\" soul classics, rendered as only Joss Stone could have done in her own stylised way.Forget about the fact that she's only a 16 year old English Rose, this album is a must listen, a must buy, a must have!!! You'll not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUSIC FOR THE SOUL","review":"\\"The Soul Sessions\\" is definitely one of the best R&B/Soul CDs to come along in awhile. I love R&B and this collection is truly a gem amongst the generic. It not slick or flashy, it's just about singing good songs. Joss's voice is strong and powerful, yet mellow and calming. This is the kind of music that teenagers, young adults, and those older can listen to without worrying about numerous sexual innuendos. It represents what Rhythm and Blues/Soul used to sound like when I was growing up. It was more subtle and it truly moved you emotionally. Given her youth, it is surprising that her voice carries such great emotional depth. Many of her contemporaries sing on the surface. But Joss sings from the inside out. There's a certain sincerity in her voice that makes her effort believable. It doesn't sound like she's feeding you hype or manufactured tunes. Everything seems to come from the soul. This CD is worthy of its title. If you listen objectively, you might be pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Discovery for Me!","review":"Saw Joss Stone article in a recent People magazine. Became interested in her music....and the rest is history. This little gal sounds like a young Aretha! I can't imagine a person who likes soul music not liking this CD. I'm anxious to hear more from her. You go, girl!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"crud","review":"Joss Stone is a talented child, but being able to replicate the sounds of a more mature vocalist doesn't mean a thing when there's no real engagement with the material. Stone oversings like an American Idol contestant (she was first noticed on the English tv equivalent), and every song on Soul Sessions has the same studied delivery and consequently sounds the same. Stone has obviously been nurtured carefully by a record company eager to sell a juvenile white equivalent to all the great black soul singers: \\"look, folks, whitey can do it too!\\" Putrid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relaxing","review":"I cannot say enough good things about Joss Stone. To be so young and to have such a soulfull voice..."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 1/2 stars","review":"Joss Stone - The Soul Sessions (S-Curve, 2003)Yeah, she's 16, she's white, and she's from England, but she also got soul. This album is a near-classic, full of respectable remakes. Not many people can remake \\"All the King's Horses\\" by Aretha Franklin but Joss did a good job. And the way she flipped \\"For the Love of You\\" was awesome (note how she added in there, \\"All we need is candlelights/And a D'ANGELO song\\"; game recognize game).However, Ms. Stone does a lot of screamin'. Dang girl, just sing the song!! This album reminds me of Monica's first album, Miss Thang, where Monica was doing so many vocal gymnastics, thus trying so hard to show us that although she was young, she can still sing. Then her second album, The Boy Is Mine, followed and she had a more mellow sound. Hopefully Joss's voice will mature the same way with her next release. -EJR"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Soul Sessions\\" is Soulful","review":"\\"The Soul Sessions\\" has come along at the right time. This is exactly the kind of CD that we need to embrace. It stays away from slick production gimmicks that are sometimes used when there are weak vocals. Fortunately, it focuses on good music and good singing. Her voice really shines through on all of the songs. The potential is obvious. Joss has substance and style. She doesn't come across as a newbie, but as an old pro instead. I wish all sixteen-year-olds had the polish and finesse that Joss does. I look forward to hearing more from this extremely talented young singer. This is an excellent debut. Buy \\"The Soul Sessions.\\" You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Us From Anymore of This Tripe","review":"I've had a chance to listen to both Joss Stone albums and, believe me, that's enough. I wholeheartedly agree with the reviewer that said Joss has \\"absolutely no range at all...she sings in the same style for all of her songs.\\" Melody takes a vacation and all Joss does is declaim soufully--over and over again. She truly can't carry a tune in a bucket. If you want to hear how \\"The Chokin' Kind\\" should sound, listen to the original Joe Simon version. The same with Betty Wright's \\"Dirty Man.\\" These are great songs and Joss does a terrible job with both of them. Only rock illiteratti would praise Joss's remarkably failed covers. Or has everbody started taking crazy pills?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to Angie Stone instead","review":"I too saw Joss Stone on \\"Ellen\\"...and I could not stop laughing.... here we go again, another white artist that thinks that all you have to do to be an R&B singer is put an bunch of african americans behind you in a band, have a few black back up singers, add some vocal gymnastics and....your an R&B SINGER!After listening to the \\"Choking Kind\\"...I was the one gaging...she sounds like a little girl trying to imitate a real R&B singer. True R&B singers feel the music....that's why its called SOUL music, you can't imitate it folks, you have to feel it. One reviewer stated that he could not wait to hear what she sounds like when she turns 21. Remember Lisa Stansfield?Want to hear what it's suppose to sound like? Purchase Gill Scott, Angie Stone, or Casandra Wilson. If you know the difference....don't waste you bucks on this fluf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good voice, weak album","review":"Why cover a song and do a version that isn't even close to being as good as the original? Fell in Love With a Boy is just lame!!!! It's boring!! Not creative!!!I have nothing personal against Ms. Stone, she's a decent singer, but this whole thing is just pure hype. She's hot, white, and sings like she's black. Sound familiar?Whoever produced this album needs to check themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unneccessary Adjectives","review":"Some of these reviews take it too far with the compliments. Joss Stone has a nice voice, but she doesn't sound like she has much training. A lot of the attention that she's getting is due to the fact that she's white and only 16. If she was black she would definitely not be getting this much attention. Talent at a young age is not as rare as some of u may think. And I've heard stuff ten times better than this from people of the same age. If I heard a 45 year old black woman sing like this, I would be pretty disappointed. There is a lack of dynamics and change of tone quality in her singing. At times she is over singing. Is she better than Christina Aguilera? Although Christina sings incorrectly at times, she is better at expressing herself vocally. However, if u want to listen to something better than pop that's creative, expressive, and unique, just pick up a Jill Scott, Amel Larriuex, or Erykah Badu cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Songs \\\\ Nice Voice","review":"OK, I was visiting another message board and everyone was hyping this 16 year old British singer. I'm open to music and questioned why they liked her so much. I got such words as amazing, better than such and such, I was like wow. Well I got a copy of the CD yesterday and popped the CD into my car, which I often do, and I could not stop hitting the skip button. Sorry, the music was just boring, sounded very much like country\\\\elevator music, I just didn't like the CD at all. In all fareness to Joss, she has a nice voice, but she didn't quite have the ability to gently glide into the R&B\\\\Soul genre just yet, or maybe it could of been the song selections."},{"rating":"1","title":"psh........","review":"Notice how this girl sings like some sort of Jim Henson creation? ... the sort of self-imposed muffling of her own voice in an attempt to sound soulful? Yeah, talented singers don't do that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"I had heard Joss Stone's cover of Fell In Love With A Boy on TV and I liked it instantly. It was something different than the normal, screaming about anything punk and rock people. I had watched the interview also on the CD and this actually isn't supposed to be her \\"Debut\\" CD. She was working on her actual debut CD when she decided to do a cover CD of some soul songs. She puts a lot of heart and soul into this CD. I didn't expect her to cover something from the White Stripes. I enjoyed this CD very much, even though I'm not really a soul music person. Buying this CD is only a taste of what Joss Stone is capable of. Her actual debut CD is coming out sometime in mid-late 2004 I have heard. Keep your eyes open!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Joss' Music Inspires Me To Be Creative","review":"I love listening to \\"The Soul Sessions\\" while I draw my characters. Joss' music inspires me to be creative, even when the task in front of me is quite challenging. I don't know where I would be without this CD right now. It makes coloring in between tedious curves all the more delightful. I also seem to focus more when I put Joss' CD in. I feel more confident.Thank God for \\"The Soul Sessions.\\" The day I bought it, my characters got even better. I had started something new a few weeks earlier and this CD was exactly what I needed. I date all my work and I compared it to when I purchased her CD and it was the same. It's the first CD I reach for when I sit down with my current set of characters.Thank you Joss!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Stunning....","review":"I bought this CD blindly, having only read a few articles about Joss and hearing the murmuring buzz about this \\"emerging talent.\\" Let me just tell you, this 16 year old is a little more than just \\"emerging\\"--she is the real deal.Not having grown up listening to 70's soul, I am now able to appreciate it through this incredible voice. Her voice is so smooth and soothing, yet powerful and strengthening, all at the same time.If you have heard the hype surrounding Joss Stone--BELIEVE IT!! Buy this CD--you will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking Forward to Future Releases","review":"Her voice is absolutely amazing. You can tell she doesn't really identify with the songs now though. I am looking forward to releases from her as she grows. It's a good album overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulful.......Sexy.......Sultry.......Simply the Best!!","review":"This is one of the best CD's that I have ever heard! The songs are so intense and smooth. I cannot believe that she is only 16!...Joss Stone has quite the career ahead of her and I, for one, will be buying all her cd's. She is amazing and truly gifted. BUY this CD!! You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavenly Voice + Great Lyrics = Classic CD","review":"What to say? I am one of those creatures who prefers the organic feel of going into a store and actually rummaging through stacks and crates of cds. Imagine my surprise when I came across Ms. Stone's offering and recognized most of the song titles as old school soul goodies. I couldn't wait to get to a cd player and see how this neophyte interpreted them. Much to my surprise Ms. Stone proved a refreshing surprise. Most of her takes on these near-classics (except the disappointingly maudlin \\"For The Love Of You\\"; next time take it up a step or step and a half for the second verse!!) belied her tender age at the time of recording. Brava, Joss. Let's hope she has a long and fruitful career and that the music industry will allow this young woman time to fully develop both professionally and commercially!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of hype, but very disappointing album.","review":"I was very excited to hear this album, but very disappointed once I did. Stone's voice is undeniably good, but she whines her way through most of the lame, drawn-out songs on the album. Another reason I bought the album was because many reviewers hailed Joss Stone as \\"a young Aretha Franklin.\\" Now that I've heard the album, comparing Stone to Aretha is laughable. I would advise you to definitely not waste your money on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stone is about marketing, be honest folks","review":"It's obvious that some of the hypesters here are working for the record label - or else they just don't get to hear much in the way of real good singing.\\"Girls who sing as well as (Joss Stone) does are a dime a dozen on \`Amateur Night at the Apollo,' but blond hair and a British accent makes her a marketer's dream,\\" observes Elizabeth Mendez Berry, a contributing editor at Honey Magazine.'nuff said!"},{"rating":"1","title":"finally, someone tells it like it is!","review":"thank you, Industry Insider - with so many people blowing smoke about Joss Stone, it's misleading to music-buyers, and, it may even be misleading the young singer and hurt her potential of having a genuine singing careerwhy can't the industry Svengalis allow a talent like Stone to be real? instead, they take her voice and use it to create an imitation of soul - it's more marketing, hype and carefully-crafted illusion than it is musicthere's no more honest review than Industry Insider has written, so, I'll just add, I hope Joss Stone recovers from the manipulations of her puppeteers, and the folks who foist these manufactured \\"products\\" on an eager public will go and put their talents to selling something that they can be honest about - like used cars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Britain's answer to Hillary Duff","review":"Joss Stone has reinterpreted a handful of songs, adding her own touch of \\"Soul\\". Apparently adding soul means changing a few lyrics and singing uninspired, because this album has nothing to offer in terms of substance. Hillary Duff is an american manufactured singer advertised through MTV to sell albums to kids who dont know any better, and Joss Stone is no different with the exception she's British. Ultimately, what you're left with is a ten dollar disc more suitable as a coaster than for spinning in a cd player, especially if one of your favorite songs has been chopped on this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grating, Overdone and Laughable..","review":"I was tortured by a female friend with this awful piece of dreck on a long car ride recently. She hyped this CD to the point of likening Joss Stone's debut to second coming of Teena Marie and that's an insult!Every note sang and played on this LP is is phony, overblown, pretentious and downright irritating. Caterwauling endlessly about your man, your heart and the blues (how rough has her life been for a 16 year old?)doesn't make for great entertainment and Stone's over the top performances make this sound like a parody or satire on the blues rather than the real thing. Horrible, just horrible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"nice start","review":"I picked up this cd after receiving a complimentary 3 song advance release teaser at Borders. The music on that 3 song disc was fairly engaging, but when I found out that Betty Wright produced the CD my interest was truly piqued. The notes on the advance release say that this isn't her official first release, but just a side project and the official first CD is being finished. This is basically a survey of 70s soul. A couple of nice ballads and a couple of funkier ones balance out a set of good midtempo tunes. The vocals are dark and warm and the band is very good. The White Stripes cover is a bit lame except for the bass player. I hope the \\"real\\" first album is an adequate follow up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful voice","review":"An amazing singer who sings souls into everyone's heart!!!

This British teen can sing, no question, and her voice is rich and husky. Her heart also seems in the right place; you have to admire someone willing to belt out little known 70's soul numbers. The problem, though: oversinging--the white soul singer's burden--plagues this CD through and through. It's never a good sign when the listener secretly wishes for one of the backup singers to hijack the whole project.For more reviews, visit http://unpaidrockcritic.typepad.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated!!!!","review":"I really don't understand all of the fuss over some 16 year-old blond singer from England. As far as I am concerned, she is only another white singer trying to sound black and she does a very poor job with it. None of the tracks grabbed me and at many times, I felt that she was straining her voice trying to reach the high notes. I wouldn't classify her as 'soulful'. If anything, she should be compared more to Canadian singer Amanda Marshall. I give her credit for not marketing herself along the same lines as Britney and Christina. She needs to develop her own style rather than trying to 'fit' in with the black divas of the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay voice, but doesn't make up for lack of talent.","review":"I know it's kind of hard to tell at first but, Ms. Stone's first main single off this album (\\"Fell In Love With A Boy\\") is nothing but a poorly done White Stripes cover. She expects to succeed with her first main single as a cover. Bands rarely do well with their first release featuring a cover. Look at bands like Orgy, Dynamite Hack, and Alien Ant Farm. One of the only bands that has had a career beyond their cover is Limp Bizkit. Their cover of George Micheal's \\"Faith\\" was on their last good album \\"Three Dollar Bill Yall$\\". After that album, they forgot where they placed their talent. Joss Stone has a pretty voice, but you're better off buying a Nikka Costa album."},{"rating":"1","title":"nope","review":"It's not that Joss has a terrible voice... But I can't helpbut feel that if she wasn't white that she wouldn't get thehype that she gets. That's not saying her music is completelybad, but there are lots of good soul singers that are ATLEASTas good as her and they are unknowns to most people.Why is that? Because they aren't white. I think race does playinto the hype factor. Yes, I'm a white guy that digs some soul,but there are better soul singers that don't get the same hypeas this girl and that just isn't right.The songs sound the same but with different lyrics... Also, thesongs arne't very meaningful coming from a 16 year old girl.The thing that bothers me the most though is how she sound theexact same on every song.

To those of us with children on the spectrum, it's obvious Louie has some form of autism, and it's just impressive how forward thinking Keats was to write about it in 1975(!) when nobody even acknowledged the condition.

The graphs were misleading in that the author sets them up to make it look like the results are extremely significant, when infact they're not. Also, concepts are stated with too many research examples that conflict with each other. They lack parsimony, and it leads readers to be even more confused about the concept after they read it thoroughly.

Second, fans of authors like Neil Gaiman will TREASURE the stories contained in this book. Last, it's written in BRITISH PROSE, which, myself being an uncultured American slob, is a refreshing new way to tell the old stories. I recommend buying it. Heck, I recommend memorizing the thing.

There is nothing to like about any of the characters. I have had a son die from cancer and know what it is like to lose a child to illness. In the case of the dying daughter in the novel, I really didn't care and neither did anybody else. Everybody seems a bit mean spirited, busy with their sex-lives or drinking and they seem to be a reflection of the author, Doris Betts who acts like a babe in the woods with an ax to grind with religion in general and the Catholic Church in particular. She even makes a point to attack the church in her \\"Note About The Type\\" where she informs the reader that the Catholic Church even censored the use of the typeset adapted for use in printing the book.

I never got a chance to find out if the carafe leaked or not, the digital display was missing bars, making the programmable timer completely useless. Since that was one of the main reasons I bought the thing, I returned it and was told by the clerk that pretty much *all* of those machines were coming back with one flaw or another. Shame on you, Mr. Coffee!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"I initially was very excited to buy this thermal carafe model because I had gone through several coffeemakers with glass ones and the cost to replace the carafe is 75% of the cost of a new coffeemaker! But my excitement soon turned to disappointment. This unit is attractive, but not engineered well. The basket door is always going off its track and lopsided, and the carafe is just plain leaky. It leaked and now the clock LED doesn't work, and the design of the carafe is poor, so that it is next to impossible to empty it fully without turning it all the way.upside down. And the lid is just plain difficult to screw on straight. Additionally, when you pour the water into the reservoir, it is inevitable that it will spill and drip. It even has a poorly located vent at the middle top back that lets the water leak down the back as you fill the machine. I'm not going back for another!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed; not recommended","review":"Like other reviewers, we had a carafe that broke after only three or four uses.Even if the carafe hadn't broken, I would have regretted the purchase because of these design flaws:1. The coffeemaker is plastered with warnings to unplug before adding water. Since there's no battery, this means you have to re-set the clock and the timer every time you add water.2. The instructions recommend rinsing the carafe with hot water before brewing, but you can't do this if you're using the programming feature to make coffee for you the next morning.3. The high-shouldered carafe is very difficult to pour from; you have to nearly turn it upside-down to get the last cup out.4. There are markings on the lid that show you when it's open for brewing/pouring and when it's closed for storing. These markings are on stickers, and the stickers aren't very durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mystery leak in caraffe","review":"I rarely make/drink coffee, so it's not as if my pot is overused, yet there appears to be a leak inside my caraffe for this coffee maker, which causes coffee to build up inside the base of the pot and get moldy, and smell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"If you push the button without water in it - you broke it.

The working one is the only one that lasted over 1 month. All the water heaters quit functioning in the others.

When this last one quits, So will my business with Mr. Coffee as I will never ever purchase their products again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of Junk","review":"This is not a good product. The carafe leaks. I have owned one for a year. The carafe began to leak after 6 months of use. It becomes water logged due to water being stuck in the inside of the carafe, between the bottle and the housing. No way to empty it, short of taking it apart, which made it leak more. Everytime you pour coffee, it leaks diluted stale coffee water!! To thier credit Mr. Coffee sent me a free replacement when I complained, however it immediately began to leak water! The coffee is also not hot, unless you pre heat the carafe. The carafe is also very hard to clean, leading to stale tasting coffee in a few days. All in all a very bad product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big on heat, low on durability","review":"So far, this carafe coffeemaker is the only one that will keep the water/coffee truly hot for more than 2 hours. I have gone back to it up to 4 hours later and the contents are still hot. While it is easy to use and the see-thru water level was a great help when pouring in water from a source other than the carafe, I used it everyday for almost two years and the unit finally gave out. I didn't have the heart to throw out the carafe part since that is still good, but now I have to buy another one so I can have the convenience again instead of making my beverage in one and then pouring it into the Mr. Coffee carafe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carafe broke","review":"After only 3 months of use the carafe exploded at night when it was empty and sitting in the coffee maker which was off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate this coffee pot.","review":"I am here at this site to buy a new coffee pot because my husband and I hate this one.

No, it is not vaccum or french press brewing, but with the tricks that every coffee drinker knows you can get a very favorful pot of coffee for a reasonable price. If you think pouring hot water into the Carafe should be unnecessary then you should know that all thermal equipment works on the same principal (hot or cold)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Predictable, But Kept My Attention","review":"My main problem with this book was that it was too simple-you knew what was going to happen from page one. Then, save for a few pages of not-so-distressing suspense, it did happen.The characters are interesting: the brilliant doctor Jacob Weber, a renowned fertility specialist with no people skills, who just happens to also be handsome, and have a soft spot, and sassy, smart, beautiful Ella Gardner, a divorced prosecutor who will not let anything come in the way of what she wants: a baby. Dr. Weber is so socially inept that everyone Ella knows can't stand him, but she sees a softer, different side of the man. Helping their relationship is a common goal: to help out an old professor they both knew while at Saunders University, though they did not know each other. It was predictable, but kept my attention; I finished it in one sitting."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hardships of Immigrants","review":"This book was a very good book in that it showed the life of the German-Russian immigrant in the United States very well. The children of the immigrants have a hard time growing up in America, because the parents still want to live in the past. They want to do things the way that they were in the old country. This makes life very difficult for the main character. She has a difficult time because she can't do what she wants with her life because her father expects her to stay home and take care of the family.This book is a very good book with many details and symbols. Each section has its own meaning through its title, as each section is named for a different time of the harvest (of beats) season.

I loved a collection of short stories with the same narrator which was a breath of fresh air.

The author has an appealing, unpretentious prose style - easy to read, good ear for vernacular, nicely noted details. I lived in that time and it all rings true.The stories are each little slices of life. Some of the later ones are about girls Buddy is involved with.

Nothing seemed too laugh out loud hilarious though. It's more of a chuckler, with some nice memories thrown in.After awhile though, all of the stories and themes started blending together a little too much. Too many stories seemed like stories I had read a few chapters ago.And lastly, the stories often end abruptly without any sort of ending. Period. End of story.Bad Haircut was a nice, quick easy read though, but after awhile, it lost my interest.

The series makes a drastic turn for the serious in these episodes (and from then on,) so get ready to discover a few new things, and raise a LOT more questions.

Van Loon starts with the history of swine to give the reader an understanding of the animal from the ground up. I wasn't sure if I could or wanted to raise pigs, so I bought the book. By the time I finished it I couldn't wait to go get some. Nutrition is so important to raising your own meat, and Van Loon spends a lot of time describing what the impact of certain foods are on the end-product. This helped me make the descisions on what our own pigs would eat. When we took our first pig to the processing plant, they were very impressed by the quality of the meat and we were impressed by the flavor. When we took the second one, it somehow,(150 lbs of pork),was 'mis-placed'- I never got it, hmmm....I think the book was mostly to blame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the $45!!","review":"This is a great accessory for builders.

Overall, I REALLY recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean","review":"I'll be brief...First, I am glad I bought this CD and it gets plenty of play time.Although I have only 9 or so JPop genre CDs (ok, 7 are Puffy AmiYumi), this high energy pop/dance music is just too fun to play while flying down the road at 130 - 150 kph (80 to 90 mph to the rest of my country's non-metric hold-outs)... just watch for traffic and police. I have no idea what I am singing about, my diction in a language I am extremely poor at mimicking is horrible, but it is fun none-the-less....ok many of the songs at first sound just like the last one on the CD. Then, after a few listens, you start to really appreciate each song as its own creation.Clean: Her vocals are very clean and her range is fairly impressive. But what catches my ears the most with her voice is the range of strength or rather presence. Her voice is like a clarion bell parting and leading the electronic musical score. The first time I heard her voice on a couple of the tunes, I was saying to myself, \\"wow...\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"What I expect of an artist of her caliber . . .","review":"I've been a fan of Nami Tamaki ever since I first heard her music while watching Mobile Suit Gundam Seed, and was very pleased to see that she also contributed several songs for its sequel, Mobile Suit Gundam Seed Destiny.Overall, this CD was very good. Fans will probably recognize her very popular Gundam Seed hits \\"Believe\\" and \\"Realize,\\" but there are also a number of other really catchy pieces like \\"Destiny\\" (my favorite on the CD), \\"Day by Day\\", \\"Be Positive,\\" \\"Prayer,\\" and several others. I was definitely impressed with the number of good songs on this CD and would recommended it to any Nami Tamaki (or J-Pop) fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T DO IT!

The software for the keyboard isn't compatable to my computer for some reason. I had to call the help line for my computer, and the tech I spoke to couldn't figure it out. Beside the fact that this keyboard didn't work; my computer wouldn't boot-up. No matter what I tried, it wouldn't work. My computer tech finally figured out what I had to do to get back into my computer and determined that either there was something wrong with the keyboard, the software or both. I had to send it back.

The filters are going to be cheaper, it has better pollen filtration capacity then a lot of other purifiers and hey, this one just looks tons better! The unit does not produce a large amount of noise on low or medium. When you turn it on high the noise resembles that from an in window air conditioner.

Even though I watched it for free, I still feel robbed. Robbed of an hour and a half of my life that I will NEVER get back. Some of the acting was bearable at best, and the plot was all over the place. What made it so confusing for me was that there were so many different characters introduced during the movie, but I couldn't quite catch how all of them were connected to one another. I had to keep asking myself, \\"who is this person, again?\\" and \\"what do they have to do with the plot?\\" I could have watched one of those old school blaxploitation movies and would have been more entertained than I was while watching this... :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Very sensual scent","review":"I followed a women in the grocery store after watching 3 men totally turn around when she walked by.

Anyone acquanted with Jefferson, as well as his party, should be able to see right through Banning's account. Although there certainly were classical republican elements in their thought, these were only secondary and complimentary to the libertarian theories of natural rights and individualism.

Common sense: the holster is supposed to be about quick, easy access. Do these Tamrac people actually use their own products in the field? Apparently not.This thing also needs more pouches/pockets. My older Tamrac holster has a zipper on top of the lid for stashing stuff---batteries, charger, tapes, whatever---as well as another inside the lid.

I am a relative new comer and I had envisioned a book through which I would learn by completing projects in their entirety.I don't mind too much that this book relied heavily on plug-ins and demo software, but it would have been nice to have, when applicable, provided companion tutorials where all the effects are accomplished using Photoshop alone.Bottom line: I wish there was a zero star rating as I cannot in good conscience recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your hard-earned money on this book!","review":"This book does not deliver what it promises.

The author is the chef and her husband is the gardener and the combination feeds you all you need to know from preparing your garden soil before planting to harvesting, storing and/or eating your fresh veggies. The recipes range from simple to complex and there are a huge variety of options for that garden vegetable that has gotten out of hand. The only downside to some of the recipes are that they were created in the 60's and 70's and consequently can be very heavy on cream and butter. Substituting soy or rice milk and using olive oil can result in healthier versions. Though they'll always taste better with butter;-) Though seemingly expensive second hand, snap it up if you can find it.

I can plug in the CB-5L anywhere I want & even use a different length cord. 2) Compact & simple design.

Just plug in a battery & watch it for a while. Then you'll understand.I read on different websites that this product comes with plugs for different countries.

Anyway, it failed after 6 light uses: 1 deer, prime cuts only; 6# of pork shoulder roast; and 1# of \\"chain\\" from a beef tenderloin; plus three regrinds of store hamburger to add more fat. That's 16 months of home ownership by a 70+ year old couple. Not a good record. Tore it apart to see where it had failed (retired aerospace engineer). The motor commutator looked like a 4th of July show when running and the windings were burning up (smell) even with no-load. Catastrophic motor failure. But, what the heck, it was only rated at 150 watts. About the power rating of a large light bulb. Don't waste your money on this unit or believe Waring's descriptions unless you want to grind really, really, soft vegetables."},{"rating":"2","title":"cant beat it for the price","review":"I purchased this grinder \\"newly\\" refurbished for a great deal. I ground the meat not suitable for steaks from two deer in about an hour. It was enough to fill eight gallon size freezer bags before i split it up for the freezer. I never had a problem with anything i saw in the bad reviews. It is a home model and some extra prep is needed in cutting the meat into cubes or strips, and it is basically meant for meat. The grind is pretty fine, even with the course blade and it must be hand washed and dried to prevent rusting. The parts arent crude, they are cast. Everything fit together fine and stayed in place perfectly. The machine will start to bang a bit if you load huge chunks of meat into it but it never clogged or got too run down to grind for me. If you want a precision engineered machine for frequent use, with the capabilities to grind very course or very fine, you should spend an extra hundred bucks or so on a professional model. This one worked great for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I purchased one of these refurbished and was left with a very poor impression. The aluminum feed tube is a crude casting. It mates with the motor body with another crude plastic piece. This is held in place with an indent in the tube that is imprecise and confusing. When I put the thing together, I hoped that at least the performance would contradict or justify the poor fabrication. When I started feeding chopped pork shoulder (no bones) into it, it started to bang and vibrate like it was going to fall apart. It managed to grind the meat, but I sent it back anyway. I looked at the rest of it, and the only thing impressive about it is the stainless steel sheet that covers up the motor. The rest is cheap plastic. This was a real disappointment for me because I own a Waring deep frying and am deeply impressed with everything about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solution for feed screw slipping","review":"We found a similar problem to many of the other 1 star ratings -that after a few uses, the feed screw would dis-engage from the motor. We realized that the cutting blade and plate were not sitting flush within the housing, and were held out too far by the feed screw, which itself did not engage fully with the motor. If you look at the rear end of the feed screw, there are 3 metal washers encasing a nylon washer, and held in place by a circlip. We removed 2 of the metal washers, leaving one to support the nylon washer, and the feed screw now sits far enough back so the cutting blade and plate now sit flush within the housing. The grinder now works fine! It is a bad design flaw that Waring could easily overcome, and results in many bad reviews for what is otherwise a good value for money grinder for occasional useage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grigory Faynshteyn","review":"Very poor quality product.

For lean meat cuts, with no fat, sinew, or tendon, it works pretty well. Also if you want to grind cooked meats, it also works very well. Using it as a sausage stuffer (which comes with the machine) does well as long as you don't have the grinding blade on while stuffing the casings. Anything fatty or sinewy, no matter how much you cut away will jam the grinding blade and blade cutter and require frequent stopping and cleaning. Also, the parts need to be stored in a plastic bag and well oiled as they begin to rust right away. I would recommend anyone with a Kitchen Aid standing mixer, to buy the $50 grinding/stuffing attachment as I have seen that used by one of my friends for the same purpose and it does not get jammed up like this grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHOULD HAVE READ NEGATIVE REVIEWS!!!","review":"This product was a complete waste of money for me. It did not grind simple chuck roast to a satisfactory ground beef and I had to repeatedly remove the cutting plate from the grinder head and then reassemble.Worst of all was the contamination probability.

I've compared this to my other 3/16\\" tubes and this has the smallest inner diameter and thickest walls which is not good for air use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen twice before you judge!!!!","review":"When first listening to this CD, I thought this is a good Air Cd.

Universal Traveler being one of the best songs I've ever heard. Put this disc on and chill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreamy, beautiful!","review":"Air are a French electro-pop duo and this album is an excellent showcase of their immense talents. Their style is dreamy and relaxing.'Cherry blossom girl' is a tender beautiful number with light airy vocals. 'Universal traveller' is another lilting, gentle number, faintly reminiscent of Michael Franks. 'Biological' is a slow, creepy number with half spoken lyrics.The highlight for me are two instrumental numbers; 'Alone in Kyoto', and the brilliant, catchy, 'Alpha beta gaga' with it's whistles, beeps, and lush electronics.If you like this cd, try 'Melody AM by Röyksopp."},{"rating":"1","title":"ARGH!! What have they done?","review":"This album was a huge disappointment, from someone who has all of their previous works. Realizing it's hard to top Moon Safari, 1000hz and Premier Symptomes were really excellent, and unique albums. Talkie Walkie, however is a total \\"pop\\" sell-out album. They completely lose the break-beat grooviness of all their previous albums, for basically pablum spoon fed, lameness. Someone should have told them they cannot sing, for christ sakes!! BARF!I'm still a die-hard Air fan however, and willingly buy any of their future albums, but am hoping I don't have to throw away any more money on crap like \\"Talkie Walkie\\" OMG!@!!!!@#$@#$"},{"rating":"1","title":"Away With the Vocals!","review":"Simply put, Air would be my favorite band if they did strictly instrumental albums. Unfortunately they've moved away from this. I can not listen to this album the whole way through; the songs with vocals make me cringe and skip to the next tracks. \\"Alone in Kyoto,\\" \\"Alpha Beta Gaga,\\" and \\"Mike Mills\\" are brilliant songs, but the rest of the album is ruined by cheesy lyrics, poorly sung, and distorted not to add any ethereal quality but to mask the limited vocal ability of the duo."},{"rating":"2","title":"French folks ain't so bad","review":"Who am I to tell you what to buy? If you want something different that isnt Radiohead, then buy this album. The French duo have taken a more simplistic approach on this little ditty. Its catchy and somewhat cheesy at times, but gosh darn it its good stuff and besides thats what they were shootin' for anywho! Listen to it once, and like the chip ad says, you can't eat just one. *disclaimer-cds ain't edible. If you don't own Moon Safari and consider yourself a music buff, you should shoot off your thumbs cause you ain't right. Buy it. Buy both. Drink some wine eat some crepes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ongaku Kerie (Beautiful Music)","review":"I was loaned this album while at the Gojo Guest House in Kyoto. I listend to it all day while I wallked about town. It was pure magic. The perfect touch to the melencholy beauty of Japan on a rainy day. This album is amazing. It holds a special place in my heart, helping me to recall the misty(sic) streets of Kyoto."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Journey into the Sublime.","review":"Once in a while, you'll come across a certain special album, and the one word that best describes it is \\"pretty.\\" That's certainly an appropriate adjective for Air's \\"Talkie Walkie,\\" which has some breathtakingly elegant moments. The French duo creates dreamy landscapes of mellow pop with acoustic and electronic touches. \\"Cherry Blossom Girl\\" soars kite-high with a catchy chorus and strong melody, while the dark and mysterious \\"Run\\" has interesting horror-show synths and hypnotic spoken vocals. The latter song could very well be my favorite on the album. \\"Mike Mills\\" and \\"Surfing on a Rocket\\" are just as good and noteworthy. To peg \\"Talkie Walkie\\" as mere chillout fare would do both this album and Air injustice. It's strong enough to be considered one of the best albums I've heard this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oooooo La, la....","review":"I can't help it, I LOVE Air. I know there is a giant movement out there and the majority of Air lovers prefer Moon Safari, but I disagree. I think Talkie Walkie is far more refined. It's smoother, and it hits your touchy feely places. It's also more consistent throughout than Moon Safari and has much better flow. I think I can get around the cheesy lyrics by brushing it off as Frenchies with a language barrier thing. The music speaks for itself and I've never played a song more times than Universal Traveler. This album is a MUST have for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best discovery in years","review":"I was very surprised to find out that Talkie Walkie has the lowest rating on Amazon out of the few main Air albums. A lot of people seem to think that this isn't quite up to par with Moon Safari, 10,000 Hz or Premiers Symptomes. Air is the best discovery for me in years (I just about only listen to classical/opera), and Talkie Walkie is the only album of theirs that has kept me coming back for more and more.I have listened to Premiers Symptomes, 10,000 Hz, and Moon Safari dozens of times each, but no other album can I listen to all the way through without the slightest desire to advance a single track. Every song gives me such pleasure in its own little way. I had to be very careful when I was first getting into the album because I was afraid I was going to burn myself out on it, which has happened before. But no matter how much I listen, I will never get tired of it, and neither will you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Air Up There...l","review":"This is Air's best CD and is the best example of electronic music moving off the dancefloor and into the emotional down tempo world of chillin' or lounge music. Believe the hype on this one. If you saw \\"Lost in Translation\\", then you've heard music from this CD. Don't purchase for the DVD, it's pretty much worthless due to poor content, buy it for the music.This is one of my favorite CDs out right now, along with mr.deviant's \\"Techno Obsession\\" which is a killer mix of power rock and hard dance music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Air has just made their best album yet","review":"Talkie Walkie has given me a new respect of Air, and after hearing Moon Safari I just considered them another cheesy chillout band like Zero 7. But on Talkie Walkie Air has scrapped all the female singers and let themselves sing the songs. This change helped Air make the best 2 songs of the album, Cherry Blossom Girl and Surfing On A Rocket. The other songs aren't as much fun to listen to as the 2 singles, but they are very good though. Air's new album is very good and I would reccommend it to a person who has owned Moon Safari first though. Also, be informed that it takes a while to appreciate all the songs on this album. Air, good job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"more and more complex they get...","review":"first off i could have burned the cd 2months before it hit the stores !!! but im glad i didnt well worth waiting plus i like the dvd after you listen to this album everything else sounds to normal and boring more of a lay back album nothing u could play at a party not in this world at least ! the lyrics get kinda sloppy but they are french it must not be so easy for them but it doesnt matter cuz this album is so complex its not even music its art stand out tracks for me would have to be ALL of them but the ones i listen to the most would have to be '' VENUS RUN ANOTHER DAY great songs HZ LEGEND was a great album as well but hz had songs i just couldnt get into songs that i skip but not walkie talkie all there songs are very masterd very complex the only other band that i could love as much as air would have to be broadcast another gem alot of people dont know of pick up a copy of talkie walkie its a must have .."},{"rating":"1","title":"lots of sugar-sweet lyrics on this one","review":"This time around the band went for a lot of singing in almost all of the tracks. The lyrics are coy and sweet. Very very French Pop-music. And the songs in general are more conventionally arranged with a real chorus and verse. Air makes great music but the silly lyrics bring my score way down here. Air should look to the band \\"Luna\\" about how to make coy lyrics that are also intentionally and successfully ironic. Or keep the lyrics out of the music alltogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"Air is back!!","review":"I absolutely love this band however I was extremely let down with their last cd. So when I heard that they were coming out with a new one I was hesitant to get my hopes up. Well what a nice surprise!Im not sure they will ever be able to top \\"Moon Safari\\" but this comes close. The music on this cd is classic Air.Any Air fan should own this cd. If your new to Air start with \\"Moon Safari\\", then I would reccomend \\"The Virgin Suicides Soundtrack\\" and then this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting songs","review":"This is a pretty good album with very interesting and catchy songs. It's much better than the overrated Moon Safari. Biological is a romantically creepy song but it's my favorite on the album. Alpha Beta Gaga is an instrumental upbeat and fun song. Another day was a bit mysterious sounding and I liked it. Alone in Kyoto was decent and chill. Surfing on a Rocket was another favorite, especially after 1:34. The vocals mesh well with the music. At first I didn't think much of Mike Mills but the more I listen to it, the more I love it. It's becoming another favorite on this album. Run is one of the darkest songs in the album next to Biological and Another Day. I loved the music in Run but I wasn't fond of the computer vocals, but still a good song. My least favorite songs on this album are Universal Traveler, Cherry Blossom Girl, and Venus.Generally an enjoyable album :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blissful sounds","review":"There is something quite dreamy, ethereal, and indeed blissful in the music of Air, and in particular on this, their third album. Whether as soothing, quiet background for working or relaxing, or as something to be turned up loud, the electronic mood music of Talkie Walkie makes for wonderful listening. Give it a listen, and it will bring you joy and make you feel like you are slowly floating within the most beautiful garden in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's really growing on me","review":"I've been an Air fan ever since Moon Safari. I was the guy who was always pulling that cd out and pushing it on my friends. \\"You've gotta listen to this band. They're great.\\" As much as I loved Moon Safari, The Virgin Suicides Score is still the best Air work in my book.I struggled with 10,000Hz Legend. I don't think it's Air at the top of their game.Now to Talkie Walkie. I pre-ordered this cd. When it arrived, I listened to it a couple times, was really disappointed, put in on a shelf, and haven't listened to it again until this week. I decided to give it another shot. Wow...it blew me away. I've been listening to it non-stop this week. I can't believe I dismissed this so early on.My advice to you, give it a few listens. If you're like me, you'll learn to love this too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this CD","review":"I bought this CD from Amazon and I think the music ispretty good, that is, if you can play it!This CD is copy protected. It didn't play on my computerand I had to the use paper clip to manually force theCD out of the computer drive. I didn't play on my boombox either.I listen to almost all my CD's on my MP3 player. I'mnot a pirate, I pay for everything I listen to but Irefuse to let the record companies dictate how I willlisten to my musicDon't support copy protection by buying this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"copy protection can be sidestepped","review":"This CD is fantastic. Dont worry about the copy protection. You can still rip these songs to another CD or your hD or whatever you want. It doesn't matter at all. Do a search on google for John Halderman Princeton. He wrote an interesting article about holding down the shift key when loading the CD. Apparently there is a bug in the software that allows you to sidestep the protection by doing this.Rock on all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I need more air","review":"a visionary work that takes them into delightfully uncharted territory rendered all the more spectacular by the wise decision to add the astounding Earl Harvin on drums for the current tour!I've heard the complaints that this one doesn't please the long term fans, but for those of us who are new to breathing Air, it certainly sustains."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like cotton candy...","review":"...it's kind of sweet, but has absolutely no substance whatsoever. This reminds me of early 80's avant garde electronica, with muzak-sounding instrumentals and ridiculously repetitive lyrics.

I'm sure I'm not alone in thinking that the overall sound of this album sounds like a parody of their music. Not only that, it feels thin, formulaic, and lacking tasteful re-invention of their musical influences compared to their previous releases. Alpha Beta Gaga stood out the most for me on this album; a pretty sweet whistle tune, actually. If your new to AIR check out Premiers Symptomes first and go from there. You'll find some warm, dreamy, soulful instrumentation a la Serge Gainsbourg. Do not visit Montreal without this music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Air Genius Lost in Talkie Walkie","review":"Air created a genius work in Moon Safari, and this quality was evident in their other early albums. This genius took ethereal synth and gave it an earthy timeless quality. Their earlier music became a soundtrack for our lives. One could listen to Moon Safari endlessly, and I was compelled to do so on many occassion.Air unfortunately abandoned this genius with Talkie Walkie. This new album instead sounds like a hazy version of modern British rock. The lyrics (why are they trying to sing themselves) are rigid, repetitive, and mind numbing. One tires of hearing the album play before it is over.I hope that Air will use its talents in the future for better purposes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quickly fades...","review":"After the let down of the last album, 10k HZ Legend, I wasn't too sure what to expect. As others have stated, Moon Safari was just amazing, but ever since, they haven't been able to recreate the irresistible hooks of Moon Safari and Premiers Symptomes.Surfing on a Rocket is about the only song that I find myself listening to on this CD. Definitely catchy unlike the rest of the CD, but it is a bit repetitive. The other songs I find I'll turn down the volume or skip. Unfortunately, Talkie Walkie will never be a CD I play repeatedly for myself or for friends. Better than 10K HZ Legend yet still not living up to what this duo is capable of.Check out the Premiers Symptoms (limited edition early singles collection) CD or the Virgin Suicides soundtrack, before adding this to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just picked up Air and Paris under a groove","review":"I have to say that these albums are the greatest new releases in electronica and fusion music. Air has established themselves as the greatest downtempo fusion group from france. This new album shows them developing into a more popular musical form. As they are writing full songs with bridge and chorus song structures.The album paris under a groove includes 9 artists who are following in their footsteps. However, these new artists like Kia, Florian, The bottle and terrasse tranquille are much funkier and have stronger grooves. Plus this album also has one of st germain's greatest unreleased tracks. I bought this release since I loved the title. But, it turned out to be a fantastic find. It is great for hanging out with friends and listening to the latest offering of mellow french jazz and funk electronica."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!","review":"I do like it a lot. But i'm not going to buy it. Since it's copy protected, i can't listen to it on my MP3 player. That's too awfull."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Relaxing Masterpiece","review":"I would recommend this cd to anyone who likes to relax unwind even if you are not a fan of chill out or electronic I would still say try this one their best since Moon Safari this music is even fit for a king they deserve many awards for this one very good job guys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Take it back Taking Back Sunday... Seriously.","review":"Man did I ever fall in love with Taking Back Sunday when Tell All Your Friends came out. Where You Want to Be wasn't as good, but at least it had the phantom of what made the band so good lingering about it. ...Louder Now? Don't bother. If you like TBS' sound from TAYF, well then you're smart, but don't even bother listening to a moment of this album, as it will only upset you. The lyrics are poor, the sound, while ok in general, just doesn't work for TBS, and their cover of The Cure's My Blue Heaven is so bad that I nearly cried.Here's my advice: get yourself a copy of Tell All Your Friends. You'll be stunned, it's absolutely amazing. Avoid Louder Now like it's the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too over-produced","review":"I have been a hard core taking back sunday fan for years now.

That being said, DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM. If you want to hear TBS buy one of the older albums, or wait for the next one (I still have faith in the guys). This much touted producer did a terrible thing to the band's sound, and has taken away much of the intensity that is TBS. He is not the only one to blame; come on Adam - where are those awesome lyrics you used to write? The album sounds thin, the music week, and the lyrics forced - rather than true and felt.

Those are my favorites. I like Where You Want To Be but Louder Now is way better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Now","review":"I never joined the TBS bandwagon. I thought they had a couple good singles, but never a good album. Louder Now changes that. It's a much more complete album than their other two full lengths and it still oozes emotion . The album starts out flawless. \\"What it feels like to be a ghost\\", \\"Liar\\", \\"MakeDamnSure\\", and \\"Up Against\\" are all great songs. The rest of the cd seems like more of let down, since it starts off so great. I'm just not feeling \\"Twenty-Twenty Surgury\\" or \\"Miami\\" at all. The rest of the cd is alright, nothing mind blowing, but tracks like \\"Spin\\" keep the cd going strong rather than withering out. Give it a listen, even if you aren't the biggest TBS fan. It's a solid album.

Let me also state that I was very impressed with it. The production is awesome, the vocals are very good and represent the \\"emo\\" idea very well. The album isn't say incredibly innovative, but it is what it is and that is a very fine album. My favorite song is \\"Makedamnsure\\" which is just an exceptional first single and it is no wonder it is doing well on the Billboard Hot 100. I also like \\"What It Feel Like To Be A Ghost\\", \\"Liar\\", \\"Up Against\\", \\"Twenty Twenty Surgery\\", and \\"My Blue Heaven\\" among others. Taking Back Sunday is an easy standout amongst the saturated emo/punk market. They actually have something to contribute musically and that is what makes them a very consistent band. With that said, I give this album 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait...I'm confused","review":"From all the hype I've been hearing, with this album TBS were trying to go for a louder, harder album.

If you have any doubts, forget them and get this cd. It's just that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very weak top third effort","review":"I had very high hopes for Taking Back Sunday's third album, Louder Now, following the incredible Tell All Your Friends, and the very good Where You Want to Be, however they failed to live up to any expectations. I expected them to deepen their sound much like their peers have done in recent albums. (Midtown's Forget What You Know and Brand New's Deja Entendu) However it seems like their moment on MTV with their last album has ruined them. The opening riff sounds like something left off Pearl Jam's Yield album and the album plummets from there. It sounds strangely top 40 and is predictable at every turn. The best song by far is Error:Operator, which doesnt speak well for the rest of the tracks, though this version is improved over the one released with the Fantastic Four movie. I wouldnt spend 5 bucks on this album to buy it used, and i regret dropping 10 on it new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Been outta the country for a while and didnt even know a new album was coming out.

I used it to take my cousin wedding reception at a local chines e restaurant and I have to adjust my raw images to +1stop. I am not happy with the wireless capability of this flash, because the flash need to be in the front of camera in order to be triggered by incamera pre-flash.

It tells the complete story of Lee & Kirby and has a lot of things I didn't ever see Kirby Collector, Evaner or anyone else talk about. No pics, true, but the words are so visual you don't need them.

I've read every major book about comics. And this one outdoes most of them with the info it reveals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good subject. Poor writing","review":"I picked up a copy of this book at a used book store. I am a big Kirby fan and enjoy reading \\"behind the scenes\\" stories of the golden and silver age comic industry.While I enjoyed reading more about Jack Kirby I did find the book disjointed. The author would be writing about some event and suddenly stop and start writing about something else. And then come back. Very strange. Ronin Ro's jumping from subject to subject made the Lost time travel storyline seem simplistic in comparison.I recommend the book if you find it at the library or can pick it up cheap - after all it is about Kirby and Lee. Just don't expect great writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Astonishing","review":"I didn't know what to expect when I saw this book. I knew Ronin Ro had mentioned comics and superheroes in his other books but wondered if he'd be able to effectively cover this story and industry. After reading it, I have to highly recommend this book. Unlike Les Daniels' company-approved version of Marvel History, Ronin interviewed dozens of comic legends, reports dozens of facts I never knew before and tells the entire true story of Jack Kirby. And he does it in a professional and objective way that many narrow-minded comic fans just can't seem to accept. As for him being some \\"Rap Writer\\" his name itself is inspired by a comic book so how can that be? And his other works are about not just \\"rap,\\" but music, law, business, and sociology. Tales to Astonish is the only objective history of Kirby the world will ever see and a great read to boot."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Jack Kirby Did on his Summer Vacation","review":"This book is written like this.

I'd take a couple of dollars and head to my local drugstore to pick up the new Marvel releases of Fantastic Four or Spider-Man. As you read the news from the Mighty Marvel Bullpen it would seem like life in the comics industry was just one big party. Apparently that was not the case. It's terribly depressing to read about Marvel's treatment of the incredible Jack Kirby. The man who helped create the FF and Spidey, Captain America, the Silver Surfer and many others was just another employee to the \\"suits.\\" It's nice to know that he did get some recognition toward the end of his career (and, unfortunately his life), but the guy couldn't seem to get a break when it came to reaping the profits from his co-creations. I have to say, though, that I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who ever bought a Lee/Kirby comic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Infra red bulb","review":"I would give this product a 0 if I could.Can't write a review because the bulb did not work when we screwed it in.

I wanted to give a high end Viewsonic a try. On screen controls are good, but the Viewsonic P75F+B produces just an OK image, certainly not what I expected from their Pro series monitor.

As a heavy gamer, I really needed something with excellent graphics, but I couldn't afford to get the best there was. Considering the price on this monior, it is truly a gem. The quality is superb and setup was a cinch. The on-screen menus take a little getting used to, but after awhile you get the hand of it.The only drawback to this monitor is that during some games, a barely visable black line scrolls quickly down the screen. I'm sure there's a setting that I could alter to change it, but it never happened on my old monitor. Even if it is due to the monitor, it is hardly visable and has never interrupted what I'm doing.It's a great value monitor for those who don't have a lot of money.

I had this connected to a firewall to connect two computers into a subnet. Every 5 to 15 minutes the switch simply disconnects everything attached to it. At the switch all lights except power are turned off. The only way to recover the network is to power the switch off and on, and then the problem repeats again in 5 to 15 minutes.I tried removing each computer from the switch to see if that changed the result and it did not. I then tried to swap a brand-new-in-box GS108 in as a substitute and I get the identical result. So the defect is in the unit's firmware or in its design, but such a gross defect from a major network company is totally unacceptable.Do not entrust this switch to any mission critical task.

The failure mode brought our entire network to a crawl until we found the culprit and unplugged it. I noticed on Netgear's web site that Prosafe products purchased after MAY of 2007, have a lifetime warranty. Leads me to believe they must know they built and sold most of the JUNK prior to May and don't want to correct their problem for those of us who bought back then.

Not so much.My advice, avoid the brand - they have quality issues.By the way, talked to tech support and the person told me that the problem was using a surge suppressor. He wanted me to plug it directly into the wall.Honestly, I think they would have replaced the device free of charge, my problem is that their products keep dying.

Definitely puts a kink in large file transfers, video streaming and online gaming.I got a D-Link gigabit switch to replace it and couldn't be happier.D-Link DGS-2208 8-Port 10/100/1000 Desktop SwitchI must admit I prefer the build and look of the Netgear (it's solid and the rear facing LEDs are great) as opposed to the D-Link's plasticky lightness, but it's all about performance, not looks now, isn't it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Average Performance - Short life","review":"I had this average performing device for 11 months before it began behaving erratically.

Today it failed with the well documented \\"Blinking Lights of Death\\". (I only wished I had read the reviews on a different site before buying). I called Netgear and it took me about an hour to get them to honor the warranty. (They tried to tell me it was under a 90 day warranty, when the box clearly states 5 years). I will get a new (rebuilt i'm sure) one in the mail in a couple of weeks. Meanwhile I'm buying a new HP switch. I will use the Netgear as a backup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works flawlessly","review":"This gigabit switch has worked flawlessly from the moment I plugged it in, and I have not had a glitch since.

Moving to something more reliable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliable Switch","review":"I have three of these in my house, one on each floor connecting a variety of devices. I ordered my first GS108 in 2006 and used that in my home office. I recently moved and needed to bridge several connections between the main floor and the basement, so I ran a single CAT 6 connection between the floors and moved multiple devices from wireless to wired connections. I have never had to power cycle these devices, they pass the connections through at the proper speed & duplex, with minimal delay. They support jumbo frames and have worked flawlessly transferring terabytes of data each month.

That review said to buy one of these. Don't! I paid for two, they got super hot, and flashing lights of doom till they would not start again. I ordered replacement caps after reading reviews on these. Now one of my set of two works again. It still gets hot, and flashes the lights of doom. The other just never worked again. If you want to try some soldering, and buy some new caps. You might get one that works some times.updated: I find it very odd that some people are voteing these 1 star reviews down. By all means, if you would like to waste your money. Buy these up! If you like things that stop working, or you love fixing defective products for netgear. This is for you.

What I did not count on was the increased speed of a gigabit switch. I frequently sync my desktop Windows email and files with my laptop (MacBook Pro running OSX plus Windows via VMWare Fusion). Both systems have gigabit Ethernet adapters so the transfers are breathtakingly fast through the switch. Just checked a recent sync log. 106 music files -- 490+MB data -- in 14 seconds.If I ever got ambitious, I'd move this switch down to the basement and put it just downstream from the FIOS router, then use it to connect all the Ethernet drops from various rooms in the house so any in-house system-to-system wired link would be gigabit. I'd still need a multiport gigabit switch at my desk, though -- probably another Netgear.Like many other users, I unpacked the box, plugged in the power and cables and started using it. Haven't touched it in six months. A great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top of the line in switch technology and build quality","review":"Netgear is without a doubt the best out there.

It gets quite hot - be sure to use the rubber feet and don't pack them too tightly. (There is no fan.)HOWEVER, Netgear warranty service is now quite bad. One of these units (two years old) just died on me. We spent two hours being bounced from one person to another; our call got dropped three times(!); we will have to pay for shipping the dead unit in; and at the very, very end it turned out that they were out of stock for replacements AND WOULD NOT ISSUE AN RMA UNTIL THEY GOT IT BACK IN STOCK. In other words: just sit around, keep calling back; we can't even send in the dud until they are good and ready.I think next time, I'll try another vendor.If you do decide to buy this unit, consider buying two. You may not get a bad one replaced in a timely fashion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Original failed, so did replacement","review":"I've owned and installed many Netgear products and this is the first one that has given me significant grief. The originally purchased device failed within 5 months and the RMA was backordered for a couple weeks. The replacement worked well for a over a year, but then failed as well. What good is a 5-year guarantee if I must repeatedly spend time explaining to Netgear that it has really failed and then pay for shipping on RMA's? I would pass up the \\"bargain\\" price because it may cost more than expected in time and shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great product while it works","review":"Bought 2 of these and they both worked for a day. 2nd day one started getting flakey. Works for about 3 minutes after power cycling. I'm not a happy camper. These felt much heftier than my previous DLink 10/100 switches. Not much good if they don't work.

I cannot get a connection on port 1, and the port 1 light flashes when nothing is plugged in! The other ports seemed to work at first, but other network devices were failing as long as the GS108 was on the LAN. Basically DOA, and now a year out of warranty.

The unit failed on Jan 28, 2013. It has operated more or less continuously since I received it. In reading other websites it appears that Netgear knows there is a problem but wants users to turn it off \\"when not in use\\". That is an impractical idea since the switch is in use continuously. Attempting to reach Netgear customer service has proved a nightmare. If you want to talk to someone they apparently want money. I will try once more today and give an update.UPDATE I was able to get an RMA for the failed switch with no difficulty whatsoever. I called the 888-NETGEAR number and was connected after a minute or two fumbling around with the user friendly menu. I decided not to pay the premium price for return shipping because I can limp along without the switch for a week or two.

I took it to a reputable music repair store who refused to work on it because of how cheaply it was put together and they did not want to be liable if it fell apart. After many e-mail requests, Kaito (the Seller) begrudingly accepted the instrument back for repairs. They had the instrument for over a month and returned it saying it was fixed. After playing it once, it again refused to play certain keys. I took the instrument to another reputable music repair store and they, too, refused to perform any repairs on the instrument, saying it would be better to simply buy a new quality one rather than try to fix this junk.

It begins with a story about Harriet Tubman and then leaves the reader to wonder what has happened. The rest of the book is filled with anecdotes from various sources and refutes the contention that this is one of the first books written about the role of Black women during the slavery period..The book's weakest point comes when she states that \\"both the black female slave and the planter's wife were equally oppressed because they knew little of birth control\\" this is feminist wishful thinking at its best..Another reviewer wrote that \\"white males and their heterosexual patriarchy are to blame for the maltreatment of slave women in the south\\" I would urge her and other's to read what many Southern women thought about their slaves.

It allows the reader to view the slave woman in a different light. It helped me to understand the importance of womanhood. When learning America history, I never truley understood the role of African American women during slavery. I thought that all they did was work and reproduce. This book has taught me that through the hardship and adversary the black woman is like who she is today, the glue that holds it together. After all of what they had been through, the slave woman was still hopefull and was still beneficial to herself and society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite Honest story of slave women","review":"I believe that this book is factually incorrect. White makes a strong statement that slave children were dying of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SID). She is unable to admit the possibility, desire and need of slave mothers to commit infanticide. For a high schooler or entry level college student, this book could give the wrong messages. While some of her facts are well taken, the ones that she concentrates on the most may very well be false. There is other material in this book that I think is just outright wrong considering that I have done substantial research on slavery. A reader can learn more about chattel slavery by studying slavery outside the US: slavery in Latin America and Brazil particularly. Historians outside the US have not turned slavery into a happy patchwork quilt."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"Head came off the first time I used the hoe.

Ms. Hunter has a real talent for creating couples with great chemistry and maintaining enticing sexual tension throughout her novels (with some great spicy love scenes thrown in along the way). And this book did not disappoint me. <Also, this is not a criticism, but I prefer my heroines to be a little older. Some of Hunter's medievals include older, not-so-innocent heroines and those are my favorites. This story worked, however, and I am excited about the next book in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was looking forward to Madeline Hunter's new series, but I was disappointed with this first installment. Neither the hero nor heroine of this novel were likeable and the revenge back story didn't keep my interest. Diane's character is supposed to be young and sheltered, but I found her to be way too stupid and passive to be believable. Her complete dependence on Daniel also made their romance distasteful. Even though I was disappointed with the Seducer I found the excerpts of her next two books to be amusing so I will probably still buy her next novel given that I liked Hunter's earlier books."},{"rating":"1","title":"predictable","review":"I found the book a bit boring and very predictable.

I hope the rest of this trilogy is more up to her standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing :(","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book, first in a series. Sadly, I gave up on it about 100 pages in. I felt there was so MUCH mundane writing and hardly any dialog between not only the two main characters but between any characters at all.

I hope the others in this series are better. 1.5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coons","review":"I started reading Coons with lots of apprehension. I wasn't sure if my baby sister has what it takes to be a great storyteller. After the first page, my skepticism was replaced with profound admiration and amazement.

Thanks for his review since that is one of the main reasons I purchased the book - now I don't have to read a lot of information not pertinent to get to what I'm most interested in (I just have to read the reviews on Amazon, LOL).Note to the author - some people are very very busy. Without an index, you just set it up so that only people who don't have day jobs or people who are absolutely desperate will get to the information they need.

The throne is comfortable with the padding, seems very sturdy and solid, and doesn't wobble at all. The best part about it is the easily-adjustable height - you simply pull the bolt out of the peg it is in and slide it to a different one. It is also very easy to set up, and feels like it could handle a lot of weight.With a price of <$50, you certainly can't go wrong if you're looking for a decent, reliable drum throne."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pacific Drums Throne DW 700","review":"A good throne overall for anyone. The bolt through is good in the fact that you can have consistent height if you need to pack it up and you can be sure then throne won't sink as you are playing.

Other than that the pad is very comfy and the legs can take my weight of 270lbs with no discernible problems. Recommended for just about anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stool Sample","review":"Amazing throne, works great for Rockband.

This is fine for me, but not for her so one is going back.For an adult though, this is a nice inexpensive seat, fairly comfortable with good padding and very solid. It's also light enough that it can go into my Roland travel case for an impromptu jam session with friends without adding too much weight. I'd recommend this to anyone who wants a fairly light, sturdy and comfortable seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"I use this stool for rock band. It adjusts to the perfect height.

I'm about 5ft 11\\" and I don't have any issues with the adjustment. Minor quibble is the seat clamp is not well designed. So IF you lift the stool by the seat, it can come off. The seat is fairly comfortable. I like that the height can be adjusted and the legs fold which is convenient. But you would expect that. I bought it to play RB & GH games. It could be used for people who play an actual drum set. But then, you might want to consider a seat that is more comfortable. Not saying this is uncomfortable. But your butt will get a little sore after an extended period of play.The build quality of this throne is quite good. No complaints there. I would definitely recommend it over any of he cheaper stools that cost around 25-35 bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent basic throne","review":"This is a decent, sturdy little entry level throne. For the price, it has good components and is well made, nice cushion and should last a long time if you are not thrashing it about. Only draw back for me is that the stalk for height adjustment locks into the base so you cannot swivel the seat unless you do not tighten the seat clamp onto the stalk. If you tighten the seat clamp then the seat will not swivel but will stay attached to the height adjustable bar."},{"rating":"2","title":"RockBand Throne","review":"I got this as a Golden Box item to replace my cheap throne for Rock Band. This is definitely sturdy. I don't have the loose, rocking problem with the seat of my old throne. The rubber feet keep it in place. The padding on the seat could be thicker, but not a problem unless you have 1+hr long drumming sessions (like me). Also, the seat doesn't swivel very much. Which might be good or bad (depending on your style of drumming). All in all worth the extra $$."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots more than hamburger","review":"The reviewer who felt that all the hamburger recipes were the same didn't try the recipes that I did. I thought there was a big variety of hamburger choices, besides lots of other meat recipes that are fast to fix. My family was happy with the way the recipes tasted and I don't think you'll find as complete a protein cookbook anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you really like pork rinds...","review":"Many of these recipes are very similar. She really, really likes to use pork rinds - an item that turned me off right away. Some hard to find items are called for, and she asks for specific brand names. I will give this book another try, since I have it, but it has been mouldering on my shelf for quite a while. Since this book is kind of pricey, I'd recommend you try some others first."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to have fun doing research!","review":"Although this book deals primarily with social interaction, this is a great resource to educate the neo-student-researcher on the fun process of research and the divergent paths one research idea can take. I read this in undergrad and realized that maybe research was not as mundane and boring as I once imagined it. I was very glad to be wrong!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Silly as heck, and very rewatchable.","review":"I hate dubs, but I bought this subbed and dubbed, just because it's so incredibly silly and funny both ways. It's manic, and fun to watch with friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"comedic anime full of random","review":"When a friend fired up this anime, i was thinking it'd be a decent, not amazing, but ok fantasy realted anime. However, i was quite surprised, and humored, by its randomness and antics. If you enjoy comedy animes, then you'll probably be at least fairly ammused by this. Like many other have stated there is some frontal nudity of little fairy people(they call them elves, but whatever). The anime is of average quality for its release date, but I've seen few funnier that are this clean content wise.you may want to get your remote ready to press pause/slow to catch everything.I watched the sub only, so not sure how the dub is..."},{"rating":"1","title":"AN INCOMPLETE WORK","review":"This 3 episode series sounds starts great an all that but the third final episode is missing so its pointless to watch this. Sure its great and all that but with no ending,its useless"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all its cracked up to be","review":"I found this story very boring and its characters annoying. Everyone screams and runs around like rabid chickens. I suggest if you want to see it rent it or buy it when it is on sale for a dollar. Not worth twenty bucks I assure you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this if you use XP or newer.","review":"I bought this for my IBM ThinkPad T40 with Windows XP, and it barely works. Whenever it detects the hardware it makes my computer get the BSOD and restart, it sometimes doesn't do this, but that almost never happens, the only good things I can say about this is that the Signal strength is good and its pretty fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"learning Radio","review":"My 13 month old son loves this toy. The tunes are catchy and fun to sing along with. He pushes the buttons when sitting in front of the fridge. It is also nice that it is one unit. There are no small pieces to be swatted off the fridge and torpedoed across the kitchern floor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy!","review":"My 16 month-old son loves this toy, both on & off the fridge. One great feature about it is that it turns itself off when not in use. Great to keep toddlers safely busy in the kitchen while you're cooking."},{"rating":"2","title":"leap frog","review":"Daughter couldn't understand what this toy was saying at times but she loved the music that it played."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Every Penny!","review":"I purchased this Fridge DJ for my son when he had just turned 1. It was exciting to him right off the bat, it plays a whole variety of songs, including ABCs and other popular children's favorites. He's almost two now and he still loves it. It has also helped teach my 5 year old the days of the week. I love it too, it helps when I'm cooking dinner, my son just sings along with the Fridge DJ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best gift for a first birthday!","review":"We have given this gift several times for first birthday parties. We received it as a present for one of our sons ... and it is still a hit almost two years later. This is a toy that will keep kids occupied in the kitchen or anywhere else! The sounds, the lights, the songs, the buttons ... it is a toddler's dream!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My little guy loves it!","review":"My son is 12 months old and just loves this radio! He carries it around with him and then when he is done playing, he puts it back on the fridge. He cannot turn the knob to \\"change\\" the stations, but he can press the play button to hear different songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repeats Letters in the Alphabet Song","review":"I bought this product for my son and am truly disappointed in its performance. I have exchanged it twice now and am still having the same problem. The first one repeated the letter \\"J\\" in the Alphabet Song and skipped the letter \\"K\\". So, I exchanged it and the second one did the same thing only it was with 2 other letters. I then called LF and after returning the second one directly to them (I had to pay for shipping), they sent me a new one that is doing the same thing again. This one is also with the letter \\"J\\". I don't want my son to play with it as he will only end up learning the alphabet the wrong way. LF has not been helpful at all and I just intend to get my money back. I have other LF fridge products that work great but this fridge DJ does not."},{"rating":"1","title":"$43.48!????? Why the price hike Amazon!?","review":"Nothing wrong with the toy...great toy but PRICE???I did have this toy in my son's Xmas wish list for family to use as reference....it has gone from less than $20 to $43.48????? Does it actually come with a real life DJ now?? I would LOVE to know why Amazon has become the MORE expensive place to buy things as this is only one of many price hikes I've seen lately? I will be buying this from the actual LeapFrog site - it is less than $15 there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great toy, my kids love it.","review":"This is the second time we have bought this toy. Our elder daughter loved it and picked up pretty much all the songs before she turned 2. It broke during a trip we took, but we had already used it for over a year. We bought the second one when our younger daughter turned 1 and she loves this toy too. Our elder daughter still plays with this toy. The only complaint I have is that the toy does not look like the picture. We probably got the older model. Nonetheless, we love this toy and I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it!","review":"My little girl who is 20 months old loves this toy. She loves to push the buttons and dance around in the kitchen. And she also takes it off the fridge and runs around with it so that she can dance in other rooms. If your kid loves music and dancing, this is the the perfect toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun","review":"I got this for my 13 month old for christmas. She loves it!!! She continually pushes the button and dances to the music. We've mostly been listening to the regular songs and not the alphabet yet. She hasn't got the hang of the dial but it's still great. She plays with it on the fridge as well as carrying it around. Leapfrog is great and she's loved all their toys so far!! I definitely think it's worth the money.(i paid $14.99 for it) It's wonderful!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fun toy","review":"My 14 month daughter really likes playing with this, and on Christmas morning it was one of her favorites. I like the volume controll. This item is too heavy for the magnets on it and really does not stay up on a metal (fridge) surface other than that it has been a hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"DON'T PAY $42","review":"As of today, 12/1/2010, you can get this for $7.99 at the official LeapFrog site. Pease don't pay what Amazon has this priced at. It's unreal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great musical fun!","review":"Our 15 month old daughter loves all types of music, and we wanted to get something portable for her to listen to. From the moment she got this \\"radio\\", she was hooked. It's one of the first toys that she grabs each morning, and plays with throughout the day.Pros:- Good mix of educational (Alphabet Song, Days of the Week, etc.) and classic music (Old MacDonald, Itsy Bitsy Spider, etc.).- Easy for a toddler to carry.- Nice LED display with letters and numbers.Cons:- The \\"classic\\" songs are music only, no singing.- The music all sounds a bit computer-generated (ie. MIDI).- Adults might get tired of hearing that kid's voice saying \\"All Right!\\" after almost every song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Took over 2 years to find second demo pull tab. T","review":"My husband swore up and down that there was no demo for this toy, that it was just a dumb toy! It has been driving me nuts since my almost 4 year old got it for his 2nd birthday. I looked online, and saw that there is a plastic oval clear thing in the back. The demo mode was frustrating because my son missed half the alphabet and half his numbers, and the songs just changed constantly. I wonder if it had any effect on his brain really. I know it drove me nuts!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite boring","review":"My 19-mth old son received this as a gift for Xmas. At first sight, he loved it. He could hardly wait for me to get it out of the box. But after 10 mins of play, he tossed it to the side & hasn't touched it since! I've tried to play with it in front of him to get his attention, but it didn't work. I'm really disappointed, b/c he loves the other products (Fridge Animals & Fridge Alphabet) & was excited about it from the reviews.If you want to get this toy for your child, I'd definately check it out at the store or play with someone else's first."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUINED my refrigerator!","review":"I have a less than 1 year old shiny, black smooth finish refrigerator. When I went to take this toy off the fridge to clean better, it has scratched my refrigerator and sort of \\"smudged\\" it so it looks dull! No cleaner will fix it. The toy is very heavy and the magnets aren't strong enough to hold it, so it slides around a lot."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],M={key:0},O={key:1};function N(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",O,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,W)):b("",!0)])}const j=d(B,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-8a655e0d"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/7.md","filePath":"guide/7.md"}'),R={name:"guide/7.md"},P=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(j)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
