I thought - no way - when I read all of the bad reviews on it, and it seems they are right. I have kept it clean and there is plenty of space around and under the unit. There is no reason for the motor to have stopped working other than it being a piece of junk.When it worked, it worked great. I'm very disappointed and probably will never purchase another Crane product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"cute frog, but water everywhere on the table it is sitting on","review":"I brought the elephant and like it - quite and work well. So we decide to get the frog because it is cute. However, the water mist is coming out of the top of the frog and even if we turned it up so the mist is over the head as recommended, the table ended up wet in the morning. There was a year apart between purchase, we definitely see improvement in design though. There are 2 lights - one red and one green to indicate on and off. The ultrasound things in the tank is covered unlike the old one that was exposed. The top head is not secure like the old one just you can just take it out easily or is that bad now the little one and take it off and misplace it anywhere? The plastic seems thinner than before. The bottom has more plastic cover and seems more secure than before. I will get the elephant again because that seems to aim the mist in the right direction instead of over the head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had Spongebob one for 1.5 years and it broke!","review":"I am NOT happy right now as I type this. We bought the Spongebob humidifier in December 2008. We don't use it too often, maybe 4 times a year when the kids get sick. My daughter just developed a cold, which sounds like it may turn into a \\"croupy\\" cough, so I got it out...filled it....plugged it in...and *poof* it just blew out. The light was on for a split second, then DONE. R.I.P. Spongebob. (and yes, I tried other outlets. It's definitely the motor on the machine.) I'm so mad, because I remember growing up, having the same humidifier my entire childhood. Just 1.5 years? Buyer beware.But when it was working, it worked very well. It's quiet and let out three different levels of cool mist. I'm tempted to buy another one, because I liked it so much, but I'm afraid to waste my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work well, stopped altogether after about a week of nighttime use.","review":"Irrespective of the fact that many have had great success with this humidifier, we did not.The elephant did not do well to elevate the humidity of our son's 10x12 bedroom. Having a Texas cold spell and a drafty house, our son was really stuffed up and having sleeping problems due to the dryness. To elevate the humidity, we resorted to put our 'good' ultrasonic humidifier in his room for an hour or so to elevate the humidity, and then let the elephant maintain that level overnight (what a hassle!).After a week or so of this, it stopped misting altogether. The water, instead of misting out of the hole at the top, was simply squirting a bit. We are returning the unit and opting to spend the money on one that will be more powerful and (presumably) more reliable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well but light is very bright","review":"It produces a nice mist and doesn't need to be filled too often.

It's very bright - too bright for a night light in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful smelling mist; cleaning with bleach solution doesn't help","review":"I was excited to see such a cute design at a great price; unfortunately the reality is disappointing. Like many of these kinds of devices from China (air conditioners come to mind), there is an awful chemical smell that persists through multiple cleanings. At first I thought the smell came from the basin or tank, but after thoroughly and repeatedly cleaning these areas with a bleach solution to no effect, I realized the smell is coming from the fan area -- you can't clean that part, so you're stuck. If you have a keen sense of smell, stay far away. Even if you don't, you might want to look elsewhere -- goodness knows what is being mixed into the mist that's filling the room..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Waste of Money","review":"The humidifier stopped working after 2 months!!

The penguin had issues getting water fed through the demineralization filter (once it was thoroughly saturated, this issue resolved). The Hello Kitty model had a far more serious issue.After a week of use, my husband noticed that the cord attachment at the back had completely cracked through, exposing bare wires. (I uploaded pictures on the product page). The attachment is very stiff.The penguin model has a much better attachment - it is sturdier, and has more flexibility. I'm sending back the kitty and keeping the penguin, for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started out great, but gave out after a few uses","review":"I chose this because it was cool mist, seemed easy to use, and was cute.As it turned out, the filling process is a bit cumbersome but I can live with that as it seems to be the price of the cute design.The real problem is that the device has stopped working. Baby is only six months old, and we've only used this maybe 5 nights, and it's kaput already. Started out giving lots of mist - instantly - and I was very pleased with it. Now, after a few uses, and right in the middle of baby's cold, it seems to have given out. I have followed the instructions - didn't place on a towel, placed it on an elevated surface, and so forth. I am disappointed and will not buy another Crane product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started leaking","review":"I used this product for about a month and it seamed to work fine. It's not completely quiet because you'll hear the gurgle of water every now and then, especially if it's turned up high. Overall, I was happy, until I woke up one morning and saw a huge pool of water where the humidifier had been. I have hard wood floors, so my floors had some water damage. Just to make sure it wasn't a fluke, I used it the next few days with a bucket underneath it to catch water, and sure enough...it continued to leak. I called Amazon and they shipped out a new one. I haven't really used to the new one yet, so I'm not sure if the same thing will happen. I have a feeling it will. This item is cute, but cheaply made."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor circulation","review":"I used kitty humififier in my bedroom last winter, but it didn't help a lot, in terms of enhancing indoor humidity.

Both were working great for 6 months. Then the first unit fan motor stopped working and fog can no longer blow up and out of the unit. Then the second unit fan motor started making loud churning noises, and eventually stopped working as well. I wrote to Crane customer service, and now have to deal with the hassle of mailing in a cut cord from each unit to get a replacement, and while doubtful of the quality of replacement units. If the fan motors break 2 for 2, who's to say they won't break again?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for me!","review":"I purchased this humidifier because our home gets very dry when we use our fireplace. I suffer from chronic sinus infections and needed some relief so I purchased this for my bedroom & the Sponge Bob for my kids. Even after daily use, it worked great all winter. In fact, it's about time to pull it out of the closet. I just come across a video on cleaning it which was very helpful. Basically, you just soak some water/vinegar solution for 20 minutes. I like easy-to-use appliances:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable Humidifier","review":"I got this for my 2 year old. She was having trouble sleeping. She would also wake up in the middle of the night. I noticed that when i put it in her room the first night she did not wake up coughing.

We returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of poop!","review":"We bought this humidifier for our baby's room. At first we only ran it at 50% at night and then when cooler weather came, we ran it 24/7. At 1 year on the dot, it stopped working. We thought it was overheated, nope; the entire humidifying motor unit is dead. It is cute, we can not deny that, but if you want a humidifier that is trustworthy, go somewhere else. Oh, and also, unless you have some strong mold repellent stuff or clean it everyday with bleach, you can expect your own mold colony!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Humidifier!! Bought three of them!","review":"This is a great humidifier. The kids absolutely love the animal shapes. I bought the pig and cow at first and our older son asked for his own, so we ordered the penguin also. The output is great! You can easily control how much output, so you can make the room extra moist or just a little. We also bought the Protec drop-in cleaning balls and they seem to work well too (and they are all natural.) They are relatively quiet, making occasional gurgling noises when more water goes into the resevoir. Over all, we really like these and they are safer than the hot steam ones that our kids got burned on."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE CRANE HUMIDIFIERS (have 3)","review":"When my dd was born 4 years ago we registered and got the Frog Humidifier. It works the best. There are no replacement filters and a little clorox or vinegar and water cleans the inside basin. You can control the amount of humidity that comes out of it and if you put it on full force it will literally wet your bed sheets! I HIGHLY recommend it. We have 3 of them and I am pregnant and we are getting another for our new baby's room. So far we have the Frog, Elephant and Dragon and they all work awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Charming","review":"We had this product for 1 month. It is very cute, it works like a charm. The only thing I don't like about it is that when you remove the top to access water tank, the water accumulates from the mist, so it drips when you take the top off. All in all, this is worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly a piece of junk","review":"I got it and it worked great for a few months. Then it started making this awful loud noise when turned on, at first I could get it to go off- but now there's not a whole lot I can do. It's a really cute humidifier and worked great for a little bit, but now it has to go in the trash. A shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"This humidifier only gets the second star because it's so cute","review":"I have to admit that I bought the frog humidifier mostly because it is cute, and it matches my son's room. I was happy with it initially, but the product started working poorly after about a year. The humidifier is not long for this world. The motor is really loud now, and almost sounds like it's grinding. Some nights it is so loud that we can't use it. It is only a matter of time before it stops working altogether. If you replace these types of items after 1 year, I guess it's a great buy. I certainly expected for it to last long enough for my son to go to preschool."},{"rating":"1","title":"everything beneath is soaking wet","review":"We bought this humidifier in the frog and the elephant. The problem with the frog is that all of the mist settles on the humidifier and below it and everything ends up soaking wet. We elevated it, as was suggested in the directions, and it ended up in a pool of water. This can't be good for the cord. My husband drilled holes near the eyes to make the mist shoot away from the humidifier and this helped. Then we plugged the original holes with packing tape and it functioned better. It just shouldn't be this difficult.Buy the elephant, not the frog. The elephant forces the mist away from the humidifier and into the air."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Durable","review":"Bought this for my sons room. Cool concept and very appealing to children but not constructed well. Had it for one month and was refilling tank one day and it slipped in the sink- wouldn't even say I dropped it- and plastic tank cracked. Now its completly unusable and replacement tank is almost as much as buying another one. That is most disappointing of all when parts cost as much as item itself. Not ideal unless you're ok with things breaking easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Cow!!","review":"I got the Cow last year for my daughter. It's been wonderful when she has cold. I put it on in her room at night. It's so quiet!!! Sometimes my daughter has coughing fits in the middle of the night. Not anymore since I put on the humidifier!!! It's been wonderful.Now I'm back because my other daughter wants one as well. This time we are getting a frog!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Humidifier was Used","review":"My son liked the cute Dragon Humidifier. We were disgusted when we opened the package to find that the humidifier had been USED. I am annoyed that Amazon sent me someone's return and did not bother to check it before sending it to me.

Amazon needs to clean up it act!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked good for only 3 months!","review":"I bought this in October 2010 to put in the master bedroom for me & my infant daughter. It worked great until a couple days ago. I turned it on & the motor was making the worst sound ever! It still produced steam but nobody could have slept with the noise it made. My husband & I poured out all the water & checked the whole unit out. We thought we had fixed the problem, one little part got clogged, but when I turned it on at bedtime, it started making the noise again. I intend to contact the manufacturer & see if I can get a replacement. If not then I have to buy another one & it will definitely not be this brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for only 2 days...","review":"My son gets plenty of bloody noses, so a humidifier was much needed. After researching I purchased this penguin and it worked well for 2 days, then down the drain it went after. I notice the mist stopped coming out and it leaked puddles of water from the bottom and sides. After looking into what could have happened, I figured out that the fan some how broke in the unit. I returned it!This is not an easy humidifier to fill with water either, you have to flip it around and in the process, even walking the unit back to the room after refill can spring a leak if you're not gentle. Back to researching for a better humidifier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cutier if it worked","review":"I purchased the Penguin for my 2 year old's room. I used it twice for a few hours and then completely stopped misting. I tried all of the troubleshooting suggestions to no avail. I returned it and will order another brand. Too bad because it was silent and relieved her congestion for the short time it worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap plastic junk","review":"The humidifier arrived with a piece of plastic rattling around in the base. Did not feel safe to add water as the housing was exposed where the plastic fell out.Amazon did an instant refund no questions asked, seems like there have been a lot of complaints with these humidifiers.What is more important? Cuteness or safety? I bought a real pediatric humidifier from the drugstore instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does nothing but cause problems","review":"Those reviewers who say this product does nothing to increase humidity, totally correct listen to them. Those who say it creates some sort of white dust, they are not lying. I'm not even sure how this thing penetrates but i had a DVD in my dvd player and a game in my xbox, and both were not working, I took them out and they were covered in this weird substance. Then a few days later my cable modem broke. This thing wasn't even all that close to my electronics and it ruined them. Do not buy this piece of junk unless you just want to look at it, as it's kind of cute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"I am so frustrated with companies, such as Crane, selling unreliable products. This humidifier, during the brief time it worked, looked nice in our child's room and created a fine, cool mist. Then, after approximately a half dozen uses, the mist simply stopped. I could hear the fan, but the element was not creating any mist. My wife and I liked the humidifier during it's brief life so, after returning the broken humidifier, we purchased another one (same model). The new unit lasted one week and then the fan stopped working. The element still created the mist; however, because the fan didn't work, the unit essentially became a large paper weight. We take very good care of the items we purchased. This thing literally broke while it was just sitting on a flat surface. This humidifier is a complete waste of money. Do NOT buy this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this one","review":"It is cute, as the reviews say, but definitely cheaply made. also, doesn't last all night and quickly runs out of water. it has an auto shut off if you happen to leave it on and it runs out but after reading the review of the motor catching fire I will be returning this one. I'll be going with the honeywell HUT-102BP humidifier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsanitary and cheap","review":"This product was a waist of money.

The only problem was that one day when carrying it full of water, the handle gave out and the resevior shattered.

I am here contemplating about buying a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Furniture destroyer","review":"I agree very cute, but something must have been wrong with the one i purchased.

I bought this one because I wanted something fun to look at that was cheap and got the job done. It arrived promptly (which I was totally not expecting, but thrilled nonetheless) and I've been using it ever since. I'd recommend using it in a small room, it works well in my bedroom. I turn it on at night and I don't wake up with sore throats anymore, and my skin isn't dry at all. It's really easy to use and to clean. The unit is relatively quiet, there is a low hum and noises like dripping water which doesn't bother me because I like having some white noise to fall asleep to, however it may bother some people. I've been really pleased with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS LIL GUY","review":"This is my first humidifier so I have very little to compare it to, but he was super simple to set up and he's SO CUTE. The moisture that comes out is cool-- is that normal? It looks like steam but isn't, so fun. He doesn't really fit my decor (I'm an adult woman living in an NYC studio) but he's worth it. I was worried that I'd pick the wrong animal, but now I'm confident that penguin was the best choice. When I put his little head on (after filling him w/ water), I like to put it facing a little askew because that makes him look like he has attitude and I like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective, very adorable","review":"Works well. Almost silent, so you can easily have it on in a bedroom. It can be a bit of a hassle to clean (more like you need to plan time to clean it) and the plastic feet are a little cheap (one of them has cracked, but it doesn't affect the function), but for the price, it's not bad. Very cute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"It's really cute.and make me feel fresh.good to use.and it's safety.it could be used for whole night.i likes it ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works fine, but big pain overall","review":"This humidifier works great and has a soothing, river-like sound. But I don't recommend it. The bottom part collects water overnight, so instead of just toting the main chamber to the bathroom, you have to unplug it and schlep the entire thing to dump out both parts. Then, because of the design of the main chamber, you can never get all of the water out of it, so you can never get it to fully dry out.

Mine might have been broken already when I purchased it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, looks great!","review":"I purchased this humidifier after my wife pestered me about how dry it was in our bedroom during the winter. This humidifier is extremely quiet, has solved her dry air problem, and is clearly the best looking humidifier on the market. This is a great humidifier for the price, and I would recommend it for anyone looking to improve the dryness of a bedroom or another room of equivalent size.Unfortunately, our first penguin had a fan issue after about 2 weeks (it got really loud). I emailed Crane customer service and they quickly responded, telling me to return the humidifier for a new one. Once I submitted return on Amazon, we received a new one in about 1.5 days.

All of my electronics is coated with the stuff. I assumed that a filter would be included but it is not. I tried to order a filter. However, after struggling for half an hour, increasing the order quantity to three filters, and working with Amazon customer service I found that there is no way to order until I order something else besides the filter.

Originally purchased for my daughters fancy rat who at the time was suffering from respiratory illness. However, with continuous use I have had to place a towel under the product because of condensation build up and to absorb moisture. I thought maybe it was just my particular unit but, I have spoken to several other people who have had the same response. My conclusion is the setting was placed to high for too long. Hope this helps :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best humidifier I've ever used!!!","review":"This humidifier is great! It's super quiet, very cute, and totally adjustable as to how much mist/steam comes out. The night light is an excellent additional feature. The steam shooting out the kitty's ears is just too cute!!! You MUST read the directions though! You cannot leave it sitting all day with water in it. You need to empty it out every day and let it dry out. It won't work right if you leave water sitting in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"very adorable crane!!!","review":"This is one of the best humidifiers for under $30.00 out there.

All in all I wish I'd bought something more practical and less cute."},{"rating":"1","title":"water leaking","review":"The tiger shape is cute and my daughter likes it. But if I turn the mist to maximum, the water leaks. I kept it on all night long to keep my room humid, and I always woke up with a lot of water around the humidifier in the morning. Disappointed! I will soon replace it because I'm tired of cleaning the water from my floor every morning."},{"rating":"2","title":"must-have for baby","review":"This humidifier is extremely easy to use and very reliable. The only thing is, like a lot of humidifiers, it requires weekly cleaning with water/vinegar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy","review":"This humidifier was great while it lasted....It was nice and quiet, did it's job, and was very cute. However, after only 2 weeks, it suddenly started sounding like a motor boat whenever you turn it on. There's no way to sleep with it on. Even my husband who is by no means a light sleeper and sleeps through anything can't sleep with it on. It's totally useless. I should've gotten a cheap $20 humidifier...Even those tend to last longer than 2 weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after a Month","review":"Worked great while it lasted..

You can definitely see the mist coming out, but the annoying part is it is leaky every time you pick it up to refill it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifesaver for mama's too!","review":"I am eight months pregnant and bought this humidifier for my baby's nursery. I received this product just in the nick of time! A few days after it arrived, I caught an AWFUL head cold, which included a terrible case of night-time congestion. I felt immediate relief from the moment my husband plugged-in our new \\"Cow\\" and aimed it's ear at me (the steam comes out of both ears). I was able to breathe all night in comfort without congestion, a dry throat or dry nasal passages. I ran the cow on its highest setting and the water lasted until morning. This item is better than I anticipated and I would highly recommend it to anyone. One more thing, this unit is blissfully QUIET."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good little humidifier","review":"Desperately needed a humidifier for my new condo. Saw the picture and knew my girlfriend would love the cute looking penguin. It works extremely well. Does make a slight gurgling noise on high, I am a heavy sleeper and enjoy the white noise. Needs to be refilled every 8 hours and placed on a high, about 2 foot, surface. Can't beat it for the price. Although meant for a child's room, it fits our decor. And yes my girlfriend also found it to be quite adorable, as the name implies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as other humidifiers","review":"I bought this for my four-year-old Hello Kitty fan. She had another Crane humidifier when she was smaller (elephant) that worked well and still works for her little sister. This is not nearly the same quality. After a couple of months it died. No steam, just a lovely melted plastic smell. While this may be good if you are trying to finish off your family, it will not help finish off a head cold. I think the little night light in it may be part of a design flaw.I would recommend the elephant, and will be heading out to Target to get one this week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after one year","review":"I bought this humidifier an year ago from amazon. On the 13th month it stopped working, I bought it because of its attractive penguin shape. The product has good build quality outwardly, but made of poor electronic components. This is my second humidifier from Crane. The first one was 'sponge bob square pant', which worked for about two years, then stopped working. It looks like the crane products are not durable. The one star is for its appearance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable!","review":"This humidifier is adorable and looks great in my sons room. Its works great and is very quiet and doesn't wake my son at all like others I have purchased in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"So cute!","review":"I love this cute little guy! He's not too big, not too small, easy to clean, and has a nice long cord so he doesn't have to be right next to an outlet. The only flaw is that the mist comes out from little slits behind his eyes, not out of his nostrils (which would make him perfect)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A leaky mess","review":"I bought this product because I thought it was really cute, and the reviews seemed to be positive overall. However, my experience was not good. I followed all the instructions to a T and it worked nicely for about 3 days, then shortly afterward started malfunctioning. Every time I filled it up and turned it on water would flood out, and mist wouldn't come out. The only way I could get the mist to start coming out and the water to not leak out was to barely fill the tank and then fiddle around and move the top part so it was tilted to the side, which allowed the mist to flow out. I'm sorry to say I think this product is an example of something that pulls you in with its looks but fails to deliver on performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought Two; They Both Broke","review":"I totally agree with the negative reviews on here. I HATE the fact that I bought not one but TWO of these stupid humdifiers. Both of them broke right after the 3 month warranty period (from Target). I blew $80 in one year on the frog and the elephant; neither of which work anymore, and because I threw away the receipts after 3 months, I can not get a refund. GRRRRRRRRRRR.The first one I bought started to leak around the gasket around month 4 of ownership, and by leak, I mean the water went everywhere. It ruined the wooden nightstand it was on in my baby's bedroom. The second humidifier (I should have learned my lesson after the first one, but oh no, not me) worked fine for a while, then I boxed it up for a couple of months. When I took it out again last week to use, it didn't work at all. Not even a small puff of steam. Nothin'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"This worked well for a month, but now it's headed for the garbage. The glue holding a rubber gasket on back dissolved and water leaks everywhere.

Had it continued to work, it would have been a great unit, my kids thought it was cute, it pushed the vapor up into the air, was easy to fill, etc. I was really disappointed when it quit working. If you do decide to buy this unit, make sure it can be returned without too much trouble - just in case."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRANE Thomas the Tank needs to goto SODOR for repair!!!!","review":"As with the last reviewer, that clear little plastic piece designed to light up the tank fell into the tank after the third time we filled it. Then water leaked everywhere, including onto the electronics. Apparently the plastic is simply glued into the tank and with even the slightest touch it falls back inside. When you place the tank back onto Thomas this piece fits over the other clear plastic piece that houses the actual bulb light. This apparently is enough to cause the piece to loosen and fall into the tank. There is no way to fix this or any warning NOT to touch it. In the course of normal filling its almost guaranteed you will touch this at some time. I dont know about you, but mixing toddlers, water and electricity is a recipe for DISASTER!!CHILDREN SHOULD NEVER BE ALLOWED ANYWHERE NEAR THIS PRODUCT!! THIS IS A MAJOR DEFECT AND SAFETY HAZARD!!!! THE PRODUCT SHOULD BE RECALLED!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with item","review":"I'm surprised these are getting such good reviews. I ordered one, the base came cracked, amazon quickly replaced it and then the other one I ordered (the pig) doesn't turn on at all.

Amazon does a great job with replacing/refunding their product but they might want to consider not carrying this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works very well","review":"I was looking for a small and quiet humidifier and this was exactly what I needed.

January 2009: Still fine, no complaints! January 2010: It's still working fine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless, worked once and never again!","review":"I only had the chance to use this item once, when I received. I bought it ahead of time for a child and when I finally got around to using it, it never worked. I have another friend who bought the penguin and had the same problem. It only worked the same day she bought it. Luckily she was able to take it to a store where she had to exchange 3 times before she gave up. You don't even have the benefit of exchanging on this product. Save your money and don't go with the cutesy humidifier, you are better off just getting one that actually works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly duckling","review":"Was fine when it arrived...but after a few weeks I noticed cracks and loose parts within. It still works but I am not sure how the crack came to be. I suspect that the parts were probably fitted too strongly together and when used, the plastic body gave way. This is the second Crane Cool Mist Humidifier I have and it is bad. The first one, which is the elephant design, has absolutely no problem and the plastic body feels different too. The 'layout' within differs too. My advise is to buy the elephant rather than the duck."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay, until burned a hole and melted plastic","review":"I have this in my children's room. It had worked probably 20 times, until it just burned a hole in the plastic and melted two parts of the humidifier. It is thrown away, and I will be contacting the company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work :(","review":"I received the dragon shaped humidifier as a baby shower gift and was very excited to use it because it was so cute. Unfortunately it did not work, for some reason the water would not drain down into the basin properly unless you wiggled the whole container, then once it had used all the water that was in the base you had to wiggle it again to get more water to go down. So unless I wanted to stand in my daughters room all night wiggling the humidifier it wasn't going to work for us. I think maybe the one we had was just defective or something but Amazon was wonderful and let us return it, even though it was a gift (it was on our baby registry) and gave us a gift card to purchase something else. I don't think I'll be getting this exact one again because I don't know if we'll have the same problem. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 for the cuteness factor but otherwise it did us no good."},{"rating":"2","title":"very cute product","review":"all my friends came to my house would point this hello kitty out. cos she is so cute. Normally they cannot tell that she is a humidifier. Then he will fall in love with her 2 ears with double function(not like other humidifier). this product also very quiet in evening. and when she is full, she can keep working for about 16 hours(i normally set it to medium)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes Crane humidifers are hit or miss","review":"This is the 4th Crane humidifier I've purchased. The first, a frog, stopped producing mist a few months after purchase (seems to be a common problem with the frog based upon other reviews). The second and third, an elephant and dragon, are still going strong after 3 and 2.5 years, respectively. The fourth, which is the Hello Kitty, started to have problems after a few months. The motor started making a very loud noice, the base became very hot and the mist slowed considerably. Crane's response has been fantastic. They are going to replace. Will send an update when the replacement arrives and has had some use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but not practical","review":"We bought this humidifier for our nursery because it had many good reviews, but after reading the instruction packet, we decided to take it back without even using it. The reason: it is not supposed to be put on anything that could be damaged by water (wood, metal, etc.) and cannot be placed on a towel because the fan is on the bottom. That pretty much leaves plastic furniture, which we have, but another instruction is that it should be kept out of the child's reach (reasonable enough), but plastic furniture could never be stable enough to repel an adventurous child trying to reach the very cute humidifier. We want something that will be usable as our child grows and learns to walk, but this obviously will not work for us.On another note for those still considering buying it, while it says \\"1 gallon\\" in the title of this product, the box says 2.1 gallons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product for the price","review":"Humidifier is quiet compared to other cool mist humidifiers. Big plus for me is that there are no filters to buy or replace. On the negative side (very minor) is that it cannot be on the floor and needs to be on the table. For it to be very effective, I keep it next to the bed. Overall a great product for the price I paid."},{"rating":"1","title":"CANNOT be set on carpet, floor, or wooden furniture - so where do you put it?","review":"Just pulled this thing out of the package (the frog model) and discovered what is NOT spelled out on the outside packaging: that it cannot be set directly on carpet, floor, or wooden furniture because the cool mist comes out the BOTTOM of this model. WTF??? Who thought this was a good idea? Think about it: the only way for this thing to function completely effectively is to set it up on top of an open structure of some kind. (Because cold falls, heat rises -- so the cool mist will go *downward*, not up to where my child lies sleeping.) Do I have any openwork structure like that in my house to set it on? (I guess you could use one of those plastic milk crates.) At ten-thirty at night, do I want to go wandering around looking for something appropriate to set this thing on? No, I do not. Crane, some bachelor engineer must have designed this thing for you! I'm returning it ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted a while then died.","review":"When I was trying to find a humidifier for my son I looked at all the reviews. I had some reservations due to some poor comments regarding this humidifier. I decided to go ahead with it because I've heard Amazon has a really good customer service department.I've had this item for over a month now and it works perfectly. It arrived at my door in a timely manner as promised and was packaged well.*Update*So this humidifier worked for a few months then died out. Of course with this type of humidifier you are also going to get all that white residue over everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very messy, hard to clean.","review":"The shape of the tank made it very difficult to pour in water or clean. Also, if the top cover is not perfectly closed, the collected water drips from the gap. This made a big mess in our bedroom.You need to clean both the tank and the base of this humidifier everyday because the water collects in the base as well, and it is easy to have the mold growth on the base.We got rid of this humidifier because it was too difficult to keep it clean and bacteria free. Now that my baby walks about, having this in her room would have been too dangerous anyways."},{"rating":"1","title":"It came to me cracked!!!","review":"I have one humidifier by Crane and I LOVE it, this one however came to me cracked in the main water holding tank, when we tried to fill it, it leaked everywhere!

After troubleshooting and contacting the company, they instructed me to return it, because I received a faulty product. When I received the replacement, it had the same problem. I am receiving a refund instead of taking chances on a third malfunctioning product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Playful Frogs","review":"I purchased two frog humidifiers two years ago and I love them! The frogs are easy to fill, quiet and cute. (Unlike those ugly brown/white units that take up a lot of floor space.) The mist comes out of the top of his eyes. My skin appreciates the moisture the frog gives the room.For some reason, I decided I needed to get a large humidifier. After researching larger models on-line, I've decided to purchase more frogs or maybe a different animal this time.From research, I've discovered that the larger models have a costly filter, are hard to fill becuase of weight, and are noisey.When I sleep, I can't have white noise in the background-not even a fan. The frog in our bedroom is more than welcome because he is quiet and allows me to sleep.I highly recommend frog to anyone who needs to get a humidifier. For the price it is worth the try."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good humidifier....","review":"its nice owning one of this... helped a lot with my son.. definitely recommend this to all parents... i hate cleaning it though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My baby love it!","review":"It is a great looking and working humidifer! In Chicago this time the year gets really dry, this help us get better sleep at night. My baby love the way the Frog looks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the directions, so many limitations!!!","review":"I bought the frog humidifier and it was already broken. Nothing happened when I plugged it in, no light went on and no mist came out. What also bothered me is that the instructions (but nowhere on the outside of the box) goes on and on about \\"Must place 2 feet above the floor,\\" \\"Don't put on carpet,\\" and \\"Don't put on wood.\\" It would be nice to know all these limitations BEFORE buying! I returned the Frog and bought a sunbeam cool mist humidifier at Home Depot. I can't remember the name or model off the top of my head, but it looks kind of like an Easter basket, and I love it. No problems with placing this on the carpeted floor and it works like a charm!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute Piece of Crap","review":"Bought this for my daughters room (the cow version). It was cute. A tadbit bigger than I expected but that was no problem. I used it for a week and every morning for the first few days, when I woke up the red light would be on. There was still water in it and it still seemed to emitting mist but the red light wouldn't go off no matter how many times I cleaned it or adjust the water level sensor as the directions suggested. Eventually got tired of messing with the darn thing and returned it.Separately, I found it annoying that the tank dripped water when you took it off of the base to refill it. Also, on the cow, the top part with the spots and the horns is separate piece form the rest of the tank and when you take it off, there was also a lot of condensation built up between those two pieces so that dripped everywhere also.One bright spot - the return process via Amazon was really convenient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent humidifier, adorable, affordable.","review":"We purchased the elephant humidifier for our nursery when our munchkin was four months old. He is now six months and we still use this every day.Pros-Cool humid air that you can see flowing from the unit-Doesn't soak the carpet or leave a puddle on the dresser like some others we've tried-QUIET!!!! Some sounds of water trickling on the highest setting but it seems to relax the baby-Large enough to run through the entire night and small enough to easily carry when refilling-Blends in to the nursery so it can be left out all the time\\\\Cons-I usually wipe down humidifiers regularly but this one doesn't have a way for you to fit your hand into the tank. It has NOT gotten dirty or slimy though so I guess this is not so much a problem with the product as with my way of thinking. Many other models require scrubbing and this one doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had two of them - both died in ~3 months","review":"They have a problem with a fan that circulates the moist air. I had two of them and both died after about 90 days. I was able to solder-in a fan from computer cooling case to fix both units, they run a little loud, but at least it works. You would expect a $40 humidifier to last longer then 3 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hello Kitty Crane Cool Mist Humidifier","review":"Received it on Friday and started using it straight away in my 2 yr old daughter's room to help alleviate her dry skin during fall-winter months. It seems to have worked.Pros: Cute design, started working instantly, has a very soft purple color light glow, seems to perform as advertised, and runs quietly on all but the lowest settings.Cons: Over-priced compared to quality, ultra-cheap light-weight plastic Chinese components (handle with great care), at medium to high settings moisture will accumulate under and around the humidifier (I placed ours in a tray to protect the wood furniture is sits on), and the purple night light is not sufficiently bright enough to be used for that purpose.Verdict: I would recommend this product since it works as advertised, but had to deduct 1 star for poor quality. I don't expect it to last long-term though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twins Enjoy It","review":"I purchase the Elephant for my son and Frog for my daughter. They both enjoy the look of it in their rooms. It is small enough that I can put it on top of their furniture and not have to worry about ruining their expensive dresser. I enjoy the fact that there is no filter to replace. Filling them is extremely easy since it is so small it fits right in the bathroom sink.I did no give it five stars because when you lift the water tank to fill it water drips out of the bottom and if you flip it over out of the top. I just make sure I bring a towel with me when I am filling them so I can easy clean up any spills.I would still recomend any of the two I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steady vapor, but some quirks","review":"I got the elephant shape for our (adult) bedroom, and it works really well with a steady stream of vapor, which is the most important part.There are a few quirks:One, there's a slight trickling or gurgling sound. That may be an added bonus for some people who like those white-noise makers that imitate waterfalls etc. Personally, I rather have no sound in my bedroom so I shut it off at night.Two, the elephant mask that sits on top of the water container does slip off rather easily, so you need to be careful to catch it when moving or refilling.Three, the refilling takes only a few seconds under the faucet, but you need to make sure you don't sit it down in the sink because it is uneven, and the handle might break.Four, it does not have space to add Vick Vaporub etc., and the vapor is cold. So if you're looking for hot steam applications, don't buy it.But overall, it truly is ADORABLE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"i like it,and my family like it too","review":"it's very cool and funny,easy to use.i like it,and my family like it too ,My nose and skin feel better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good product","review":"quiet and great output but needs a stronger fan. sometimes i feel that the fan is not strong enough because the mist just immediately hits the ground."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for six weeks","review":"The Crane was very quiet for about two weeks.

It does the job nicely, it's easy to assemble, to fill and to operate. My only problem is with the manual. Crane puts out several varieties in the shape of different animals and my manual had photos of another version -- not the penguin I had bought. And the parts differ slightly from each, so you have to do a little guessing as to where things go. Things get figured out fairly quickly, mainly because you keep moving the parts around till they click into place. Anyhow, it's all together now, it works okay and so far, it looks like a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't believe how well this item works!","review":"I bought this Crane Elephant Humidifier because I was so tired of the Vicks models I've tried.

Until it breaks","review":"I bought this from Target about a year ago. It worked well and pumped out lots of cool mist. However, my unit failed in a very bad way. The ultrasonic element overheated and detached from the base of the humidifier causing the contents of the tank to flow through the device(and the powered fan) on to my table and on to the floor.I suspect this device has a design flaw in the empty tank detector. It always shut off the fan correctly but I bet it never shut off the ultrasonic element."},{"rating":"2","title":"cute and does the job","review":"I picked this up in target for about 30 bucks or so and it's done it's job so far. The penguin's belly can hold about 1 gal and I usually set it on medium humidification for the night. This leaves about 1/2 tank full in the morning. The mist at the high settings is very high, so you can definitely get moisture into the air quickly. I used the walgreens sunbean model for about 1 day before it decided to break, so I hope this one will last.Strengths:simple to use, variable humidity control, easy to refill, no mold yet, enough mist for a small roomWeakness:cheap contruction, no controls to stop from over-humidification"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Penguin","review":"The Penguin humidifier is truly adorable--and for about a week it was incredibly wonderful. Completely quiet--little penguin gently misted the bedroom. Then one day I smelled that electric burning smell and ran to the bedroom. There was plenty of water in penquin, and he was misting away--but he surely smelled like something was wrong. I unplugged penguin and emptied the water and took a look. There was a small crack in the plastic base which seemed like it would allow water to leak through to the motor. Hmmm. Poor little penquin went into the trash--I sent more plastic to the landfill. A sad end for all. I am hoping that this was just a freak accident of my penquin--and the rest of the penquins and frogs and so forth are still going strong. But I don't think I want to drop another 30 bucks to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for kids","review":"We bought this when I hit my annual bout of bronchitis and found that the old humidifier was pretty much dead. I honestly wasn't expecting much, just something that spits out some water and looks cute, with a higher price tag for the Kitty. I was pleasantly surprised to find that this is actually a very high-quality humidifier, with all of the bells and whistles found on others in the same price range. Others boast two settings, this one has an entire adjustable range of settings. It doesn't make a sound at all and it's easy to fill and to clean. The nightlight is cute, but not very useful, as the LED power indicator is extremely bright and puts out more light than the nightlight does. Still, though, it's a soft purple and very soothing to look at.Science has shown that happy thoughts can help contribute to quicker healing and recovery, and something this adorable can definitely add to that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might be cute, but the humidifier fails after 2 month","review":"I bought the penguin humidifier when my daughter had a cold. My wife and I picked it out, because it was cute, and a decent price.Every time we filled it, (and yes we followed all instructions with the unit) the output knob had to be adjusted, so that mist would come out. This just kept getting worse and worse. After about 60 days (using it only at night) the unit quit working.Evidently Crane does not exist on the internet, nor can you actually find who makes these units, to try to get a replacement.All in all a complete waste of $30. Dont get it. Get something more expensive, and a brand name you can trust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Product for kids","review":"I only rate an item if it's extremely good, or really poor, and this item is great. We bought it for our daughter because she would cough at night. After we put it in her room it really reduced her coughing. It also doubles as a great night light. We liked it so much we bought a similar humidifier that was in the shape of a panda, but it was not nearly as good as the hello kitty product, and it didn't have the night light feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thomas Humidifier","review":"I should have looked at the reviews before buying. My son loved being able to have Thomas in his room. However, much like the other two reviewers giving this a bad review, the plastic light piece on my tank also disengaged and fell into the water tank after very limited use. I was hoping there might be some way to fix it (as I figured it out before putting it on the base unit) but because I can't reach the piece, I have no hope of using waterproof glue to reattach. I agree that this is a major hazzard and the product should be recalled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product","review":"This product always had problems. I'd turn it on and I'd hear the sounds of water bubbling, but no mist would come out. I'd open it up and see all of the mist trapped on the inside. I learned that it would only work if I turned it on immediately after placing the frog head on top, while the water was pouring into the basin. So that was okay, it was inconvenient but I could deal with that. Then after a few months, it stopped working altogether. The green light turns on, and if I open it up I can see the water swirling in the center, but no mist forms.Even when it did work, it didn't do a good job humidifying the room. This product is more about looks than function. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality, broken after 2 weeks","review":"The quality of this product is very poor.

After 1 week it made weird sounds when I turned it on. I found that if I turned the wheel in the base a bit it would work but that worked 2x. I think the fan is broken. It creates mist which either stays in with the water or leaks out the back bottom a bit. Not enough fan to get the mist up to the penguin's beak.I spent too much money on this to have it break down after so little use. Will be contacting Crane on Monday for suggestions. I hate filters so will be looking for a better made product that is also filter free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, nice but didn't last 2 months!!!","review":"Makes me sick.

Now he only goes to bed if his new toy is lit and puffing white clouds into the air. He doesn't mind that it's a bit noisy.So far the humidifier has performed well, no mechanical breakdowns to report. It's very cute, easy to operate, maintenance free - just fill up with tap water and plug in.One little plastic trim piece has come off, and that's why I'm giving this product 4 stars and not 5, but to me that's a minor quibble compared to the piece of mind knowing that my kid is happy falling asleep with his favorite train humming piecefully next to his bed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke the first night!!","review":"My husband and I followed all the instructions for proper use.

I bought it to raise the humidity and it has made about a 10 percent humidity change for the better. I use tap water so I get a thin film on my glasses (and everything else probably) overnight but this wipes off easily. My only complain is a slight design flaw: When you lift the water reservoir (penquin body) off the base to refill it, it drips water pretty much from the whole circumference of the base. But I figure it has to evaporate and go into the air....hey you wanted to raise the humidty level didn't you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken one delivered.

It's cute as can be and when you fill it up it takes a long time (maybe 2 days) for the water to all be used up. It's quiet other than the constant dripping sound it makes. I think it sounds like rain dripping from the window sills so it can be relaxing if you think of it that way. The only thing I really don't like about it is the awful white dust it produces and I've used it with and without a filter and still get the same white dust. It's very fine and the only place I see it is stuck to the TV screen and in our air purifiers but there's a lot of it. Kind of gross. Still worth it though to have a great little humidifier for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made Us Sick!!","review":"There are too many nooks and crannies for pathogens like mold, fungus or bacteria. It is near impossible to get this thing well-cleaned. You cannot get your hand or a scrub brush into the basin to thoroughly remove residue or film. I noticed that after a few months of use, the humidifier actually made my family and me very sick. We had flu-like symptoms and I was short of breath. It turns out the the cool mist humdifier was making us sick by dispersing a commonly found bacteria into the air (Serratia marcescens). We could not remove the pink film completely from the humidifier so we threw it out. Actually, we had TWO - an elephant and a frog. We didn't have to worry about bacteria in the frog because it croaked within weeks of using it!! Junk. If you are susceptible to lung irritants, consider an evaporative humidifier.

I had the previous one for two years and no problems (the old one still works - but I like to replace them in that time frame). This humidifier unlike many of them - you can actually see the mist very clearly being emitted into the air. Close the room and it works very quickly. I can begin to tell a difference within 5 - 10 minutes. I like that there is no filter to change. It's convenient, works perfectly, super quiet; very nice. The penguin is the best designed one in my opinion, because not only can the head of the penguin be moved in position - but also the mist comes out of the penguin's 'beak' instead of just shooting straight up into the air. It's also the most attractive and versatile model as well. I would highly recommend this one. Refill/clean at least once a week and you're pretty much good to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful with the handle","review":"The handle for the water ressevoir broke off the first time we used it.

On a completely full tank with the spray knob turned up at high, the humidifier lasts for about two nights, so I guess, 24 hours.I know most people bought these for their kids, but I'm in my twenties and thoughts this was a totally fun accessory for my bedroom.

And since it's cool, it only rises about 3-6 inches from the vents and then immediately sinks. If you're trying to humidify a room, you'd have to keep it on all day and keep it up high.Filling the basin is more of a pain than it should be. It must be filled upside down and carried supporting the bottom. The manual recommends not using the handles when the basin is filled with water.The one thing I did like about this humidifer is that it is relatively quiet.

It's perfect for the baby's crib area, and keeps the baby fascinated too because of it's bright color.It requires regular cleaning and maintenance, but so do all humidifiers.There are a couple of things to be taken care of like using it off the floor and not placing it on a carpeted surface (both requirements ensure a good airflow) -- so read the instruction manual thoroughly.I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Traps mildew and mold- hard to clean!","review":"The inside of this tank has so many cracks and crevices that mildew and mold collect in spots that are impossible to clean, even with wire brushes! I follow the instructions to clean it with vinegar and even do it 2x a week. It is used so frequently that the tank is rinsed and refilled a lot. I have another Crane (the tear drop shaped one) and have NEVER had a problem with mildew/mold growing.

It's relatively easy to fill and it lasts for a while. I haven't done any humidity measurements to see how effective this product is, but the streams of vaporized water coming out the cow ears work psychologically for me. My fiance loves the cowness of it, so that's a plus.I used to wake up with a dry throat and the occasional bloody nose, but it hasn't happened much recently (perhaps still a little dry in the throat). Since the weather is warming up there's no way for me to tell which factor is really contributing.Given that many of the bad reviews for this product have been more long-term product failures, it makes sense that this review is a little positive.

Here's a link to my youtube how-to video: http://youtu.be/EjRDjOL8nCYObviously, if you don't use the humidifier as frequently, it won't start to rattle as soon, but we were using it most every night for about 3 months strait. I've used other (boring) humidifiers in the past that don't begin to rattle, so I'm giving this 4 stars.

So I had to send it back to Amazon, who by the way were so fantastic about the return. Well, when the new one came, two day shipping!, it worked great. My only complaint would be that there's a funky smell whenever I use it. I've tried cleaning it and putting good smelly stuff in it, like febreeze and vaporub but the smell just keeps on coming back. So other than that it's a great little humidifier. The smell isn't strong or really all that terrible, it's just a little annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product but one small issue","review":"I recieved this Humidifer for my son who has allergies and Acid Reflux and it worked great for about a week, then out of nowhere it stopped working.

It is quiet and has a decent capacity. The flow is very adjustable; from a tiny mist to a huge stream.I will say that the one thing I dislike about the cool mist humidifiers is how often you need to clean them. When refilling it, I smell for mold and also note any slime or buildup on the parts. It really needs to be cleaned about once a week. The white vinegar rinse and wipe method works ok, but this makes me miss our old evaporative humidifier (even though it scaled up and failed, and was an energy hog, it rarely needed any cleaning)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks & Hard to Empty","review":"The humidifer leaked the first night we used it (all over the back of the dresser it was on). I then ran it all day to see if there was a cause and it didn't leak again so I am not sure what caused it. I ended up returning it as there is no way to empty the base without unplugging the entire unit. This is very inconvenient if you plug yours in behind something (plus I noticed it's easy to get the cord wet if you're not careful) and the manual recommends it be emptied every night.On the plus side, it was very quiet (much quieter than 4 previous brands we have owned), it looks great (we got the dragon)and puts out visible cold vapors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Humidifier I've owned!","review":"We've gone through many humidifiers over the years and most don't last more than a season. We got this one when our son was born in 2008. It is by far the best we've owned! VERY quiet with lots of output and a nice large tank. We use it all winter and whenever he's got a cold. Cleaning and maintenance have been easy.I loved the Crane humidifier so much that we bought the smaller capacity tear drop shaped oneCrane 2.3 Gallon COOL Mist humidifierfor our bedroom. It works just as well as the Penguin and just as quietly! 2 years later it's still going strong and I have recommended these humidifiers to friends and family ever since."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potential safety hazard","review":"I read the negative reviews and choose to ignore them. Bad mistake. Yes it looks cute and yes it performs ok while it works. However after only a half dozen nights, it stops working, making a weird gurgling sound. The worst part is that then the water started to overflow from the base and leaked everywhere in the room. Imagine almost 1 Gl of water pouring on your furniture, floor and over an electric appliance connected to the outlet. Kinda scary picture in a baby's room. Read other reviews. Does not seem like an isolated incident. Seems like a potential product defect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good choice!","review":"I used this for the first time today. During operation, it makes a pleasant bubbly water sound (not enough to keep you awake at all).However, when I went to refill it for overnight use, I noticed it had leaked all over the table!

I had to constantly wash the base. For something that is meant for children, I would have imagine this device to be more mold and mildew resistant. After using it for a month, I gave up and tossed this into the garbage. Why add the extra stress to raising a child and worrying about whether this device is putting mold particles into the air.FYI...I also own a Air-O-Swiss AOS Ultrasonic Humidifier which has never had this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Break easily","review":"First time I ordered this item was when my daughter was born and it was last about 2 years.

This time, it was last a little bit over a month then the same issue occurred. I have to communicate with Amazon customer services for return because it is over 30 days.

This little humidifier is a workhorse. I've had it on nearly 24/7 for the last month of so and it's been chugging away reliably. The one drawback is that when you take the reservoir with it's cover to refill, the condensations drips. A towel to cradle it took care of that. The hum is low and is a combination of a white noise machine and a tabletop fountain - a pleasant addition to drown out snoring and very condusive to sleeping. I've had an elaborate $160 Bionaire humidifier that didn't perform this well. This a great product and have recommended it to many friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaked","review":"I ordered this for my son's room. I used it once, and it worked fine.

We thought it was a little mold, but after trying to clean it off we realized it was the paint flaking away, revealing the lighter color underneath. So that means that tiny paint flakes we're mixing in with the water. I don't know if those were small enough to aerate with the mist, but if so, that's why I'm giving it one star.We're going to give Crane one more try. We just bought the penguin model. We're going to keep an eye on this and put in another review if this happens again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does its job well","review":"We had Vicks humidifier which works well but we had to change filter every 6 months.

We did not run it every night - only when he was congested. First it started making strange noises when we would turn it on, which made us wonder how much longer it would last. Then my son accidentally knocked it over and the tank broke. We had it set on a small stool (about one foot off of the ground), so we were surprised that there was a huge hole in the side of the tank after such a short fall. Given the strange noises it was making and how easily it broke, I would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good humidifier, but didn't last","review":"I bought the frog humidifier back in 2008 and it's still working great. When we had another child I got another one for his room, because we liked the first one so much. This time I got the penguin. Worked great until last week, now it doesn't have any mist come out.

At first I was wondering why the heck was my table getting soaked from the steam, but yes, you do have to adjust the steam, it should go up into the air and not arch downward, so don't put it on the highest setting, it will defeat the purpose. I like the sound of it, and its so calming that it puts the baby to sleep. The only problem is that I put some Eucalyptus oil into it, but didn't smell it in the vapor. I did feel the difference in the air, because in my room there is dry air, but when I used this product I felt the moisture.

I had cleaned it out for the season and was about to put it in the closet when our daughter got a really nasty cold. She has not been sleeping due to congestion, and I figured the humidifier would help a little. When I plugged it in and turned it on, the fan wouldn't come on. I have tried everything I could think of to come to the realization that it is broken. Perfect. And right when our girl is sick.

I called the company after the first one and they said that it sounded like the motor wasn't working correctly there for not sending the mist up high enough in the room. So we returned it and tried again. Same problem! I thought it must have been the 'lot' so I went to Target and purchased a third unit. Not only did the third one leave a puddle on the table but it wouldn't turn off without unplugging it from the wall. We bought the Crane 'Frog' and it is working beautifully.

I noticed when I turned it on that the fog has been coming out from the bottom instead of the top. When I unscrewed the bottom to take a look inside everything was corroded. When I tried to reassemble it the screws where impossible to get back in.I am debating if I should have a crap product replaced with $15 shipping or recreate my own bludgeoning scene from Office Space.was it work the money I paid for?

I strongly urge against this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic light cover fell off on first refill","review":"This is a nice humidifier, with cool vapor coming out the smoke stack and a light to make the train glow at night, like a big night light. However, to make the train light up, a blue light bulb protrudes up into the water reservoir, protected by a small transparent cap that is part of the reservoir itself. That cap is simply press fitted into the water reservoir - from the inside! The cap fell out on the first refill and is very difficult to get back in position - one has to rattle it around, balance it on the end of a pencil inserted through the hole and lower it back into the hole. That done, the fit is so loose that it just falls out again. Some glue might fix it, but for now we have an expensive night light."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is junk","review":"The only good thing about this product is that it's cute.

I plan on trying to return it today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and handy but a pain to refill.","review":"This little guy does his job pretty well, but is a pain to refill.

The spring which holds the holding tank closed while upside down started rusting after a few weeks of overnight use.

She actually gets excited when I bring him out and put it on. Besides being cute, it's a good humidifier in that it's a cool mist so it's safe for children. It uses ultrasonic technology so you don't need a filter although there is a demineralization filter for it you can use in order to prevent mineral build-up if your water is too hard. It has a mist adjustment knob which is nice. The only thing I don't like about it is the cleaning and maintenance is pretty extensive.

The separated chambers do not lock together in any helpful way, causing water to leak out of every possible crack at the slightest touch or movement. Which is always a safe and fun feature for children's electrical equipment. It's hard for me to fully articulate how much we loathe this horrible piece of junk, and the only thing stopping me from drop-kicking it is the fact that it would explode mid-air and I'd have to sheepishly pick up all the shattered pieces off the front yard. Still, I'm planning a suitable destruction of it in the near future, something hilarious and permanent, that involves me looking directly in the penguin's dead eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Purchase ever","review":"this was the worst purchase ever; it never even worked.

The first was for my daughter's room, the second would eventually be for our bedroom. I ran the humidifier per the instructions the first evening, ensuring the stream of mist wasn't saturating the floor. The result, the humidity in my daughter's room never got about 20%. She awoke the next day coughing and with a dry nose. The next evening I tried it on full throttle, despite the instructions. After running the whole night the room made it up to 25% humidity (with my former humidifier it got up to 40%). In my last attempt I simply removed the penguin's head, to see if that would result in better room saturation. Unfortunately, it led only to a very wet dresser and humidifier.Besides all of these negative tests, I had to refill the penguin half-way into the evening, since the reservoir had run out.1/2 star"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, would be nice if it had turned on","review":"Adorable, yes.

Up until that unfortunate incident, it worked well and he loved trying to catch the mist if he was under it while it was turned on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous and loved","review":"When the last elephant died, due to mold inside, we were informed by the 6 year old that she only wanted another 'Ele'. These are great humidifiers. This, the newest model, comes with clearer instructions on how to clean it and so should last longer. The mist comes out of the elephant trunk and gets fairly high into the air. We set it up on a stool near her bed and it helps tremendously all winter long. Because this model has a single point of electronics (the dial on the front) it is easy for her to turn off in the morning when she wakes up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent humidifier","review":"This worked very well, and concentrated the flow of mist toward the person's face while in bed, which is what the doctor said a humidifier should do. After my son and his wife used it for several months on a regular basis for their baby, the fan quit working. I was disappointed that it quit working, as it was a good humidifier. But, they did use it a lot. I just thought it would last longer. My youngest, teenage son liked it better than another we got on sale later. I would recommend the penguin humifidier. I don't imagine others will use it as much as my son and his wife did, so maybe it quit because of their using it so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work","review":"Okay so I originally ordered two of these crane humidifiers, one Hello Kitty and the other Sponge Bob. The Sponge Bob one worked no problems, great. The problem is the Hello Kitty one only worked for about two hours and then stopped working. I tried to troubleshoot and all I could think of was empty it out, dry it and start all over, which I did and got the same results. I called the manufacturer and they told me it sounds like a faulty unit so they sent me the warranty information, which stated to return part of the item and if I wanted a replacement I needed to send in a check for $25 for shipping and handling, which I do not think is fair because it's not my fault the unit does not work. I already paid for the unit which did not work properly from the get go and now I have to spend more money on it. I did not think that was fair."},{"rating":"1","title":"crane is a bad bad bad brand","review":"I bought like 3 units of this brand: hello kitty, elephant, now the thomas the train, all three stopped working after 1 use,, yes, only one use.... the hello kitty will not mist no matter how I adjust the level; the elephant will not mist too; now the thomas the train, this junk has a very bad water sensor, after the first use, the water overflowed from the tank and all the things around the humidifier were soaking wet.

If you need one for your room why not get one that adds to your decor. Other humidifiers may work just fine but are limited in their color selections.

It leaves the surface I put it on soaking wet from the mist. I have to bring a towel with me and wipe it down. Its hard to clean the inside.

The hygrometer I purchased gives the humidity perecentage when the level reaches 20%, otherwise it reads \\"Lo.\\" After trying it for 3 nights, putting it on as soon as we got home and shutting it off before leaving for work, the humidity level in our room did not get above the \\"Lo\\" reading. So even if it went from 15% to 19% that's not a good level. It should be anywhere from 40-50% using a humidifier. Yet a steamy shower in the bathroom next door will raise the humidity level in our bedroom to 21-23%. So the hygrometer does work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too fragile, cheap construction","review":"What a cheap piece of junk.

At full blast, it would take literally 3 days to deplete a single tank.And I wish it was confined to the first one we got. We got 2 replacements from Crane that worked the exact same way.

It also started emitting a moldy smell, again, after less than a month ...I tried cleaning it according to the Crane video on YouTube. To no avail. The thing is junk.It's cute.

I was excited by all the great reviews that the product/brand received. Unfortunately, this one didn't even have a chance to break because it never started working properly in the first place. While I have no doubt that this is a great product for those of you whom it actually worked for, I was not able to enjoy the same experience. I only gave it one star because there was not an option to leave it starless or that would have been my choice. I believe that a products that do not work properly to begin with do not deserve to be on the shelves at popular stores, only to have consumers like myself purchase them and later have to deal with the hassle of returning the product due to a defect."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok for kids room...","review":"We bought the cow and crane humidifier last year and barely used them. They are perfect for a childs small room. And hopefully they have white furniture because it DOES leave a film. This year we bought the Honeywell HCM-300T QuietCare 3-Gallon UV Tower Humidifier and L O V E it!! You can control the humidity level and it is quiet. It is easy to fill and clean & comes with a filter. When it got really dry the winter and it was like 11% in the house I can crank this baby up to 35% and then switch it down so it will auto start when it gets below the desired level. I think we bought it at our local Home Depot store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would definitely recommend","review":"Our pediatrician said that we needed to get a cool mist humidifier for our three year old's room to help with sinus issues she has. A friend who has 4 girls heard we needed one, and bought us this as a gift. She said she has 4 of them at her house - one for each girl - and figured my daughter would love it, too. Well, she does, and I do as well! It's extremely quiet, I love the night light feature, and it's very easy to fill and clean. It's also helped us with the \\"monster\\" problem we have - we told our daughter that Hello Kitty will keep any monsters away as long as the steam is coming out, and she will now sleep in her room without any fuss.It's made a huge difference with how much she gets sick, and I definitely plan on buying another cool mist humidifier for our bedroom. I adore the Hello Kitty one, and have recommended it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent product at a good price","review":"I have been using this for about 2 months now and i have no complaints.

It was mentioned in the product manual that i shouldnt use the handle when the container is filled with water since its a delicate construction. That's weird.

I wasn't too upset as this was a lower end model and I had used the humidifier everyday for at least 8 hours.To humidify with my extremely dry apartment, I bought a new crane penguin humidifier. Unfortunately, the new crane penguin was not up to standard! Crane has improved its design, making it easier to clean. However, do note that this new humidifier produces ONLY A FRACTION of the mist (1/5 of mist compared to my 2009 model)! I think this is an attempt to increase the intervals (approximately once every 48 hours) before one needs to refill the humidifier. I actually bought and returned this humidifier twice before giving up and switching to the SPT penguin humidifier (cheaper and works well)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, really cute","review":"I bought the elephant at target when my 3 year old got croup. It's a great humidifier. Amount of mist that you want to come out is fully adjustable and you can direct it with the elephant's trunk. It's super, super quiet. The barely audible \\"glug, glug\\" sound that happens every once in a while when the water goes down a level may possibly bother the lightest sleeper. Haven't had any leaks or cracks so far but it's only been a week. The only drawback that I see to this and every other humidifier that I've seen is that it's hard to thoroughly clean and dry the tank with the little hole it has for an opening. It would be nice to be able to screw off the top of the tank to really get in there."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so great","review":"i bought two of this brand. the frog shape one works great for already 1 year. the kitty shape one broke in about 1 week. it generated loud grinding noise. i had to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Little Penguin!","review":"This humidifier is great!

Most students know that living in a dorm room can be tough, especially with the dry and stale air. It can be really difficult to sleep in a room like that, so a humidifier is a good plan and this one is perfect for my designed single. It's quiet enough to not bother me while I'm sleeping, and it keeps me from coughing/waking up incredibly thirsty in the middle of the night. And the one-gallon size is neither too big nor too small. Oh, and it is completely adorable and satisfies my obsession with penguins. :)I gave it 4 stars because mine is a little leaky. Nothing that can't be solved with a dining hall tray underneath it, but it is a little annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not reliable and therefore not recommended","review":"After our initial purchase of this Elephant shape humidifier, less than 45 days in, it started making a really loud fan noise from the underside fan and would inconsistently start fanning loudly when we ran it - unfortunately, this often happened at night and woke our heavy-sleeping daughter up (we live in NYC on First Ave.). We promptly returned it to Amazon and got a replacement which died after 34 days with no just cause. This was on a flat surface, atop a dresser, and was consistently refilled. Because it was beyond the first 30, we couldn't re-return it to Amazon and now we have a dead unit.All the negative reviews on Amazon mention one or both of these issues so I can't in good conscience recommend this to anyone.

We have had both for about 2 months and both have broken due to poor design. There is no tray for holding the water in the base of the humidifer, so the water sits directly in the base. (This was a problem for cleaning the humidifier, but I could deal with that.) The fan is below the water resevoir of the base. Both humidifiers cracked so water seeped into the fan area--very dangerous if you ask me! The water goes pouring out of the bottom of the humidifier over a fan motor and close to the electrical cord. Caused water damage to our floor and a bookcase.

Produced lots of mist without white dust (I use filtered water). But it only worked for ONE day. There are 2 lights, green for when it's working, and orange when there's not enough water. After the perfect 1st day, then orange light went on even with a full tank of water and stopped producing any mist. Very disappointed at the inferior quality. Returned the frog and bought a penguin, I hope this one lasts.Update Feb 2013:Bought a blue penguin from the same manufacturer, it lasted 7 months and started leaking at the bottom. Tossed it. Bought a yellow duck and a gray elephant and they both lasted years. I guess it's hit and miss with these humidifiers. For some reason, the duck and frog (weaker mist from 2 spouts) are quiet but elephant and penguin are louder (strong mist from 1 spout).

I bought this particular humidifier based on the fact that it received high marks from other reviewers. Is it cute? Yes. Is it easy to operate? Yes. Is it inexpensive? Yes. But, I felt it wasn't terribly effective, so I bought a hygrometer to measure the humidity in the air and was disappointed, but not surprised, at the results. Leaving this humidifier on high all day in a small bedroom with the door closed never raised the humidity percentage more than 10%-15%. Perhaps, these results will remain the same with another humidifier, but I'm guessing not.

The first one after 5-6- months, the second after less than two months of actual use.It is clearly the fan, the only moving part, and when it starts making noise there is nothing one can do, just turn it off. It is loud enough to wake up children and adults and definitely too loud to stand even when awake.Clearly the components are not up to the task and the manufacturer is putting garbage into these things.It is disappointing because of the waste of money and because we like it when it works but is definitely too expensive for playing hit-or-miss or replacing it after two months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Penguin Humidifier","review":"This is the second Crane penguin humidifier I've owned.

In the last three years I have had to purchase three of these because they quit working. We use a humidifier about six months out of the year and so technically they only last us six months.

The hardest thing was to get her to choose which animal she wanted- that took forever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't recommend","review":"We actually got 2 of these of our baby registry and figured we'd use one in our bedroom instead of returning. Big mistake, I should've exchanged it so I wasn't left with two broken ones! We had these in 2 seperate areas (nursery and master bedroom) and in both areas, the mist all fell to the floor and COMPLETELY soaked the carpet or the night stand they were sitting on. Since we of course didn't want all the mildew soaking up in the carpet, so then we figured we'd jerry-rig it and put a towel underneath both of them... BIG mistake. This stopped the fans completely and broke them both!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to clean","review":"We've been using this Penguin humidifier for about a year now. It works great, but it has one critical flaw: You can't open the tank up for a thorough cleaning.If you've ever used a humidifier for more than a few days, you know that algae and slime buid up pretty extensively on any surface the water comes into contact with. This is to be expected. However, the tank on this Penguin has only one small filling port that is much too small to get your hand through. So, ever week or so I can clean off all the accumulated slime and algae in the base and the outside surfaces of the thank, but the inside surfaces of the thank go uncleaned. It's pretty disgusting inside that tank after one year of not being cleaned.If I could do it over again, I would have picked a humidifier with a design that allows for cleaning of all surfaces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay at first, then broken","review":"I bought this humidifier for my daughter's room. It worked fine for a short time, maybe a week or so, and then it started making a lot of noise. I could jiggle or tap it and it would stop for a day or two, then it started doing it constantly and nothing I could do would make it stop. It was a really loud grinding noise, definitely not something we could ignore. I also found that you couldn't turn the mist up very high or it would condense and leak out from under the face plate. We just returned it rather than trying to get another and I am going to try something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is good one","review":"Received on time. So far it works as expected.

Earlier when I went to refill it, i lifted off the top and water went everywhere all over the floor, all over me and the shelf it was on.

If it did, you'd hafta refill it's tiny reservoir every couple hours anyhow.- poor output- poor capacity- poor adjustability- clumsy to fill / refill (the reservoir cap design defeats its own purpose too)- can't operate on carpeted floor, the air inlet is very easily obstructed- poor durability /reliability"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but it leaks!","review":"Of course all the humidifiers in this line are adorable, and when they function properly, they are very effective. However what I've found with this elephant humidifier is that a small stream of water leaks out of the bottom of the nose and down the front of the unit, right into the dial, or onto my table. I tried sealing it and stuffing a tissue up into the nose, but nothing is working. Looks like my next fix is a new humidifier. This item is way too expensive for me to be waking up to a puddle of water on my table.

It has been great so far! It has a really high range from high to low output, so you can adjust it easily and quickly.

I bought the red dragon design for my son's bedroom. For the first week or so, it worked great! You can see the mist and everything. But then...it started making loud noises. We're not exactly sure why it is so loud. I think it's just an unfortunate feature of ultrasonic humidifiers. They are really touchy and we will never buy another one ever again - of any brand. We tried using distilled water. No dice. We also tried the demineralization filter thing that crane offers, but it still had problems. My husband has to jostle and shake it for about ten minutes every night to get it to run quietly.

I find it to be much more quiet than a table top fountain. Also, his head turns so you can direct the mist, I hadn't seen that in a review yet.From reading other reviews, it sounds like this company's quality control might be a little patchy, as many people said theirs leaked, didn't work well, etc. I was ready to send it back if it was defective, but we seem to have won the penguin shaped humidifier lottery.At least we've got that goin' for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaked Water after 4 month","review":"The product worked great when I purchased it for the new baby's room back in December 2010; it was quite as described and my wife and I loved it.

I do not recomment this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt work","review":"Lame. This product didn't work, at all. Was returned a week after getting it because whats the point of keeping a product that does NOOOOTHING?!Highly recommend buying something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cute and Functional","review":"My daughter chose this humidifier when we needed to get one to help her with nasal dryness. She insisted on the frog and she loves it. At first I did have difficultly getting the mist to come out of the holes above the eyes. But it finally started working. I discovered that if you turn it to it's highest setting you can see the mist better and then you can turn it down to the correct level you want. I had to put it on a wooden tv tray in my daughter's room since it could not be on carpet (carpet would block the vents which on the very bottom of the unit). But it is working well there. I also really like how the water tank can fit under a sink facuet. Makes filling it easier since I can you the bathroom (which is closer to my daughter's room). For the price I paid here on Amazon (which was cheaper than elsewhere) I am very pleased with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not work at all","review":"I usually don't write reviews but this product was so terrible I had to say something. We bought it for our new baby's room based on all the good reviews but it did not create mist, was very loud and didn't actually work at all. It might look cute but the head of the penguin didn't even sit properly on the body. It's a huge waste of money. The motor was so loud I couldn't imagine putting it in a baby room and the mist never made it out of the head despite the dial being on the highest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply does not work","review":"Doesn't work at all. Running at maximum level for 24 hours has zero impact on the humidity level in my apartment, absolutely none."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can't prevent it from soaking the surroundings at high","review":"This is almost useless. At high it will soak the area it is near. At low, well, it's too low. I have a ceiling fan on to circulate it and that helped. Nevertheless, I will return it to Target. The evaporative type is better. The problem with the units I had had once was that they were loud. The fan did turn off when the desired humidity was reached...a good thing which this does have...a bad thing. It did add humidity. Keep your box and reciepts on anything you purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do not place towel under humidifier","review":"I learned the hard way that placing a towel under the unit can impede airflow and cause the unit to fail. The manual DOES warn against it. If you are concerned about water damage to furniture, just make sure you are setting the output properly. Another alternative might be to place it on one of those thin plastic placemats for children. Other than the sometimes difficult-to-open tank cap, I have no complaints about this product and feel they have been essential in keeping my family comfortable through the Winter."},{"rating":"1","title":"ridiculous design error","review":"Think these are cute products, bought the duck and penguin, one each for our kid's rooms. While they work fine to spray the mist, the \\"optional demineralization filter cartridge\\" doesn't fit in either of these models. In the duck, the handle is in the way and the hole may be too shallow. In the penguin, the diameter of the hole is too small. I don't know if the filter will fit in any of the other models, but my suggestion is don't waste your money unless you weren't going to buy the filter anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two in a row defective","review":"The first one stopped working after a few days when the fan that blows mist out of the beak stopped running. I just opened and set up the second one, which leaked onto the floor. On closer inspection, there was a crack in the plastic base. We previously had one of the Penguins for a number of years and were happy with it, but it got misplaced during a move. We're trying for a third -- it seems that quality control at Crane has fallen apart, but it's still a cheap product that seems to be highly rated."},{"rating":"1","title":"2nd Crane to die early","review":"My daughter loves Hello Kitty. We live in dry air, Colorado, therefore I like to keep humidifiers in the kids rooms. I have four kids and 4 Cranes. They are adorable - you can't go wrong there. However, the fan on this Hello Kitty is outrageously loud and not functioning properly after only 3 months. This is the second Crane that I have had this problem with. In the past I have just thrown them out and began again. This time I will see if I can get a replacement. If this turns out to be an easy process, I would rate the humidifier higher. Again - it is adorable! If not, I will likely stop buying Cranes. While they are affordable at the outset, they are not when you have to replace them every 3 to 6 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rainforest!","review":"The Frog works VERY well!!

Too bad, but this thing was all looks."},{"rating":"1","title":"smells very bad","review":"I really wanted to like these, they are just adorable. I ordered two humidifiers (frog and penguin) and both had a strong odor right out of the box. They smell was very chemical like. I decided to give one of them a try to see if the smell would fade.

They are both being returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it !","review":"I bought one based on its popularity in Amazon. But the quality is extremely bad. It only works for the first month, and I found no way to make it work again. No mints come out ever. Nothing is wrong with the operation, nothing is wrong with the electricity.

Buyer beware!","review":"We bought this humidifier for our baby's room, running it at night when our baby slept. After running satisfactorily for a couple of months, it has now started making really loud mechanical noises when turned on, and we are afraid to leave it on for fear of it being a fire hazard (read the other review about the motor catching on fire).It was only when we tried to return it that we realized that despite it being a baby item, Amazon does not include it under the 365-day return policy like it does for other baby items. Perhaps it is because they have had too many cases of people returning it because it just doesn't last for very long. We really liked it when it worked, but now all we have is one more thing taking up space. If you only need something for very occasional use or don't mind getting a new one after two months, then this might be for you. For us we hoped to get something we could trust to leave on in our baby's room overnight, and apparently this isn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"cute and functional","review":"It is what it is, a humidifier but looks like our dog so it's just not an ugly thing on the ground in our room."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"I have received this product today, and it seems good.

There are spaces that I can't clean using a toothbrush, scrub brush, paper towel or anything else, that have developed a pinkish mold which forced me to stop using this humidifier.(2) The humidifier shuts off prematurely, when there is still a shallow amount of water in the reservoir. Unless you catch this quickly, that shallow amount of water sits and grows mold.Overall, this is poorly designed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute","review":"Works great so far. Only one problem, it started making a loud noise, when it was turned on. I drained it and let it dry then wiped off the water level device and it works fine.

When we started using it, I realized that there was a slight problem - because the mist comes out of 2 holes (the ears), it is hard to find a place to put it that doesn't get a wall, a piece of furniture, etc. wet.We also got the penguin humidifier for my other daughter's room and we love it because it shoots the mist straight forward so we are not getting anything wet that we do not want to.There are so many cute choices but I would definitely recommend one that only allows the mist to come out of one opening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped putting out mist","review":"This humidifier started out well enough. It put out mist (not much in comparison to other humidifiers) so we were happy. My son liked the nightlight and having SB in his room. Put it away after last winter and took it out about a month or so ago. It basically stopped misting after a couple of weeks and I can't figure out how to fix it. Not really worth it even though it's pretty inexpensive. I would just save your money and get a real humidifier."},{"rating":"1","title":"headache to clean","review":"This cool mist humidifier is cute and is easy to work BUT not matter how often i clean it, it just keep accumulating scum and hard water stains. The hole to access the water tank is too small to fit your hand or tools inside to clean. The interior of my water tank has turned orange and slimy. The bottom half of this humidifier has many small corners and levels that are also hard to clean, due to bad design. Yes it does do its job, but the headache of cleaning it is not worth it. I can't stand the thought of my son breathing in slimy crusty bacteria filled air. I am switching to a Holmes humidifier HM5082V-U."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really cute, but....","review":"This is the cutest thing ever! And it works well too. The light is not too bright so it works great for a nightlight. It's quiet. My granddaughter loves it! I'm getting one for her room at her house.I wrote the above review when I first received this. It is very cute, but the lightbulb burned out shortly after we started using it and there is no way to change it as far as I can see. It's in a sealed compartment.

I started out with the Hello Kitty one, it stopped working after 3 months. Crane replaced it with a new one. That one stopped working after 1 month. So I figured I'd switch characters and Crane replaced the second one with the Penguin. That worked great for the rest of last winter season (maybe 3 months?). Then I plugged it back in again 2 weeks ago...and it didn't work. From my experience with Crane, I would say they are nice in replacing their faulty humidifiers, but all three of their humidifiers that I've used lasted no longer than 3 months.

I unwrapped the whole thing and picked up the water tank part only to find numerous cracks and a chunk of the tank missing. The chunk that was missing was not even in the box. Obviously another customer purchased it and returned it. Returns must not be checked for damage.

The first one I had for about 2 weeks and it worked great, and then all of a sudden the motor started sounding like a car without a muffler. Even my husband who sleeps through everything couldn't sleep with it on. It was extremely loud. It was still under warranty, so I figured I just got a defective one and exchanged it for a new one. The new one I only used for a few nights, and then I didn't need it anymore for a while, so it sat in it's box. 6 months later, I take it out again, and it's suddenly horribly noisy like the old one. Unfortunately, since it laid in the closet for several months, it's warranty is long over, so I'm stuck with an adorable, but completely useless humidifier.

We have a humidifier from the 1970's, belonging to my parents, so we dragged that out and man, it just blasts the room with awesome hot mist and in no time he was feeling better. I see on the description that it says \\"COOL mist humidifier\\" but I had mistaken that all humidifiers gave off warm/hot air.

So we decided to buy another one for the extra dry winter days. The new penguin looked the same, but the electrical part (bottom half) of the unit was obviously different. The new penguin's vapor appeared weaker than the old one's, apparently there wasn't a fan to blow out the vapor as in the old one. The new penguin was slightly noisier than the old one, though it's still quiet. There was no comparison in the output: The new penguin took 33 hours to use up a gallon of water, while the old one can do it in 14 hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great....for two weeks","review":"We bought this humidifier at another store (rhymes with \\"may mart\\") and it was fantastic for a couple of weeks.

I thought that they were doing something until I bought a hygrometer (measures humidity level). They were not making much difference. So, we bought a warm mist humidifier by Vicks and it works great. Sometimes, it's works too well that I have to be careful that it doesn't exceed 50%, which can be accomplished by setting it low. We still use these Crane humidifiers since we have them. It's better than nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but impossible to clean","review":"I think this humidifier is really cute and works well. However, it is impossible to clean. You can only access the tank from a silver-dollar sized opening, so if any mildew builds up at all, you simply can't get in there to wipe it down and a replacement tank costs just about as much as a new system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed... Want a refund","review":"All this product offers is a cute appearance. It does not produce enough mist, even at the max setting, to counter the driness in my toddler's room. When I observed the mist being produced through the kitty's ears over a week, I couldn't help but to think that a smoker could probably puff out a cigarette smoke bigger than that of this humidifier. Too bad, I can't return the product for a refund because I discard the packaging material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible product - Chemical fumes AND was broken.","review":"This is one of those products that make you think about the \\"safety\\" of plastics. It had a really strong chemical smell. I had originally bought this humidifier for my newborn since some baby books recommend the use of one. However, I'd imagine this chemical smell would be harmful to all people. I was willing to try the product thinking that the smell would go away, but the unit wouldn't turn on - it was probably for the better that it didn't work anyway. Why risk the chemical fumes, especially after all of the trouble I went to purchase BPA-free baby bottles?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Adorable but poorly made","review":"I purchased 2 of these humidifiers for my children, to use nightly, to help with the dry Colorado air. Yes, they are cute, but within two weeks, my son's stopped working (no mist was coming out). I tried all of the trouble shooting ideas in the instruction manual and even contacted Crane. I had to exchange it for a new one.Now, three months later, I will have to return both of them. Once again, the mist has stopped coming out in one of them. The other one continues to leak, enough that after running all night, there is a 1/2 inch pool of water on the tray I placed under the unit. Aside from that, the handle broke off one of them while I was cleaning it.I gave it two stars because this ultrasonic system is much quieter than the evaporative humidifiers I've had in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a Humidifier!","review":"I used this product for about 10 days. I have two different hygrometers whose reads typically differ by a 1%. Both of them didn't register any (any!) variation in the humidity of my (small) bedroom after hours and hours of operation with the door closed! They do register important variations when the shower is on or something is boiling in the on the other side of the house. This is a nebulizer, not a humidifier. The water goes on the floor as soon as it is ejected. Absolutely useless. I am so going to return this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little humidifier!","review":"The humidifier arrived on the expected delivery date. This little humidifier seems to do a great job although I have only had it for one day. It holds a lot of water, it allows you to determine the amount of mist it puts out, and it is quiet. I wanted the humidifier not only for the cool mist but as a 'white noise' too so it could be noisier for my purpose. There is a green light on the front that tells you when the humidifier is on, and that green light is annoying; I don't like extra light in my bedroom. But for parents this could be used a a nightlight. The machine ran all night and did not come close to using up all the water in the Reservoir (the setting was on medium). The machine is easy to fill with water, and it is easy to see the water level. It is of flimsy construction so we'll see how long it lasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy","review":"Be prepared to put down a towel or two in the mist path as this will make your hardwoods nice and slick or your carpets cold and wet.

I bought 2 of these humidifiers. The first one the frog from Target. At first it was very quiet. After about 2 months, the frog started humming and rattling loudly. So we threw that out and bought a second one. This time it was the elephant model. It seemed to work well for a couple months. But then one night I came into the baby's room and there was a horrible plastic smell that burned my nostrils, and my baby was crying. I hope that smell isn't toxic.

I used for maybe a year, until I saw how much better my boss's simple generic heated mister worked.The weak fan makes some noise, but the heated misters are absolutely quiet. The cool mist sink rapidly and I find it hard to believe it's moisturizing anything other than your carpet. You have to use distilled water or buy expensive tablets to easy the debris that accumulates in this tank. Speaking of the tank, it's awkward to unscrew the head, refill and reload. I have been much happier with the local drug store's generic hot air humidifiers for roughly $20, or this one I bought for my mother:Vicks 1.5 Gallon Vaporizer with Night-Light.If you need them to be cute for a child, then put stickers on it, I suppose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after four months","review":"We bought this for my daughter and she loved seeing the steam come out of the penguins mouth.

The dialogue is very poorly written/translated, the characters are annoying and constantly argue over stupid things, and the fact that this is a supernatural anime was not at all made clear by any reviews or summaries, so it felt utterly out of place to us with an introduction of pure (annoying) character development. (Not to mention Yuichi is kind of an ass to all of these girls who like him.) Both of us absolutely would not recommend this anime.

That doesn't often happen when reading any book, much less science fiction work.I stongly recommend \\"Quest of the Three Worlds\\"; unbelievable that someone could imagine that universe and then write about it so well.That said, Norstrilia is a rolicking good time book with rich underlying stories-within-stories.

Well after reading reviews about the quality, I decided to try it out and I am pleasantly surprised. This tape measure surpasses the Lufkin. It's of mostly same quality but feels better when I am holding it. It comes it a bunch or different sizes and styles. It's easily available for order on Amazon.

Regardless of the change in speed, F-Minus are just as aggressive as ever on \\"Wake Up Screaming.\\" The riffs are heavy, the raw attack on the drums adds to the heaviness, the vocals are pure \\"punk-rock.\\" The finished product has a violence and murkiness to it befitting a nightmare.The flaw: 15 songs which are more lengthy than past tracks, in a bad way. The tempo is slower, so as verse/chorus is repeated the music loses it's power. What makes F-Minus so great is their ability to blast out fully structured songs in less than a minute.Positives: The lyrics are good, as always. And throughout the album there seems to be a recurrence of random haunting feedback, which I think totally adds to their garage-punk sound. And a few special moments of in-studio mistakes carelessly unedited, like the ending to \\"Controversy.\\"Overall, a 4-star album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hardcore at its best!","review":"This recent album from F Minus kicks a$$ people!!

After reading it, I went back over the first 50 or so pages looking for a physical description of the hero - a part of Romance Fiction that I see as a great necessity. I found that he was tall, had large hands, a dark brow, was well-educated - but there were none of the stereo-typical \\"brown eyes, broad shoulders, pouting lips\\" that most women read Romance for. I also found the dialog to be lacking in believability. Dialog is difficult for some writers to do convincingly and perhaps Ms. Graham could use some practice in this area.I do congratulate Ms. Graham on having accomplished writing and publishing a novel.

Passages in this book are strangely prophetic to the death he would die in the aftermath of Hitler's Reich. He draws solely from Scripture as his inspiration for each chapter, including the Sermon on the Mount and others. He reveals an apostle-like reverence for Luther, which seems a little over the top and there is a lull in the 3rd quarter or so of the book, but it doesn't not disappoint. It finishes strong and the end is worth the lull.

This is plain to see in his assertions found within, The Cost of Discipleship. This book sets the bar to which all Christians should aim.

Do not be beguiled and deceived by the offer of cheap grace, instead, live for the righteousness found only in Christ. Take up your cross daily and follow Him.

These words of Bonhoeffer are the grand theme of this miraculous theological work. This books calls upon every professed or confessed believer in Christ to examine him or herself. Bonhoeffer pulls no punches, and he has every right to do so. Focusing on the \\"sermon on the mount\\" Bonhoeffer calls on every christian not to just hear the sayings of Christ but to do them! There are few writers who can truly bring us into the presence of Christ, and this is what Bonhoeffer does in \\"The Cost of Discipleship\\".In these times of false teachings and \\"cheap grace\\" as Bonhoeffer puts it, this is a wakeup call for all christians.

She also hopefully helps to expose the often-ineffective and downright inept attempts at \\"treatment\\" that some sufferers have experienced - \\"behavior modification\\" and outright punishment by some therapists that can often result in regression once the patient is discharged."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that all Teenage girls should read","review":"Anorexia is a disease that affects teenagers in every high school. Slim to None helps us to understand this terrible disease. It gives us ideas of some of alternative treatments that could help young girls overcome their obsession with food. Unlike the other books on eating disorders, Slim to None tells the reader exactly how she feels at the time of her deepest sorrows. This gives the reader a real idea of what this terrible disease is about and how it affects an individual both physically and mentally. This book is clearly going to educate readers in a way that no other book will be able to. Slim to None should be read by not only those directly involved with eating disorders, but by everyone. All high school libraries should have a copy available at all times."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book about anorexia I can relate to","review":"As tragic as this story is, I was completely moved by its power to inspire and educate. I learned so much about eating disorders that I've never read before, and perhaps that is because there is a book finally written by someone who is telling us the truth about it -- instead of some Lifetime movie that always turns out happy in the end.Jennifer Hendricks was a beautiful writer and I feel I got to know her really well and connect with her, which I haven't done with an author in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"how could this story be boring?","review":"I wanted to read this book and love it, but I simply couldn't get past the poor writing and VERY stiff and cliched \\"dialogue.\\" Jennifer's diary entries are compelling, but none of the rest rang true for me.

I felt like I was reading the script for a Lifetime TV Movie about anorexia, not the story of a real woman's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing book","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book but was extremely disappointed. I found myself saying out loud \\"come on that couldn't have really have happened\\" .

But page after page about a self-absorbed brat with a pathetically devoted and brainwashed father enabling her 14-year suicide was disgusting, frustrating, and depressing.I understand that anorexia is not a choice, but I don't think this book is about an anoretic. It's more about someone with borderline personality disorder and how effectively that can wear on people's -- even professionals' -- patience. And how effectively it can manipulate the willing, even in getting them to publish sappy memoirs posthumously. I agree that the book brings up ethical questions about psychiatric care that need to be addressed. It made me wish someone would just take her to a shelter and put her to sleep so I wouldn't have to read any more of her whining, false-memory-spewing nonsense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truman Capote's Christmas Memory","review":"The remembered Christmas was both precious and sad, and so unlike our very commercial Christmases that Capote's account is almost difficult to understand. Precious because his family knew how to treasure each other and their individual foibles, although none of them could afford the sort of Christmas gifts we think necessary to give. Sad because the most loving aunties were too old to keep on living and being family for this excellent author. Still, a wonderful little book to give as a gift to oneself or to a treasured friend or relative: it makes Christmas more special than our style of celebration can provide."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good story","review":"Capote did a nice job on this book which was later turned into movi, twice. It is a true story of Truman when he was a little boy and his relationship with an old aunt. The highlight of the story is the making of the Christmas cakes. \\"It's Christmas cake weatha\\" calls out the aunt to Truman as they go out picking up walnuts and then all of the other ingredients that are needed for all of the cakes. She has saved all year in order to get the few dollars that she needs to buy everything. She gives them all away every year to people. lovely story"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overpriced, but a jewel in both writing and bookbinding","review":"The price is steep but these stories are spectacularin the way only Truman can be. I found many readerswho had ruled out truman after being forced to read\\"In Cold Blood\\" in school were willing to give himanother try with this volume. This is probably dueto the fact that the book is nicely made and short.I really think it's worth owning and worth givingCapote another shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Literature","review":"The story is good, as others have said, but please study the writing itself: exquisite and, in my opinion, the model for all writers--clear, fluid, seemingly simple, but every word perfect, with deep emotional weight, fine observation, indelible images. Two kites entwined? Unforgettable. A perfect gift for any writer, and hold onto your own copy, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christmas Memory","review":"The novel A Christmas Memory written by Truman Capote will give you strong emotions. One thing that I acted strongly about was when his cousin was going to send Buddy off to military school.

They had been together every since Buddy was little. This was their last Christmas together. He didn't want to leave his friend but he had to. When he leaft that was the hardest part in the book. A Christmas Memory can certainly make you be sad and mad at diffrent times. Your emotions change real fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific story","review":"I ordered this book after first reading the story in a collection of Capote stories from the library. I knew I wanted to own it and share it. I ordered one for myself and one for a friend who loves Christmas so she could enjoy it and share it with her friends and family. I haven't listened to the CD that comes with it, but that was a nice surprise. The only thing I didn't like about the book are the illustrations. After having read more about Capote and seeing photos of him and his aunt, the pictures just didn't seem to match. They seemed too charming to me, not conveying the reality. For someone without a preconcieved idea of what the characters should look like it won't matter and this book is actually geared towards children, whereas the original story was not. I enjoyed my initial reading the most being able to create the scenes in my mind with his beautiful descriptions and my own experience with elderly relatives.

Written by Truman Capote as an autobiographical account of a childhood experience, Christmas during the Great Depression era of American history is celebrated as a holiday for gifting with items hand-made expressly for their recipients. I bought this edition for its cover. This Christmas classic should be in every child's library."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christmas Memory","review":"A Christmas Memory is a heart touching story that involves many emotional moments. When reading the story, I felt an urge to cry because of so many feelings that Buddy had for Sooke. I could feel the emotions race in my heart from word to word. The most heart touching moment, was when Buddy was forced to leave his best friend, Sooke. The way Sooke felt when Buddy had to leave meant everything. Sooke felt as if she could do somthing to make Jenny let him stay. Buddy may have been a young boy ,but he understood how Sooke felt. The scene when they were giving gifts from under the tree, Sooke and Buddy gave each other a kite which they flown the next day for their last time together. The moment when Jenny, Buddys aunt talked to Sooke made feel as if now she would be alone. After the talk with Jenny, Sooke thought that all she could do now was walk Buddy to the bus and say her goodbyes. A Christmas Memory will certainly make you experience strong, emotional feelings.Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A touching portrayal of simple people in an era gone by","review":"Truman Capote's story of himself and his country Aunt celebrating Christmas together is one that should remind all of us of the meaning of love and caring for each other this season."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Story","review":"Truman Capote's A Christmas Memory is sure to remind you of a time you've shared with a special friend. Buddy and his friend shared, almost, every moment together. The fact that they were so close made me feel very happy.

Surprise quickly gives way to hate as Lars observes Paco standing against a wall in the busy Brazilian street. Lars clutches the butt of his .38 inside his shirt as he remembers how Paco, the con man, was solely responsible for his incarceration at the penal colony in French Guiana. Recently escaped, Lars delights in the pleasure of revenge, but he knows that any action from him will bring investigation from the police. Through a series of events, both men find themselves working on the same ship and engage in their final confrontation on the high seas. Hubbard's use of vivid imagery and character development remind me of a good Graham Greene novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast-paced, high-seas action","review":"This is a very cool story, not so much because of the suspense and action it packs but because of the character development. Hubbard really creates 2 characters that are so completely bipolar that the electricity between them is pulpable.

Hope this review helps someone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Held up","review":"This thing has held up for almost a year now, and I have to say that I'm impressed. You do have to refill it every so often, but it is easy enough with a small hand or mechanical pump. I don't know how much it helps me stay in shape, but my fiance loves it and I don't mind watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product for the price","review":"I bought this ball because I'm pregnant and wanted something to sit comfortably on when my hips were hurting and for early labor before I go to the hospital. I had one of these when I was a kid (they were much more expensive back then) and this one seems just as sturdy. It's pretty thick and I think it would take a pretty sharp object to puncture it. The pump that comes with it is flimsy, but works fine for blowing the ball up. If you wanted to inflate and deflate the ball a lot, you might want to get an electric pump or something more heavy-duty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout ball!","review":"Opened it up, pumped it up with the included pump, worked out with it. I've been very satisfied ever since. Very durable, perfect size for me (I'm 6'0\\"), nice color. You can do so many different workouts with a body ball! With this one it's a little cheaper in price than most and does the job just the same as the more expensive ones! No complaints. Great product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful !","review":"This ball is huge I ordered the largest ball because I'm 6'0 tall. This ball was as big as my living room chair. I had to beat on it to get it through the doorways of my house. I also faceplanted off of it onto the livingroom floor, broke my glasses, and still had my lower body up on the ball from a simple reverse crunch. Be careful you have to really learn how to keep your balance on these balls. It is not just a toy. I no longer have mine because my cat popped it when my son sat her on it and she pushed off with her claws. I would suggest getting a smaller size to begin with and get one of the videos to teach you how to use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Balls OUT!","review":"It is and does what it claims to! Ball takes some time to inflate, not a big deal....unless you are just a very unreasonable person living in your lala land.Ever since I started using mine I can't keep the ladies off me, well, metaphorically speaking. I mean it totally works so phyisically when the women are all up on me I can literally just throw them off of my person and not even break a sweat. You can also use the ball to bounce these infatuated people off your sleek new hawt self! Yes, I think I am funny.I do like the workout chart that comes with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT 75 CM, WRONG SIZE","review":"I specifically ordered the ball because I wanted a 75cm ball, this ball is much smaller and does not fit the tape that it comes with, the tape remains slack. That is the biggest disappointment for me. The ball works fine for a smaller ball but what's the point of paying for it if it's not the size you want? I was deployed when it was shipped, so I am too late to return it and either way I would have to open the box and blow it to see the size.I hope someone lets Valeo know of this discrepancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"popped on day one","review":"This thing popped the first time it was used. And I only weight 160 pounds, so it's not what you think!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small for a chair & strong chemical smell.","review":"MUCH smaller than other 75 cm balls I use. I work at a computer and use these balls as a chair. I'm not sure why this one is so much smaller than the other 75 cm balls I have used in the past... maybe I was sent the wrong size.This ball also gives off a strong chemical smell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong size - Blew up!","review":"I ordered a 65 cm ball (I love them and have 2 already!). I started blowing it up, the pump split in half (fixed it with duct tape), and kept trying to blow it up to fit the inside diameter of the measuring tape. I inflated the ball to ~65% and it exploded into 15-18 pieces (smells really bad, BTW...). My guess is that there was a blue 55 cm ball in a 65 cm box. The only markings on the ball were \\"N 163\\". I was unable to correlate this online with any Valeo product to ensure the correct diameter size. Sooooooo, BE CAREFUL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love big balls, this is the one for you...","review":"I bought two of these balls and let me tell you, they're GREAT! nice and bouncy and feel good and grippy in my hands. my girl loves working out with them too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great desk chair","review":"I purchased this and gave up my really expensive leather chair in hopes of having a better support chair. I have been using it for several days and it is great. When I am listening to music I can't help but bounce around on it. I feel like it should have handles so I could bounce around the room. Who knew a chair could be so much fun and help with posture? Love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"Blew up the ball according to instruction. Heard air escaping immediately. Checked over ball, and saw it had a nick/small cut in it where air was escapinging. Pressed LIGHTLY on the area to further assess, and ball tore. NEVER even got to use it. ABSOLUTE JUNK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality ball, poor quality pump","review":"I read the instructions carefully, and tried to inflate the ball as described in the instructions.First, the included cheapie plastic pump split a seam within 3 minutes. Since the ball can't be inflated with a standard sports ball needle, we had to jerry-rig a patch for the pump, and continued to try to inflate the ball with a (now) leaking pump.15 minutes later, taking turns because it was so difficult, we got the ball *almost* fully inflated, according to the included measuring tape. Deciding not to press our luck, we got the plug ready, pulled out the inflation nozzle, and the ball popped straight down the center.Let me emphasize this: WE DID NOT OVER-INFLATE THE BALL. The manufacturer-provided measuring tape, which we had CAREFULLY strung around the middle of the ball, ensured this.The ball is too fragile, the pump is WAY too fragile, and I wish I'd spent the extra $10 for a better-quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good quality","review":"When I took it out of the box, besides its extremely strong chemical odor, I noticed it seemed to have some kind of wet substance all over it that rubbed off on my hands when I touched it (the consistency of lotion). I have no idea what it was. On the plus side, it comes with a measuring tape to let you know when it is inflated enough. However, the pump that comes with it was extremely labor intensive and a lot of pumping didn't accomplish much. The smell and the wet feel of the plastic was enough for me. I'm going to buy another higher quality brand. I guess you get what you pay for!"},{"rating":"1","title":"kissing concrete","review":"The 75cm Valeo Body Ball (\\"burst resistant\\" per the box) performed faithfully for seven months until it ruptured yesterday. I am 6'4\\", 200# and was prone using two 10# dumbbells when it burst beneath me and dropped me face first on the smooth concrete floor. The tear was nearly fully circumferential around the middle of the ball. Fortunately, I only had a couple of small abrasions. The ball had no previous damage, leak or or other warning sign of weakness or impending failure. It was replaced with a more expensive, stronger ball that is now used with a thick foam exercise mat underneath."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burst my bubble","review":"This product worked well fro me until it popped when I was using it. I am well within the weight limits of the ball and it burst after only a couple months. I had inflated it using the tools provided. On the plus side they did send a replacement. If you want to do this right, put the extra money down for one of the gym quality balls, this could be you by but may surprise you one of these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cheap alternative to a therapy ball.","review":"My son suffered a brain injury and requires ongoing therapy, alot of which we do at home. An average therapy ball cost upward of $70. This exercise ball fit the bill at a fraction of the cost. We use it for stretchings, balance work, weight bearing, and simple play. A welcome find. Child is 3' 4\\", 48lbs. Works great as a therapy ball for his size and weight. Can not vouche for its intended use as an exercise ball for an adult, as I have not employed it in that fashion, though I can say it has held me and my child in a seated bounce (approx. 225lbs)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stability Balls","review":"We like the prodcut, but two of the twenty six popped the minute we blew them up. We have several we have not blown up and I'm nervous they will pop too. I'm sending the two back as I believe they are defective. The other are working out nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"exercise balls are great!","review":"These are great to workout your entire core. Helps to improve balance, posture, and overall fitness. I recommend its use to anyone of any age!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Color","review":"I was trying to order the large silver ball to use as a desk chair, and I clicked on that color. When there was a red ball at check-out, I assumed that it was the generic photo of the item. Just in case, I did a second order, clicking on the silver box again. Nothing came up telling me that it wasn't available, or that it came only in red. (Several colors were shown in the boxes below.) You guessed it: a bright red ball arrived, clashing with everything in the room. Whether or not it's a high-quality item isn't the reason for my poor review, just the inconvenience of having to re-pack and ship... Next time, I would like to know what colors are, and are not, available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got wrong size ball","review":"Like other buyers, I too got the wrong size ball - 55 cms Blue ball. Unfortunately I waited too long to inflate it so have missed the return window and am stuck with a ball I cannot use. Advise to other buyers- dont wait too long to evaluate the product. I am 5'7\\" and bought this ball to use at my work desk. Now I cannot use it because its too short and I will have ergo issues (which I thought I would fix with the Ball, in the first place). Waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable, nothing to complain about, smell goes away","review":"Function:I mostly use this as a chair, though this involves putting more regular pressure on it than most people buying for exercise, so I think that's a good test of its resilience. I've had no problems after a couple months. The pump works fine and is easy enough to use.Smell:It smells strongly when you first unpackage it, but once you leave it pumped up for a few days, that goes away completely. Don't try to wash it off like some reviewers--it's not going to give you cancer, and washing it will probably reduce its durability, because that smell probably comes from a coating that the ball absorbs when it expands (I don't have a strong chemistry background, so I'm just speculating, but it makes enough sense)."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong size in the box","review":"ordered size 65cm... the shipping was fast, but after pumping up the ball, I realized it was 55cm only. Although the box printed 65cm, the measuring tape (which is part of the package) was much longer than the ball. So I have to return for an exchange, and hopefully the new one will come at the right size.will update again once I receive the new ball."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good. Color shown is not accurate.","review":"I'm 5'2\\" and this is a good size for me. Easy to inflate. No leaks. Seems like it's going to hold up pretty well. The color of the ball doesn't bother me one way or another, but this ball isn't silver; it's pearly white."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this ball.","review":"The ball was perfect for my height 5'0. The pump was easy to use. This ball is just a joy to exercise with. And if you want ideas, YouTube has a lot of free videos with the ball. Can I say that on here? Anyway... Good ball!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This ball doesn't hold air.","review":"This ball doesn't hold air. I'm not sure if it oozes air from the small hole it came with or the valve. The hole is rather a thin spot (in the already thin rubber )that might of developed after sticking to itself. Not worth the money. I don't think it would pop with average weight put on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not 75 cm","review":"I was very excited to receive this product today, but it became fairly clear as soon as I started inflating it that it would be nowhere near the advertised 75 cm diameter. I followed the inflation instructions, using the tape, and there is no way the tape can be tight on the ball.Also, I don't recommend using the pump. Mine cracked shortly after I started inflating the ball."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Different Sizes","review":"I purchased three (3) of the 65 cm stability balls for circuit training boot camps I run. When they arrived and I blew them up, each of the three balls were a different size. I blew all of them up the most I could and undoubtedly they are all different sizes. I did not want to hassle with returning them, so I make due, but in the future I will not buy this brand for my fitness studio due to the inconsistencies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me....","review":"This is the second or third one of these that I have purchased. I have issues with my sciatic nerve and I can sit on this ball and watch tv and it doesn't set off the nerve. My problem is that it doesn't hold the air and it's hard to fill correctly. Maybe we're doing it wrong, I don't know. Otherwise, when it's blown up, it's great."},{"rating":"1","title":"This ball reeks!","review":"Functionally speaking, the ball works like it's supposed to, as does the foot pump it comes with. But it came out of the package covered in a film of greasy residue, and even after wiping it down with lysol wipes and letting it air out overnight, it still REEKS. It smells like a mixture of car tires and plastic cups melting in the fire. The fumes are making me sick. I hope the smell goes away... but I have bought other yoga balls and did not have this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Small","review":"This ball is super small.

Before I gave my mother a chance I tested this on myself 220p.It didn't break!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ball developed hole after 1.5 months","review":"This ball randomly sprung a leak after only 1.5 months of use. I was initially relatively happy with the purchase, given the price and positive reviews. However, after my experience, I would not recommend it.Furthermore, the really cheap pump that comes with the ball cracked during the first pump, and I had to use duct tape to hold it together to finish inflating the ball.I would not recommend this as a quality buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"ball split into two equal sized pieces","review":"I enjoyed the ball for about three weeks, but I discovered it split in two pieces one day for no known reason. I plan to get another, but not this brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti Burst? Yeah Right....","review":"I received the Valeo Body Ball today and started to inflate it using the included pump and measuring tape. The pump was a pain to use and kept slipping. It took me about a half hour to inflate to 58 cm (it is a 65cm ball). I decided to under inflate it because I am only 5'4 and therefore on the small side to use this size ball.I used the included plug and left the ball sitting in a corner UNUSED for about ten minutes. All of a sudden, there was a giant WHOOSH of air, my dog freaks out, and I look over my shoulder and the ball has burst. It burst cleanly down the middle. I am very upset and will try to return it. I never sat on it or used it in any way. It was sitting on carpet. Worst product EVER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong size","review":"Seems to be a trend that they are shipping the wrong size ball. The box correctly said 65cm but after trying to blow this up for 20 minutes I realized I could not get it any larger and the measuring tape was off by many inches. The ball diameter is for 55cm. The tape seemed to be the right size for a 65cm ball though.I'm sending back for another try. If things work out I'll update my review based on the ball itself and not the shipping (Or packaging) mistakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Plastic Smell","review":"I could barely stand to blow up the ball without opening the window. All parts (ball, pump, and measuring tape) smelled of cheap plastic. I washed it in the shower with soap and water to try to get the smell off, but it didn't help. I'm leaving the window open for another 24 hours to continue to let it air out before I spend much time around it. (I don't think that vinyl smell is healthy.) The plastic also feels thinner than the previous exercise balls I've had in the past. It was the cheapest ball of that size on Amazon, and I guess I got what I paid for. I'd rather have spent twice as much had I known that it would be made of such cheap materials."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Product with Missing Parts","review":"I ordered this brand-new from amazon.com. But after I inflated the ball, it kept deflating. According to the instruction manual, a plug and a tape measure should have been included. Neither were included in the box. Very annoying! I am returning it for a refund. Don't waste your $$$."},{"rating":"1","title":"POP","review":"After having this ball for only 2 weeks, it popped while I was sitting on it, not moving, on carpet. Not a fun experience for someone with a bad back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toxic smell!","review":"I can't speak for the functionality of the ball because as soon as I took it out of the box the plastic smell made me sick; just try opening a new shower curtain liner and multiply that smell by 10. My intuition also tells me that anything that reeks like this is toxic to inhale. I left it out for 3 weeks, even washed it but to no avail. Anyone sensitive to toxic chemicals or plastics should steer clear of this one.Nu-Source has a similar body ball that doesn't stink. If you have the same reaction to the Valeo plastic I recommend you try the Nu-Source instead.You can find it on Amazon.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy","review":"Extremely poor quality. Unwrapped it and found FIVE HOLES in pump, nozzles did not fit on ball. Could not inflate."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap","review":"Owned for 1 week...no instructions for inflation w/ included foot pump. ball sheds strips of plastic from all the seams and was covered in a greasy residue that was very hard to remove. it stinks, the pvc or whatever, off-gases a very strong chemical smell that washing has not lessened. It has to stay in the garage because it stinks up any room it's in. holds air reasonable well. buy something else. made in china, of course."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only good for small people!","review":"This is a decent ball, but not if you're over 150lbs. The rubber is thinner than some other companies (like Gymnic), so the ball tends to flatten out when you're using it, giving very little resistance. I have a Gymnic ball as well, which holds shape beautifully, and I'd recommend that."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I expected","review":"It was hard for me to figure out what size would be right for me but this is pretty much a standard size for anyone.

Anytime they're fussy or sleepy we just cradle them and bounce them to sleep. We are both taller than 6' so we bought the 75cm ball. Well it popped under my 160lbs wife and our 8 month old daughter. ON IT'S VERY FIRST USE! Stay away from this brand!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ball was unusable within 30 days","review":"This balance ball arrived with a very cheap inflating pump. After fighting with it to stay together long enough to inflate the ball, and enduring a terrible chemical smell from the ball (the package was labeled that it contained cancer causing toxins), we finally had a balance ball. Unfortunately, it sprung a leak within 30 days from normal use. I'm returning it. So glad Amazon has a good return policy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ball","review":"I was glad I looked into the different sizes and got the size that fits my height, and I was lucky to have it in a color I like.

The air pump, the measuring tape and an exercise chart are included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than a couch","review":"I got this ball because I didn't want to sit on my couch anymore because it made me feel lazy. Now I sit on the ball or I stand around to watch TV. I think it's awesome because no matter what, I'm always moving around, even when I'm not working out. The ball comes with an instruction manual for exercising and I've used it quite a bit for that but mainly for just sitting around when I'm tired. The pump it comes with isn't that great but I had a bike pump that DID work well so it didn't matter much to me. Overall, I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good ball but needs better instructions","review":"I have had several exercise balls in my life and none of them were as challenging to inflate as this one.

It took me 25 minutes to inflate this ball and towards the end of it the spring in the pump broke so now it's useless.

I'd suggest buying a exercise ball that's Made in the USA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after a little while","review":"After a few short months of use as a chair, the ball developed a leak and stopped doing, well, its duty of being an inflated ball. I found the leak, covered it with some glue, and pumped it up several times, but it always deflated. I wish my $12 had lasted a bit longer.Otherwise, this 55cm ball was a good size (I'm 5'3\\"). You can't choose the color (55cm is pearly white). The pump is easy to use but takes a while, slips often, and makes an loud squeaking sound. Also it's made of cheap plastic, and ripped along a top edge eventually. Was easily repairable with a piece of duct tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap disappointment","review":"i thought this ball was a great deal with so many great reviews on it but i was really disappointed when i received it. you really get what you paid for. i got a different type of pump than the instructions called for and it was missing a plug, so we couldn't even keep the ball inflated after we went through all the trouble of blowing air in it. it's made of cheap materials and after i started reading the 1 star reviews of it popping during usage, i decided to return it. i can't risk that since i'm pregnant! amazon is a great place to buy stuff because you can see all the reviews - i'm just so surprised this has an overall 4 star rating! don't get it! spend an extra $5 or so for a better one. amazon was great for returns and refunds though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last","review":"Like C.

It gives a great workout and seems to hold air quite well.. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that pumping it such a pain!

This product has a flawed design. There is no mechanism for easy removal of the infuser. The infuser itself was made to be taken out (there are retractable prongs), but there is no way to carefully do this. When I tried to clean it, the glass broke (this was the first time I had ever used it, and I am a reasonably careful person). Also, broken glass is NOT covered under Bodum's warranty. My advice is to stick with cast iron pots. They are more expensive, but they last forever under normal conditions."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite teapot","review":"The best teapot design around. So elegant and easy to use.

This gives me a place to put my wrists and keep my hands at a more comfortable height to the keys.It's very stable on my desk with no curling and no sliding. Easy to wipe off with a cloth - although it doesn't really pick up much grime from what I've seen so far. It does have a terrible smell which is fading fast. Not really an issue since I find it doesn't get on me.The only problem with it is that I'm probably going to break it by poking at it and using it like a stress ball. Oddly addictive."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little more hard than I would like it to be.","review":"This wrist rest for the keyboard is just a bit too hard for my wrists. It is well made and is holding up well but more on the hard side than soft side. It does do the job of keeping the hands/wrists up at a good ergonomic angle though.Also, the wrists tend to stick to it more than the other wrist rests that have a material over them. So , if your wrists are not sensitive this is the item for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Life Depends on This Being Released!","review":"...okay, not really.

Most shows of similar quality and popularity have been released on DVD already. People on this site and others are clamoring to buy these shows. So what will it take to get the distributor to allow us to legally own this exquisite television program? No better television drama has ever aired.

From the very beginning this show captured my heart and I was devastated when it got canceled after only 4 seasons. Everwood was the perfect mix of small town drama, family frustrations, and love.I got the first season years ago and I even managed to draw my grandmother in and she hates most TV shows. I'm beyond thrilled that the second season is finally being released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you WB! Now Season 3 + 4","review":"Okay WB, thanks for FINALLY issuing Season 2.

I purchased the first season DVD set and watched again the awesome shows. I was very upset that Everwood went off the air. I was more upset that I could not purchase the other seasons on DVD.

This show is addicting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everwood was deep, funny, moving, and amazing!","review":"Everwood was and continues to be my favorite TV show! I started watching it with my parents and then my friends joined in. I love that Everwood deals with real emotions and doesn't shy away from hard issues. The characters grow and change and struggle and learn in each episode and through the seasons. I still rave about it all the time and bought Season 1 on DVD when it first came out but have been anxiously awaiting the release of the DVDs of the other seasons. I don't understand why they haven't been released because there are so many fans who would buy it for themselves and their family members and friends. Please listen to the fans- we'll begin forgiving you for cancelling the show when you release the rest of the seasons on DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST SHOW EVER","review":"I am a full time employed person so watching Everwood started on a day off and happened to catch it. Was so hooked by it, had to set my video to tape it every day, would then spend weekend watching 5 hours of episodes!!This show is amazing, I cannot believe it is not yet available on DVD for all the seasons shown in America, the rest of us are dying to find out what happens in those last 3 seasons!!It really is such an emotional drama, reminded me of My So Called Life, on a few years ago but it left such an impression.Let's hope the makers see sense and release it soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"underrated show","review":"i've watched this show from start to finish and i must say it's probably one of the best shows ever...the writing was the best out of all the tv show dramas that WB(CW) had at that particular time...it was kind of stupid that they cancelled everwood in place of 7th heaven...7th heaven to me was a joke and countless other show's they had on WB...the acting on the show was terrific and the cast ensemble worked great together...i hope season 2 comes out on dvd soon...and if i lived in LA i would buy the 7th heaven dvd's and chuck it at the CW building!!! hoping to hit the building itself or Happy the dog from 7th heaven!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"come on already!!","review":"I have watched the Northern Exposure episodes over and over... It's time for some more Everwood!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why was this show cancelled?","review":"I did not start watching Everwood until late 2003, so I am in the dark about what happened up to that point. But once I watched, I was amazed! This was great television--superior writing, acting, directing, etc., and now it's gone. The least they can do is offer up the series on DVD, but all that is available is Season 1. Why? Please, I'm sick of reality TV and desperately want to know how everything started. Plus, I want to have the DVDs at home to watch whenever I want to see a show that is engaging, tender, warm, funny, and unbelievably intelligent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please release Seasons 2-4 NOW!","review":"Everwood was the best dramatic series ever on television. I have gotten two friends of mine already hooked by lending them my season 1 collection...however, they keep hounding me about passing along the other seasons! I can't do that if they're not released! I really hope the production studio gets their act together and releases the rest of the seasons so that we may enjoy Everwood for eternity."},{"rating":"2","title":"why no closed captions???","review":"I love Everwood and was absolutely delighted when season two finally appeared. But as a hearing-impaired person, I was really disappointed that it was not closed captioned. I got around that by using the English subtitles, but I found it odd that the closed captions had been omitted..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grossly underrated","review":"Everwood, which sadly has been off the air for three years now, was one of the most underrated television shows of the modern era. Because it was on the same network as watered-down, trite shows like 7th Heaven, it was unfairly categorized as a teeny-bop show which it WAS NOT at all. Tremendous writing and superb acting along with a breathtaking landscape as a backdrop makes this show truly unmissable. To be honest, I think four seasons was a pretty good run although I would've liked to have seen at least one more solid year from this show. Please do not dismiss this show. If you are a fan of great writing with down-to-earth and flawed characters trying to make their way in this mad, unpredictable world- you'll love this show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilled about the second season!","review":"It is very exciting to hear that the second season of EVERWOOD is going to be released on DVD in June! EVERWOOD was such a well-written show with wonderfully quirky and poignant characters. I own the first season DVDs and I was afraid I would never see anymore than that. I will gladly buy each of the remaining seasons just as soon as they are released!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Television at its best","review":"This is one of the best shows of all times. If I could sum it up in one line, I would say that it is a show that has a heart. No, the characters aren't perfect. In fact this is part of the charm. But the bottom line is that people truly care for one another on Everwood, and that's what makes us care for them. It is my hope that the CW execs realize what a gem they have on their hands and finally release the rest of the seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please release remaining seasons!","review":"I am dismayed to hear the remaining seasons may not be released. I am a new watcher over the past year or so of the reruns on WB. I love it and my kids love it. We purchased season one and I was hoping to purchase season two. This is the first time I have ever reviewed something like this or thought about buying a series on DVD. The quality of the show is great, deals with current issues in a mature way and in a way young people will think about. There are two few good shows on TV right now and this one was definitely one of them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrible mistake","review":"I think that is really ridiculous, that for example all seasons of Gilmore girls or Seventh Heaven have been released and not Everwood. Nevertheless, Everwood is the show of higher niveau, it is full of emotions, the each episode was great. I enjoyed it very much and it made me think about life and relations..."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's time for Season 2","review":"Honestly a quality show like this should never have been cancelled and I still don't understand it, but that is behind us. Now what I'm trying to figure out is why Season 2 hasn't been released yet. It's been up on this site for a year. There's clearly a demand for it, especially with the extended time people have waited for it so what's the hold up? Am I missing something here?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I would buy every season of Everwood today if available","review":"There are so few TV shows that I find truly worth watching.

Please, Please release the rest of the seasons on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY!!!!","review":"I was estatic to say the least when I heard that they were actually going to release the second season DVD. I know that it had been in the works for some time but to actually see it being released...I couldn't be more happier. This TV series was the cream of the crop in my book. The acting was phenomonal and it literally hurt to see them cancel it. I just hope that they will release the rest of the seasons on DVD as well. Maybe even release a box set. I guess I can only dream!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Please, Please ......","review":"Please, Please, Please release the remaining Everwood shows on DVD, I like many others purchased Season 1 and am in love with the whole package, characters, story, town etc. Why are we still waiting I wonder."},{"rating":"2","title":"woot woot!","review":"Since Everwood came out years ago I've been looking fro seasons 2-4 on dvd, glad to see they are finally out.

You can't help but get interested in the characters immediately and you stay involved until the very satisfying conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as cool as it sounds","review":"I was extremely disappointed by this product. I expected it to project large shadows on the wall several feet away. However, the light didn't project more than about two feet, and even then, it was so dim that you could not make out the figures at all. Setting it closer to the wall was no help either; not only did that make the images EXTREMELY small (on the order of an inch or two), they also had an annoying \\"overlap\\" that made it seem like you had double vision. I would not recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy magic light","review":"I really wanted a shadow lantern similar to the one in the movie Sleepy Hollow. Instead this was all I could find. The price is right but that's about all to recommend it. First it's an energy hog. I went through two sets of batteries in 48 hours. The lamp was not bright either. So I tried wiring it to a power supply but the lamps keep burning out. The poor quality reflector and dome distort the images. I'll use this as a stopgap measure until I can find a more suitable lantern from the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"i thought that this toy would create a beautiful atmosphere for Halloween in a dark room but it's too dim, you can hardly see the figures ..not worth it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring!","review":"Until I read this book, it had not really occurred to me the tremendous sacrifice faced by these courageous men. Thinking about it though, they had to know that their names would go down forever among the annals of the worst traitors in history had things gone differently and England won. Which makes their sacrifice all the greater - it's one thing to offer one's life, but to offer one's honor is a tremendous sacrifice. Thank goodness America was the victor and these great men are held to be the heroes the deserve to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent source for home schooling","review":"I bought this book as part of my son's home schooling American History.

This book sheds light on the others, the ones whose names appear but who never received the same renown of some of the others. For the most part they were men who were called to represent their states and who believed in independence. There were conflicts among them as one would expect. Some of the conflicts continue to this day. And that is an important lesson. These men found the common ground that allowed them to stand as one and sign the declaration. We must not forget that each of them by signing did \\"mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor\\". We should all know more than just their names. This book tells us more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for caring Americans.","review":"This is such an eye opening book to what all these men wanted for their new country.

Instead they made a poorly crafted model in which the parts do no fit together well. It's bad craftsmanship and frustrating. Stick to Tamiya models.

It arrived within days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware.","review":"I imagined that this would be a good father/son project. However, I had to build most of it alone. If you appreciate precision fit, you won't find it in this kit. Epoxy is not fun to work with. Cementing little metal nuts to plastic and then finding later that the holes don't line up can be extremely frustrating. Eventually, I got it together. It works, looks impressive, etc. However,this is not the ideal project to create a bonding experience between father and son...unless you have some M-80's, lighter fluid, or a sledge hammer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"I ignored the other bad reviews and bought this item anyway. I have been working on it night after night trimming pieces and cutting them trying to make everything work correctly.

Because of these problems it is IMPOSSIBLE to build a decent looking model - if you are lucky enough to even get it finished.

Nothing fits together at all, pieces warped and molded poorly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not assemble it.","review":"I bought this for my grandson and was not able to assemble it even though I consider myself pretty good with building models. The kit required the use of epoxy glue which was difficult to work with, the parts did not fit together well and was generally poorly designed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic Nightmare","review":"I am a very patient guy and this model kit has destroyed it all. Do mind, that is a given when using glue that there will be some kind of mess. Regardless, the way the manufacturer created all the parts I expected little to no REDESIGNING of parts. I quit building this 3/4 of the way once I realized I will never get the pushrods to actually function with the valves. The plastic camshaft bends the pushrods instead of pushing it up. The pushrods do not even contact the valve lifters.On the brightside, this monumental project does look good after u get the cylinders in and watch the motion of components.I will not recommend this to any of my peers for it is a doomed project from the start. Plastic components are just not made accurately nor precisely and will never fit together unless you make a living re-engineering a catastrophe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Epoxy cement is a mess. molded construction is very poor","review":"I remember the original with little lights to represent spark plug ignition. This is a cost-reduced copy of poor construction and badly fitting components that require a LOT of post-mold re-engineering. It's a great learning tool, but a very badly produced copy of the originaly excellent quality model. I would recommend it only in the sense that it it appears to be the only one available, but it is by no means the quality that Revell used to deliver. Over-all, I would not buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This!","review":"Despite some of the bad reviews, I purchased this to build with my son. From the first step, this was a disaster. The tiny nuts that were supposed to fit in to the base did not fit for the most part. They had to be filed and cut to accommodate the nuts. The rest of the steps were not any better. For a model that cost $50, this was a tremendous disappontment. I also noted that the people who gave positive reviews did not specify that they built this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as I remember","review":"I built one of these as a 14 year old and learned quite a bit about how an engine works. Either my memory has gotten worse or this product has. I don't recall as a teen (about 35 years ago)that this thing was so poorly made. The parts don't snap in or line up properly and there is way too many things that don't fit easily or should have been done for you, i.e. glue nuts in tiny notches. All in all, I was quite frustrated and disappointed. Too bad because it has great potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep your child busy","review":"Looking for a model that will keep your child busy yet educated then this is the one.

You will need the skill of a watchmaker to put this thing together. The use of epoxy glue instead of model cement is a real pain. The best epoxies set in 5 min. The miniscule nuts don't nest properly and it's hard to keep the epoxy out of the nuts. This model will take days to complete.Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Visable V-8","review":"Excellent item. A great learning or teaching tool.

Trust me that I wasn't expecting a whole lot when I bought these, but there isn't much about them that made it worth the money. The picture quality was so poor--often the screen was completely black even after adjustments and focusing a flashlight on my daughter's face to get more light on her!

It is more usual the case that a statistical approach is adopted, in which the canonical (or other) ensemble is arrived, and subsequent results somehow refer back to the the ensembles. Huang seems to wish to proceed from a strongly microscopic and kinetic point of view. There must be great strength in his approach, as statistical phenomena, in reality, is built up from this semi-classical sort of physics. If you like kinetic theory, then buy it. However, for those of us who find more comfort in relating to a more statistical approach, this book is fearsomely unreadable.But do read it for a description of the Boltzmann Transport equation."},{"rating":"2","title":"An adequate Stat. Mech. book","review":"I would suggest that the previous reviewer get him/herself a tutor. (The formula Huang uses, log n! = n log n - 1, is correct for large numbers.) Statisticam Mechanics is a notoriously hard subject to present lucidly and clearly. Huang does a fairly good job.

His writing style is awful, the book is littered with typos, his notation is completely different from any I've ever seen, and attempting the homework problems is similar to trying to write an essay in Korean with only a travel guidebook as a reference. Even the paper and cover is of substandard quality. If you are an instructor and are reading this, for the love of god, DON'T USE THIS FOR YOUR COURSE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Least favorite of all I've seen","review":"Huang approaches the subject as a series of proofs: he does not make physical arguments, and his writing is wooden. Instructors--avoid this book!Some have said that this book approaches stat mech from the refreshing view of kinetic theory. But it leaves out the Fokker-Planck and Langevin approaches, by which the Boltzmann equation is usually solved. Anyone interested in this approach would be *far* more rewarded by Landau's Physical Kinetics.Anyone interested in Gibbs theory should consult Landau or Sommerfeld.Anyone who wants good problems (and real applications) would be better served by the canonical McQuarrie.Anyone who wants a feel for what the subject *actually now is* should see Kadanoff or Chandler. Actually I think allowing students to leave stat mech without seeing the monte carlo algorithm or solving a stochastic equation is a crime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"The reviewer below who said that this book pursues primarily a kinetic theory - Boltzmann Transport Equation approach, got it right. It really is a fearsome, and by and large, pointless read. Our professor used this book in our stat. mech. class back in 1992. He also used Mahan's Many Particle Physics book in our solid state course and de Genne's Superconductivity text in our superconductor course, so that gives you an idea of what kind of person likes Huang. Most students I've talked to feel that this text is the worst sort of student pain. The pain you feel when after exerting colossal effort trying to understand, you realize at the end of the semester that you didn't learn anything, and that you could have, if only the instructor had chosen one of any number of better books. I am completely mystified as to why and how this book has reached a 3rd edition. Perhaps there are too many physics professors out there who don't care about pedagogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book ranks as one of the worst physics texts.","review":"This is a so called \\"minimalist textbook\\" where derivations and discussions are brief outlines. Great frustration descends upon the individual who seeks to labor through every derivation and develop a meaningful understanding of the subject. Such a difficult subject deserves more careful and thorough treatment than that which Huang gives. The book is almost completely devoid of examples and worked out problems. The only positive aspect of this book is the range of topics covered. I suspect this is the reason Huang is used as a text at many graduate programs. Statistical mechanics is a discipline desperately in need of a good text book. I would however recomend a book by Greiner. Greiner does not cover all of the topics that Huang does but it is an excellent text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"We are using Huang in Physics 262 (Statistical Physics). The whole class is utterly lost. The derivation of the Boltzmann transport equation is just painful. The derivation of the Boltzmann distribution is even more painful. The way I know something is wrong with this book: we all read the chapter quite a few times and then looked at the homework problems at the back of the chapter, which are standard enough, and had NO CLUE how to approach them. Now, I am guessing that all fifty or so of us are reasonably intelligent, so the problem must not be with us...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Reply to the Last Reviewer","review":"Admittedly, the first review was a bit harsh; nevertheless, it is clear that approximating n! by n ln n - 1 is not sufficient.

It's not that Huang glosses over important topics. It's not even the uncreative problems at the end of each chapter. THE TEXT IS RIDDLED WITH ERRORS. Did Huang proof read this or does he just not know physics well? Who ever hear of approximating n ! by n ln n - 1 for large n? Apparently, Huang did. He wrote a whole chapter about it, and derived several results from the erroneous statement.

There's also the best friend who betrays him and the mother who keeps giving him grief. The music is terrible. Everything feels like it was made in the 1970s. The action sequences are glossed over.

While \\"Khan\\" is beautifully shot, I felt the fighting sequences were a little flat, and I had a very hard time rooting for the Mongol leader. I did like the aspects where Khan was trying to understand where he came from, and the dynamic with his son and family wasn't bad, but it wasn't really what I was hoping for.

A little more grit/muted palette would have done it wonders.But those are just nagging points when the main problem is pacing, this movie was way too long and badly structured.

Following this recording they made three strong albums with Richard Sinclair, of Caravan fame, as the replacement bassist. The first four discs were different than the next three in that there was more room for instrumental interplay. The chemistry between these four musicians made for some inspired and enjoyable music. The only flaw can be found in the vocals as Camel never really developed a strong vocal presence. Still in spite of this singular flaw Camel's early recordings are well worth obtaining. This record, Moonmadness, has some of Latimer's finest and most passionate soloing. Highly recommended...Simon"},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap, cliched, not for my kids...","review":"I don't really mind the cheap animation. It's more the cliched, near offensive parts.

The thing I hated most of this story is with the scene where Rox will have the abortion, the way it all was described gave me chills and made me dizzy.

It would be nice to have a snap down strap on the back of the chair connected to the bottom front. This could be used to fold and hold down the seat during portaging.

WRONG! I could not belive that i was actually listening to a TI album when i put this album in. None of the songs have a good beat as they did in the past, and lyrically, you might at well mute the cd and rap to yourself.

This cd is terrible. This is one of the most simple-minded albums I've ever heard...and coming from a cat that I thought was a pretty intelligent guy but made the wrong choices, I'm EXTREMELY disappointed. This man had the audacity to say \\"Don't get me wrong/I ain't neva been a fool/Just put off graduating/For a pair of tennis shoes.\\" Hip-Hop is going down the drain.

The only way to get it out is to shake it vigorously and warm the pan on the stove with the lid on. Also so disappointing is the customer service I received from Calphalon. I called immediately after the pan arrived and they cheerfully told me they would send another lid and a sample of cleaner right away. That was more than 3 months ago. Repeated calls to ask what the problem is, always resulted in taking my name and address again, and telling me it would be sent out right away.

That aside, having picked it up when it was on sale for even less than its low list price, I am hapy with it. It heats up nicely and is easily controlled but it has discolored a bit for me.

Even if the female characters in the book were sensual, beautiful, enticing, etc., they were always being described as such by a male character who was going to have something done to him. So what. I don't want to have to work to get a turn on from a story. I want the narrative from the female's perspective. Presented that way, it makes it easier for me to slip in to the story and be the female character. If I'm always trying to mentally rewrite a man's story to fit myself, then the true story does not awaken the primal part of me.

With the exception of an opening at a pub, the entire narrative takes place at Bill's mansion, and frequently in one room.

There's a Jeeves in it, of a sort, but no Bertie. This Jeeves, if you can believe it, actually laughs out loud. \\"Ha ha,\\" Wodehouse has him say, without a hint of irony. As if that weren't enough, a little bit later he is made to scream--as part of a role-play, true enough, but do we want even role-playing Jeeveses going about the place screaming? I thought not.

They are people dulled by boredom, depression, loneliness... fascinating, probably, but we can't get into their heads. They speak over ours.After the death of one character, the novel becomes something else entirely.

Bowles' improbable story is written with much more passion and meaning than was Hemingway's style.Three bored Americans try to discover themselves in the brutally hot and dirty Sahara. Kit and Port try to recapture thier affection and are accompanied by their dull friend Tunner. Drunk and terrified, a vulnerable Kit succombs to Tunner's advances while Port becomes obssessed with native dancing girls.Eventually Port and Kit separate from Tunner in an attempt to regain their love for each other. Port becomes desparately ill leaving Kit emotioanlly unprepared to do what she must do Rather than face the truth and her obligations, Kit escapes from reality and finds herself alone in the dessert and prisoner to the savage ways of the desert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way overrated!","review":"I was really disappointed by this book. Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I like a novel with a plot and with characters who are at least plausible if not interesting. This book has neither. Given the glowing reviews here on Amazon, I kept reading on, assuming that \\"this has got to take off soon.\\" It never did. Nothing led anywhere, nothing mattered, nothing happened. Maybe, as some previous reviewers suggested, that's the point: this book is about nothingness, and thereby makes a statement about the twentieth century soul. But if that's what I wanted, I could just have stared at a blank piece of paper for fifteen minutes. When I read a book, I want to engage with the book on some level, and I did not engage on any level whatsoever with this book. Maybe it's me, but all I can say is \\"Reader Beware.\\" When they say that the desert is the main character, THEY'RE NOT KIDDING. If you're interested in people or plot, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived","review":"Pointless, convoluted soul searching by irritating characters who could have sorted their problems with a straightforward chat over a cup of coffee. I can only think that Bowles was exploring what happens when already deranged Americans arrive in a foreign land.The conversation is contrived. The thought processes near insane in their detachment from reality (were Port and Kit schitzophrenic?). The attempts to make the mundane seem mysterious irritating (the Lyles were just con artists and thieves - that's all).Certainly Kit's inexplicable behaviour at the death of Port and her subsequent Heart of Darkness like journey into a Saharan erotic mental and physical imprisonment suggests there was a serious mental instability already lurking.In short, they should have been seeking therapy in New York. They were too unbalanced and immature to take a train to Boston (let alone be married)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gag! Hated it! A very annoying read.","review":"I *HATED* this book. There is nothing likeable about the characters, nothing to draw you in and care about what's going on in their heads. Rich, spoiled, selfish. Bah. I think Bowle's portrayal of Kit was shallow and unrealistic. He says she gets through her days balancing an internal dialog of omens and signs, yet after he mentions this, there's no evidence of her doing this. I think he got the female character way wrong, expecting her to validate her existence only if there was a man in the picture. And his portrayal of the \\"natives\\" of the various locales was incredibly unflattering. Why go deeper and deeper into the desert seeking a \\"real\\" experience if you're going to dis the people who live there? Alienation, existential angst, yadda yadda yadda. Yeah, we get it, but who cares with these people? I think this book is like The Emperor's New Clothes. Everyone talks about how great it is but in reality, it sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Jane Bowles","review":"As I read more and more into the life of Jane Bowles, I thought I would benifit from reading some of her husband's work. It enrages me to think that he became the famous one, for he lacks all the wit and charm of his wife's writing. The only thing I feel I got out of this book was a small biographical view of his feelings for his wife (Kate/Jane, come on folks, it obvious). I you really are a fan of Paul, I recomend reading ' A Little Orginal Sin' the biography of Jane Bowles, just for a further understanding of him. A person always plays them self up, it is in through around him that was see who he truly was. He was a good man, but his story is not everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic Work...not for me","review":"Admittedly, I only got through 2/3 of this book but having read many of the reviews on this site, I knew what to expect and decided to stop reading. First, this is a classic work in the vain of other Beat generation writers such as Kerouac. However, this book did not work for me, possibly because of my South Asian heritage. While Bowles makes a worthy effort at portraying middle east culture as alienating and disorienting to the average American, I just couldn't buy the \\"mysteriousness\\" of Moroccan culture. The world is a much smaller, more cosmopolitan place than it was in 1947, so it was hard for me to relate to crucial elements of Sheltering Sky's main character, the desert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turn off your conscious mind!","review":"There's no other way to read Paul Bowles. Just tell the inner critic to shut up for a while, let yourself fall into his dark shadowy prose, and he will take you over..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written but confusing","review":"The Sheltering Sky was an interesting novel with well-written descriptions that transport the reader to the vast desert of North Africa. Bowles also offers great psychological insight into the characters' personalities; however, I found the last section abrupt and somewhat confusing. After reading the description on the back of the book, I expected to see a gradual change in the characters, which was present, but most of the changes in Kit (one of the three main characters) seem to occur suddenly when there are about 60 pages left to read. I'm not sure that I got everything out of reading this novel that I was supposed to, but I will say that the three main characters were very interesting, and the mother and son who kept turning up everywhere were amusing. I would recommend this novel, but not if you are looking for a quick and/or easy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"transports you","review":"There's a haunting scene where the surviving characters gaze up at teh full moon over the desert, and think of how rarely they truly notice the moon . . . and begin to wonder how many full moons they have left in their lives. All of Bowles' works make you confront your mortality in ways that are, ultimately, liberating."},{"rating":"1","title":"No cultural insights","review":"An unsatisfying book, recounting an implausible story of sheer fantasy with no/little pretensions of reality. I chose the book expecting to glean cultural insight of places (Algeria in this case) that I'll never visit, based on book-cover and online write-ups with remarks such as \\"devastatingly imaginative observer of the West's encounter with the East\\" and \\"Paul Bowles examines the ways in which Americans' incomprehension of alien cultures leads to the ultimate destruction of those cultures.\\" The book attained none of this, it dwelled for pages on sheer fantasy, highly implausible events, characters of dubious sanity, and offered no cultural insights beyond recounting the heat and grit of African life, with both of which I'm already familiar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsympathetic characters, ambiguous setting","review":"A novel in the tradition of dissolute sojourns by privileged but dissatisfied figures, Bowles attempts to beautify desolate landscapes and repressive Saharan locales, but for this reader he fails. None of the characters are sympathetic, they are merely foils of the ugliest sort: ugly Americans, thieving and conniving Brits, scoffing French officers, amorphous Arab and African stereotypes. Read and enjoy this if you are or like alcoholic and licentious blue-bloods and enjoy suffering in yourself and others, because suffer you will as you read the painful travails of Kit, Port, Tunner, and the others. I can sympathize more with protagonists from Henry Miller, Ernest Hemingway, John Dos Passos, and even Fitzgerald, much more so than Bowles' agonists. The best book about being trapped in a sandy hell hole is Abe's \\"The Woman in the Dunes.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Might be the best novel of the 20th Century","review":"I just read this book for the second time.

Usually I see a film AFTER reading the book, but this film, in a Bertolucci retrospective, was intriguing and left me with many questions about the characters that I thought might be resolved in the novel. The novel was unfulfilling in terms of understanding the main character's motivations, particularly those of Kit and Porte. Nonetheless, the first half of the book, set in North Africa, probably Algeria, was compelling. However, in my opinion \\"Sheltering Sky\\" deteriorated as the story focuses on Kit. Without giving the plot away, I'll say only that her behavior turns incomprehensible and disturbing. Sheltering Sky unexpectedly degenerates into a kind of gothic novel -- which is not the genre I wanted to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"dry,not quaking","review":"what an experience! well worth the time to read.forget the movie..some parts are unbelievable; but thats bowles..this is a great book to start you on the path to becoming a \\"beat\\"-nik..the heat..the sand..what a lifestyle! wouldn't it be interesting if you could just travel for months, years,decades, at a time and still remember what you are running away from? you can run, but you can't hide.history, time and place are always a part of your present..bowles is one cool dead dude..try other works by him as you listen to loreena mckennitt and think about going to work tomorrow..ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"A wonderful existentialist triumph--and the basis for a song by The Police, \\"Tea in the Sahara\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not about Morocco","review":"Read this before we left for Morocco to get some background on the country but it was a somehhat dark tale about a dysfunctional relationship."},{"rating":"1","title":"trays","review":"junk dont buy it get yourself some real trays unless you dont need to get the cubes out of the tray which is what this is good for........I call this a movie set ice tray"},{"rating":"1","title":"Less information than free online sources","review":"Totally useless article - better information is available for free online.Infant mortality rates of 10-15% are grossly overstated in this very brief article.

There are no lyrics. It is a true concept album based on Paul Gallico's wonderful novella, \\"The Snow Goose.\\" Filled with great melodies and individual character-based musical pieces (a little like Prokofiev's \\"Peter and the Wolf\\" in places, four-piece progressive rock in others), TSG includes a full orchestra in the background and occasionally the orchestral instruments are featured up front as well.

The singer has the voice of an angel, albeit a sad bastard angel, and his singing rises just enough above a whisper to break your heart.

Supposedly written from the author's own past-life recall this is a must-read for anyone interested in metaphysics, American history or women's studies. Vibrantly alive, Neff's Patty Jefferson emerges as a compelling figure in TJ's life. This vivid portrayal brings up more questions than it answers.... namely HOW does the author know all this?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"History becomes a Harlequin Romance","review":"I am amazed by the other reviews I read. Have you never read a piece of actual good writing? Does history count for nothing? This story is a badly-told, baffling bodice-ripper, written in a pseudo-georgian vernacular. It reminds me of nothing so much as a teenage girl playing dress-up with historical costumes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Garbage, a badly written costume drama at best","review":"I find this woman very hard to believe. Any scholar knows that Jefferson and his wife held their love story very private. If this woman was even 10% of what his wife was, as far as class, dignity, education and charm then A. She would not have written about her sex life and courtship, even now, for her \\"so called recalled love of Thomas\\" it would still have been a very private matter B. she would have not written Thomas like he had a high school level education- he would have used bigger words and better dialogue (seeming she was married to this man and can \\"recall\\" what he supposedly said to her).Don't me mislead by this complete waste of time and shameful piece of literature- I sure hope that the folks in Williamsburg and Monticello aren't buying her self indulged stories.FYI those so called past life regressions she had can be put into her mind over time- especially seeming she has been obsessed with Thomas since childhood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly written tripe","review":"If you're looking for a book that explores the true character of Martha Jefferson and her relationship with her husband...THEN DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS. I can only assume that the other glowing reviews on this page were posted by the author's family. This book is not history--but romance- and it's not even well-written. Anyone associated with this thing should be embarrassed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fantastic","review":"This is a wonderful video.

The studio film is equally moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!","review":"I first watched this film in the Air and Space Museum in Wash. DC back in the 70's. It was shown in one of the off the beaten track side rooms. Being one of the few museums I visited with any regularity, I always made a point of hitting this room when ever I visited.The film, to me, shows in detail, how absolutely tiny and insignificant we are in the universe. We are nothing!!!! How happy was I to learn that this film was rereleased on a disc to enjoy again, and with my son.An absolute MASTERPICE by the Eames.

LOVE them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A dis-service to the Tapestries","review":"If you have ever had the chance to sit and gaze at these magnificent tapestries in Paris, skip this book. It is nothing but a cheap romance novel that tries to drag these fantastic pieces of art and symbolism down with it. If you are truly interested in the tapestries, read one of the marvelous interpretations of their possible meanings. Some interpretations are sexual, others religious, all better stories than this one. I wish I could erase her version of the story from my head.If Tracy Chevalier wants to write yet another story about an artist's seduction of a maid, perhaps she can stick with a minor work and not one so rich in meaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Believable, entertaining, with bits of real history mixed in....","review":"This book was fantastic. I enjoyed every page. I was surprised to find that the book was believable! I found the characters to have been painted so vividly that you really feel a connection. I cannot recommend this book enough. It is rare to find a piece of historical fiction that is likeable to as large a group of readers as I feel this piece to be. It is perfect without dwelling too much on details like the time, geography, etc. This book is really a colorful telling of the tapestries and the story itself is almost as fascinating as the tapestries themselves!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I don't normally read books of this sort, but I thought I could try to get into it. This was a tedious book, predictable at every turn. After struggling to read the blahty blah and flowery wordiness, I got to one of the most disappointing endings. The author does use great imagery, but the characters are week and hold no power or connection with the reader. I was seriously disappointed, and unfortunately this experience will more than likely keep me away adventuring outside of my preferred genre. Sorry... two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm..did I read the same book as everyone else?","review":"What on earth did everyone else read?!?....this book isn't even worth 0.1 of a star. It's terrible! I'm pretty sure 20c mass produced romance novels are better than this drivel. I'm not really a fan of historical fiction, but it was given to me as a present so I felt I had to read it. The 'plot' is terrible. None of the characters have any depth or any real storyline.Our protagonist, if you can call him that; Nicolas, only has one trick up his sleeve to \\"plough\\" his girls...a tale about how a unicorn's horn makes everything pure. He then sets about trying to sleep with basically any girl over 12. There's a bit of talk here and there about tapestries...but I think a primary school course in art history can give you more meaningful information than this book. The story is complete nonsense and VERY poorly expressed and to be honest with you, I cannot believe it ever got published, let alone sold and read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really enjoyed this, easy read.","review":"It's been a year or so since I read this so I can't give specifics. But this is probably my favorite Tracy Chevalier novel. I either really enjoy her work or can't stand it, like \\"Burning Bright\\". Terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"The story draws you in","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Sure, I love unicorns as much as the next girl (young or old), but I also loved the back and forth between the time periods and the mystery of the tapestries coming to life. All in all, a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this the same Chevalier who wrote \\"Pearl Earring\\"?","review":"\\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\" was an extraordinary novel, with its simplicity and subtlety and intriguing characters. \\"Lady and the Unicorn\\" is its opposite, with shallow characters, a silly plot, and an unengaging, elementary writing style. The overabundant references to sex and the raunchy sexual encounters are nauseating. I've read all of Chevalier's books, and while none are even in the same league as \\"Earring,\\" at least the others were readable. The fact that this book revolves around a beautiful piece of art is immaterial; it belongs in the dime-store novel genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"spellbinding read","review":"As a Chevalier fan this book was not a letdown. It was almost on par with Girl with a Pearl Earring. The characters were well developed. You grow to like and the good guys and hate such characters as LeBoeuf. The idea of the story in the tapestry and the people behind making it is fabulous. I wanted to delve further in the family of weavers. This is about change in our lives. Wonderful. A great piece of \\"historical\\" fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"An agricultural tale","review":"So much plowing! It's all the male character talks about! This becomes a very tiring sexual metaphor after about twenty pages. I continued to read, hoping (in vain) that the story would take off and there would be a reason for the endless plowing references. I thought, perhaps the author wants us to really dislike this guy. But he seems to be the \\"hero\\" of the story. Why?I must say I was very surprised and disappointed, having recently read \\"Girl With a Pearl Earring.\\" Don't know what happened with this one. A major and annoying waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got halfway through...and had to stop.","review":"I, too, enjoyed \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring,\\" as well as \\"Falling Angels.\\" But this was an altogether waste of time. The characters are unbelievable and, frankly, annoying. The storyline was dull and didn't seem to do justice to the actual paintings. I expected more from Chevalier than this cheap, romantic rubbish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tracy Chevalier does it again... just brilliant!","review":"I love Ms. Chevalier's work and this novel is a great example of how she is able to carry the reader's attention to the very last page. I appreciated the unusual twist of events ((but I won't give it away!)) that didn't allow for a \\"cookie cutter\\" ending. Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A delight","review":"This is one of the most delightful books I've read in the past few years. Yes, yes, we know it's about a set of medieval tapestries being woven and about the people who get caught up in each others' lives as a result. Put like that, it sounds dusty and worthy perhaps. Nothing could be further from the truth. For me, Lady and the Unicorn bubbled along, filled with both fun and pathos. I found myself caring deeply not only about the characters but also the tapestries themselves. I also found myself referring frequently to the designs underneath the dust-jacket and even poking around among the rugs in the basement to see whether there was a unicorn rug down there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly written, groan-worthy, eye-rolling.","review":"Based on the description on the back of this book, I expected an elegantly written, cozy, sophisticated, intriguing, engrossing Medievalish fantasy. What I got was a badly written, tawdry romance filled with cheesy innuendos that entirely lacked depth. I don't mind a tawdry romance, but 1) it was completely at odds with how this book is touted so I wasn't prepared for it and 2) even the least sophisticated romance I've read has never come close to this level of groan-worthy, eye-rolling text. To this day I am still not sure what the author was trying to accomplish, aside from making me guffaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"happy....to finish it......","review":"call me just an \\"average Jane\\" but I like reading stories where at LEAST one character has some redeeming feature that endears the story to me, the reader.In The Lady And The Unicorn I would have been happy to see every character fall off a cliff. From the horrid, rutting painter, to his vain, selfish \\"true\\" love, her miserable and misery making mother and all the rest are only worthy of a long walk off a short pier. The only recommendation worthy parts of the story were about the tapestry weaving, which were interesting and informative.If your idea of a \\"a fun evening reading\\" is to sink five feet in dark, depressing and selfish machinations, then this may be the book for you.2 stars for making even unicorns cringe worthy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Facinating, beautiful, educational.","review":"This is a fascinating story that educates the reader about how a lissier - a tapestry weaver - works. It makes learning something fun, and brings a beautiful work of art to life with a nice story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clumsy but mercifully quick to read","review":"One of the advantages of a reading circle is departing from one's normal reading matter. Hence I came to read my first (and definitely last) Tracy Chevalier novel. I know nothing of the Pearl Earring book or film. The poor imagery conjured up by the author does nothing to nourish the reader's soul. Many good reviews seem to mention the book's link with a real tapestry - just because a book has a real (art) artefact for inspiration does not make it a good work of fiction.In short, life is too short to waste it on prose such as this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't believe anyone would not like this excellent book!","review":"I read THE LADY AND THE UNICORN in one sitting, on a plane ride to Europe, and couldn't put it down. History has always fascinated me, and the story of Claude, nobleman's daughter. I found it amazing how Tracy Chevalier was able to take one tapestry and create an entire story about it. She builds upon what is already known to create a piece of fiction that seems almost real unto itself. I always marvel at Chevalier's works, as her language is descriptive to a fault, and doesn't assume an air of modernity which can be found in many historical novels written in the present time. I thought this was a well crafted book, the way McCrae's BARK OF THE DOGWOOD is, or perhaps the novel GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING. The writing is first-rate and right on the money. Do yourself a favor and buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling","review":"Having seen the exquisite series of tapestries of La Dame et la licorne at the Cluny Museum in Paris, I thought this theme held great promise. What a huge disappointment! What trash! Here is an actual passage (and I am not making this up!): \\"Luckily Nicolas didn't have to answer, as he couldn't have spoken. I had placed my hand on his bulge, which was as hard as a tree branch. I had never touched one before.\\" And much more along the same lines, ad nauseum. I can't believe reviewers have given this 5 stars! Or any stars at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I loved Tracy Chevalier's Girl with a Pearl Earring, but this book is not as well-written or enjoyable. The main problem is that the central characters are not likable. Who can sympathize with either a randy, pompous artist or a silly, unthinking girl, or an art patron who can't even see his wife's face in paintings? In Pearl Earring, both Griet and Vermeer are appealing and likable, and we care what happens to them. Plus, in Pearl Earring, the sexual tension is palpable, and I as a reader wanted to know what happened between them. Here, the sex is in-your-face and I didn't care what happened to these characters. Chevalier can do better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and original","review":"This book was very good and different. I loved the idea of the story and was totally taken away to a very different time in history. It really was a very sensual story. I was captivated and kept looking at the inside cover at the tapestry. I would definatly recommend this quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea, sloppy writing","review":"I loved the idea of The Lady and the Unicorn--the time period, the changing points of view, a fiction inspired by a real work of art--and I have enjoyed previous novels by Tracy Chevalier.But Chevalier's writing is getting pretty sloppy. She overwrites and tells the reader what she means instead of showing the reader. For example, she feels the need to tell the reader reapeatedly and explicitly how obsessed the daughter of the nobleman is with the painter, when she could have shown it with the actions of the characters to much better and more subtle effect. It is as if she does not trust her reader to figure it out.Her writing in this novel has also begun to verge on soft porn--meant to excite but not really exciting, perhaps just a ploy to reel in readers. The almost soft porn might be okay, except that it is not believable--I do not believe that some of these characters in these times would do such things so quickly and easily, without a second thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"An AMAZING disappointment!","review":"I was looking forward to the next Chevalier offering; of course, having read all of her former books,THE VIRGIN BLUE,FALLING ANGELS,and the haunting GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING.So? What did I delve into? A short book with anti-heroes/heroines.....thoroughly unlikeable main characters; a tedious recounting of how a tapestry is woven; and a plot so unbelievable that I, a life-long student and teacher of European history could hardly countenance the odd twists and turns. A sexual encounter under a table? Profligate violations of Guild rules? And happenstance pregnancies that presume to add to the story line? It was too much to swallow. Bottom line is that this author is grasping at a momentary glimpse of fame and she had better get her act together before she publishes, or is published, again. Sorry I bought it; and it's a give-a-way to anyone who wants it! Any takers?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Weaving a tale.","review":"The Lady and the Unicorn tapestries are a series of six pieces, each depicting the unicorn becoming more comfortable in the lady's prescence. This novel explores the possible conception and completion of those tapestries. That which interested me more than anything were the descriptions of weaving techniques and weavers' guild rules and regulations(no weaving by women permitted!!). What took place between Nicholas and Claude can hardly be called a love affair; a brief fling under the dining room table does not an affair make. The time that Nicholas spends in Brussles with the weaver and his family makes up for anything lacking elsewhere in the book. All in all, the tale is woven as neatly as the tapestries themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I'd hoped","review":"I read Chevalier's \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\" and loved it; so I thought I'd try another of her novels. This is, unfortunately, not the same caliber. It reads like the trashy romance novels I try to avoid. The character development revolves around sex, which can be pulled off (think Chopin's \\"The Awakening\\"), but it just wasn't in this case. The interaction between various societies, classes, and the art which binds them all is fascinating, but I would have prefered the novel to revolve more around that than some randy artists desire for the various female characters. So, I would definitely recommend \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\" but I would not recommend this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty amazing...","review":"I love life once lost because their music realy can insperi you alot...

I have seen their live set three times in LA and SF, and I am terribly disappointed with this new project.It seemed to me that they were really just trying to wear too many hats with this mix, and ultimately the sets had no substance or cohesive themes to them. Disc one had a few redeemable moments, but disc two was really just pretty lackluster. Just the same old stuff that everyone else is putting out. Nothing new, nothing good, and nothing that will withstand the test of time.I think these guys are very talented so I am at a loss to what happened with this project. Maybe the second release in July will make up for the disappointment. You would think that after having taken a break for a while and building up a following; they would have wanted to put out a more quality sound.I was pretty bummed out on this album.

Mainly used for trim, crown molding, and baseboard. Nothing major. After about a year the compressor started to go out and it would not hold a tank of air. Really frustrating. I could not find a service center nearby either so I was stuck with it. After about a year of dealing with it I just bought a new Porter Cable compressor and have had no problems since then. I am still using the guns on a fairly common basis and have not had any major problems. I lost a bump guard from one but that was probably my fault from dropping it.

My authorized repair center used the serial number and did not even request a purchase agreement for the free repair.Still, it is a great value and I like the nailers better than other brands I have used in the past. There are sturdy and easy to access a possible jams.My kit arrived with a travel \\"bag\\" but I would prefer if they had include a plastic case - being a little more rugged.It is the quietest compressor I have ever used for the 125 PSI pressure rating.Worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great for my projects","review":"I bought this combo kit a month ago and it has opened up a whole new approach to wood working projects for me.

This flat iron did not do a good job at all. I have very thick hair, so this one might work for someone with thinner hair. It just did not get hot enough is what i think was the problem. I ended up getting a $50 Con Air product from KMART and it worked wonders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Tools Tamed Me!","review":"I have naturally curly mixed in with frizzy waves. My hair is very coarse and thick, and I had almost given up on straighteners. I originally bought this particular flat iron from eBay 1yr. ago. Eventually, due to the demands of my hair it did give up, as far as heating up. I was so pleased with the results from the 1st one, that I knew this would be the only brand I would ever buy again, no matter how many times! Hot Tools 1177 Professional 2 inch Ceramic Flat Iron (1189) has made my hair soft to the touch and frizz free; thanks to anti-frizz hair serum that I comb through before use. My hair is manageable and smooth, and I would not post this review if I had anything at all negative to say about it. Certainly the product for those of us who have coarse, curly, thick and frizzy long hair! Proof positive!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"As I paid $20 I really cant complain - but if you are looking for a realy great flat iron, this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-par","review":"I bought this item from a local beauty supply store. I had several problems w/ the flat iron. First, my hair is fairly long, and when I would slide the hair along the plate, hairs would get caught between the plate and the plastic that held the plate, breaking the hairs. It didn't matter how big or small the section of hair was, some would get caught.Second, the iron completely stopped working after about six months. It was if the \\"on\\" switch stopped working. Setting the appliance to \\"on\\" didn't cause the power light to come on, and the appliance didn't heat up. I sent the appliance back to Helen of Troy, only for them to tell me they didn't have a replacement model in stock, and they couldn't tell me when they *would* have on in stock. They didn't tell me this until 4 weeks after I sent them the item for replacement.Long story short, save your money, buy a different appliance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"My hair gets stuck in the plates. I thought it was how I was using it but I see others have had the same issue. I prefer my smaller iron by Revlon."},{"rating":"2","title":"does the job!!","review":"I tried this straightening iron at a friend's house and could not believe how straight my hair could be! I've tried other straighteners but this one is great because it has 4 different heat settings which is great for all different hair types. It heats up quickly and straightens in half the time it took me with other straighteners."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was absolutely awesome","review":"I have really frizzy wavy hair, and this straightener was totally awesome! It made it so smooth and shiny, my hair felt like silk! I totally love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would NOT recommend!","review":"I initially liked this product until it broke a week after I purchased it. One side would not heat up so I sent it back to Amazon for a replacement. Amazon was great and sent a replacement immediately. I received the second one and it broke about a month after I recieved it. Same problem. One side would not heat up. Amazon's warranty was up so off it went to the Manufacturer. Surprise, surprise. ITEM NOT IN STOCK AND BACKORDERED. They could not get me a delivery date. I am now requesting a REFUND!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfied.","review":"This item was working great until just a few days ago. I only just bought it in December, 2005, and already it is broken. One of the sides no longer heats up!

I think their flat irons are incredible. I have very thick, wavy and rather frizzy hair but when using their flat iron my hair turns out amazingly straight and so sleek. I will admit have to replace my flat iron about every year and a half to two years but that's just because I use it so much. My best decision was switching to a ceramic flat iron. I find that it doesn't damage my hair as much, leaving it healthier looking and I burn myself less often. I must also add that I personally love the three inch plate. Having such thick hair, the larger plate really helps me straighten my hair quicker. I highly recommend this flat iron."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good While It Lasted","review":"It worked well, but the handle cracked near the change shortly after it was out of warranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Straightener","review":"I have really thick, hard to manage hair. I use to have a conair plate changing straightener, and a revlon mist straightener. Neither worked very well on my hair. I tried out a Hot Tools straightener at a friends, and my hair was really straight, soft, and shiny. I was amazed! A little research was done, and I found out that regular straighteners will give you split ends, and do damage to your hair, but ceramic straighteners aren't half as bad. So, I spent a little more money, and went with the 2\\" Ceramic Hot Tools. I LOVE IT! I can have my hair curly with gel in it, and it will still make it perfectly straight. It only takes a minute to heat up, and there are 10 different heat settings. It takes half as long to straighten my hair before school and it looks 100times better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just stopped working","review":"I bought this iron for fifty dollars and really liked it. It came with a year warranty - but I never sent it in, nor did I keep the reciept because: a) I am a disorganized person and b)I have NEVER had a small appliance stop working within a year of buying it. This product, however, did. About six months after I got it I noticed I wasn't getting the results while using it and realized that one of the plates no longer heated up. Not money well spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed in this product","review":"I have used hot tools many times in the past, including their flat irons. However, this particular one does not clamp down tightly on your hair - I have to clamp it, and then with my other hand close it tightly, and then run it through my hair. It is annoying and adds time to my hair styling. I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible...Does not work!!!","review":"I bought this expecting it to work nicely, but no. It doesn't straighten a thing. Barely even heats up. I am now going through the process of having to return it and get my money back. It was a huge waste of time and money. Don't waste either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, it's better than nothing...","review":"One of the only study guides for the AP French Language Exam, Barron's does give sample tests and at least an idea about what the exam will be like. However, I have prepared for several other AP exams using \\"Cracking the AP\\" by the Princeton Review. These books are much more readable and take an approach of \\"beating the test.\\" Barron's, by Laila Amiry, seems to be written for AP teachers, not students trying to improve their score. She begins by suggesting ways to, over a long period of time, improve your listening and comprehension skills. While this is a noble thought, as a student right now I am much more interested in getting a four, not on watching numerous movies in French. Especially if the exam is approaching quickly, Barron's is not worth the cost. This is a plea for some book company to write an informative, fun book on how to \\"beat\\" the AP French Language Exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst","review":"I personally detest the book. When I took the practice exams, I followed the steps that the writer suggested. The process made my results worse than if I had approahced the question in my way. The strategies are horrible.

It's also interesting to read the product ingredients and also the parent company of many of these name familiar companies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great resource","review":"I love this book. I have only had it for a week, and I can tell that it will be an invaluable resource. I don't see myself agreeing with her always (I like shiny make-up -- and even blue eyeshadow) but if I hadn't read her review of my sunscreen, I would have no way of knowing that it did not contain any of the top 3 ingredients used to block UVA rays.The people who probably don't like her book the most are likely those who love the products she trashes -- or those who really believe Chanel is worth the price it costs. Me, I see this book as not being the final word on any given product or item, but as a really helpful resource to find out about skin care and make-up before spend the money. I definately recommend it to those make-up junkies everywhere, as it is easy to read, and reviews every single product found in boutiques, department stores, and drugstores alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"old book","review":"Amazon send me an e-mail requested a review so here it is. I purchased this book in 2012. It was written years before so the information in it is not current. Some of the skincare products I'm using are not in the book. I realize she has a website but I wasn't that pleased with the book in general. I didn't read the entire book, but I did not find any ringing endorsements from her for any product. Could it be that because she also sells cosmetics, she was dishing her competitors? I don't want to think so, but I was not able to find a ringing endorcement for any skincare product available back then. Don't jump all over me if you found one because I was only looking at the skincare products. The choices seemed to be between those that were worthless and those that \\"did the job\\". No excitement over any.

This book explains that yes those products are great but there are other products with the exact ingredience for a lot less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scientific?","review":"Paula Begoun has built up an amazing business and marketing machine based on very little actual scientific fact and mostly biased opinion. If you've ever seen this woman give an interview ... well, let's just say her poor complexion and 80's makeup job speaks for itself. This is like the portly Dr. Phil writing a diet book and everyone flocking to read it.You've got to give the woman credit though. She's taken her opinion, common sense and sketchy science background and turned it into a very lucrative business."},{"rating":"1","title":"complete personal bias","review":"There is no objective advise here. While I've worked in Cosmetics and know there is a lot of hype, there are great products out there that she just completely destroys - mostly anything plant based. Not all here descriptions are valid and unless you have terribly sensitive skin, you can just ignore this book. The truth is keep your reciept! Take a tack and pin the reciept and box to a bulletin board and try the product your interested in, if you don't like the result, return your products to the store. If in 4 weeks you don't see ANY difference, it's not working for you! But this book will simply scare you, when most products are perfectly safe without reactions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased!","review":"Let me save you some time: Paula has something negative to say about every product on the market except for her own. I find that a lot of her information is suspect and some is just plain incorrect.In my opinion, she has no place critiquing other products while she is trying the schlep her own.If you are interested in the ingredients in products, buy Milady's skin care and cosmetic ingredients dictionary. It is educational, easy to understand, and impartial. It will be a better use of your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book by biased author","review":"Having read her preivous books I was anxious to see this latest edition given that she has her own product line. I was extremely disapointed. Her attitude was \\"too harsh\\" and it was difficult reading reviews knowing she was critiquing her own competition. This book seems to be nothing more than a marketing tool to get you to her web page in order to get you to buy her products.

She does say that these are her opinions. A person's opinions mean very little to me because like rear ends everyone has one. And in Paula's case, her opinions mean nil. I tried some of the products from her line and found them to be quite blah. She really needs to tell people in her book not to buy the garbage she sells. The only way to find out if a product works for you or not is to get some samples and try it out. There is no mass recipe for skin care, it is trial and error. All skin is different and no two people are alike. Just because something works for a friend, doesn't mean it will work for you. And Paula ain't your friend so I don't know why anyone bothers to listen to her. She has drummed a nice profit out of her little books, emerging into her own website with products she has for sale. Wake up people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I found this book at my local library before purchasing. I was glad of that b/c I won't be buying it. A much better read is Natural Organic Hair and Skin Care by Aubrey Hampton, creator of Aubrey Organics who this author does not give credit due for his hair and skin line. I found Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter without Me more of a personal opinion of almost every cosmetic product on the market. It get's tedious.

Begoun's negative tone was much too strong and repetitive to take her critiques seriously. It seems that only her line receives 100% high marks. It made me wonder how Begoun was able to evaluate \\"over 35,000 products,\\" effectively.This book lost all credibility when the author included her own line of skin and hair care products within the book. It was not surprising all of Begoun's products were posted in Paula's Picks as the best products to use. It was shameless self-promotion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Go To The Cosmetic Counter At All - Instead Buy PAULA'S Product!!","review":"The first thing that flew out of the book when I took it out of the Amazon box was Paula's advertisement for her own product! I was completely shocked and felt like a dummy! I understand that she may feel, with all her research, she is an expert on the field, and even understand how she could possibly come up with an ideal product....but for goodness sake be SUBTLE!She should at least let the reader discover Paula's product (alphabetically listed)slowly. I can even get past ALL the smiley faces her own product gets, but I definitely don't want an insert to fly out of the book when I first open it. This is completely in poor taste, and I don't feel she can be objective!Having said all this, she may have valid points, she may have done great research, she may have the best product, but I really don't care, as I feel like an ABSLOUTE sucker for spending $20 for buying her advertising gimmick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful for anyone","review":"I'm a student makeup artist and I'm tired of spending my money on [not so good] makeup, so I was just pleased as punch to find this book. I agree with most of the cosmetics she test, however, she doesn't seem to like bright bold colours, so she marks them unkindly, even though they're wonderful.So stop spending your money on [not so good stuff], get this book and it'll save you $$$ in the long run!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, very good but negativity is irritating","review":"I have saved hundreds (if not thousands) from reading Paula's books. But her negative tone gets to me very quickly in this latest edition, I must admit. The advice has changed my attitude towards buying makeup - no longer so extravagant; I mean who knows except yourself what you're wearing - and I discovered I shouldn't use anything with titanium dioxide in it and stopped having BAD breakouts (saving even more money). So overall it's good, especially for those with sensitive skin, oily or dry. Those lucky folks who never react to any ingredients don't need the book, although I think her message that you don't need to spend hundreds on skin care, anyone can use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here is why some cosmetics work, and some don't","review":"Ms. Begoun does not just tell us which products are good, she tells why. I enjoyed finding which drug-store products were better than the department store products, and actually buying them, and discovering they were great! It's nice to have a guide for cosmetics. When I can't return cosmetics, I'd like to know what it is I'm spending all my money on and if it will really work. I do it for cars and other major purchases; why not for my face? I checked this book out of the library several times before I finally broke down and bought it. I do not regret a moment of it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Kindle!!!","review":"Kindle is not a user-friendly format for this book.

It was money well spent because I have saved money using it as a guide to what I buy. I bought mine own copy cos I like having it on hand whenever I need it. I think Paula's recommendations are on target."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice guide, but don't take it too literal","review":"It's a nice guide to have, but don't take it \\"by the book\\", since you will find that too often you don't share her opinion. She claims to rate every product based on what the product promises, but gives EVERY single pencil that needs sharpening a bad or neutral rating. I mean, it's a pencil, what was she expecting? the pencil is delivering what it promises, even though it needs sharpening! they didn't say it wouldn't need sharpening. The cosmetics rating are also subjective, so be careful. You might hate a certain mascara, and yet, Paula loves it. And viceversa. So, if you are a makeup junkie, get this book, it will give you a general idea of products, especially when it comes to ingredients. Just make sure you form your own opinion!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money!","review":"This book was a waste of my time and money.

Please do not waste your time on this book. I am either going to demand my money back for or throw it in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is she really unbiased?","review":"I bought this book with enthusiasm, but when I learned the author has her own line of products I felt like I had totally wasted my money. How can she honestly have an unbiased opinion when she has a real need to knock down other products? I disagree with many of her opinions and I wonder how many times she tried a product or company. For example, she doesn't have a whole lot of positive things to say about Mary Kay, but I wonder how many consultants she went to. I love my consultant and she has never done any of the things mentioned in this book! Maybe the author just had an unfortunate experience that most people won't have. At any rate, I take her \\"advice\\" with a grain of salt. I just don't possibly think she can be unbiased while she is selling her own line. Which of her own products does she not like?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Honestly, you should go to the counter without her!!!!","review":"Coming from a clinique counter I can personally tell you that a lot of her information is incorrect. Now I believe that not every product is for everyone but she is giving you wrong product info. For instance she states that turnaround cream is a good moisturizer and that is it, Actually turnaround cream has NO moisturizers at all, it is a chemical exfoiliant maid to break down dead skin cells refine skin and diminish signs of aging. Or she states that All About Eyes can be a very good moisturizer for all over. Please don't do this, it is not a heavy enough moisturizer for your face, it is a hydrater and also it has a active ingredient of Caffeine to stimulate your capilaries to pool out some blood and thus reduce dark circles and puffiness. Please talk to a consultant before using a product. We are here for you and one last thing, she has nothing to back herself up in, she isn't a chemist or a doctor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go to your dermatologist","review":"While the book was comprehensive and somewhat informative, I found it to be biased and sometimes irrelevant.

I received much better information from a dermatologist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paula What's Your Point?","review":"Paula states at the beginning of the book that this is her opinion and her suggestions won't work for everyone. Then she goes on to tell us what is good and bad based largely on her own preferences. Is this about the facts or the world according to Paula?

I definatly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A life-preserver in the sea of hype!","review":"I can't tell you how much money I have saved, and the improvement in my skin is remarkable. And, what's most important: with Ms. Begoun's advice on sunscreens, I am finally doing everything I can to protect myself from future wrinkles and skin cancer, without smearing a slew of unnecessary moisturizers (with their preservatives and irritants) on my oily, sensitive, breakout-prone skin. As far as her 'attitude' goes: she's angry at the cosmetics industry, and justifiably so! The misinformation they regularly put out to women is irresponsible and can be harmful."},{"rating":"1","title":"1,000 pages of sales pitch!","review":"Paula Begoun's books have in the past been somewhat informative, but her latest edition is a waste of money. The reviews have not been updated, (there are a lot of products listed that are no longer made or have been reformulated) and the whole thing comes off as a sales pitch for her new line of cosmetics! She's just trying to sell that now on top of just selling her books, a bad combination! The reviews have the feel of \\"this is why my products are better than theirs.\\" Taking the advice of Paula Begoun is now no different than asking Clinique what they think of Lancome! (except they would probably be more tactful!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misinformed","review":"I have read her book and, I am thankful that I went to the library versus buying her book. I have found a few errors and, am curious if she is being held liable for misinformation. I was an employee for a company that she reviewed and, I can tell you that she made false claims or incorrectly listed an ingredient in this particular line. Which completely discounts her credibility in my eyes. I encourage the potential buyer to be aware and check her credentials.You may be better off with an ingredient dictionary. 2 that come to my mind are A Consumer's Dictionary of Cosmetics Ingredients or What's in your Cosmetics."},{"rating":"1","title":"I DON'T need you to buy my cosmetics","review":"Very disappointing. I was expecting a guide of what to buy or not but instead its just propaganda for her cosmetic line.

This is one of the longest running facial cleasers on the market. Heck, my grandmother used it! Plus, it's the only skin wash that hasn't made my skin dry. And then she gives smiley faces to Neutrogena, which by the way made my skin break out in a bad rash. She neglects to highlight the important cosmetics. Seems to me she is just writing what works best for HER skin. She must remember that everyone's skin is different."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate to even give this book one star...","review":"Thank God she says this is the last book she'll write.

I was, however, extremely disappointed to find out that it was full of misinformation about products, especially what they were to be used for. This is more of a fifth grade slam book for the beauty industry than a resource for women interested in beauty. If I could give it no stars, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a BREAK!","review":"Any consumer out there with common sense will leave this book behind! Why take advice from an author who is so blantantly promoting HER OWN line of cosmetics? Wouldn't it make sense for her to shed a negative light on her biggest competitors? Plus, since everyone's skincare and makeup needs are different, why would you base your purchases on what ONE person thinks? We deserve to find the products that work best for US, NOT Paula!

It might not have stopped my wrinkles but it sure would have smelled better than this stinky deceptive book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Teh Awesome","review":"Paula's books are a must for anyone who spends more than $100 a year on skin care and cosmetics!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Mom Loves This.","review":"Just as the title says - I sent this to my mom as a gift, and she evidently does just what the title says - she takes it with her to cosmetics counters ranging from the local Rite Aid to Nordstrom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't [not buy] products based on this book alone","review":"The author, Paula Begoun, does not go into great detail when explaining why some products are \\"bad\\", and why some are \\"good\\". At times, her reasons for discrediting a product are too vague to seriously take into consideration. Also, there are times in many of her reviews when she will give a product a good rating, but then counteract it with something negative to say about it. In my opinion, I don't think that this book is [good] simply because different people with have various reactions to various products. What works for some may not work for others. Bottom Line: The book gives useful information on the ingredients within the products, but the author is not very detailed and comes across as having a \\"grudge\\" on many of the product lines. Try the products for yourself through samples, and you be the judge!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but a bit contradictory","review":"I really like this book, but what I don't understand is that when you read about a product she says not too good things about it and then in the end of the book ranks it high (under best moisturizer for example) I don't understand how she does her ratings. Some things get good rankings (smiley faces)but not good written writeups which is quite confusing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Everyone's Skin is Different","review":"I'm so glad I read these reviews before I bought this book. As soon as I read that Paula is a proponent of mineral oils I knew her product recommendations would be irrelevent for me personally. I think Paula has some great advice as I've read other books by her, but she seems to have only one way of thinking. As an aesthetician with extremely sensitive skin that is prone to break outs, I've learned that what works for me doesn't work for everybody. The most baffling thing about skincare is that there is no universal treatment. EVERYONE'S SKIN IS DIFFERENT and reacts differently to ingredients. Even Dermatologists don't know everything there is to know about skin so how can someone who isn't a doctor have all of the answers? The simple fact is that you have to take any skin care advice with a grain of salt regardless of who you get your information from."},{"rating":"2","title":"I do NOT go to the cosmetic counter w/o Paula","review":"This book has proven to be the most informative and best written book regarding cosmetics. It not only gives information on all the \\"designer\\" brands, the local brands but gives you the ingredients and what they will or will NOT do. You will find the \\"designer\\" brands are nothing but marketing and hype. I applaude Paula Beguon and all her hard work to put this information in writing for the consumer to read. Keep up the good work, Paula!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Paula Begoun has saved my skin!!","review":"I've never found a more honest or helpful book. It has saved me tons of money, not to mention breakouts, oily skin, dry irritation, sunburn and in the future, wrinkles. I'm glad I found this book this young because Paula seems to know my skin even better than some dermatologists do. She dedicates a VERY FEW, unrated pages to her own line, which is superior. I found this guide easy to use and nearly three years later am still refering to it before any purchase.I've NEVER looked better. After reading this, you will never look at the cosmetics/skin care industry (or your own face!!) the same. Highly reccommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest","review":"This book is chock full of information and clearly very well-researched. The problem is that it is poorly organized. The book should put all mascara together, all cleansers together, all eye creams, lipsticks, etc. Instead, it places all brands in alphabetical order. Therefore, if you want to know which is the very best mascara to purchase, you have to look through pages and pages to get the info. It seems that it may be done that way purposely to assure that readers go through ever brand and all of their products. This is not the reference that I thought it would be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty comments","review":"Although Paula has done some good research, she puts some random comments into her reviews that are untrue.For example, it is clear that she does not like The Body Shop's shimmer cubes. She says that if you drop it it will easily break and that the product tends to flake.I have dropped the tester in the store. This means that it was open and i dropped the whole thing from the shelf, which was about 5 feet. The make-up did NOT crack. It even popped out of the container and the container's container (so there was cube of pure make-up) on the floor and did NOT crack.Furthermore, I have dry skin on my eyelids that flake. I use the shimmer cubes to STOP them from flaking. So I don't know where she gets the \\"each shade is grainy and the shine tends to flake.\\" Or if she meant \\"fade\\" instead of \\"flake\\" then she should take course in English.Overall, I think it's important to not take everything she says seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Believe the Hype - Take Paula With You!","review":"Although I hardly ever give a book a 5 star rating, this one more than deserves it!I have never ceased to be amazed at the number of intelligent, savvy women who get taken in by the outrageous claims and exorbitant prices of the cosmetics industry. Pauls aobviously feels the same way: she begins her book with a letter from, of all people, a marketing executive, who had wasted literally thousands of dollars over the years on useless beauty products.Now, however, we have Paula, and we no longer need to believe the ridiculous hype of the beauty business. In this weightly tome, Paula cuts through the nonsense you read in ads and in magazines, and judges products the only way they should be judged: by their ingredients listings. Even if, like me, you're not a cosmetics addict and only occassionally buy beauty products, this book will still save you money and spare you disappointment. Don't go to the cosmetics counter without it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-hum!","review":"I found this book un-impressive. I would not recommend wasting your money or time reading it. Purachase cosmetics that can be returned if you do not like them ~ do your own research."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was disappointed. First of all, she plugs her products too much. and she's really negative about a lot of products. Now, I'm sure she has back up, but some of the products she rated very low, I've had great results with. And there are a ton of products not reviewed....like OroGold, Gratiae, and some others. It's a huge book, but it's form 2009. Obviously there are a ton of new products out there, since the business of wrinkles is a billion dollar industry. It needs updating. Her website is way too geared for her line...which I've never heard of before seeing this book. It's called Paula's Choice. Not a name I'd look into...of course all the reviews about her line are positive. It's just too slanted. I'd have more respect for her if she didn't have her own line, and wasn't trying to sell it when ever she could. it took her credibility away for me. She could be right on track -- you just don't know for sure. And, like everything, different products work better on different people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, very useful and informative","review":"This is a great book every woman should own. If you want advice on what products work and what products are actually detrimental to your skin, this is the book for you. She gives honest reviews and ratings on a tremendously wide range of products. So forget what the magazines tell you - magazines promote certain products to make their advertisers happy. The customer is the victim here so be a smart consumer and you too will thank Paula. Many reviewers complain that Paula badmouths the more expensive cosmetic lines.. which is not true. She has given many great reviews on a lot of their products. The truth is, if you're going to spend that much money on cosmetics, you're probably not going to settle for drug store substitutes. You are simply going to be a more educated consumer and learn to choose the best products from each cosmetics line."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIAS! BIAS! BIAS!","review":"You know I might buy what Ms. Begoun says in her book if it wasn't for the fact that she has her own cosmetic line which according to her...is well, better than everyone's else. To me, she can not possibly be objective knowing that she is trying to promote her own products. Of course she doesn't like or has something bad to say about most of the cosmetics she has reviewed...she wants you to buy her stuff. Don't waste your time on this, you can be a smart consumer without Paula Begoun's bias opinions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative, saved me money, time and sorrow.","review":"Quite an eye opener.

I have found most helpful. When she would answer people on her website she would say that \\"natural\\" products are no better than synthetic. Now, she is selling a natural line of skin care on her website! I have always thought there were slots of unregulated chemicals in products... Now I check goodguide.com and skindeep.com and am shocked at all the toxins in most cosmetics and skin care! It may not matter to her, but it matters to me.. Health, Society and ecology are more important than the best products.... Especially cosmetics. And if she abhors animal testing, why is Olay, Covergirl, and even Cetaphil listed as \\"the best\\"??"},{"rating":"1","title":"She's just so wrong....","review":"As a person who has made her living as a 'cosmetic cop' for over twelve years, I wonder where she gets her information! She's just WRONG so often. Lavender is harmful for your skin??? SEAWEED is harmful for your skin???So much of what she says in this book is just straight up wrong its ridiculous. I've trained with over 20 cosmetic lines and have been a trainer myself. I am all about researching ingredients to see what they do and see what effect they have on the skin. Ive spent hours of my own time doing this. Ugh. This book was garbage. Use what you think works for you. There's no way this woman went out and tried 30,000 products and even if she did, she doesn't have the same skin as you. Skin care and make up should be fun, and effective. Not based on some cracked out theories of some woman. Especially when they are almost all wrong. If something works for you - THEN USE IT. period."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love Makeup you will love this book!","review":"I love make up, but there are just so many products out there to choose from. A friend recommended this book and it really helped me narrow down what foundation to use for my skin type and in my price range.But, as always, go out and TRY the product before you buy it. You can try many department store cosmetics right at the counter and many drug stores have a policy that allows you to try the product and then bring it back with no hassles! (Harmons is a great one for that!)So I highly recommend this book to guide you through the world of cosmetics!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete bias!","review":"Let me save you some time: Paula has something negative to say about every product on the market except for her own. I find that a lot of her information is suspect and some is just plain incorrect.In my opinion, she has no place critiquing other products while she is trying the schlep her own.If you are interested in the ingredients in products, buy Milady's skin care and cosmetic ingredients dictionary. It is educational, easy to understand, and impartial. It will be a better use of your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"When I first heard about this book I was really excited. I'd heard that some less expensive products were just as good as the expensive ones. So I read this book. (Thankfully I just checked it out from the library.) I tried some of the suggested less expensive products. But, I'm going back to Estee Lauder. The cheaper products resulted in break outs and skin that felt dry. Like lots of people , I got really excited when I was told that for less money I could get something just as good. But cosmetics are just like anything else--you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not scientific, only anecdotal evidence to support claims.","review":"I think that there is a lot of good information in the book. It might make a good starting place for make-up consumers. For better skincare advice, see a dermatologist. Cosmetics, by definition, cannot permanently alter your skin. Things that do that are classified as drugs and are regulated. I have met very helpful and informed cosmetics counter people and used to be one. While I admit there are people who just want you to spend your money on products you don't need, I managed to become the top seller at my counter by only selling people the products I thought would benefit them. If you aren't happy with the person helping you, get someone else. The woman writing this book sounds angry, and I have a hard time swallowing advice from an obviously biased person. But, I can sympathize with her frustration. And she's definately hit a nerve with a big portion of the country.

Wonder Why. Would of given a 3 star rating! They did not have enough class to answer back completely in my prior email. Like they could of given the review of that soap! But to busy I guess!

This edition has thirty or so items in each category with no mention of the best prices. Also, in her first book I often disagreed with Ms. Begoun on products I have personally used as did many of the blind test groups. There are no test groups in this edition just facts, formulas and ingredients.I also found her own product line in the book a little too self promoting.Unless you are in need of a list of ingredients in cosmetics I can't see any point in this book as a reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect Door Stop - Dreadful Cosmetics Guide","review":"I was so disappointed with \\"Don't Go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me\\". Why are products that are given less than enthusiastic reviews, listed in the \\"Best Product\\" chapter? My sister, her 16-year-old daughter and I all thought there was an overwhelming amount of not very helpful information. The first thing you do when reading this book is to look up the products you use and see how they rate. Not a single product any of us use was given an overwhelming endorsement. Unfortunately, over 1000 pages later I am still unsure as to what I should be using. Don't bother carrying this enormous book to the cosmetics counter.

I no longer shop for most items at the department stores. I have found, thanks to her reviews, lots and lots of great make-up at the pharmacy and discount stores. I can go nuts on eye shadows and blush and lipsticks because Ms. Begoun has told me what has good consistency and blendability and what does not. She is not a big fan (to say the least) of shimmer and sparkle (except for special occasions). She recommends matte products. I have tried products I wouldn't have normally given a serious thought to, and love them!!! In order for her information to be exceptionally helpful, you can't be stuck on department store brand names.

While the book would have benefited from a more thorough editing and proofreading process, I nonetheless greatly enjoyed reading it. It appeared to be well researched and the author obviously has a passion for the subject. I found the Stevenson family fascinating. The descriptions of the building of the lighthouses, particularly the great ones; Eddystone, Bell Rock, and Skerryvore, imparted a sense of both the excitement in attempting such daunting projects and the tremendous difficulties that were overcome to build the structures. I also enjoyed the illustrations, but wish that more had been included. I would recommend this book to anyone having an interest in the history of lighthouses or maritime engineering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masters of lighthouse construction","review":"\\"Extraordinary\\" is certainly the appropriate term for Bathurst's excellent documentation of the incredible Stevenson family of lighthouse engineers. Up to this time, most of the attention toward this families accomplishments has focused on the author, Robert Louis Stevenson, and left others of his amazing family in the dust. Bathurst's research is impressive and her ability to tell this story is thorough, yet highly enjoyable(I missed my bus twice.). The most exciting part really is about patriarch Robert Stevenson's building of the lighthouse at Bell Rock. You can feel the sense of horror as Stevenson notices their ship has pulled away from it's moorings, and his realization that death may be near as the tide rises. If you don't have a summer book yet, and you like good non-fiction. Try this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Typos and mistakes galore! So how solid is the history?","review":"After visiting Scotland last summer, I was excited to find this book. The wild Scottish coast is an intriguing context for adventure, courage, and (here) amazing engineering achievement. However, the book is a huge disappointment. The story is potentially quite a compelling one, but the HUGE number of mistakes--both in the editing and proofreading and factually--detract to an overwhelming degree from one's possible enjoyment of the book. If this were a paper from one of my students, it would get about a C-. Given the number of mechanical errors in the book, one might be very skeptical about the historical facts, as well. And if it isn't good history, it sure doesn't cut it as decent fiction. If you want to read this one, check it out of the library.

Whether the fabrication of this pseudo-biography is representative of the entire collection I can't say, but it certainly has nothing to do with the reality of her life. Gilmore knows that this sort of thing satisfies some deep inner need of his own, and obviously that of his most devoted readers. But for those who are interested in a non-fiction account of her life, I urge you to wait for the publication of \\"Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye\\", a complete chronicle of her life by John O'Dowd soon to be published by BearManor Media.

By far this is his most aggressive work; an overwhemilng quality to it, thrusting at you as it does. Few writers have this capacity. The tragic timbre that lays beneath the surface of this work is devastating. A true presentation of where contemporary literature should be and, unfortunately, is not. A fine book on the vanguard of this author's body of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could anyone call this Nu Metal?!?!?","review":"I keep trying to give this band a chance, because I hear in certain circles that people like them. In all honesty, I can't understand why people in the metal scene would enjoy this. This is NOT latin-influenced metal, like so many people say. This album, and the previous one as well, is latin-influenced POP/ADULT CONTEMPORARY with a metal guitar riff thrown in every couple songs. In the first song on this album they say they've been at this for 10 years. Well, if that's the case...they need to try waiting for another 10 before trying to record another album. If you want REAL latin-influenced new school metal that is done effectively, try a band called ILL NINO. Ill Nino buries these fools."},{"rating":"2","title":"The sound of Puerto Rican rage","review":"This band started in early 90's and i've been following the band since.I've got to say that this album has been a big evolution for the band and really blew my mind!The guys are better than ever, the sound is so bold, everything is perfect.This album is their best production to date.If you're into rage againt the machine's rapping and growling, pantera's killer riffs and soulfly's percussion aranges you gotta buy this cd right away 'cause it's better than all of them together!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After their amazing first album, which was the perfect blend of bilingual metal, jazz, and salsa, this one comes off as a huge disapointment. Somewhere, for some reason, they lost most of their salsa/jazz influences and went generic nu-metal (the downfall of metal) with latin percussion, something Sepultura masterd a long time ago (true metal, not this nu-metal [..]). There are still some gems, like Si Aja, Pa'Ti Pa'Mi, and Ahorake and the production/musicianship is still as good as before, but I found myself skipping through most of the songs. Get Fundamental instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit new iPod Nano","review":"I cannot get this cover to fit the new iPod Nano.

The story pulls you in. The characters are well developed and you can feel the anguish Artemesia is feeling at some points in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gripping story from historyf","review":"A fascinating story of a woman artist's struggle to succeed against the odds in medieval Italy, both in her work and her personal life. AND she's a real person, a contemporary of Galileo, whose paintings you can actually Google and visit (if you're in the right place.) The book is overflowing with rich details on the locations, clothing, food, and human relations Artemisia encounters in various cities. Very enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely no passion","review":"I really though I would love this book, I love art, love the premise. I'm a voracious reader, but rarely have read a book as poor as this. I kept reading, since I wanted it to improve, but finally gave it up 3/4 through, just didn't care to continue The dialog is really, very poorly written; and the writing is in a very strangely detached style, the \\"Passion\\" in the title is never achieved. Last one from this author I'll read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book, having read \\"M; The Life of Caravaggio\\" in the past. I was very disappointed. The writing level is extremely low. The characterization, dialogue, and description are around the level of a generic romance novel.Further, I recently read David Hockney's fascinating and convincing book \\"Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters\\" that demonstrates how optics were almost certainly used by artists of the time (and Artemisia is specifically sited with examples). Since the author of this Artemisia book seems unaware of the evidence (published in 2001), this book suffers from passionate descriptions (although not exacting) of foreshortening practice and other techniques that were unlikely to have been used by the artist. This poor research throws the authenticity of the whole book into serious question.If you're interested in painting, I would suggest you look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"spellbinding","review":"I read her first book and enjoyed it very much; but the improvement in her writing skills between this and the first book is amazing. This book grabs you and holds your attention from beginning to end. She captures the humilation of the rape, the drive of the artist to paint and the need for love and forgiveness in one's life. Artemisia comes to life in a real way, with real feelings, needs and desires. Veerland created a life and blood person painting with words instead of oils. This book is truly a work of great beauty. I hope that she continues to write as she has a wonderful gift to share."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Job","review":"Well, I guess Vreeland has proven that instead of pushing herself as an author, she's going to run her \\"inside the artist's life\\" book-concept into the ground. While I found \\"Girl in Hyacinth Blue\\" enjoyable, mostly because of the way she wrote about Dutch cottage-beliefs, this one is seriously lacking all around. Her writing is very poor, and her treatment of Artemisia's story is to take a woman who, in real life, was one tough cookie, and turn her into a washed out, maudlin weakling w/Daddy issues. For a much better treatment of Artemisia's story, I recommend \\"Artemisia: A Novel\\" by Alexandra Lapierre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely a novel...","review":"This book is very interesting. I am disappointed that it can't be more non-fictional because Artemisia was an amazing painter for her time. Books that have half truth and half fiction are hard to deal with because one has to wonder wether it is real or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"the passion of artemisia","review":"A wonderful book that leads readers through the story of a pioneering female artist. A must read for both lovers of literature and those interested in a woman's struggle to express herself in a male dominated culture. Filled with great detail and imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Having enjoyed the Girl in Hyacinth Blue, I was very interested in reading Susan Vreeland's new novel. I was, however, totally disappointed right from the beginning by the \\"bodice-burner\\" tone. I felt that all of her characters, except for Sister Graziela, were one-dimensional and for the most part, totally unlikeable. The descriptions of the painting processes and the paintings themselves are the only reasons I gave this book two stars instead of one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book I've Read This Year","review":"I'm a fan of historical fiction. I absolutely loved \\"Galileo's Daughter\\", also enjoyed \\"Year of Wonders\\", and \\"The Red Tent\\" to a great extent. I enjoy a good story and taking certain libterties with history. However, I must say that \\"The Passion of Artemsia\\" was the worst book I've read this year. I'm truly amazed that it was published and is a best seller. The grammar is atrocious. The writing is over-wrought and reads like a dime- store romance. The plot is contrived, historically inaccurate, and thinly researched. In the discussion section in the back of the book, Susan Vreeland talks about how she read one book Artemisia and two books on the Italian Renaissance-well it shows. I wish I had the book in front of me and could quote some of the more awful passages. All I can suggest is do not waste your money on this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like this at all.","review":"Another book club book. We have an artist in our group that was dying to read this. She actually looked up and printed off copies of the paintings that were described in the book. Most of our book club liked this. I did not. It was very long and depressing. I appreciated the story and the struggles that the main character went through. I did not find this entertaining but more of an assignment type read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Passion of Artemeisia","review":"I CAN'T BELIEVE that I actually read this whole thing. As an Art History major (undergrad & grad), I found this story totally insulting. I love historical fiction (a la Mary Renault), but this drippy tale has me thinking that most readers are historic, linguistic and cultural morons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"First let me say I loved Girl In Hyacinth Blue and was eagerly awaiting Susan Vreeland's next novel. The Passion of Artemisia was enormously disappointing. The writing was poor, the plot was trite and the book was overflowing with present day political correctness. I know that this was loosely based on fact but it could have been much better. I am tired of books with heroine as victim. The author took lots of liberties with the truth. According to one source I read the real Artemisia had sons yet to make this a feminist novel you cant have her having a positive relationship with a male. I am sick of stories of women done wrong by men.Perhaps it is time for women to grow up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Research, inaccurate, doesn't deserve even 1 star","review":"While in the Uffizi in Florence this May, I decided to purchase this book after viewing Artemisia Gentileschi's paintings that the museum. My undergraduate career was focused in Art History and concentrated in Italian Renaissance works, so I am well knowledgeable about Artemisia and her influences. I when in to the book energized because from my research Artemisia's life is an amazing story for women. However, the lack of plot and inaccurate information left the last 300 pages painful to read, but I hoped each chapter would meet my expectations.Save your time and money, better artistic reads are \\"The DaVinic Code\\" or \\"M; The Life of Caravaggio\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning!","review":"I read this while in Florence and it brought art and history alive for me. This is a spendid book as you can see by the glowing reviews!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Passion of Artemesia","review":"I was COMPLETELY DISSAPPOINTED with this book. The author had the opportunity to write an incredible novel with deep characters, historic value and a taste of what it would have been like to be a powerful woman in that time period. The characters were shallow, the description of the countries from Rome to Venice were disappointing. Don't buy it...It's closer to a...dime store novel than anything I've read in years and it cost 21.00"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vreeland's Artemisia: Incandescent","review":"Vreeland's character of Artemisia brings to life a 400 year old story, revising the myth surrounding women in art. Here is a strong woman full of passion, overcoming adversity to fulfill her basic necessity: the need to paint. Her visions were innovative, and her will unbreakable. Vreeland captures the harsh reality of the patriarchy and displays humanity at its finest and its worst. It is under this construct that Artemisia struggled, and we struggle today, with the constant purgatory of the artist versus Woolf's \\"angel in the house\\". This book is a worthy historical account written in the truest emotions of fiction. Brava, Susan Vreeland."},{"rating":"2","title":"very enjoyable read","review":"Susan Vreeland paints a detailed picture of some of the urban and artistic aspects the seventeenth century Italy. I very much enjoyed the art historical details of the making of pigments, hiring the models, the artistic rivalry and the careful look at some of the contemporary painting and sculpture in Rome, Florence and Genoa. Some of the characters are well sketched and ring very true, especially Artemesia's daughter. Enjoy it. A few illustrations would have been a plus."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Meat","review":"Although this novel is about a fascinating woman in history who shone among the women of her generation, this book lacks a richness in character development."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice easy read :)","review":"I found this to be a nice easy read with characters that held my attention, and a story that was interesting enough to make me want to find out more about Artemisia and her life. I would have liked a more in depth look at Artemisia and her husband, their relationship, and his relationship with his daughter.Although this was not an \\"exciting Page-turner\\", it did hold my attention, and I cared about the people in the story. I really enjoyed the descriptions and the interpretations of Artemisia's paintings, Italy, and the art of the times, and I found myself looking up her paintings on line so that I could see for myself what she wanted so badly to express in her art.I am very glad that I read this story, and look forward to reading her other book, Girl in Hayicinth Blue, as I haven't yet had the pleasure.Enjoy,Debbi"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good writing, weak history","review":"Vreeland's writing captures the characters and involves the reader with them. I enjoyed reading this book, but was stunned at the contradiction to the reality of Artemesia's life. Although fictionalized biography by definition takes liberties with the subject's life, it makes no sense for example: 1) to portray Artemesia with only one child (she had 4), 2) to portray that daughter with no interest in painting (her surviving daughter was a painter), 3) to have Artemesia return to Rome alone with her daughter (in reality she returned with her husband), 4) to portray Artemesia's marriage as breaking up much earlier than it did in reality. To me these distortions change so much about Artemesia that the book becomes pointless. It puzzles me because Vreeland is a good enough writer to be able to carry a story without contracting essential facts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A look into a different world.","review":"This was the first book I had read by Susan Vreeland. Normally, I don't like first person narrative, but this book was wonderfully written. The story of Artemisia is one of betrayal and passion, and the slow realization that reality isn't all that it's cracked up to be. She is forced, by circumstance, to be married to someone she doesn't know. HE can't accept that she is a better painter than he. Artemisia spends the majority of her life trying to reconcile her past to her present and to find a balance between her love of painting and the love of her family.I would recommend this book to anyone. Not only does it illustrate a period in history that I don't know much about, but it allows the reader to see behind the paintings. The pursuit of art, for art's sake, is a noble venture, and to see the background makes it even more important."},{"rating":"2","title":"Track Listing","review":"1982 CBS Discos International VINYL LP. # HML 803441.

When I reread it recently, I was amazed at how superb it is - it is not a Poirot or Miss Marple mystery, not at all, but it is a very different type of mystery. The shocking solution is in fact a brutal attack upon our own culture, our obsession with murderers and murder, and the inexorable impartiality of evil - it is a very frightening book, largely because it does not follow ALL the strictures one expects of a murder mystery. A novel as well as a whodunnit as well as a psychological study. And a grand success."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well-constructed mystery.","review":"This is one of Christie's most interesting novels. Don't be surprised if you can't put it down!! You will be quite surprised at the ending and kicking yourself for not guessing whodunit!

Christie should have developed the characters Charles and Sophia more; it was dissapointing to learn almost nothing about them and what happens to them after the murder is solved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious Christie","review":"This Christie novel doesn't quite deliver the goods. It's the usual savoir faire: a crumbling family's patriarch is murdered, and his significantly-younger trophy wife is thought to be his killer. The dysfunctional Leonides family thinks the victim's wife might be carrying-on an affair with the live-in tutor. There's plenty of police talk and not nearly enough character development. In fact, one wishes the characters weren't so \\"Christie,\\" i.e., familar, predictable, etc. Despite a mildly intriguing denouement (which, also, was somewhat predictable), Crooked House lacks fresh characters and gripping dialogue, which makes it a tedious read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Agatha Christies best!!!!","review":"i have read almost 30 of the agatha christie books and plan to finish them all!!! ive become quite good at figuring them out and i thought this one was fairly easy to figure out. i was in a way mad at the ending and i thought this book had a very evil feel to it unlike most of her books. but if your a fan of murder this is one you will defineately want to read!!! along with \\"murder on the nile\\" (my very favorite book of hers) which i figured out:D \\"the murder of rodger ackroyde\\" and \\"and then there were none\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"CHRISTIE AT HER BEST","review":"By all means, this is one of my favorite Agatha Christie novels. The denoument is so gripping I couldn't put the book down, even after I finished reading it. I just immediately started reviewing the clues again. It was all there in the open to see. Pure genius! Most of the other reviewers have summarized the plot, so I won't rehash it. Excellent, quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorable shocker","review":"One of Christie's strongest. Although the plot is neither intricate nor clue-laden, the ending is powerful and immediately convincing. Christie's climatic explanatory chapters are usually lengthy; this one is barely two or three pages. This is due to the soundness and deceptive simplicity of the solution. Christie's publishers wanted her to change the unconventional ending, but she wisely refused. A classic murder mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst...","review":"No care or attention is made for the characters which are completely flat and have no life.

I was introduce to the character Sage which I have not had the pleasure before. First heard of this character from a Spiderman game (Gameboy Advance).

Consider this album if you enjoy music that comes from the heart and a songwriter's soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book About Law Enforcement","review":"I'm not much of a fan of traditional cops and robber stories but this book presents an entirely different view of police work. This is honest, real life police work and it is more exciting and stimulating than any work of fiction. The characters in it are real and you can't ignore the impact they make as they march across the pages of the book. The criminal element presented in the stories is not at all like those you meet in traditional detective stories. The workaday law enforcement officers you encounter are intelligent, brave, hard working people who deserve our greatest respect. As you read the book you will note that they don't always come away unscathed. I highly recommend this book to one and all. You will be entertained by it but you will also come away with a deep sense of awe for those who protect and serve. At times you will laugh and at other times you will cry.

When I listen to a live album I like to feel that I am part of the audience, these breaks effectively break any sense of continuity that you get in a live show. I can take a few breaks between songs, but in between ALL of them?Otherwise, treat this as an excellent Greatest Hits Live.

Where on earth is the crowd - I thought they were live? Johnson's vocals are too much in the foreground and overshadow the music and that makes no sense to me. AC/DC is about great guitar riffs, the lyrics are secondary. No other AC/DC album allows the vocals to dominate the disk, the vocals definitely don't dominate their live shows, so why do they on this disk? Who allowed what should have been the greatest live album of all time to get screwed up like this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"to indulgent for most tastes!","review":"In 92 Ac/dC live came out in both single and double editions. Neither one is really that great! Ac/Dc is one of hard rock/metal's best groups,but just like everyone else, not everything that they do is good. One of the biggest flaws of the album is that it is too self indulgent. Most people don't want to hear songs in excess of ten minute running times. Another flaw is that the Bon Scott era is not represented very well, I know he's dead, but most of Ac/Dc's better albums were from the Bon Scott era. Highway to hell is only represented by the title track, big mistake there Highway to Hell is just as good as Back in Black if not better! Also not enough from High Voltage.

However, there were some chapters that were left out which I later read on my own. Of some of the terrible advice in this book, Wangerin advises cheating spouses, rather than confess to their spouse, to confess to a responsible, trustworthy Christian, in order to save the spouse from hurt. Also, he advises spouses who are beaten by their spouses to give their spouses several chances to stop abusing before kicking them out. Even then, he advises them to still give them another chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Start Here!","review":"In the years leading up to marriage, and during the ten years I've been married, I've read MANY marriage books. My reading has not been sparked by any particular crisis, but rather, by a desire to make our marriage better. This book is the best! Many Christian marriage books paint the picture that the author has a perfect marriage. Wangerin puts away any such pretense and shows us his soul. In the process, we learn about ourselves. I encourage any couple to read this book, whether things are great, or heading toward divorce. Thank you to Wangerin for writing this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a better way for a strong marriage foundation","review":"As a Lutheran pastor, I certainly have a soft spot for other well-written Lutheran pastors. Be that as it may, AS FOR ME AND MY HOUSE is, without a doubt, the most helpful resource I've found for couples who want to build a genuinely fruitful Christian marriage. I say \\"build\\" because a marriage does not happen overnight - it is constructed over years of companionship, trust and, lest we forget, forgiveness. No other resource that I've seen even comes close to describing the kind of work a successful marriage requires, and no other resource identifies forgiveness, not love, as the centerpiece of that rare gem, a fruitful Christian marriage. I give this book to my pre-marriage couples, but I would give it to a 60-years married couple with no hesitation, because I believe that they would learn from Walt (and Thanne's!) wisdom and counsel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best marriage book I have read.","review":"My husband and I have read several marriage books and we do pre-marital counseling with engaged couples in our congregation. As a Christian woman, this is the best marriage book I have read. In many of the marriage books I have read, I have sensed a tone of condescension towards women. Not that I still didn't get a lot out of those books, but some of the ideas about women were very traditional and some of the expectations on women were extremely conservative and stereotypical. In As For Me and My House, Wangerin, respects woman and his treatment of both men and woman are fair, taking into consideration that not all women and men are the same. His chapters on forgiveness are excellent combining an intelligent blend of a high view of scripture and psychology. He also writes well and the book is an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for any stage of marriage","review":"My wife and I found this referenced on Rachel Held Evan's blog, and decided to check it out after getting engaged. It was an excellent conversation starter for us. We'd read a chapter or two, and then talk over what stood out to us.We haven't finished it yet, but part of the beauty of the book is the way it's beneficial to couples at any point in their marriage. We will certainly be returning to it for wisdom through the years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy Buy","review":"This is a well written book that approaches the topic of marriage in a fresh way in that he tells it in a story format. This makes it engaging to read. Also, men, you're probably going to wind up convicted reading this which is a good thing. I would suggest buying it even if you have read many books on marriage because you will find his approach rather unique and what he writes is very helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing and Insightful","review":"I've read lots of books on marriage. I'd say this is one of the easiest to read and one of the most helpful. Wangerin speaks to the heart about what matters. This book is well worth your time and money. It is not just one more book about marriage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same as others, ripped off on volume.","review":"I guess I should believe the reviewers.

I can tell it's cheap compared to the Monoprice wire I used for 3 HT speakers before running out of a 100 ft. spool. I can't strip away the plastic cover without breaking strands of wire - very thin and brittle. This was easy to do with the Monoprice. Clearly a difference in quality.

Second off, we measured the spools as we used them and were not shorted at all! At all. I am wondering if the people who receive short spools know how to measure? We upgrade our surround sound system from a 5.1 channel to a 7.1 channel. On our old we used a 16 gauge wire....you can definitely notice the difference.

The cost of copper has caused the cost of speaker wire to skyrocket over the past couple of years, but 12-gauge is the way to go if you intend on having long runs of speaker wire through your house or office.The price of the Metra 12-gauge wire was as good as I could find anywhere, even after searching eBay for several hours. I pulled this wire through holes that I drilled in floor joists and wall studs without problems, the wire sheathing never tore or cracked, so it's definitely durable.

I'm buying 12 guage speaker wire for a reason, and it is not to cut corners on copper. Also, I checked the length of the roll, and there are 90' and not 100' feet of wire.

It is frustrating to be told to mix \\"all ingredients,\\" then two sentences later be told to put in another of the ingredients. This is one example of many. The directions are sketchy or downright inaccurate. There are so many obvious typos, that I wonder how many of the ingredients and amounts are accurate or are also typos. I dislike this book so much that I will not even give it away. What a waste of money. This book may be good on the \\"lore\\" side, but it is not a cookbook.

It is very simple to read, very easy to understand, and the examples are concise and relevent. I would not recommend this book for someone who is older and is involved in serious meetings that require a more in depth knowledge of Robert's Rules, but it works perfectly for my purposes, which is to educate people who have never been exposed to this information before.

For example, Zimmerman recommends using unanimous consent whenever possible to expidite business, and gives concrete examples on how to do this.You will probably eventually want to buy the full \\"Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised\\" to complete your study of parliamentary procedure. If you read Zimmerman first, RONR will be alot easier to digest. On the other hand, you may not need RONR, as all the most commonly encountered rules are covered quite well in Zimmerman. Sure, if you run into disciplinary problems, or want more details about how to write bylaws, you will need to look in RONR, but for the day to day running of most club/association/church meetings Zimmerman's book is a great guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"SIMPLICITY","review":"When attempting to start as a novice on this matter of envolvement with a small board and how to be part of the monthly board meeting I was in total ignorance.

Nevertheless, Baudolino and this book are in my opinion not even close to his higher standard.The mysterious flame of queen loana, lacks any sort of emotion, is boring, so boring you end up counting the pages to the end.If you are into comics, WW2, old book names and weird old music titles you might be interested on a 100 pages of it...there is no mistery so do not get your hopes up....simply a flat boring book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"self-indulgent navel-gazing","review":"Cut about 150 pages and this would be an interesting read.Eco uses a book collector's failed memory as an opportunity to explore what it was like to live as a young boy in WWII Italy. Of itself, that sounded like an interesting topic.What it turns into, however, is mind-numbing cataloguing of song lyrics, books, comic books, newspapers, etc. Where one or two examples might have been interesting, Eco gives us dozens. Yawn.I'm a huge Eco fan, but don't waste your time here: Foucault's Pendulum , and The Name of the Rose are masterful. Even The Island of the Day Before, not his best work, is more worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"I appreciate other reviewers' positive comments and ratings, since I appreciate Eco's technical skills and erudition. Further, Name of the Rose is still one of the most enjoyable and well written thrillers I have ever read. Unfortunately, I just couldn't keep plowing through page after page of reminiscence over obscure comic book or other literary references. I suspect those readers able to do so eventually were rewarded, but after the 50th such page I simple found the book unreadable and quit.

Instead what I got was a mumbling main character who never remembers anything of importance and asks himself the same questions over and over: Was this from my childhood? Did I make this memory up? Am I imagining a past for myself?Interspersed between the redundant self-doubt were descriptions of various toys, books, and pieces of art, most of which have pictures in the novel. Nothing much interesting about the descriptions; I could have just looked up the art on the internet if I were interested.Nothing wrong with the prose--Eco knows his words. Just a boring, boring story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and disapointing","review":"Like many other Eco fans I keep looking for books of at least the same quality as the Name of the Rose.The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana is rather disapointing, except the first third which is well written and promising.Unless you are a fan of Ialian interbellic media you will find a lot of boring information and the rest is not so satisfying either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for the summer","review":"I am a big fan of Eco's work and I like this one very much. It is well written and has lots of information just like all other books that he wrote. But for some reason, I don't like this one as much as the other ones. There is just too much information from a culture and era that I can't related to. Perhaps, it is meant to be like this. Maybe he wanted to convey the idea of fragmented foreign ideas becoming the past memory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather disapointing","review":"Although it wasn't 100% uninteresting, I found it, on the whole, very boring.

This will stimulate your imagination and thinking, but an easy romp it is not. If you want to stimulate your imagination and thinking this is for you.

This is probably not the best book to introduce you to Umberto Eco's writing, but If you already like his other books you will like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work","review":"I loved the Name of the Rose and Foucault's Pendulum - since then, Eco's storytelling has gone downhill. I really like the concept of Flame. Man loses memory and tries to regain it by returning to his childhood home, rereading formative books from his past. But the payoff here is terrible - the resolution meaningless and uninteresting. OK - I get the point - life is like that - but the book is simply a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mysterious Flame of Queen Loana","review":"As an Eco fan, I could not wait to read his latest novel.

If you want to read a really semiotic novel check out Darkmans by the very wonderful Nicola Barker."},{"rating":"1","title":"A story in three parts; one is actually good","review":"This novel is broken into three sections. The first, \\"The Incident\\" is funny, irreverent, fast-moving, and satisfying. Read to the end of this section and then go find another book. The remaining 368 pages barely budge; mostly the author shows us his comic book collection under the guise of a novel.So one section out of three is good, that's 33%, and a two stars out of five would be 40%. That seems fair, if a bit optmistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good idea squandered","review":"The first section of this book is really very good, so it was particularly disappointing that Eco did not follow through with his initial idea. Instead, he uses the main character to rehash some fairly common criticisms of popular culture. For some reason, he gives detailed plot summaries of numerous comics and books for young people, which is tedious. One just cannot understand what it is that so fascinates the narrator about all of these old comics and mystery novels. By the end, Eco has completely forgotten about Paola, and the persona of his narrator. Then the book just ends.

And the imbecile reels.\\"At last thanks to Mr Eco, I have a snappy reply for the next person who says to me, what a lot of books you have, have you read them all..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgia","review":"Nostalgia. I'd put nostalgia foremost of the feeling this book leaves the reader with. For some reason, somehow I kind of feel that's Eco's closure at least on this literature front. As for the casual reader, I wouldn't recommend this book, unless the former is patient and willing to follow Eco's own reminiscent descent into a so-typically Italian mind-set and lifestyle surroundings. By no means this book is as introverted, as say, the Island of the Day Before, and it certainly leverages more elements from Foucault's Pendulum than any other of Eco's books. At the end of the day this book asks the reader to quite literally follow Eco to the loft of his youth and past fires and open these dusty old drawers full of brochures and posters from the '50's or the '60s. If you are willing to say 'yes' to that, then please do go ahead and pick up this book. It's a good one everything considered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literary mystery, literary treasure map","review":"Reading this novel, I have been entranced by the idea that human beings develop personality through the works of literature, music, and pop culture with which they have been blessed. As Yambo struggles to re-discover who he is, he poses a challenge for all readers who recognize the quotes he remembers: if we are indeed at least partially created by our exposure to the arts, how shall we empower the next generation? Will we be responsible for the new generation of brownshirts, or will we help to generate thinking global citizens who understand their place in the world and their responsibility to it? Heady questions these, but Eco is a master at making his readers think. This novel is entertaining and highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Weak Flame","review":"Fantastic writing, interesting concept (initially), but Eco doesn't deliver. The first half works; the second half is tedious and boring. If Eco wants to catalog every work he has read, perhaps he should sign up with GoodReads. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"The What? of Who? ... and why you should ignore this book.","review":"IMHO the worst book Mr. Eco has ever written bar none. If you are not a post-graduate student of Fasict Italy do not bother with this book. Even Yambo is the least well defined of Mr. Eco's lead characters. A blank slate who remembers what he has read...no..not quite...he doesn't remember (spoilers follows) all the trivial and/or popular material of his childhood and we are forced into memory lane with this excuse for a romp through Italy of the 30's and 40's. Even when Yambo gets his second \\"stroke?,lesion?, brain fart?\\" all you can hope is that he dies. He dies but not quickly enough. There is one great story about the Gorge in his coma but not enough reason to buy the book, I only wish the sun had gone black on page 246, not 449."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superauthor defecates on stupid and gullible readers!","review":"A poor joke on people like me who are stupid enough to continue reading it. There are warnings enough, if we would but heed them. The high point is the scenes from Mickey Mouse and Clarabelle's Treasure. I don't think that I will ever read another Eco book and may burn the one's I have. Just the effect the author hoped for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be titled \\"History of Fascist Italy in comics\\".","review":"I am a huge fan of Umberto Eco's Novels. I am a huge fan of his Essays. In this novel, he is using a potentially interesting plot to tie together the true intent of his novel, which is to showcase the history of fascist italy through popular culture. Anyone interested in the history will love this book. Sadly, when I buy a novel, I want a real novel.That said, although the first two thirds of the book really drag, once the narrator goes into a coma, things really start to pick up (odd, isn't it?). There is one great highlight--one of the characters makes a great argument about why god is a fascist. The rest of the novel is a painful purgatory of forced history lessons.My advice? Re-read Foucault's Pendulum instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Author.","review":"Eco has that uncanny way of writing in that it is though he is speaking directly to you.

I don't know why..I do like two of the songs on it, though.I can see myself parting with this CD from my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Songs are as cute as they look","review":"Hey I don't mean that they are another one of \\"Heart throb, making teen ager scream\\" kinda boys. In fact their faces are too beautiful, almost like beng made up to be an actor or something. But their songs, especially the words and expression are so cute. My favorite song is \\"I'm not in love\\". This song has man's stuburness and pureness all mixed together. This boy is trying tell his girlfriend that he is not falling in love with her, but he knows that he is, so he is just telling himself that he is not in love, almost trying to convince himself. Men are stuburn but they could be so pure sometimes like little kids, are'nt they? All fo the songs in BBMak CD has cute expression of boys towards girls. Most of the songs are mellow, but make you smile, I GUARANTEE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD rocks!","review":"This CD is one of the best CDs I've ever bought. The guys of BBMak are so talented! They write most of the songs on the CD, and they play their own instruments, too. On top of all that, they've got amazing voices! I've owned this CD for more than a year, but it never gets old. My favorites are \\"Not In Love,\\" an upbeat, catchy song, \\"Ghost of You and Me,\\" which almost sends shivers down your spine, and \\"Still on Your Side,\\" which is just a plain awesome song. Trust me, this is one CD purchase you WILL NOT regret!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back Here, Bayba!","review":"The first time I heard the song \\"Back Here,\\" was when I was watching MTV. It is one of those songs that you can really relate to, the lyrics are terrific, and the vocals are superb! I use this song whenever I write a really deep letter to someone very special! (Because the feelings and thoughts envoked by this song make it ever so much easier to write down on paper.) If you wanna have like a favorite song, for you as a couple, this would definetly be it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"A good solid Cd. What I love about this band is that they wrote their own stuff, and could play it...AND sing it! They also had a unique way of trading verses; One guy would get the first, the next guy the second and so on, then all would sing the chorus. I also really liked that they all had voices that blend well; close enough to harmonize perfect, sounding almost like one person. But just slightly different tones and octaves, so that each verse had \\"their\\" own sound to it.Of course personally I think that Christian Burns had the best voice and could have easily been on his own. But still...all together, they sound great!The whole album is good, and I can listen to the whole thing non stop, but my fave is \\"Ghost Of You And Me\\" there is a catchy, haunting sound to the singing.So in the end; Good album I'd recommend to anyone. And as the Brits say \\"Brilliant!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Job, lads!","review":"I think that Christian, Mark, and Ste are incredibly talented. I love the fact that they play some of their own instruments. I also love the fact that they are adorable:) This CD is awesome. Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Made me vomit five times!","review":"Ear-splitting chaos. Beautifil and ugly. It will drive your neighbors insane. This album MUST be played on headphones to keep all indoor pets safe. Psychedelic harsh noise for real hardcore fans. Absolutely scary. One of the best extreme noise albums of the year.Couldn't get a wink of sleep the first night I listened to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BBMak is excellent!","review":"I thought BBMak was awesome they are alot better than the BSB or Nsync.Plus they canplay instruments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new band","review":"Just got this cd today and haven't stopped listening to it. This is a cd you can listen to and enjoy from start to finish. Actually I bought the cd mainly for the \\"Back Here\\" single, but now I like most of the other songs as well. BB Mak has some great voices, great lyrics, and great background music too. This album can appeal to anyone who likes pop music. To me, their music reminds me somewhat of Savage Garden's music on some tracks. You get a good mix of fast songs and some slower ones too. My favorite song still is Track # 1- Back Here. But I also like Next Time, Unpredictable, Ghost of You and Me, and Love is Leaving. Go get this cd. You won't be disappointed. This group shouldn't even be clumped in with the other \\"boy bands\\" such as BSB or NSync because they have totally different styles and sounds. They have plenty of talent. Plus they write some of their songs and can play musical instruments."},{"rating":"2","title":"snap, crackle, POP","review":"Another Boy band? wait lets say that again...boy band....hmm wow you know what they are a boy BAND. These guys can actually play their own music. Very solid debut album, had to give them 5 stars (constant complaint about amazon no half stars...CD is actually a 4.5) Fans of NSYNC and BSB should definitely give this one a try. They might not have the 'flash' and \\"glamor\\" of either of those groups, but their music is solid and then some."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD","review":"I have to rate this CD with 5 stars. I am a 27 year old male, just went through a terrible relationship break up and for some reason I can relate to every song on this CD. Great music, great words that actually has been helping me through this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a debut!","review":"This is a great album for a debut by BBMak. It features the awesome hit \\"Back Here\\" and plenty of other future hits. The album is uplifting with some nice BSB style tunes and a bit of 98 degrees and even *Nsync and LFO here and there. Its good but not every track is a scorcher and looking back, once the guys get another album out it is sure to beat this one. Not bad guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A step above the others","review":"BBmak's debut really sets them apart from American trio's such as LFO with their outstanding harmonies and very catchy themes. The stand-out songs on the disc are the first single 'Back Here', 'Again', 'Next Time', 'I Can Tell', and \\"Love is Leaving'. BBmak are surely going to be compared to the present slew of Boy Bands, but with their amazing harmonies and smooth voices, they are one step above the others. The songs may sound similar on the first listen and although the lyrics are not the most profound, give the disc a deserved second play and you'll see why these three guys are not your typical Boy Band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sooner or later you'll learn to love BBMak!","review":"If you love such boybands as 98 degrees, backstreet boys, and nsync, you will love BBMak! Don't be fooled! They are not a boyband! They play their own instruments and wrote 7 out of 12 songs on their cd. In addition to thier awesome talent, they have dazzling good looks! Christian is such a hottie! I even got to meet BBMak! When I first listened to the cd, I was amazed, no bad songs! I love all of them! Some of my faves are: \\"Still on your Side\\", \\"Back here\\", \\"ghost of you and me\\", \\"next time\\", and \\"love is leaving\\". Belive me, there are many more that I love too!

For one,this album seems to much like she wants to prove herself.

Get Speak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wowza! Great album","review":"I liked her first album, it was catchy and fun but this new one is much better.

THE PAIN!!!! Can't believe I listened to the samples of this album. Hopefully those 15 minutes of fame are almost done. She's at a crossroads in her career now, which lead to either Pornos or obscurity. So please stop funding her drug habit people!

I feel like I've known her for years. Man, she's really exposing herself. Look out Dylan!A little more personal? What a joke. This album was mostly written by the same person that wrote some of A.

A dial tone?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be titled \\"A little more LOUSY!\\"","review":"Does Lindsay Lohan and Ashlee Simpson share family genes?

I pre-ordered this album, and i got it the day that it came out(December 6, 2005). I loved it, I can relate to some of the songs. I never get bored listening to it. Lindsay really hit the big time, I also thought the music video for Confessions Of A Broken Heart was really cool. She directed it, and her younger sister played a younger Lindsay with her parents fighting. I highly reccomend this, it is awsome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay, Jasmine, you are such a dumbass!","review":"Number 1, Carrie Underwood sings country music, not Rock/Pop. Nobody said anything about Kelly, she rocks! But this is Lindsay's page, stop referring to other artists, it just shows you have no argument. So you are comparing apples to oranges. Number 2, Lindsay is not bad on this album, she is fantastic! Anybody who can tell true effort from filler songs would tell you the same. Can we try a little more personal?

The only song with any potential is the first single off the album \\"Confessions of a Broken Heart.\\" That song you can feel the truth and pain and it breaks your heart... brings you to a place where you relate, and fix her words to your own memories. The other songs on the album are crap. A thrown together collaboration of diddies to impress the plastic teenage angst generation, none of which are appealing...more like nauseating. I mean, most people will hear older albums and compare the new one and say \\"Much better\\" \\"She's older\\". Wow, that's insight - of course she's older...but age doesnt improve song writing/composure...and where the content may have matured, the important things have not. Her voice is as pleasing as her appearance...but she needs to really look into her self to get something worth writing about. Lindsay, think \\"Confessions....heart\\" and stay on the track this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars!","review":"Excellent!! 5/5 stars!

She tries to tell of an abusive past in a song, but she's a little late. Her as well as Kelly Clarkson.

It \\"almost\\" sounds like you, but it does not really sound like you at all, which is great.... since you can't sing. I remember being a little sad with your Good Morning America lip sync job. But boy! Those producers sure did good.Well, gotta go to the chow line now. Hope I don't get shanked! I will be out soon. Can't wait to manage you again! Maybe we can go on tour with Hanson!

Although her voice isn't bad like hilary and ashlee I thought she was going back to school to take a break from music and movies. Her confessions video was sad and she looked really freaky like she was trying to be punk or victorian but I saw right through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Halfway matured","review":"Lohan returns to (mostly) baffle music critics again, this time with a seemingly more \\"mature\\" look and sound. In the opening tune, the piano ballad gives way to a strong \\"heart-wrenching\\" chorus, where she's actually touching upon a genuine subject matter that a lot of young folks might connect with, but chances are it's gone largely unnoticed and dismissed. The bad news is that it keeps going on like that - rock-ballads with soft, everyday \\"dilemma\\" verses and strong, \\"sing your heart out\\"-choruses. The only time it really shines is in when she's covering superior artists, putting a spin on \\"Edge Of Seventeen\\", or when she returns to the more dance-floor oriented sound on \\"Who Loves You\\". Stop with the fashion stuff, Linds - come back and finish up your electronic dancepop album, that might finally be something."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT REAL POP MUSIC!","review":"Sorry folks but this is not real pop music.

All of the songs from this album are so corny. It's got no hit songs on it! I hate it. It made my eardrums bleed sooo bad! Good thing I got rid of this CD and bought better music with real musicians, instead of crappy manufactured pop junk. I'm deeply annoyed at this album!

If she was really this good at singing (which I highly doubt she is)she would keep this going well its been over 5 years and she hanst even made as much as one single (I guess that proves the horrible singer theory). She ruined a classic cheap trick song while most refrains to her currupt personal life especially the relationship with her father and then somme. all in all I wouldnt buy this album or any other pice of crap she calls work of art cause lets face it Lindsay has gone from Lilo to lowlife."},{"rating":"1","title":"can this girl od already","review":"sick of lindsay, sick of her going to jail, sick of her doing drugs, sick of her confusded sexuality please anna nicole was less anooying buut don't worry folks lindsay won't see 35."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing \\"personal,\\" but your album sucks","review":"It's hard to feel bad for a talentless millionaire celebrity whine about her dad.

Her singles Confessions Of A Broken Heart was a TRL staple and while her second single I Live For The Day had some radio was never released as a single or musci video. It also features covers for Cheap Tricks I Want You To Want Me and Stevie Nicks Edge Of Seventeen. Favorite tracks are Confessions Of A Broken Heart, A Little More Personal, If It's Alright, A Beautiful Life. Highly reccommend this aswell as her debut Album Speak."},{"rating":"1","title":"As \\"Raw\\" as it gets.","review":"Alright, it's been a turbulent year in Lindsay Lohan's life, what with her dad going to the slammer, she having a weight problem, then coming out and admitting it (which is good, don't get me wrong), dying her hair that nasty blonde and putting on make-up that a cheap floozy would wear. Her first album sucked big time but the MTV kids still ate it up.Oh, the music! Yes, onto the album! Well, this is about as intense as it gets. Forget about polished vocals, synthetic instrumentals and shallow lyrics. Leave THAT to Hillary Duff. This is gritty, raw, intensene and even hardcore. Lindsay shows here she can sing without the magic of computers and vocal correction programs.(pause)I lied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimately Linds BEST work ever!

I am amazed that there are so many good reviews here. They must be planted by her die hard fans and friends/family members. This cd is awful- her voice is bland- and she has no vocal range whatsoever. She sounds like every other teeny bopper wanttobe musician today- she is overproduced and has no real talent. When I saw her perform at the american music awards- I was convinced that my opinion of her is correct. She is horrible live- and is way too cocky for my taste- especially when she does not have the talent to back it up. While I put her above the nasally untalented britney spears-- she is no Kelly clarkston or carrie underwood.

The vocals are a little unnerving. The songs are lackluster for the most part, but not terrible.And can someone please explain the album cover to me?"},{"rating":"2","title":"LINDSAY ROCKS EVEN MORE!!!","review":"THIS ALBUM IS THE BEST!!! I find it to be even better than her first album, Speak. not that many people thought she could pull off re-making the famous Cheap-Trick song 'I want you to want me' and the great Stevie Nicks song 'Edge of Seventeen', butLindsay proved to everybody she can sing these great two songs.Not only did she remake two classic songs she wrote more than half of the cd!!! The songs hit the right spot, some made you want to get up and dance, like her songs \\"Fastlane\\", \\"If you were me\\", and \\"A Little More Personal\\". And others where about the heartbreak in a relationship, like for example a song in the album \\"If it's alright\\".Lindsay is not just an actress and a singer, she is an example of a strong little girl inside who battled heartbreak, rumors and the seperation of her parents. And in this album it truely shows how she matured from everything that she battled."},{"rating":"2","title":"I dont like pop music...But i have to say that she did a great job","review":"ok...I dont likr pop music and pop fake singers at all.I have this cd because one of my friend gave it to me for christmas(she dint know my musical tastes)so i had to listen this cd.I did'nt like Lindsay Lohan at all but i must say that she did a great Job on this cd.SHe is more mature and now she can conpose part of the songs..the songs area really personal and more mature than her first cd speak!In this cd she talks about her realtionship with her father and how it is growing up in that way!Well..maybe next time we gonna see Lindsay Lohan talksa bout poilitics???we will see...."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Excellent CD!!!!","review":"This is one great pop album though it is on the heavier side of rock - pop/rock at times in my opinion.All in all a good CD, good set of songs.I have always like Lindsay Lohan but this album rocks!Awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oooops ...

Find out for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"what?","review":"I'm really surprised that this book has received only positive reviews. I found the writing/punctuation style to be incredibly stupid and annoying. It looks like this: Today I woke up and took a shower. with hot water. at four in the morning. and it was fun. I don't understand why he would do that, it just looks weird and makes the narrator sound kind of airheaded.In addition, I thought the author was insecure about writing female characters or something; I thought he would just randomly put in sappy/wimpy-sounding lines because he thought he had to.I was super disappointed by this book because Pure Sunshine is awesome and beautifully written."},{"rating":"1","title":"First page...","review":"I read the very first page and it was so completely butchered I wanted to throw up.

I tried it in a rice cooker and just in a pan in it always came out like a gelatinous blob. This design is simple and works perfect, for the authentic taste and texture.The only downside is that it is another device to put away in your kitchen and you really won't use it for anything else besides sticky rice. Also, the basket is a little hard to clean, since it's only bamboo, so i usually just let it dry and flick out the few dried grains that get stuck.Make sure you use the right rice, and have cheesecloth on hand. Also you'll need a pot lid to put over it since it does not come with one.If you love Thai food, buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"need some kind of storage cover","review":"Like this product.

To make sticky rice, you MUST USE sweet sticky rice or glutinous rice. Let it soak for 24 hrs, or if you're pressed for time you can soak the rice in warm water for at least 4 hrs before steaming. Fill the aluminum pot about half way with water, bring it to a rolling boil, line the basket with cheesecloth, drain out your soaked rice and drop the rice in the basket, cover with a lid, let it steam for 30 mins, and voila. It's fool proof, but the key is buying the correct rice - it won't work using regular jasmine rice or any other rice (I've already tried). Never had to steam the rice for more than 30 mins, and it comes out just right each time. Very happy with the purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product but not the best online merchant","review":"We ordered this item a few years ago from the Wok Shop. It makes great, traditional sticky rice. A week ago we decided to order two more as Christmas gifts from the Wok Shop through their web site (at the time we weren't aware that they were also selling on Amazon). Several days later we were informed that the item was out of stock and wouldn't be available until mid January 2010.

Even though the life stories being told were compiled fifty years ago, the book is still very relevant today.

I feel bad for the group, and can only hope that they are allowed to do better work next time. At this rate, the taste for Filipino talent from the Bay is going to become over-saturated real quickly.

While it WAS great for traveling and seemed to keep my 1 year old son mildly entertained, I only give the book two stars.My beef with the book is that the descriptions of the babies don't really match their expressions. For example, the picture that says \\"happy\\" shows a baby who looks a bit nervous and really isn't smiling. And many of the children look like they were hot and crying when their pictures were taken (they have flushed cheeks and worried looks on their faces). The title of the book, \\"Happy Baby Faces\\", isn't really fitting.Bottom line - I've seen other baby picture books that do a much better job than this one.

Having been fortunate enough to have worked with Pierre Bernac earlier in my singing career, I have complete confidence in his artistic thoughts on all aspects of diction and performance of the French mélodie.

After attempting to rig up a way to secure the track, we set up the train. The engine arrived broken. The electrical component was loose and was sticking outside of the train. We had to fix the train before we could use it. Each time the boys want to use the train, we have to spend much time rigging it in such a way so it will run. Once we get it going, we're lucky to get the train around the track one time without it falling off.

The high price tag only adds insult to the injury. They've started out with a very poor print and have done nothing to improve it. The result is worse than we're used to seeing on most budget label low-speed VHS tapes. I'd recommend you buy a used DVD of this because it certainly isn't worth the asking price that Televista has placed on it.

In the spirit of full disclosure, this is my first gas grill. I have used charcoal for over 20 years. But, the time had come, or so I thought. First, gas grills add virtually no flavor to the food. The flavorizer bars are no substitute for charcoal. Second, and more relevant to the Summit C, is the built in smoker. It's a joke. Yes, it works well and creates lots of smoke, but the smoke directly exits the grill housing. Because Weber put it on the side, the smoke does not even touch the food. Instead, it snakes up the side wall and exits through the back vent. Without the smoke or real grill flavor, the Summit C is nothing more than a glorified outdoor oven.

Tom Keifer and his band are really at the top of their game with this album. His scratchy blues/rock voice is so much better than all the singers throughout the decade of the 90's. I liken him to a cross between Black Crowes, ZZ Top, and AC/DC. Three other really awesome rock/blues bands. This is what great music is all about. Go see them live whenever you get a chance.

The main premise that I needed to learn is that enjoyment comes from complexity - so while our natural tendency is towards simplicity, full engagement in life ('flow') only comes about when you're fully immersed, often in a disciplined way, in a task that has rules and boundaries.

Some of the author's scientific research on this topic is also discussed.

The second is that it is filled with vague generalities that don't fit into any recognizable scientific or psychological norms. It is essentially one man's take on what it means to be happy. As a definition of happiness, it sort of works, but there isn't really any substance to the book. Filled with oblique metaphor, anecdotal evidence, and a loosely defined spiritualism that is most similar to Zen Buddhism, the book does nothing to provide any answers on how one can truly be happy. The pursuit of 'flow,' admirable as it may be, is in no way definable as making one happy any more than any other esoteric personal philosophy. If you're interested in the nature of happiness or in invigorating your own creative spirit, there are much better resources available.2/5 Stars.

For me, the problem wasn't so much in getting the metal cap off (easily done with a simple, sturdy flathead screwdriver pinned in the center of the tab) nor was it in actually adjusting the length of the rope. The problem was in getting the tab back in the handle. The cylindrical metal tab has to be snug in the handle lest it fly off during your excercise, but OH MYYY!!!, getting it back in requires an incredible and equal amount of pressure on all sides at the same time. I spent almost an hour before I finally got lucky and was able to push it back in. Good luck!!As for the review concerning knots, I can see how they might prove to be cumbersome with the hindering of the motion of the rope. However, I'm not sure why anyone would want to tie knots in the first place. Just cut away the excess rope.Now that my frustration is gone and my rope is fixed, it does a great job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought 2, both Defective - unable to adjust","review":"I am sure I am following the instructions correctly. I have read all the positive reviews here, and understand what they say about how easy it is to adjust the length. If it is that easy, mine are just defective. I pop the caps off the handle, and try to slide the rope out the opening, but it will NOT budge. The metal cringe is kinda stuck on the top side of the plastic handle, where I cannot reach to even tinker with it. Heck, I bought this after reading the overwhelmingly positive reviews, but have to say that I must belong to the small minority that got saddled with the defective pieces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, get some random rope instead.","review":"Would be nice if it were adjustable as suggested.

I'd probably stay away from these. I used them probably 20-25 times when they broke at the handle. Since I still had some rope left, I was able to fix them....for a few more weeks, when they broke again at the handle. At that point, I decided that jump roping just wasn't my thing and threw them in the trash.It's certainly possible I just had bad luck. I actually didn't have the problem that many reviewers state in adjusting the rope's length. I just don't think the quality is there. My jump rope saw very limited use (I didn't jump rope for more than 5 minutes at at time), and it still didn't last being used more than 2 dozen times.I'd probably go with another manufacturer for jump ropes, although this one certainly won't break the bank if you decide to give it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Don't waste your money, it broke while I was adjusting it and now it sits in my garbage pail.....

I pried off the silver end cap of the handle with a flat head screwdriver, I sliced off the extra part of the jump rope with a pruning shears, and with a tack hammer a whacked that baby back on. Adjusting is a pain, but I'm guessing you're only going to adjust it once, and when that's all over you won't think about it again.The grip on this rope is great for me. Now someone who has sweatier hands may disagree. Otherwise this is a speed rope, works fine, does its job, no dissertation is necessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great jump rope","review":"I jump rope for exercise, and the Valeo Speed Jump Rope works very well, much better than the soft rope I had before.

Just pop the cap, move the retaining clip down with a pair of pliers, and cut off the excess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"I needed to buy a new jump rope after my old leather one broke at the handle. I decided to go with a speed rope because I have a Valeo workout ball that has lasted the last couple years for me. The jump rope is a lot faster than a leather one, and the first couple times i used it my arms took a beating from the plastic rope. Once I got used to it though it greatly improved my cardio workout.

The spot where the rope meets the ground has been worn half through. Now I don't jump that often, (in fact during these couple of months, I had to take a two-week break due to injury) so the product has not been through a lot of wear and tear to be in this poor shape. The only thing I can think of is the three times I jumped on my patio, which has a rougher surface texture than my usual spot in the garage. Still, it looks like it's been through a fight with a belt sander. I'll look elsewhere for a new rope. (And soon, apparently.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS ROPE - it is NOT Adjustable","review":"Having spent many frustrating hours trying to get the rope crimp through the narrow 'throat' in the handle, I have realized that the instructions are for a different rope, and that this rope - with a very narrow throat in the handle, cannot be adjusted. I didn't bother to return it as the return shipping cost is a significant percentage of the price - so I'm just writing off the cost and will never again buy a Valeo item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snapped!","review":"I enjoyed it for two weeks.

I have been jumping for a little over two weeks and my pants already fit more loosely! This is a really great quality jump rope! Very durable and will last a long time! It is also very easy to adjust, all I needed was a pair of needle nose pliers and the rest is pretty simple to do yourself.THIS IS A MUST BUY!Miscellaneous: As I mentioned before I have lost weight after a short period of time. I was in a bulking phase where I wanted to get big but I have realized that I really enjoyed being more toned and slim, and at 230 pounds and only 5'10 (mostly muscle, im not fat and I bench 350 lbs) but I dont care about being strong anymore, being big has made a lot more sluggish and not as fast as I once was.

The rope is resisting stretching out when I accidently step on it, the handles are comfortable to hold. I mean, its a jumprope, are there more ways to assess it than either 'yep it sure is a jumprope' or 'no its actually not a jumprope'? I wouldn't be the one to tell you. I was tempted to take another star off for hittimg myself in the face with it the first time I tried to use it, but its unfair to blame that on the jumprope I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great jump rope and only cost six bucks","review":"Just started jumping a couple of months ago and already people are asking me to show them how to jump.

You open the handles to expose the crimped end of the rope, with one extra crimp to use after you cut to your desired length. You get one shot. I cut it, put the crimp in place and squeezed it, which broke the crimp and sent it flying. The rope was ruined before I spun it even one time.Spend a couple more bucks and get a decent rope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice jump rope","review":"I can only do this a short time because I have not yet build up the endurance but I used to enjoy this form of exercise in my younger days. It was tough and I had to use a screwdriver to pry the thing off off, but if you are pulling or removing anything else you are doing it incorrectly. Like many of the other comments, I had a tough time adjusting the rope. The directions should be improved significantly. Once I figured it out, it is actually easy and makes good sense. The only thing you have to know is that the only piece meant to come off is the plastic cap at the end of the handle. It just pops off."},{"rating":"2","title":"semi hard to adjust length of rope","review":"I had to look up how to adjust the length of the rope before doing so just so I knew I was doing it correctly since it was so hard getting the ends of the rope handle apart. It took a putty knife to pop up the end and then twist the top off, needle nose pliers to undo the silver clasp inside the handle and scissors to cut the rope to my length. I'm just under 5' so I had to cut about 1 1/2' - 2' off of the rope so I could use it. Definitely a great rope for adding to knee highs but a pain in the butt to adjust for your height."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Expected!","review":"I was a bit worried after reading some of the reviews that these would be a pain to set up and adjust for length. Don't worry about it. If you can read (if you've made it this far into this review, you read more than well enough) and have a cheap pair of pliers (don't worry--expensive ones will work fine, too), they're easy to adjust. And after that, it's a great jumprope as much as something as simple as a jumprope can be great--feels solid in your hand, smooth, etc. Don't spend crazy money on a rope endorsed by a \\"jump rope expert.\\" This one is cheap, adjustable, and great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable at all.","review":"I purchased this item in August, 2011.

I didn't have too much trouble adjusting it, just popped off the plastic cap at the end, pulled it in to the length I wanted and then crimped the additional metal crimp provided. However...As soon as I started jumping it started to twist and after about 25 jumps it was tangling around my feet and I had to stop and let it hang to unwind, then let it hang from the other side to unwind more. Not only is this annoying in general, but it is even more annoying when you are doing interval training and trying to beat the clock. After the 2nd interval of skipping I simply threw it on the ground and pretended I was skipping rope.Stupid, stupid jump rope. I am throwing it out. It was cheap, but you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice rope, but sucks to re adjust","review":"The rope is pretty nice out of the box .. but once u get to re adjusting its length according to your height - its a downhill journey from there on. The metal clamps provided just bend out of shape and then there is no way of getting them on to the readjusted length.I also tried the option of simply tying a knot with the adjusted length - the drawback here is that the rope will not rotate freely when your are skipping it and will just get tangled ..Disappointed at the design .."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke in the first two days.","review":"Not sure if others experienced the same thing.

I got frustrated with the adjustment process and decided to use it the way it is. I love the rope! It has the best value and best design of all ropes I've used. It may be difficult to use at first.

However, it's impossible to adjust the length. First of all, the directions say to unscrew the rope handle from the black plastic cap. The cap does not screw off; it pops off. I wouldn't complain about the incorrect directions as it is easy enough to figure out, but the rope cannot be pushed down through the handle to the opening. At one point in the handle, the tunnel through which the rope must pass becomes too narrow to fit the rope and metal crimp. There is no way to reach the end of the rope to shorten the length.

For $11 breaking after using for two months seems unacceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Supprised","review":"I was supprised this item is made of a vynal rope or plastic of some kind and is stiff and not very flexible, kind of odd, not what I expected.

Took it outside in the cold the first time I used it and, well, I couldn't use it. Brought it inside to the gym the second time, still couldn't use it. A complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adjustable Fail.","review":"This rope comes at it's max length with very difficult to adjust metal clamps. First, the directions to adjust the rope are not comprehensive. Secondly, the metal claps which hold the end of the ropes in the handle are too easy deformed making it extremely difficult to do it correctly and/or to be able to slide it down the rope to the appropriate length. I failed at this and tied a knot instead because it was becoming too epic. However, if that happens there is a 100% chance the ball bearing on said jump rope with no long function on the knotted-side handle thus creating tangles in the rope almost immediately.This product is trash, the design and the construction of the clamp is absolutely criminal and goes against every law of common sense and engineering. Therefore I highly recommend buying a similarly priced but superior product from a competitor (as found at local stores near you for similar prices)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to adjust rope length.","review":"Impossible to adjust the rope.

Set handles aside.Step 2) Push rope down through end of cap so both metal crimp pieces are visible...And despite being a reasonably smart and handy guy, I could not pass step 2.Under the foam grip, the handle is sort of hourglass shaped. The design/production problem is that the crimp and rope are on the side of the hourglass closest to the handle, already crimped. The right side of the hourglass has a cap at the end, which is removable. However, it simply was not possible to get the rope and crimp through the narrow gap near the center of the handle so that it could be taken out through the uncapped hole and shortened. Gotta love Chinese manufacturing. Cheap cost.

The portion with the farm buildings was purely decorative and otherwise has no function. I also found there really wasn't enough sand to fill all the containers to their recommended levels.

Sorta like jazz.If you like your metal to have a purpose and direction with a clear formula, stay away from this band.I'll give it two stars: one for being within the realm of metal, and one for being fairly well produced.That's it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this Metal?","review":"It seems that nowadays all sort of noisy and yelled music has to be simply labeled as \\"Heavy Metal\\" (maybe music critics are in need of some professional help, as a librarian or a linguist), so Mastodon is no exception.For me, their sound is a complete disappointment: there is no guitar solo, no virtuosism, no resemblance with the type of songwriting and playing that make Heavy Metal unique, but only a grunge, Nirvana-like wall of guitars followed by a guy squeezing every ounce of air from his lungs 'til exhaustion.The only interesting point in Mastodon music is the Ginger Baker/jazz style of the drummer, who does a good and creative job behind his kit.Taking all in all, this record might be of great value for someone who appreciates grunge music, but not for true Heavy Metal fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Thrash no metal","review":"First off this band doesnt Thrash so what makes them metal? Second of all I saw them live this past week as an opening act to slayer and Mastodon succeeded in putting me to sleep.. Repetative power chords is all I heard with offkey screaming. If recklessly bashing the drums and playing sloppy chords is what people compare to metallica then those critics who make that comparison are talking about St Anger metallica which isnt really metallica. If you compare this to Kill em all up to the black album, it doesnt come close.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clash of the Titans meets Black Beard","review":"Brillant album. And I don't use that word often or lightly.One of the few albums where the cover album art actually matches the music behind it...Dark and dreamy, great infusion and balance of rhythmic guitars and oceanic chaos.And I haven't even dived deep into the phathoms of lyrics yet. Normally the music and lyrics are judged before making an overall decision on the album, but this is the exception to my rule.One listen into it, I ticked off about 5 tracks I liked immediately. Second listen, about 7, 3rd listen all of them.4th listen, bliss.Carl"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mix of prog-thrash-stoner metal","review":"I have to start out by saying I never listened to the band or heard them before seeing them live on the 2004 tour with Slayer & Killswitch engage, so I knew nothing about them. They blew me away live! So naturally I had to buy the album. Leviathan is a masterpiece of complex arrangements and odd timing. Very heavy and epic sounding. Not for everyone, but those who would enjoy odd technical prog metal bands like Coroner, Voivod, Mekong Delta, U.P., Beyond Fallen, etc. would probably like this. The vocals are a bit on the death metal side for the most part, and don't do much for me, but the music is killer. Great to see a metal band willing to be a bit different. It has thrash, prog, stoner, and death metal moments all rolled into one. Very well done album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A metal gem","review":"Mastodon have mastered complex metal, creating 10 of the most sonic and unique songs of the year.Tempo and groove are the key elements of this album. They are extremeley unconventional in their tempo (Megaladon is a great example of a diverse tempo that just shocks you). These guys can just destroy everything in sight (Blood and Thunder, Iron Tusk), create a true epic (Hearts Alive), or combine the 2 (Naked Burn, Island). And this is a truly TALENTED band. It is like a perfect fusing of jazz with extreme metal. It is mind boggling!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SPLIT YOUR LUNGS WITH BLOOD AND THUNDER, WHEN YOU SEE THE WHITE WHALE!","review":"This album gets 5 stars just for the first track.

Most of us had to use this book because it was required. Rule of thumb for Math and Physics students, it is not something that can be rote memorized. You actually have to see the worked-out problems and try to solve them yourselves. If a book doesn't contain enough examples (like this one), you are one a slippery downward slope.

It crashes constantly, it runs slowly, it does not provide error messages to guide you. Prior to installing EMC8, I rarely had problems with Windows XP Pro; now, the system hangs frequently, always when some component of EMC8 is running. The \\"support\\" for this product is a joke. In my experience, on-line \\"chat\\" is never available. The ticket-based help system takes forever to respond--if they respond at all--and good luck trying to find a phone number to speak to a live person.I have no idea if other programs work better than this one. Before buying EMC8, I read many, many reviews and they all seemed equivocal about pros and cons. I bit the bullet and bought EMC8, a decision that I will regret for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used to advance graphic editing but this does the job","review":"For my work I have to make a lot of Powerpoint presentations. For editing photos and graphics I've been using several advanced programs. I needed a sound and video editor as welll as new burning software so I bought Roxio EMC8. The photo editor works nearly as well as the advanced software I'm used to using. I haven't had to use another program when I'm editing photos. If you use their photo editor you can go directly to slide show maker or the burning options. Since much of my work is professional, I need to have backups. This suite has an auto backup utility. You can auto schedule backups to your liking. The video editing has been good to. I get requests to put the presentations on discs so they can be mailed or hand carried. I'm able to jump from making the presos to burning disks really quickly. This suite has been a big help in my work creation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes you think you need a new computer","review":"Loaded on an eMachine and a Gateway.

I don't need that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Hope You Won't Need Support","review":"The product installed properly and then the problems began. I tried to get help from Roxio's self help site, which proved to be extremely inadequate. I posted my problems on the Roxio support site, but all were left unanswered. Here's just one problem example. There were many. I decided I wanted to create a label for a music CD that I burned. After ordering labels directly from Roxio, I found that the labels they shipped me were not supported by the EMC 8 software. Can you believe that? Anyway, functionally the suite is very complete. If you buy it, just hope you won't need help from Roxio. They're probably the worst software company I've ever dealt with. I ended up returning the software for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"found this even better than 7.5","review":"After using Roxio emc7.5 for a few years I know the good, the bad and the ugly. Most of it worked but I still used some side programs to do media editing. I don't know how some think that 7.5 was better. I don't even think it compares to 8 now. Version 8 has improved the media editing so much that I don't use the my other programs any more.photo - added layering editing, clone toolvideo - 2 track editing, virtual clip & music video creation,audio - noise filter, equalizationdisc burning - added dual layer dvd, auto music id tagsThese are a few of the new things I noticed. Overall the menus are much more intuitive. I can say that I felt that I have a true upgrade and not a program with just a few small features added. Of course the software would be useless if it didn't work right. So far I've burned several discs and edited video complete with added music. There are probably better video editing programs with more features but for a suite version this one is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Found nearly all programs great","review":"I'm not sure why there are those who say the program is bloated. The program is large, no question, but it covers a lot of ground. The disc authoring alone is huge as there are a lot of disc types it covers. Apparently burning data and music are vastly different, which I found when I used this program. It takes a lot more time burning music which is due to coversion and having dolby stereo audio. It's not just the size of the files that affects the burning time.The photo editing program is very comprehensive and this is like a packaged program by itself. Add to that the slide shows and other projects and the suite offers a lot of photo project features. It may be huge, but I think all the programs are of use."},{"rating":"2","title":"fair and balanced","review":"Nothings perfect but in terms of pluses and minuses, emc8 definitely rules in the plus categories. It's a breeze to learn and most programs included are needed for media control. Pluses are the disc and file formats like dvd-vcr, divx, tivo, dvd dual layer. In the editing category all the programs show improvement over version 7.5. In the minus category, the utilities could be more robust. The dvd and cd check utility are the most useful, but there isn't a lot more than that. I'm one happy user."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves top reputation, not just for Mac software","review":"For years roxio has produced some of the best software for Apple computers. It's reputation has been stellar and I was always pleased with their disc authoring programs. I use a pc a lot more now and thought that I would try the roxio pc program. Although there are differences, it still has the roxio signature features. The menus are not arranged the same, but I think this is a progression to their older software. You nagivate your way around by choosing the type of media. Also like Mac software you can use the visual method of dragging files to the the disc icon. There is a drag and drop icon which can reside in the memory so you don't always have to start the full program. Also in keeping with the roxio structure, there are wizards galore which make all the actions highly accessible. Keep this up and I may consider getting rid of my Mac completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of junk!!!","review":"I installed the product and could neither register it online nor get any updates without hanging trying to access Roxio's servers.

At this it stinks. It gives new meaning to the terms counterintuitive and user-unfriendly. It uses 98%-99% of my CPU capacity, making multitasking totally impossible. The disk label function forces you to use wierd patterns instead of plain labels, and doesn't recongize standard Neato labels. It gives less control than you get with 7.5. I'm going to uninstall it and go back to 7.5.This piece of junk was probably written by the same idiots who did Norton PcAnywhere 11.

I was very happy using the old software it work like a charm. When more new versions of Crator were release Roxio place an apps to try to disable my use of version 8 and trying to force me to upgrade. Every time I open the program it would not link me to the Roxio website and come back with annoying error. After I kept clicking the error box a number of times, then the program would work, but not without it starting again.

Having used versions 6.0 and 7.0 in the past, I was hoping that version 8.0 would be invigorated with some fresh ideas after having been acquired by Sonic. While I had found Roxio to be serviceable in the past, there were a few idiosyncrasies that I had long found annoying and had hoped that they would be eliminated in this new version. Instead, Sonic has married many of the nuisances that caused me to first choose Roxio over RecordNow with the ones already present in Roxio, to produce a product that I loath using. In fact, I removed it from my computer.This is not to say that the product doesn't work, or that it's not feature laden, just that it doesn't suit my personal preference. It's the sort of thing that, for me, tips the scales in favor Nero Ultra Edition.

I frequently have to throw away two to three CD-R or DVD+R discs to get one copy. I can't recommend another software since I simply use the Windows Media that came with my computer now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not gonna take long","review":"I wont get into detail since all the other reviews already have covered the problems.

Pretty much one of the worst programs I have wasted money on."},{"rating":"1","title":"not on my pc","review":"Used previous versions. No problems. With ver. 8 trying to create DVD's, nothing but problems. Imported video files one by one. Titles show up in menu box but not in preview window, just blank black text boxes, Tried changing color, still no text. Tried burning the project. Looked just like the preview. No text for video titles or menu title. Just black text boxes. Tried eval version of Nero. Worked fine. Tried update of roxio 8. Still no text editing. Tried for 3 1/2 weeks to get answer from tech support. No answers from either their online help or email response. Garbage program, garbage company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Who knows, like the user who had PC-Cillin, so did I. Perhaps if I was willing to wait and leave my PC inoperable until the wonderful Roxio customer service contacted me, I too could have Roxio operating on my PC. What a bad experience. This software caused my excellent PC to bomb as soon as I installed it. I never even tried any of the functions prior to returning it primarily because the software caused my CD/DVD drives to malfunction. Trying to escape playing a CD caused \\"MY COMPUTER\\" to freeze. Removing Roxio restored my system to normal. If Roxio has known software/hardware incompatibilities, those should be posted right in the forefront of their help section. Come to think of it... I had Easy CD Creator 5.0 Platinum. It too had an application \\"Take Two\\" that destabilized my old PC so bad that I had to f-disc reformat and reinstall Windows. Last of Roxio for me! Seriously... Good Luck all of you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but awful burning DLs","review":"I've been a long-time user of Roxio ever since v4, but as time has gone on, the product seems to have gotten worse. I have v8 and it does okay burning CDs and single DVDs, but count on a lot of coasters if you try to burn DL DVDs. The editing engine is terrible, like something from years ago. Roxio Classic no longer burns DVDs and the menus are rather confusing. You can do much better with Nero or CloneDVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roxio Fails to Fully Deliver","review":"Roxio Easy Media Creator Suite 8 is a great value, but be prepared to work for those saved dollars. Numerous programming glitches turn what would have been a simple, somewhat user-friendly DVD creator into a frustrating, time-consuming ordeal. I used it to create a few slideshows. My biggest frustration came when I'd add music, and all of my \\"zoom & pan\\" settings would disappear. Then, when I'd add \\"zoom & pan\\" settings, my timing settins would change. Ridiculous. Roxio would do well to FULLY test their software before rushing it to the shelves. I would have given it only one star, had it not been for the good price."},{"rating":"1","title":"customer service was terrible; this should still be in beta","review":"don't get this software unless you dont mind paying to beta test roxio's pile of crap. customer service was horrible, the tech support website was down half the time, and the workarounds they suggest only got half of the suite to work properly. go back to 7.5 until they get 8 running properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roxio Media Creator 8.0","review":"I was sorry I opened the box. I just tried to edit a Sony DVD video and 8.0 was a joke. For the Menue Styles it only gives you three choices. You can click on a more choices button and it bumps you online to Roxio where you can buy more Menue Styles. Roxio 7.0 had many video Menue Styles to choose from. You think they would add more not less with the 8.0 upgrade. I wanted to delete a scene in the video and it was impossible to find the right menue to do that. I have a new Dell Demension with 1 gig of memory and fastest hard drive and processor available and 8.0 still hung up and seemed sluggish for video editing. If you have Roxio 7.0 stay with that or I am going to try a Sony video editing product. I just ate $80."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trouble","review":"This program keeps locking up.

It looks like it has some nice features if you can keep it running long enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"I bought this online as a download. It is a waste of money. The user interface is frustrating and not all that intuitive, the slideshow does not let you choose less than 2 seconds. I hate their background menu picture default... why can't they let me choose no background picture at all. And wose of all, when I try to burn a VCD or DVD, it encodes to about 90 some percent, then stops and does nothing else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Causes system hang and inconvenient","review":"I'm using the Roxio EMC 8.0 mostly for video editing and DVD burning. DV imports and CD copies were fast but the real problem was with photo slide show and video compilation during the video editing. I experienced numerous system hangs (more than 10 times a day) during the slide show creation. Content pool window was too small and I had difficulty placing a photo exactly where I wanted. Text editing tool is very basic and was not stable. I encountered a couple of system hangs during the text editing.I'll go back to Sony Movie Studio because it is very stable and easy to use. Roxio EMC 8.0 provides a lot of features, but for video and slide show creation, Sony Movie Studio works much better for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am returning this","review":"I had a program in 2002 that worked better for photo editing.... none of this program is user friendly, though I did like the slideshow feature....

Ha! Ha! What a joke. Roxio is probably laughing all the way to the bank. It will not work. I also loaded it on my laptop which has Windows XP and it did not work on that either. I contacted support. They sent a patch which helped some of the problems but not all. I contacted them again and have not gotten a response, that was about two weeks ago. I was not able to locate a phone number for tech support so I contacted customer service to try and get my money back. They said it was not their problem to go back to the store. The store said it sounded like a compatibility issue and they would not do anything. So we are stuck with a useless piece of junk program. I would strongly recommend that you pass up this program. Ulead and Adobe will let you test their software. We are in the process of looking for a different program."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This software is so heavy, it takes over a gig to install. It takes a very long time to install.

It also did something weird to my wireless network, so I cannot use wireless anymore unless I uninstall and restore my computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"No More ROXIO","review":"Running a top of the line Dell XPS. Loaded Roxio Easy Media Creator 8.0 and got infamous \\"Blue Screen of Death\\". Removed software and computer operation was normal. Same results on subsequent attempts to load software. Tried to use ROXIO web-site for help with absolutely no success. Disscussion group tried hard to help, but suggestions were not helpful. There seems to be no way to contact ROXIO live assistance. Automated tech assistance (Roxanne) is useless. I do not plan to try instalation again. Just not worth the trouble. Would donate software to good cause, but would feel guilty about giving an innocent receiver such a troublesome software product. Probably will just throw the $80 software away."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAUTION May crash your system","review":"If you are using Windows XP SP2 with Windows Media Center, after your install it will cause an upfixable error. If you call Roxio support they will tell you to download the 114meg patch which will not install or pay another $10 for the CD. Had to do a rollback on my system to get Windows Media Center to work again. Returned product and would not recommend it to anyone until all the bugs are worked out and compatable with Windows Media Center."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roxio EMC 8 is 2 steps backward in MP3 functionality","review":"I bought Roxio EMC 8 after using Roxio 6. I recently purchased a new Dell and of course the \\"free\\" media software that came with it was all \\"lite edition\\",trail ware none of which has full functionality, or requires the purchase of plug-ins. So with my experience with Roxio 6 I assumed 8 would be a good tool to create and organize my MP3s. I was wrong. Roxio EMC 8 has less MP3 functionality than Roxio 6. Furthermore, there customer support is very difficult to navigate. I want an 800 number or an email address. The Roxio site forces customers to register and be at the mercy of a bulletin board forum for any and all truly technical support.In all fairness I did not use the other functions of EMC 8. As I said I bought it for its MP3 functionality, not so much the other stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good as long as you don't load backup program","review":"After installing the Roxio Easy Media Creator 8.0, my computer slowed to a snail's pace.

I was able to find a way to burn Tivo shows with Nero as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tivo No-go","review":"I bought EMC8 because of its support for the Tivo file format. Like other reviewers, I found that the program ran VERY SLUGGISHLY and sucked up nearly all of the resources on a dual Pentium 4 Xeon workstation with oodles of memory. I wasn't able get further than adding a Tivo file and creating a menu before the program would crash.Contacting tech support via email several times elicited no response. I managed reach a tech support rep without being charged $35 by going through customer service; the advice I received did nothing to resolve the issue.Don't waste your time or money on this worthless software.I'm still searching for a fast, reliable way to archive Tivo files to DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good package","review":"There are certainly a lot of diverse opinions here. My take is that the software needs to run and it should have all the features that it says it does. This has been the case here. I want to burn disks and edit files. I've been able to do that using this software. The installation was surprisingly quick. It is a huge program but I didn't have to keep entering a yes when it installed each program. It treated everything as one big program.Using it has been a no brainer. It's all written out so you just choose what you want. It has the widescreen video support I wanted and the video formats I needed. So far this product hasn't let me down."},{"rating":"2","title":"dvd authoring program and slide show maker to boot","review":"The slide show program is more than competent. You can add a number of transitions, special effects, background music. I like that there is the export to video feature so that the show becomes video footage. This is one of roxio's stronger programs. Of course I use the disk authoring program the most. Creating dvds for dvd players is now a reality with the program. It's far above other programs that I've tried in the past. What about the bugs? I didn't get any so I can't say they even exist. For me this is a great program."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE!!! Alters file modification dates!","review":"This program added some information to hundreds of jpg files on my hard drive and changed the file modification dates without my knowledge. I usually refer to programs like this as viruses. I ended up reloading a 250 MB website because the web editor thought I had replaced all of my photos. Roxio customer service non-responsive after two days. Ended up doing a system restore to eliminate all traces of this horrible program. Doesn't deserve even 1 star for all of the grief it has given me.Update - 9 days later and still no response from Customer Service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parts of this program just don't work","review":"I'm very disappointed with this software. I tried to make a DVD on my home computer using MyDVD and the software actually rebooted my machine while I was adding video from a file on the hard disk. I tried it again and it rebooted my machine again! So I moved the software to my laptop from work and, although it didn't reboot the laptop, it wouldn't actually produce the DVD either. Basically, this is an unreliable piece of junk. I wish I hadn't wasted my money. I'm going to download the 30-day Nero Ultra Edition 7 trial and hope it works better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with version 7","review":"I have been a user of the Easy Media series of products from its early days as an Adaptec product. Prior to V8, I was very happy with it. V8 is a huge leap backwards, however. It is slow, more difficult to use and very unreliable. Roxio service used to be good, now it seems non-existent. The only reason to get this is if you need to burn TiVo programs, but Roxio now has problems doing that. The message boards for both Roxio and TiVo have long lists of complaints.I would go with Nero unless you need the TiVo functionality"},{"rating":"1","title":"World's Worst Tech Support","review":"I purchased version 8 and apparently was unlucky enough to get a defective CD.

There is NO help available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money, time, and hair on this issue","review":"Roxio came out with a dog and will not admit it. This program distroyed one of my DVD drives, and trashed my computer. Being a masochist, I tried one more time, even trying their patches for 8. Finally, I had to flush the system of 8 then set the computer back a week and start over. After re-installing 7.0 and then 7.5, I was finally able to use my computer and DVD drives again. Several of us are very mad at a couple of professional magazines for giving such glowing reviews of this program. Now, it is not a question of getting our money back, we want justice. We want Roxio to re-issue a corrected up-dated working copy of 8 to everyone that legally purchased their product. If not, somewhere, somehow, someone will come crashing down on them with one of those class action law suites."},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY FROM THIS USELESS PRODUCT!!!","review":"I bought Roxio Easy Media Creator 8.0, and beleive me there is nothing easy about it. It crashed my computer and after I tried all the solutions to make it work, the program would not respond at all. I was lucky that I have Symantecs GO BACK program, I was able to get my drive and my old Roxio 5 back. I thought it was time for me to upgrade to Roxio 8 since it seemed I was getting behind. Little that I know that it was goin to take me all night long trying to UNINSTALL Roxio 8 and fix everything it messed up. Let me tell you, STAY AWAY FROM THIS WORTHLESS SOFTWARE.

If you have enemies and want to take care of them, tell them to buy Roxio 8.0, that will really fix them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crash Landing","review":"I bought Roxio Easy Media Creator 8 because I have owned most Roxio media creator versions going back to version 2 or 3 and found them to be very useful and reliable. Unfortunately, using this version my machine hangs about every third time I try to edit a video.

This one is even worse. After spending hours on a DVD project, Roxio would no longer open the file. Hours and my $69 lost. To get my system working again, I had to resort to using Windows System Restore. To make matters worse, the \\"Suite\\" product has several features missing -- they want you to buy the version with the useless Dazzle adapter if you want a full featured product.

I went out and bought Adobe Premier Elements 2 which works much better although it needs digital content so the vcr's had to be imported by roxio first.

A few wrong keystroke and the system locks up, sometimes completely, requiring a hard boot. It also is so slow, perhaps because it was written in Java, that it gives you the impression that you are not getting a response from your own computer but from another galaxy.There is few better competing products. If you bent on buying this product, do yourself a favor and buy it from Roxio's web site, becasue from there you get a 30 day money back guarantee - and there is a good chance you will want that guarantee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy CD Creator 8 A Ripoff","review":"The title says it all.

Version 7 worked pretty good and I thought version 8 might introduce new features. With version 8 Videowave however has numerous functional problems.What compounds the problem is that their support is not there. I wrote their support and they did not even answer. If you call there is a $30 charge even when you first purchase the product.It is a shame because the software has a lot of great features, if it worked. It doesn't.

I finished off the project and saved it to the hard disc to burn with Nero 7 to find out that some of the files necessary to play the DVD are missing. Recoding the project was futile so I ended up saving the MPEG streams that I worked so hard to edit so I could author and burn with Nero 7.

Also, the \\"pan and scan\\" that replaced the \\"motion pictures\\" edit was a huge disappointment. Even in advanced mode, Roxio seems to have simplified the process so that it actually does less than it did before: you cannot conveniently adjust the slide duration here, you cannot zoom in as far as before; and the pre-set \\"start\\" and \\"end\\" points are quirky to override and the scan point settings sometimes seem to have a mind of their own. I loved it the way the \\"edit motion pictures\\" function was before and was hoping that in the new release that you'd be able to ROTATE the panning frame as well.

Pat Cooper rightly says the joke isn't that funny in the first place. Kevin Pollak is funny because he mostly just gives us his Christopher Walken impression. And Jerry Seinfeld comes out better than any of them by not appearing at all. This film shows that gross does not mean funny. Just watch Airplane! again if you need further proof.

I appreciate a good dirty joke as much as anyone and am not easily offended. But this movie STINKS!!! The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because of Larry Storch's brief interpretation of the joke using a British accent, which was the only truly funny part of the film and even that part was cut short.

Oh but there's a kicker, the joke isn't funny and everyone knows it. Yet, of course, some of the comedians tell it like it's the funniest thing in the world - Sarah Silverman, Gilbert Godfried, Bob Sagat, and South Park are definite highlights. And I love Sarah Silverman. However, the awful cinematography, horrific editing, and terrible production value of this film make impossible for me to fathom why people didn't burn down the theaters when they realized this film wasn't getting any better. I would have at least demanded a refund, and $100/hr billed in 15 minute increments. I think Sarah Silverman saved the day again."},{"rating":"1","title":"not funny, just inane","review":"Trying to move a product by being as vile as possible is a poor excuse for something marketed as humorous. Even though top comics are involved, the Aristocrat joke format is tiresome as every possible combination of themes on scat, bestiality, and incest is played out ad nauseam. The documentary style of endlessly discussing the joke and its supposed merits is also tedious.

If you like jokes that revolve around family members, including children, engaged in sexual perversion, this is for you and serial killers everywhere. It's everything the DVD art says it is: obscene, disgusting, vulgar, and vile. It's just not funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply not funny","review":"Yes, this movie is offensive, but offensive doesn't bother me at all. Some of the best humor -- Richard Pryor, more than anyone -- can be extremely offensive. What bothers me is that the movie simply is not funny. The joke is not funny. The comedians expounding on the nature of comedy are neither funny nor profound. The level of humor here is no more clever than your average high-school sophomore. Just a bunch of people elaborating on pederasty and defecation for no apparent reason. A drag from start to . . . well, I couldn't really finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Tried","review":"It's hard to judge a movie when you haven't seen the whole movie. But I just couldn't bring myself to watch it past the first scene. Vulgar jokes don't really bother me, especially if they ARE funny. But the joke seemed to be lost in all the random comments like how a joke is told, how it changes, what it means, etc etc.Usually the directors goal is trying to capture to audience so they can't pry their eyes away. I had to force myself to watch the first 20 minutes! This was just a waste of film. It could have been maybe a tv special that no one watches. But to spend money actually making a dvd about it? Waste of money, time, and everyone else's life.This dvd would only be interesting to maybe an actual comedian. But for the rest of us? Just say no."},{"rating":"1","title":"People think THIS is FUNNY????","review":"I had to check out this film on the recommendation of a close friend. He enjoyed it, and it sounded like a clever idea for a film/documentary. I love offensive humor. I also like it when it's delivered in a funny, or clever way. This movie is about as funny as watching your lover get a colonoscopy from the rear. I didn't laugh a SINGLE time, and I'm not that hard to please when it comes to comedies. Simply a LONG movie about a joke (or lack there of) that isn't funny. Waste of money! UNRECOMMENDED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, choppy, and repetitive","review":"Rented this movie expecting to laugh. Didn't think it was funny at all. The camera jumps from person to person as they sit in chairs and describe the first time they heard this raunchy joke, that really just isn't funny to begin with. I kept expecting the commentary to stop, and the movie to begin, but it never did. It got real old real fast. Tried fast farwarding to see if there was anything else to see, but there wasn't. I don't mind swearing or dirty jokes, when they are funny, but this was just nastiness for the sake of nastiness. Shocking yes, but funny no. After you hear the twentieth person say the same thing, it's no longer even shocking, just annoying. I wouldn't even recommend renting it.

Very cool concept analogous to a jazz composition. It does lag in the middle but finished strong.

Some note that the jump cut editing and the interruptions of the joke by the tellers is a nuisance, I disagree as it keeps it the joke, and with it, the film from being redundant. \\"Why all the negative reviews?\\", you might ask?

Some of that is funny, depending on the comedian (there are some people who make a living as comics-- a very good living, probably-- and I've never been able to understand why. Quite a few of them are found here). But the joke itself and its endless variations? Nah.

Alexander has become famous for writing children's books and for giving interviews in which he stresses how he makes sure to instill good moral values in his own children. However, in The Aristocrats, Alexander goes way out of his way to engage in the most vulgar and disgusting so-called comedy imaginable.The basic thrust of The Aristocrats, at least to the extent that there is one, is that free speech is a good thing.

The family goes into action. The act has sometimes incest, sometimes it's scatological, often both with other weird stuff thrown in. It is over the top as the joke teller's mind can go. I just don't find that kind of humor funny.Penn and Teller (it's their movie) don't drink nor smoke. They have given me the impression that they try to eat moderately (watching their Showtime series) but to them this is okay.

The joke that this movie is based upon is simple, straightforward, and dates from the days of vaudeville. In it's simplest form, it is a quick set-up, punch line, and rim-shot. The point of this documentary is that each comedian that has told it over the years has improvised their own details in the middle, and seem to have an ongoing contest to see who can make it the longest and the most disgusting.

Pathetic, geared for retards.Thank God for classic DVD's and old movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total unadulterated , nonsensical garbage","review":"Without a doubt a great looking movie and that's about its only redeeming quality.This movie probably has one of the most ridiculous plots of anything of the Star Trek franchise, either tv or movie, obviously the producers have absolutely no concept of physics or time paradox.Over use of special effects, totally pointless action sequences, incessant need to try and work everything from original Star Trek lore into a two hour movie, just jumbled things even more.If you are a die hard Trekkie, obviously this movie is a must, but if this is the future of Star Trek then the franchise really is doomed.And what's with the tattooed Romulans, why is it that every bad guy today has to have tats, bit like the 80s, when every bad guy had dangly earing and mullet.Honestly if you have the ability to go back in time and change things, why wouldn't you just prevent the future destruction of your planet, instead of destroying those responsible, 'makes no sense!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap knock-off","review":"This single disc is extremely disappointing. The sound quality on the voice tracks is abominable. Whenever there was any action, the voices were almost overwhelmed by the music or the sound effects.This was one of these special prices Amazon is running and I don't know if that was the problem, i.e. a cheap copy. I have no idea what the two disc sets sound like. Likely better. I happened to see a bootleg copy that had better sound quality than the single disc.I can't tell you how disappointed I was. After seeing that bootleg, I was expecting something special on the one I actually bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps the Worst Movie I Have Ever seen in My Enitire Life","review":"I am a major Star Trek fan don't get me wrong but this movie is totally unwatchable and it is not because of the actors or the story but because of the endless lens flare and camera overlay. I have no idea what they were thinking of but they made a movie so hard on the eyes that they rendered the story meaningless with their jumpy camera work and cheap \\"special effects\\". There may have been a great story here but I was too distracted by the sloppy direction to pay attention to the story. I would rather watch \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\" anyday than this hunk of junk movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie, even if you aren't a huge Star Trek fan.","review":"I absolutely love this movie. Before, I was never a huge fan of Star Trek, but now I am in love with the characters, and I find myself watching old episodes of Star Trek and The Next Generation.

I can honestly say that this new version of Star Trek set off a chain reaction of obsession for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I ordered","review":"I ordered the new version of Star Trek with Chris Pine. Unfortunately, I received a 3 discs of old Star Trek movies that im not in to. The covers were virtually identical. So be careful if you order this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't Star Trek, it is a lame series of idiotic scenes...","review":"But it does have decent sound effects. Too bad the movie goes from 'save the baby' to 'rebellious child loves fast cars' to 'did that little idiot actually destroy a 200 year old Corvette?' to 'I hope he falls to a painful death!' to 'I don't care if Uhura thinks he is a loser, I just hope the idiots in red kick his a**!', to 'Do they really expect me to believe that star-ships are built in Iowa?', and then the formulaic aspects of the movie started to get too annoying to really care.This is a monumentally bad movie. It is a rejection of everything that the Star Trek movies stood for. In many ways, this movie is more of a discredit to the original concept than the movie that claimed to be Starship Troopers."},{"rating":"1","title":"New = Old, Plot fails","review":"This was a clever \\"remake\\" of the old TV series and could be the stepping stone to a new series based upon the younger version of the TV characters beloved by all us trekkies. The personalities and even mannerisms of the younger versions of all the old staples, including Kirk, Spock, Uhura, Chekov, McCoy, Scotty were spot on. The plot was a mis-mash however, unscientific and a major disappointment resulting in only 2 stars. With all the solid sci fi writers out there, why go for cheap, non-sensicalness?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I really enjoyed this new \\"Trek,\\" but...","review":"...why did we need to have Spock and Uhura making out on the transporter pad? I felt that way after seeing it in the theater, and I feel that way even more after watching the DVD. I don't think any Star Fleet officer would engage in such a public display of affection with another officer, and the fact that it's Spock makes it even less - dare I say it? - logical. It's the one part of the film where I think the director and writers tried a bit too hard to veer off the well-worn \\"Star Trek\\" path, and it fails mightily to me. The rest of the film, whatever quibbles some hard-core fans might have with it, was quite enjoyable, I thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes me proud to be a Trekkie","review":"From the first Star Trek film through the various TNG outings, many had good attributes, but none could be called a \\"really good story\\". The latest prequel is an exceptionally well done, thoroughly entertaining production. Not only is it visually intriguing, but the character development, plot line and fun references to the original series are all top notch.Heck, I was embarrassed to tell anyone that I had a copy of Nemesis. This one is near-perfect!Chris Pine, Zachary Quinto and Simon Pegg (sp?) are perfectly cast. Bones' replacement has the look and the vocal intonation down to a fine science (sorry - have forgotten the actor's name and am too lazy to look it up).A must for any Trekkie, and probably should be in most collections of any sci-fi junkie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"Fun, humor, action...great acting.

My Previous favorite was The Vogage Home. I still love that movie but this is the best Star Trek movie ever. I never was a Trekie, I just enjoyed the shows and the movies.

Hopefully will breathe some badly needed life back into the franchise. Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy successor to its legacy.","review":"Aside from being a movie which keeps the viewer's interest from beginning to end, this \\"Star Trek\\" movie serves the purpose of tying up a lot of loose ends from the original series. One comes away with a much better understanding of the characters, and can get much more out of the original episodes when watching them again. This is a key aspect of the film, since other than its social commentary and obvious allegorical nature, what has always set all of the \\"Star Trek\\" series and movies apart from other SciFi on TV and in theaters is that it is character-driven, rather than depending on the special effects and story lines (though the writers have always been good as well). This one is no exception. It's a very good movie, and very well-acted."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Star Trek","review":"Being a Trekie from way back, I was afraid this would be a poor production.

Guess what. It's expired as of 11/27/2010. Do they say that anywhere?!?!? Nope. Will Paramount do anything about it? Nope. Now, I don't necessarily blame Amazon for this, since Paramount is knowingly allowing movies to be sold that won't work. (Paramount isn't the only crook, Warner and Sony does the same thing, apparently). Get the cheaper version, save your money.If it wasn't for my wasting my money, I would have given this more stars, but alas, that is not the case here."},{"rating":"1","title":"The glare generation","review":"The video and audio quality are great, which makes this lens flare/glare orgy completely unwatchable.

And while I enjoy the early movies with that original crew, this modern take on the same characters is fantastic. All of the actors did a great job, combined with fantastic effects, and having Leonard Nimoy appear as the original Spock was icing on the cake. This disc also contains one of the funniest gag reels I have ever seen, and I still laugh about it years later. All I can say is that I am very looking forward to the next one due out in May 2013 and the fact that JJ Abrams will direct the next Star Wars movie gives me a \\"new hope\\" that that movie will be nothing short of spectacular also."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT DEAL :)","review":"For a few bucks, it'd be hard to pass up a deal like this.

Especially that of Spock and McCoy. Its almost eery how they all seem like the original characters (or should I say those who played them). Its a great intro story that focuses on the 2 main characters of Kirk and Spock. From Starfleet to there vital mission to stop the Romulan Nero from his revenge against the original spock (Leonard Nimoy in the film was nice touch though Shatner should have been in as well) In the end the timeline may be changed but our heros stay the same>"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much awaited Star Trek","review":"What can I say, I'm a HUGE Trekkie. I know this was more expensive than just getting the Blu-ray alone, but I just couldn't help myself. The replica of the USS Enterprise, NCC 1701 from the movie is perfect.

This is one item that will be cherished for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film, but digital copy is worthless for portables","review":"This review is really about the \\"digital copy\\" which is a device to sell DVDs and make you think you can watch the film on your mobile devices, i.e. iTouch, Zune, Mobile phone, etc. The movie is excellent, great new take on the original 'Star Trek' story.But the digital copy process (for Windows) downloaded two WMV versions of the film to my computer, one for the computer, and a smaller \\"portable\\" version. But both files are rigged not to copy (it generates a bogus error). So the portable version cannot be copied to my portable device (a Windows Mobile phone). So the whole thing is useless.

I'll make this short and sweet. If you have never seen any Star Trek movies or series then I'm sure you love it. It's a summer popcorn blockbuster. Fast paced. The ride is great. Now if you follow Trek then i don't have to say a word. This movie has been picked apart at various Trek websites. Some love it and Some don't. I personally think it was cool. I had been waiting for any new Trek since Nemesis. So I'll take what I can get. I just had a hard time seeing anybody replace the original cast. I'm sure they will grow on me eventually. Except for maybe Sylar, Oh I mean Quinto. Every time I watch it I keep seeing Sylar in Spock. I guess i watch Heroes to much. Anyway I do recommend it.

The storyline is thin, and it throws away much of the Star Trek Cannon that has existed for decades. Why?

If you are a long term Star Trek fan, you will be left asking, \\"what happened\\"? If you have never seen a Star Trek movie, tv series, book, or recording, you may think this is good entertainment. However, the storyline is unsustainable, a very large flaw that Paramount overlooked while making this movie, and the very reasoning behind this movie will leave most Star Trek fans wondering who the heck thought this was a good idea.

Anyway, if you have a functioning brain, then I don't think this movie is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the additional audio tracks?","review":"I have always been a huge Star Trek fan, but I am very disappointed with Paramount lame blu-rays. Where are the additional foreign language audio tracks that are present on the DVD version? No Paramount blu-rays on my shelf, so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"j.j takes a piss on 40years plus star trek history","review":"i just can not believe that this new star trek movie has been getting rave reviews world wide,have any of you so called fans even seen star trek before? it seems not! yes it's pretty and fast and sexy but it's more like fast and the furious in space then star trek,and for the writers and j.j to just dismiss 40 years plus of trek history and throw it all out the window is a crime against star trek,so go slam this review and say i am hater but i love star trek and this new movie is not star trek.!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"What a disaster.I grew up on Trek and was really looking forward to this.Can we please stop resorting to time travel people?Harlan Ellison let this plot device out of the bottle (in TOS) with an elegance that has not since been matched. Let's leave it be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great start for an old series","review":"I'm an old time Star Trek fan but the original cast definitely had some weak movies. This movie not only resets the story line but the actors are top rate in their roles. I know the time travel line can be overused but in this case it doesn't detract and adds a freshness to the series. Zachary Quinto is excellent in his portrayal of Spock balancing his Vulcan and Human sides. A big thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Trek 2009","review":"I enjoyed this movie. Simple as that. Anyone that watched the original series and has seen most the previous movies will appreciate all the call-backs from this installation of trek. The back story for Kirk is just meh. And Kirk running into Spock Prime is just ridiculous. All in all a good action sci-fi moving picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Trek review","review":"I thought the Star Trek remake was excellent. Chris Pine was very good as Kirk, Zoe Saldana was very good and the person who played Spock was excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it's \\"Star Trek\\" it MUST be wonderful!","review":"If you crave video games and CGI's then this movie's for you. However, if you want more from script and direction then altered personalities; biker style Romulans (with dialogue to match); and leading players who look and sound like your local High School troupe, then you may find this film wanting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vamwolf","review":"Great movie! Before you complain about \\"continuity\\", I advise you to watch the entire thing. All will be explained. \\"Live long and prosper.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"C. Pine changes Star Trek history","review":"Although Chris Pine did an excellent job with the making of Star Trek, he deviated from the classic storyline of the three main characters. Especially he changed the history of James T. Kirk's history and thus I have to berate him a little for that. As far as Star Trek is concerned, I am a purist and the story should have stayed the course. Of course I am one of the original trekkers from way back in the old times of the 1960's. Except for this one major flaw, I have given this movie four stars for special effects; writing; acting; and I basically enjoyed the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"harold and kumar go to an apple store","review":"good cast + no plot at all + explosion or chase scene every 5 mins = not STAR TREK but a TRANSFORMERS movie. I particularly liked the engine room scenes that were obviously filmed in a BREWERY (what's a warp drive without water pipes, square cielings, and concrete floors?), the bridge that was patterned after an Apple retail store, and the inside of the Romulan ship that was obviously a collection of scaffolding on a sound stage with spotlights on the scaffolding."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Star Trek Sucked","review":"It has none of the spirit of a Roddenberry Star Trek.

You might as well have called it Star Trek Transformers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rebirth of an Iconic line","review":"Saw the movie in the theater and loved it. Bought the DVD and still love it. A a classic trekker I was cautiously optimistic when the movie came out. Now I am sold on the idea of altering a few things and seeing how it all works out, this time around.<g>"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film - even better on Blu-Ray.,","review":"I really enjoyed this \\"reboot\\" of the Star Trek story. Even though I don't consider myself a hard-core Star Trek fan, I was excited by the idea of seeing the early years of the Enterprise crew. Overall, I'd give the film an A- for it's solid story, great acting and special effects. I wasn't too impressed with the interior shots and set of the engine room/lower levels of the Enterprise, as it's painfully obvious they were shot in a present-day industrial facility of some sort. That was the low point for me, and it stood out like a sore thumb in an otherwise well-made flick.Also, this movie really shines when experienced on a quality big screen HDTV with (at least) a good 5.1 surround sound audio system.Lastly, thumbs-up to Amazon for fast shipping and a great price for the three disk edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Trek movie (new)","review":"I absolutely LOVE this movie. I remember the original series and didn't think I would like the movie, I loved the spin-off series' and some of the older movies. They did an excellent job of making a new movie that grabs you. It stays true to the original series and yet is a new story of them getting together. A definite watch and as much as I cut back on purchasing movies I had to have this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie even if you aren't a Star Trek Fan","review":"When my husband first wanted to watch this movie, I told him to go ahead and watch it without me. I've never been a big fan of Star Trek or other sci-fi movies. After he watched it, he talked me into watching it with him. I loved it. I'm looking forward to a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic!","review":"Must see on Blu-ray! The history kinda throws you for a loop. You may need to watch it twice to catch where everything fits in together but it's an amazing story with great casting. Really great casting. I only purchase movies I think are amazing and this was one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was a great movie to see at the theater, will buy DVD...","review":"As a Trekkie from way back (and I'm talking the 60's), I was excited to see this movie. It did not disappoint. We saw it in the theater - a good choice for this type of movie, and I rented the DVD later on to watch again. Still a great movie. I loved the interaction between Spock and Kirk, and all the references to the past. It was great to see L. Nimoy again,like seeing an old friend. It was an interesting movie, full of great scenes, action, and unpredictable. This movie was more about relationships and less about solving any intergalactic problem, at least that was my feeling, which was fine by me. I was still thoroughly entertained. Perhaps not as true to form as die-hard Trekkies would like, but still a great movie in and of itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Trek","review":"I saw all the Star Trek movies at the theater. And I bought the full box set back when there were 10. So now I have to buy each movie one at a time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The beggining","review":"Really this movie explains a lot of details about Star Trek creation. The origin of most habits of main crew members were presented and the final scene, when Capitain Kirk enter in command room is amazing... pay attention about the manner how he tooks the seat and give to the pilot the directions of Enterprise...it's identical to William Shatner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun","review":"I have been a Trekkie since the 1960's. I admit I did not think anything could compare to what Gene Roddenberry did back then, but this movie was great. My favorite part about the series was the relationships between Spock, Kirk, and Bones. This movie version honors the \\"specialness\\" of their relationships. I saw it in the theater and had to own it--it was sooo much fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic movie, Choppy Video experience, not in HD like I ordered","review":"I ordered this movie in \\"HD\\" off my Roku XD box on a cable connection which is considered \\"high-speed\\". About 1 hour into the movie, the connection basically stopped, the video became choppy, and basically unwatchable. Ruined the date and movie night.It also was not in HD after the first hour and was in what seemed like a poor video resolution as it definitely wasn't clear. More than once, it blacked out and said it was \\"loading\\".The movie is fantastic, but the poor performance of the network or the delivery mechanism through Roku ruined the experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst star trek ever","review":"I have been a life long fan of star trek. Until now I thought the motion picture was the worst of the movies but it has been topped. This movie features mediocre acting and a plot that erases nearly 50 years of star trek history. The best part of the movie was when I fell asleep, wonderful power nap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible sound and picture quality","review":"I ordered this online version by mistake, thinking it was a DVD. But I played it twice, and the sound quality and picture quality were so bad that I turned it off and have never played it again. I then ordered the DVD, and the movie itself is fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like the movie, but the stream was awful","review":"I have plenty of bandwidth, ran a speed-test, and tried out other services, but I couldn't get this to come in any format better than line-doubled SD.I'm sure it was some sort of glitch in the pipeline, as I've seen other Amazon video come in as HD. I doubt it is anything specific to this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A supped up Last Starfighter","review":"We got this movie last night as a rental from Redbox. We really enjoyed it, probably because we kept on comparing it to the series and enjoying the movie for what it was. Plenty of LOL moments, of course lots of action and great special effects, and good casting and even a surprise romance; something for everyone.We'll now be buying it for our permanent DVD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"I loved the movie. I thought it was fast paced, endearing and comedic at times. My dad was always a Trek fan, and I can see why. Having to look at Zachary Quinto for 2 hours isn't bad either :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"If only there were zero stars...","review":"Like many of the people disappointed with the movie, I'm a long time fan of Star Trek. This movie was just terrible. The 'alternate' timeline was an excuse to make what can only be described as bad fanfiction. The movie is all mindless sparkles and explosions with none of the intelligence of the series. Also, you can plainly see that Abrams was a Star Wars fan rather than a Star Trek fan when you watch the movie. I think it's very sad that this is the new 'face' of Star Trek."},{"rating":"1","title":"STICKEM'UP","review":"Attention Universe: This is the layman (normal,regular guy-expects what he paid for ).As a long time STAR TREK fan I thought this movie would ENTERTAIN its paying audience.Having purchased the BLU-RAY disc and viewing it on my BD player, a great disappointment unveiled. ALL logic has been pushed to the wayside. It was like watching a two hour SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE spoof. Once the cobweb / crustacean-like Romulan Spaceship exited the (wormhole?), things just went south. No need to elaborate(see review by GURMAN SINGH BAL), too bad I can't get my money back.As for Blu-y Quality, it gets 2 stars. If you really want a Blu-ray reference, see the BD versions 'ZULU' (Michael Caine) and \\"HOW THE WEST WAS WON\\" (ensemble cast). I gave the BD Transfers on these two movies 5 stars and so did all the other reviewers. I got what I PAID FOR!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun movie, annoying product","review":"I enjoyed the movie when I saw it in the theater. Sure it has some things that jarred me out of my engrossed stupor, but it was a good movie. The reason for the low rating is based on the product. I'm not even remotely interested in two extra disks of stuff I'll never watch. And there is no Star Trek blur ray single disk option listed anywhere I can find. I hope decision makers for producing these products read plenty of comments like this one. A cheaper single disk product is what some of us prefer."},{"rating":"1","title":"seriously think if you are a true fan of star trek","review":"I gambled and lost, just finished watching Star Trek. The other one star reviews are correct if you are a true fan of the originals this is no where near justice to Gene Roddenberry's mythos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible \\"Revision\\"","review":"This \\"Star Trek\\" movie (if you can call it Star Trek) and the last two that were made are the worst Star Trek movies ever. The Nokia product placement was shameful. And for those who think I'm too anal, would you have liked to have seen Anakin Skywalker walk on the screen with a Pepsi and a bucket of KFC? The worst part is that the main plot of the story (revenge for a lost love) is a complete rip off of the best Star Trek movie of all time \\"The Wrath of Khan\\". The disappointment and copout of the film is that the timeline is altered and yet we are suppose to believe that these characters will still serve together on the same ship and will be best friends forever! Ummm, not believable. Not only is the timeline altered by two premature deaths, but now there are black holes that alter the Star Trek universe for the worse! I seriously doubt that Gene Roddenberry would have been happy with this deterioration of his vision!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Plot","review":"I was looking forward to a great update of the Star Trek story, but was greatly disappointed in this film. While the special effects, the sets and most of the actors (except for Uhura and Scotty) were well-cast for their roles, the story line was horrible. A trite good vs. evil villan (named Nero, no less), and some really improbable things that would never happen in a Star Trek story (Spock would never jettison Kirk in a space pod and strand him on an ice planet - against Starfleet regulations), makes this a real bomb. I'm a big-time Trekker and was dismayed to find such a dumb plot wrapped up in such beautiful packaging. Glad I only rented it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Movie","review":"It's always nice when you get a movie that gives you action to keep you on the end of your seat, but this one has a plot that keeps you guessing where they are going with the outcome. I found this a really refreshing adventure with lots of emotion. I would suggest this movie to anyone, it breaks all the boundries, it has its moments of comedy, plenty of action, a love story of a sort and for the scifi fans you can't get more scifi then deep space action."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"We were not able to see this when it was out in the theaters, so we were counting on the bluray to be good. The picture was gorgeous and the movie is awesome. The movie was so well cast, and the writing was phenomenal- lots of great scifi and action with a great mix of humor. I LOVE that Leonard Nemoy is in the movie. Yes, I know it's sappy, but it actually brought tears to my eyes to see the \\"real\\" Spock. Definitely one you'll want to watch multiple times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible story offsets great cast","review":"What is it when J.J. Abrahms has a great cast he saddles them with a terrible script. He had Phillip Seymour Hoffman in Mission Impossible 3 and that movie was terrible and PSH's awesome acting couldn't save the film. It is the same thing with Star Trek. Let's never mind that it destroys Vulcan, something totally out of sync with everything else in Star Trek, but he makes the characters almost cartoonish in how they act.All of this great acting talent almost overcomes one of the worst scripts of the past five years but it fails because the script runs like a roller coaster from point to point and there is no point to any of it. Spock's father, a major figure in his own right, is like a fly on the wall. It is really just such a shame that all this talent was wasted and what could have been a great movie is very, very weak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Trek BR is awesome","review":"I was hoping that the blue ray disc would be able to live up to the very high standard that the movie had set in the theater,and I was not disappointed. The clarity and detail are even better than my 1080i could keep up with. I guess now I need to go out and buy a 3d 240 1080p to make sure I see all the detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"confronting feelings","review":"What can I say?, beyond the title of my review, for one side, this movie is just great, good perfomances, great special effects, solid plot (yes even if Kirk goes from cadet to captain in on hour, that kind of things happens in war) but in the other hand, JJ Abrams, has literally, destroyed 40 years of cannon (in the real universe) and 200 years of Star Trek universe, so, I only hope that the next movie will be number as it follows , Star Trek XII, and the things return to the right temporal line!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Trek","review":"How can you not love this movie. The characters were spot on and the plot was great. I can not wait for the new movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great take on Star Trek for the new generation","review":"I honestly haven't seen any of the original star trek movies with Kirk and Spok. I have seen quite a few of the next generation movies with Picard.

Excellent Job!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie - takes me back to the original TV show, but keeps me in the high tec, on the edge of your seat 21st century.","review":"This movie has great action scenes and for the reason I loved \\"The Next Generation\\" of Star Trek, it has a great story line. It brings back so many memories of the original TV Star Trek with Captain Kirk and his crew. They are all depicted very well in their younger state.Thoroughly enjoyed this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!!! A New and Fresh Interpretation","review":"I'm old enough to remember watching the original series before there was anything else Star Trek. And while I at least have respect and reverence for the old series and actors, I can nevertheless proclaim that this movie is an absolutely outstanding new interpretation of Star Trek for the 2000's. Maybe I was in the perfect mood and frame of mind when I watched this movie, but I loved it. It was action packed. It was stylistic in a fresh (like I've never seen that before) kind of way. It looked outstanding on my widescreen TV! For me, the reinvention of the old characters didn't seem forced or campy. It wasn't over the top ridiculous as many actions movies are these days. The plot was interesting and engaging. Overall, 5 STARS!!! The most entertaining Star Trek movie ever! I can't wait for a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie!","review":"The wife loves Star Trek and this one is no different. Love all the extras on this 3 disc edition.

Perfect actors were chosen to play well loved characters. Never thought they could pull off a \\"prequil\\" for Star Trek, but they did, and did it beyond my expectations! I Love this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Film","review":"Definitely one of the better, if not the best, Star Trek movies. Not a real in-depth, though provoking movie, but fun to watch. I can watch on my PC with PowerDVD, but it lags on AnyDVD. Still worth seeing, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly good","review":"I've never been much of a STAR TREK fan but it's not like I haven't tried. As a kid I watched the old series once in a while and also got to see the original first film in its initial theatrical release but was truly bored out of my mind. For whatever reason, this is a series that's never been too popular outside the US unlike, say, STAR WARS. That said, I had no intention of seeing this new film but word of mouth was just too good to ignore for which I'm glad as this is an exciting, non-stop action movie with great performances. I thought the new Spock was terrific, Zoe Saldaña absolutely gorgeous and it's hard to remmember any film in which a cameo by an old beloved figure has been so perfectly justified. The impecable special effects alone are worth the price of admission.Now, to my amazement, I'm seriously considering buying this DVD. I guess this proves it's never to late to become a Trekkie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio Sucks","review":"Ridiculous plot aside, my main gripe with this dvd is the boosted background audio. The dialog is almost entirely drowned out by explosions and \\"riveting\\" music; so much so that it's nearly impossible to follow the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"Are you kidding me?? Is this seriously the best that we can do with a classic franchise like Star Trek? The appetite that Americans have for this type of nonsense is depressing. And the idolization of youth represented by this movie and far too many others of late is repulsive. Raising children on a diet of Hannah Montana, iCarly, and Jonas Brothers, with a smartphone in their pocket in elementary school so they can check their Facebook page and tweet with their friends because \\"math is boring\\" is resulting in a generation of iKids who only worship themselves and mindlessly consume trash like this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst crap I have ever seen","review":"The plot makes no sense, it's just unlikeable characters badly acting between special effects. Nothing to do with anything that makes Star Trek great. Oh if only Roddenberry could've come up with the money to buy the rights in 1970 when Paramount offered it to him. At least he didn't live long enough to see this destruction of his life's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor script with poor editing","review":"I'm a long time fan of all the Star Trek series and movies and this one just didn't cut it. Too Manny impossible coincidences, flawed premise and script. Patched together scenes that flowed poorly and many seemed cartoonish. Had many good scenes and good actors but a failure overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"They've Ruined Star Trek!","review":"I can't believe Paramount let them do this to such a respected franchise. The original series, subsequent series, and movies stuck to the same themes. This is just a cartoon with people in it occasionally. There's hardly any acting or drama, just computer generated animation. They've sacrificed principle for profit. When they were writing it, they must have said, \\"Lets see how many special effects we can cram into two hours.\\"There are a few chuckles to be had, but overall I rate it one star and two thumbs down. If you can see if for free, it's OK, but I'm glad I didn't spend any money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's an interesting show, but it isn't Star Trek","review":"Sorry, but they took 43 years of history and erased it all. What they replaced it with was attractive but also one-dimensional and shallow. Star Wars was the show about action. Star Trek was the one about science and character interplay. All they did with this one was turn Star Trek into a Star Wars...and an inferior one at that. I'm giving it two stars because it was attractive and was something that maybe would have been OK as a different franchise. I took away the rest for abandoning so much history and turning something so iconic and significant into something so shallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pale reflection of the superb original series","review":"The producers had a chance to capture some of the magic of the original series but--alas--they missed the boat. The appearance of Leonard Nimoy is one of the few bright spots. Spock French-kissing Uhura is undoubtedly the film's nadir; that, and the discombobulated script with its unbridled excesses and the constant cops-and-robbers-style shootouts make this movie suitable for puerile audiences and, perhaps, video game lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action movie","review":"There is not a dull moment in this movie. This is a new view of Star Trek and the formation of the crew. Movie special effects are getting to point where everything is on a grand scale and believable. The old Star Trek had to get by with much less in special effects.Spock (Nemoy) is showing his age and he is the only original actor (I noticed) in the movie. The Star Trek story is still good entertainment and predictable. The crew faces impossible odds and internal conflict to overcome an adversary. The extras get killed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital Copy Rip-Off","review":"I paid for a digital copy of this movie. The digital copy code wasn't working so I contacted Paramount at the URL given by iTunes. I just received a reply from Paramount:Thank you for your interest in Paramount Digital Copy, but unfortunately that feature offering is no longer available for Star Trek.What a rip-off. I hate paying for something and then not being able to access it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bold","review":"This is the best Star Trek movie I've seen in a long time. The actors stayed true to the roots of the original characters while still adding some new twists. The screenwriters/director deserve major props for re-booting this franchise.The plot keeps moving along and you're not bored for an instant. Plus, the original Spock makes a cameo. I think Trek and non-Trek fans will enjoy this simply because it's an entertaining movie. I hope they make another."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great reset for Star Trek","review":"The original Star Trek starts over. They did a good job of (re)introducing the characters, and developing a story that was fun to watch. A must see for any Star Trek fan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on, from cadet to starship captain in one hour???","review":"The plot is absurd. The only thing that saves this movie from a one star rating is all of the visual eye candy. Why do people think they need to take a good thing and re-write it? I'm all for a good re-make -- as long as it stays true to the story line and franchise. Come on people, how ridiculous is it for Kirk to go from cadet to captain in 60 minutes? I hope these people NEVER get to meddle with Star Trek again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is absolute garbage...nothing like original Star Trek","review":"If you are a REAL Star Trek fan you know this movie SUCKS. This so called Star Trek movie was directed by someone who loves Star Wars. I noticed this movie tries to be like it with scenes similar to Star Wars. This movie was also made for people who are not Star Trek fans. Its pathetic how all the crew members are roughly the same age in this garbage and it makes no sense at all how they all got together. Nothing but annoying cheesy actors playing the role of the real actors I grew up to know and love. And man that spock looks like a big sissy. Star Trek is being ruined by dumb idiots. Gene must be rolling in his grave because of this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOO! HISSSSSSSS!","review":"What a joke, & a disgrace. DO NOT BUY!!

My bad for not opening it sooner, but now Amazon does not have any of these left to replace it and I'm left with a ship without an engine. Poor quality control here folks!!

Maybe I'll rent it, just to give it another look."},{"rating":"1","title":"We've Been Backstabbed!","review":"OK, I'm a Trekkie from way back. In this film, which is a prologue to everything that's gone on in Star Trek, the romulans go back and wipe out Vulcan and thereby most of the Vulcan race. What kind of a moron would write such a script? What kind of a director would direct such a script? Perhaps the most pathetic of all were all the Trekkies coming out of the movie, grinning from ear to ear, giving a thumbs up to the movie. These particular Trekkies, if you were to put on a movie starring vegetables as the Star Trek crew, with the cucumber having pointed ears pasted on it, they would come out of the movie saying it was a great movie.

The story was not Star Trek, not sure what is was. The Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry is turning over in his grave.The Star Trek genre is not there. Scotty is also turning over in his grave, they made him look like a buffoon. Uhura was Spock' slut. Sulu and Chekov where a joke. I recommend that you wait till it is shown on HBO or Show time. Don't wast you money. Who would think that red paint could cause time travel or Vulcan destruction.They even cut out Winona's entire screen time. DVD sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the regular DVD disc?","review":"Boy, just when I thought I knew how to tell one version from another, Amazon threw me a curve on this one. You'd think that having a THREE! disc set you would end up with a regular DVD copy for the other non-Blu-Ray players in the house. Not with this one. One Blu-Ray and two crap extra junk discs. I'm mad at myself for not reading closely enough but the advertising on new movies is not as straight-forward as it should be.

I think it is a proper way to reboot a TV/Movie franchise that has appealed to people for over 40 years. Amazon unbox is a great service and I highly endorse, almost all my video comes from unbox."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live long and Prosper","review":"Great film! It's, in my opinion, a little better than the original movies. This is because it explains a little more like where Kirk and Spock are from and how they got into Starfleet. The other films just don't seem to do that. It also let's us see the relationships that we're so used to start to form. The film also explains what happened to Captain Pike in a way that the show didn't. I mean with the show, we know what happens with Pike, but it's never really explained. The film also explains how and why Kirk becomes captain of the Enterprise. I would recommend this film to anyone. You don't need to be a Star Trek fan or know anything about Star Trek to enjoy this film, but once you see it you'll be hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly quite good","review":"As a long-time Star Trek fan, loving the original series, liking the Next Generation, Voyager, and Enterprise, and completely overlooking DS9, I was very skeptical about an original series re-make. I must say, though, that this film did not disappoint. The casting for this update was truly great, and in true original series fashion, the interaction between the characters makes the movie. As for the plot, again, the long-time Star Trek fan will not be disappointed. The writing staff gives nod to the original series but frames the new story in such a way that the new adventures do not clash with the original story. This is not the typical \\"old series makeover\\" that has become so popular in recent times. A definite good addition to any Trekkie's collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fun movie","review":"very nice adrenalin producing escape movie, it tried to show how the Star Trek crew origionaly united and achieved their first joint victory and I think it did quite well at this"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Product","review":"I am very sorry that I didn't open the product right away to watch it.

The rest of the cast did a good, workman like job.In general, the plot was interesting. However, it was presented in a contrived fashion. The insertion of \\"the past\\" often seemed like commercial breaks to an otherwise good story.So, I found it watchable, mildly interesting; but, I can't ever see myself watching it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone needs to time travel and write this movie out of existence","review":"I tried to give this movie an honest shot.

I was already gaping when when the Enterprise arrived and flew through the wreckage of the fleet.

Rather this film is a reflection of todays \\"pop-culture\\" as dumbed down as ever. Not too much thought was put into this movie as it followed a very simple and common formula for films today. Take a known brand \\"Start Trek\\" subtract all of the complex and intriguing script writing, add copious special effects, add a good measure of sexual scenes and then reduce the dialogue until it sounds as dumbed down as common modern American vernacular. Now blitz the media with as much hype and pomp as you can possibly conjure up. Serve while still warm to pop-culture drones and unsuspecting loyalists to a now exploited brand. Net result, make a few bucks with mixed reviews and move on to the next \\"horror\\" film... Your fellow nepotists at your local film factory will be satisfied regardless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"The movie is outstanding, one of the best of the year.

This IS demo material!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Trek","review":"I enjoyed the movie in the theatre and couldn't wait for it to show up on DVD. I ordered it pre-release so that I would have it the day of release. I am sorely disappointed in the DVD I received from Amazon. It will not play on my laptop because the code on the DVD is NOT Region 1 (US and Canada). It was supposed to be widescreen and it is letterbox to the point of almost being unable to watch because it is so small. I measured the letterbox on my 37\\" LG HDTV and it was only 10 inches tall!

What I expected was a good prequel--an origin story with the original crew; done in the manner of \\"Batman Begins\\"--one of the best Batman origin stories ever. Wow, was I disappointed! The movie is NOT Star Trek in any way, shape, or form. Why destroy the Star Trek universe? Gene Roddenberry must be turning over in his grave. Save your money; don't buy the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"New TimeLine - New stories - Great Idea","review":"The writing for this movie was by far the best I have ever experienced for a Star Trek Movie. Although, I have enjoyed all of Star Trek. Period.Star Trek is notorious for changing timelines - Tasha - dead, alive, returned to earth per birth. So come on. Time is always relative.Spock did everything he could to ensure he and Kirc became the friends they were meant to be. McCoy's character was by far, in my opinion the best, too.Anyway, the long/short. We know the entire history now of Kirc, Spock and McCoy, but now we can relive it anew/fresh with the slate completely clean. I think it was a great idea. As old fans we can experience our favorite (I'm an old guy) characters all over again without saying - wait the Romulans didn't do that - well, now the writers are free to explore strange new worlds and new civilizations and boldly go where the crew has never gone before....Can't wait for the next movie with the same actors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Bad DVD","review":"I really liked this movie when I saw it in the theater. So I pre-ordered it. Nice price ($9.99). Howver, the quality of the DVD is horrible. It looks like it was recorded by an amateur, with glaring reflections almost obliterating some scenes. Extremely disappointing! I would have prefered to pay more and have a good quality DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Trek","review":"Being a die-hard TOS fan, I found the movie to be mildly diverting. However AQ & PQ are so outstanding that it almost made up for the rather over-the-top Nero characterization that, had it been played straight, might have actually brought the movie up a couple of notches. Fun to watch, even if the storyline is confused and illogical (sic)- and Simon Pegg as Scotty is pure delight."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-See From '09","review":"You must see this flick.

This movie is ok. It's kind of fun to see how the crew came together but the plot has a lot of holes in it (I'm sure others will take the time to sit around and list them...). The Spock character was really the only one with any depth. The movie is amusing so long as you don't think too much about it. If you're not already a ST fan then you'll probably not think much of this movie (and rightly so) but, if you are, then you'll probably like it. Despite the gaping flaws, however, I did enjoy the movie.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"StarTrek","review":"Just what can you say \\" To boldly go where no man has gone before\\" waiting on the next one coming out in 2013 this is the year for STAR TREK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Trek","review":"Excellent movie-captivating because it had a few important differences between it and the original movie.

I wasn't looking forward to another Star Trek movie after the last few. Boy am I glad my son wanted to see it.Other than a few distractions such as Spock always looking like he was smirking this movie left me wanting MORE. After enough time to get used to the characters, even Spock about to bust into a smile was ok ;)The story is a good one on the whole. Just don't get distracted at some key points and you can follow the plot without having to rewind it to figure out what you missed lol.I am a big fan of the original series and TNG, and a few of the movies.

It was our first (and so far, only) streaming video rental from Amazon. We have a 10mbs FIOS connection so we should have been able to stream the HD version of this movie (which we paid extra for). However, the stream rebuffered and we had to watch in lower quality. My advice, stick with Netflix.

The demo game was a waste of time not worth playing. Acting was excellent and the story kept pace and didn't get boring. Tyler perry was an admiral in this movie and he made me wanna puke but he only had about 5 minutes in the film so it wasn't too bad; at least they didnt give him a starring role elese i wouldn't have bothered to buy the film. Overall the director did an excellent job on the movie and I'm waiting for star trek 2 (hopefully Tyler Perry won't be in another star trek movie)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good prequel","review":"I thought this was a pretty good movie. Some parts seemed kind of silly but other than that it is full of action and it was cool to see the characters come together.

And I've been watching it on tv and in the movies ever since.It would be impossible for the casting to get any better.The story is great. While treating the old Trek with the greatest respect it provides itself with a future without restraint. This may (and reading some of these reviews it apparently does) set some of the more orthodox Trekies on an Inquisition, but if you're not actually into holding services you'll probably love it.I'm looking forward to (hoping for) more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame Re-boot","review":"What a load of krap! This isn't Star Trek, boldly going - it's lame frat boy getting drunk, bar fight, skirt chasing. You want that, go get a copy of <any> of the American Pie movies ( and those were better done too ! ) I feel sorry for Leonard Nimoy & Zachary Quinto, the only people in this trainwreck that were worth actually paying attention to as actors. Have to agree with previous reviewers how much this ripped-off Star Wars, if the director focused more on what Star Trek is about vs. what woould be the next \\"action shot\\" this would be a totally differnt kind of movie and one worth rating more starts to recommend its purchase.Sure hope Paramount dumps this director / writer and fires whoever came up with this kind of a re-boot. It's just as stupid as the one done for Superman Returns, and probably forever drive away the fan base to ever consider going to see another of the franchise releases again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't Hollywood shoot in Hi Def?","review":"I Purchased the BlueRay version and basically it was shot in Widescreen Mode using 2/3's of my 55\\" Samsung LED LCD TV making it look like crap.

JJ Abrams is also a Star Wars fan as opposed to a Star Trek fan. Star Wars is futuristic fantasy. Star Trek is harder sci-fi. Hence JJ Abrams did not stay true to the Star Trek franchise & made a JJ Abrams movie with Star Trek characters. No Respect for the Star Trek fan base. No respect for the original body of work that Gene Rodenberry created.Spock is sexually active and in a relationship with a former student- not a Vulcan thing. The time line story isn't very good. The screenplay has an air of being written by 3 people- a Star Wars fan, a Teletubbie script writer, and a Lifetime Network Man-hater Movie of the Week.I lost respect for Leonard Nimoy on this one- the things actors will do for a paycheck. I'd rather see Spock team up with Ron Jeremy for Skin Trek. I get more enjoyment watching Priceline commercials with William Shatner; I find them more sincere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Storyline Garbage","review":"I 100% agree, this movie was garbage and I am glad that I did not buy it. This movie was nothing like star trek. The writers came up with their own version of star trek that is as much like star trek as cat is to a a dog. The plot and storyline of this movie was laughable at best. They should have named it something else but not star trek. Here's one little example: kirk is put in charge of the ship's bridge and in a few short minutes goes from being a recruit to being the captain of a ship. That is absurd as captains get to be in their position after many years of military experience at a minimum of ten to twelve years on the low side. That is just a small example."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"Ever since this came out, I've been interested in the old Star Treks.

This movie is phenomenal in every distinctive way. I couldn't believe how well thought out and put together this film was. A masterpiece. The new characters resemble the old characters and revive their distinctive roles again while adding a more realistic and plausible sense of human nature that is what make us human beings in the first place.

Saw it in the theater and have watched it 2-3x since buying this DVD. Very well-acted, well put together, fresh plot, tons of action and excitement, lots of dry humor from Bones -- just an overall great film.

But this movie just dragged on and on.Like the Star Wars prequels, the most fun is just identifying characters and drawing connections to the Original Series characters and events we know and love. On its own, though, it's just not much of a story.What the movie lacks is heart. The surface plot doesn't suffice. The only character that makes any sense is the bad guy who's flying some big ship that looks like what the Babylon 5 shadows would fly if they had giant battle cruisers.Look, if you're going to mash up Star Trek, at least make it fun! Give us something to sink our teeth into. This cotton candy grows stale a good hour before final credits.Side note: Zachary Quinto did a pretty good job at capturing Spock's body language, but the voice was all Syler. That was distracting. I kept expecting him to point his finger at someone's forehead and...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Effects. Poor Story.","review":"Undeniably, great special effects. Unfortunately not sufficient to make a good movie. The story line is poor, linear, and barely compares to the Star Trek universe. This version is more like space cowboys. I am a The Next Generation fan. In TNG, Captain Picard is constantly faced with situations that require a discerning and strategic approach, combining smarts, negotiation, creativity, tactical maneuvers, not just the boring \\"let's blow them up with a bunch of proton torpidos\\". Zachari Quinto (Spock) is the only excellent actor in this mascarade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate it","review":"This is one of the best bad movies that you'll ever see.As a stand alone movie it has everything that would make a winner. The actors were good, the story was well told and the look of the movie is spectacular.As part of the Star Trek franchise, it is a disaster. Destroying the planet Vulcan? Making one of the founding members of the Federation an endangered species?NO- the producer over-reached and created something that can't stand beside the existing body of work.J.J. Abrams is great but in this case he screwed the pooch. He re-wrote history and undermined a near-sacred franchise in a way that in completely untenable. You simply CAN NOT do that with a shared treasure like Star Trek with generations of fans that know the story and trivia much better than the bleeding idiots who OKed production of this wretched script.He should have known better.Pretend that it never happened and maybe it will go away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even if you're not a fan...","review":"I've never really liked Star Trek, and never really got the allure. I'm a Star Wars fan, of course. However, I heard really good things about the movie, and my wife had been on a \\"Next Generation\\" kick at the time (it comes on every Monday afternoon), so I figured, what the heck, it's been so long since the last movie anyway.This is now one of my favorite sci-fi movies. It wasn't campy and corny like the original series, the acting was great, and of course there are enough references to the old show for the true fan. I'll be buying this movie as soon as it comes out. You should too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Trek","review":"Fast service from the time I ordered the movie untill I recieved it.

Let's hope he will have grown up in time for the next sequel and manages to exhibit some of the dignity that Captain Pike conveyed with an elegance so lacking in Kirk.And Spock, it is neither fair, nor logical, I might add, to deny a star cadet of a deserving position and affect the trajectory of her StarFleet career simply to avoid the appearance of favoritism on your part.Why does the Romulan spaceship -- from the future -- resemble an ugly spare parts warehouse in its interior?Sufficiently entertaining otherwise, worth a watch for its quick pace, visuals, story, humor and overall \\"prettiness\\" factor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lens flares and crappy sets + wasted potential","review":"While the movie had a lot of cool CGI, the sets and locations were pathetic. A brewery with computer desks lined up by the vats? I admit it was hard to see with the flares though. The actors did a fair job but the plot was unsophisticated and clumsy. Adding stupid twists to the well established Star Trek universe added up to a parody. This is not an acceptable work to add to the original vision. This is a low rent version that has none of the class of other Star Trek movies. It's really a shame this movie was made."},{"rating":"1","title":"For a Friend","review":"David loved this movie in addition to his other Startrek movies.

The villian from the future changing the past allows for variance from the Star Trek mythology that so many know so well. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto do an excellent job as Kirk and Spock.

Gene Rodenberry would have loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Trek (2009) DVD review","review":"First off, I'm a Star Trek fan!

As in STAR WARS, however, there's always a bigger fish, and one eats the smaller one and pursues Kirk to the only cave on the entire planet with Spock in it. It seems that no one hesitates these days to abuse the willing suspension of disbelief.The new movie has some great and not so great casting. Still, someone who is familiar with STAR TREK should have done the movies. It wasn't an issue of how close they could make it to the older series, but how much different.They should have called it SPACE DEBRIS, or better, GALAXY QUEST, PART II."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"This reboot of the Star Trek movie series is wonderful.

They justified all the completely wrong things in the movie to an alternate reality/time line. As if having one character say that justifies completely rewriting the \\"history\\" of Star Trek. I was not able to get connected to any of the characters. It just went on an on. Chekov didn't even show up till later in the original series. He was much younger than the rest of the characters. Did they just add him for the comic relief of his ridiculous Russian accent? Wictor, Wictor - gag! And the chase scene where a very young Kirk is racing his step dad's car is just stupid. JJ Abrams should be embarrassed. Not worth the time spent watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"looking for info on the 2 disc SPECIAL EDITION not the movie","review":"I'm looking for information about the 2 disc set Special Edition set but instead i find nothing but kudo's on the movie itself so guess i'll look somewhere else to buy since you could care less about giving potential buyers the info they need to make a decision on which to buy, if any.oh & for those who are interested; neither Scotty,Sulu,Ohura,or Chekov delivered in their performances of course that's partially the fault of the writers; Sulu had a chance but didn't deliver,Uhura was never a loose woman,& the actor who played Scotty was never close to capturing the essence of his character.

I tied knots in the tubing to keep it from pulling back through the handle and continued using it. A couple of weeks later the other end of the tubing broke. I tied knots in that end too.

Once the handles broke off I do still actually use the bands themselves for the workouts, not near as comfortable...but still has decent resistance.

Many of the recipes contain age-inappropriate ingredients, and the most important thing seems to be that the recipes appeal to the adult palate rather than meet the child's needs. According to the book, the author became interested in writing a baby food book before she had children and when she was working in a completely unrelated field - sounds a bit suspicious to me. Perhaps she just thought it would be fun and didn't take the time to do the proper research. Choose one of many other excellent baby food books rather than wasting your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"This book sounds great from the title, but when you read it you find that you don't learn anything you didn't already know.

Then I was touched when I met the cast of characters aboard his junk boat. The owner's wife treated the American engineer with much love, when no one else really did. This eased his homesickness. The others, such as Big Pebble, and the owner, Old Big, were mysterious characters. This book, lathough I had been to China before, helped me understand Chinese culture better.

There are 18 chapters in these 57 pages, often 2 pages in the book contain only one page of writing. The whole book reads like it was written as a college project last minute.

For a newbie Placebo fan, this book gives you the 101 on everything that you need to know about Brian Molko, for others who are more \\"seasoned\\" fans, can find that some information you may already know, but it's how it's presented and the way everything is put into one \\"compact\\" easy guide that makes all the difference. Why spend ages trying to find out everything on various internet sites or fishing through articles if everything is put together in one book? You get the complete package, the bio, the complete discography of albums and singles, and even a section of famous quotes. Sure, the book isn't as lengthy as other biographies on other rockstars may be, but it's still one wild journey to tread into Molkoland for a day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting....","review":"I'm a recent Placebo fan so I found this book very interesting in displaying the information surrounding the band's lead singer. I found the book to be rather coherent. I also liked the section with the Cult Molko Quotes because they were really funny. I recomend the book, especially if you're a fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try cloth/cotton training pants instead","review":"I got these for my daughter when she was about 20 months old. I had been putting her in the potty for a while and she was kind of potty trained for the big job but not for the small one. I got this thinking this would do the trick.... it would make her feel wet and she would tell me. So far that hasn't happened. Maybe this doesnt feel as dry as an ordinary diaper but it still a diaper... she doesn't feel wet and it hasnt helped with potty training at all.

My four year old was using a soft bat, nothing that should have caused that kind of damage. We had to duct tape it together in order to continue playing. The bases are nothing more than a lightweight piece of foam. Not worth the money! Needless to say, we were extremely disappointed in this product and promptly returned it. Do not waste your time and money on this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be 1/2 star only","review":"I would rate this product at less than one star. I was highly disappointed in this product. The bat that comes with it is large and clumsy not suited for small hands. The Tee does not attach to the stand very well and once you get it to stay a three year old can break it and make it non functional. You would be better off purchasing a small Tee ball bat and ball and making a stand from PVC pipe."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Hit...","review":"Should have read the reviews before buying it, but the price was pretty good and loved the fact that you can easily remove the stand from the base, BUT, the first time my 6-year old hit the stand instead of the ball, the stand broke off the base!

Received another identical model with bases for a B-day present two years later, and I though they had to fix the design flaw???? In about four hits my four year old broke the stem off in the same fashion as before, which I attribute to the plastic threads not being long enough. In addition, the included base were made of such of a light material they blew around the yard in a 7MPH wind. Taking this overpriced garbage back to the store, will never purchase another set with the same stem design.

I wish I could say the same for the BBC series. For one, the musical score is either absent or irritating. So much of what is compeling in the book goes on inside of the Characters. How about voice-overs or something else (music?)? Let the audience in on the torment and conflict of Raskolnikov (the main character) and interplay of the characters that is so powerful in the book. What I saw was an acceptable theatrical production on film. I've written much more but it's unfortunately been truncated. Simply read the book instead or view this and know that this pales before the book. This is a dreary protrayal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the Worst","review":"The acting is awful, the scenery offers nothing and it drags and drags so that I wound up just shutting it down and preparing it for an EBay sale.

John Hurt is a little older than is ideal for the role of the student Raskolnikov, but otherwise is a fantastic choice for the part. The story is absorbing and thought-provoking, and, at least in the marvelous scene in which Raskolnikov taunts a police inspector --- funny!Crime and Punishment was preceded by an adaptation of Dostoevsky's The Possessed. I hope that will become available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Pictures!","review":"Why, oh why do you advertise the 1979 version of Crime & Punishment with John Hurt, using the pictures from the 2002 version starring the sublime John Simm. I would download the 2002 version all day, everyday but the misleading pictures are really unfair. Either offer me the version I want, or get the pictures right!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The roots run deep.","review":"This book was not very enjoyable even though I tried to like it. I am interested in Nazism as well as the occult, so I thought this would be a no-brainer purchase. Wrong. The information within the book is boring and tedious. The author informs us of various \\"mystics\\" who may or may not have had influence on basic Nazi ideology, but he fails to delve deep into the actual description of these beliefs and their correlation to National Socialist policy. The book could have been something if concrete examples of these ideologies were given (e.g. excerpts from Ostara)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Angelina really strutting her stuff","review":"If you're a fan of Ms. Jolie, buy this and enjoy her in it. She plays a 20 year old vamp who seduces Danny Aiello in a flagrant, delicious way that only Angelina could. If you don't feel a sudden intake of breath when she struts into the diner early in the movie, then you need to switch back to Regis and Kelly. Angelina's not a major character, but she's on screen enough for me to feel fine about my mini-buck investment. The movie itself is a bizarre little noir that has it's moments (decent acting, OK script, good desert atmosphere) and its non-moments (uneven directing, plot holes), but not bad. The movie rates a 3, Angelina rates a 5, you do the math."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wet Noodle...","review":"This movie drove me crazy it was so bad. I literally wanted to bleach my eyeballs out after sitting through it. The best part of this movie was Angelina Jolie - end of story. She steals the screen in anything she does, but even she couldn't save this steaming piece of crap. The plot is inexorably stupid. I guess if you're a diehard AJ fan and feel like seeing some of her earlier work, you might only be slightly homicidal after seeing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huzzah for Angelina Jolie!","review":"I rented this movie for the sheer fact that Angelina Jolie was in it. THIS MOVIE SUCKS. I'm sorry for the vulgarity or bluntness of the comment, but that is my opinion, which is the encompassing purpose of these reviews. The movie was a terrible attempt at hitting into the challenging action/comedy genre, a feat only acheived by some, and mostly entirely missed by others. Now is when the reader may ask, why then does the reviewer give it TWO stars? Why not one? Why review at all? The answer to this can be explained in two words, which then, through the transitive property in mathematics, would be the basic equivalent to two stars: Angelina Jolie. The 15 minute scene stealer stole the whole movie. Though this is most likely one of the worst movies in her career, she brightened the dim mark with her natural acting and raw ability to master the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you love Angelina? or not?","review":"I absolutely love Angelina Jolie, so of course I will sit and watch anything if it means looking at her for two hours. I own this video and I do watch it, but not because its a great film. If you are looking to find a Good movie to watch then keep looking. If you are an Anjelina fan, then you probably allready own it anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad story","review":"I bought this movie cause I'm a big fan of Angelina and it had to be part of my collection, but the truth is that if you're not such a fan of her you'll be wasting your time. The movie it's pretty bad, it doesnt make much scence. The performances are not that bad, but the story its bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be good, but unfortunately isn't","review":"This film is one of those films that you watch and continue hoping to the last minute that it will get good, because throughout the film there are good moments, but in the end it is sadly, a flop. Danny Aiello is a good actor, so he makes his scenes believable,as does ann archer, but Angelina Jolie seems to be reading the lines right out of a script. A big flaw in this film is that throughout the movie it appears as if the characters are insane and crazy, only in the last few scenes all characters seem to suddenly turn boring and normal. This movie is not to be recommended. However if you do like this film or if you like the sort of mystical style, I recommend \\"Arizona Dream\\" which has similar qualities and in my opinion, is very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad copy","review":"I like this movie but this one I bought is bad.

Written just for him, primarily by her, from you know who's viewpoint. No variation in tone, each story reads like the one you just finished, assuming you forced yourself to read more than two paragraphs. Few writers successfully pull of writing a book of erotic stories, certainly not the ones who attempted His. A male reader's time would be better spent reading, or re-reading, the classics of the genre -- The Pearl, My Secret Life, A Man with a Maid, My Life and Loves (Frank Harris). And anything by Anais Nin (Delta of Venus, Little Birds). Opus Pistorum (aka Under the Roofs of Paris) by Henry Miller is about as hot, and off track, as male fiction gets. His -- 30 Erotic Stories -- is as short on imagination as heat. Look elsewhere if you're into erotica, or think you might be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Guys typically don't like to read erotic books. I do like the Anne Rice Sleeping beauty book but that's a bit different. The stories are pretty much the same for each one. They mainly talk about having sex with strangers in a way that would never happen. Sure it's fantasy but make it somewhat believable. You want to impress your man?

Without the romance which is the key to his movies, this one falls completely flat. All of the characters seem to be reading their lines off of cue cards. Ther performances are really that stiff.

You'd think that a comedy without laughs would at least have something to look at, or a story. But no. There's nothing here. Okay, Adam Sandler has some charisma and John Tuturro does a good job.

I figured since Adam Sandler was in it, it would be pretty funny. Now, there were some funny parts but the movie itself was awful. I'm not sure what was missing.. a plot maybe but the movie was terrible. If you want to see it, rent it.. don't buy it. If I could give it 0 stars I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"An off-film for Sandler","review":"This film looked promising in the ads, and since I am such a huge Sandler fan, I had to rent it. The film tries to be sentimental while retaining its lowbrow credibility; it fails. Plus even if it were pulled off, who wants to see an Adam Sandler movie with motional stuff? Not me. The film is very loosely based on \\"Mr. Deeds Goes to Town,\\" the Frank Capra classic. I haven't seen that one, but looking at this film, one wonders what the point was in re-making it. Terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply a bad movie.","review":"Mr. Deeds is, quite simply, an awful movie. Sandler has done some funny stuff in his career and some really bad stuff in his career. This movie is near the top of the 'bad stuff' list. It's no secret that Sandler is not an actor so because of that, I would expect a very funny script to help make up for that fact. There is hardly anything funny in the movie. Even his high-powered co-stars can't save this one. I wouldn't recommend anyone rent this movie, let alone pay money to own it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Would YOU do for a Klondike bar?","review":"Some people will do anything. Apparently, Adam Sandler hit his creative peak during his mid-twenties. Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore and The Waterboy were passable comedies. But, Mr. Deeds is just an embarrassment. The movie is just not funny, flat out. The only scene that I even snickered at was when Deeds and Johnny Mac are drunk and tearing up Manhattan, and I was only laughing because it reminded me of the Sandler of old in Billy Madison. Sandler as a total goofball can be admittedly funny but it seems that he is trying hard to become a \\"diversified\\" actor (see Punch Drunk Love). To make matters worse, Wynonna Ryder couldn't act her way out of a bag either, so you can pick your poison. She's so bad that you want to reach through the screen and place duct tape over her mouth. Anyway, avoid this film at all costs even on cable or free tv, it's such a waste of time. For Shame, Adam Sandler, For Shame...NOT RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"1","title":"Move on.","review":"Originally a movie made in 1936 about a Tuba Player from Vermont who went to the big city. It later became a television show in 1969 till 1970... and then in 2002 it was turned into a travesty by the worlds worst comedian Adam Sandler. Honestly, I used to like Adam Sandler... but after like 5 of his movies, that are all basically the same thing \\"Adam doesn't have money.\\" \\"Adam needs money.\\" \\"Adam gets money.\\" \\"Adam is a good guy.\\" \\"Hooray for Adam.\\" - I wasn't sold on \\"Mr. Deeds.\\" I felt bad for John Turturro. This movie was CLEARLY below him. Supporting actor to Adam Sandler?!? John Turturro was by far the funniest part of the movie. Adam Sandler was still doing the same tired, played out comedy. Move on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny!!!","review":"Adam Sandler does another awesome and hilarious job as Longfellow Deeds. Deeds owns a pizza place and writes greeting cards in a small town. He soon inherits 40 billion dollars from his dead uncle. A reporter named Babe Bennett tries to get close to him to get a story. She soon finds out that he is a really sweet guy and doesn't want to continue doing her story because her boss takes her camera and alters Deeds to look like a bad guy, and she feels really bad about it. When he finds out, he gets rid of his money and moves back to his town. He also finds out that the company is about to be sold, so he appears at a shareholders meeting ands tries to stop it. I also like the character, Emilio Lopez because he just appears out of nowhere. I highly recommend MR. DEEDS!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I care not for Adam Sandler but....","review":"This movie had me laughing from end to beginning!

First big mistake. Sandler is as winning a protagonist as Weird Al would be in \\"It's a Wonderful Life.\\" He's no Gary Cooper. I wonder if he even watched the original.And no, Winona is no Jean Arthur.The original depression-era rags-to-riches classic is here reduced to an annoying \\"I'll show you\\" vehicle to make Sandler's fans cheer but the rest of us to ask, \\"What were they thinking?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I cant get into this one","review":"I usualy like Adam Sandlers movies, but with this one i just couldnt get into it. It just came off to me as a re-written, (in a diffrent way) version of Sandlers earlier movies. I didnt think this movie was very funny at all, and it was the same thing I have seen Adam play for years, a guy who has a heart of gold, yet this voilent side to him aswell, who finds a girl, struggles to get, then keep the girl, and then do somthing nice and get the girl in the end....sorry, i know alot of people here are saying this is a good movie.... but i feel i've seen it before! and was a bit too predictable IMO... apart from GOING OVERBOARD, this is about the only Adam Sandler flick i couldnt grasp."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a Snore","review":"Sandler's movies are hit and miss, and this was definately a miss(although not as deplorable as Happy Gilmore or Little Nicki). Sandler plays his simpleton roll by walking around as if he's half asleep and completely disinterested in everything around him. Winona Ryder's performance is actually painful to watch and you have a sense through the entire movie that SOMEONE, ANYONE else would have been better in the part. The only redeeming performance comes from John Turturro who plays the butler with the odd foot fetish with character and charm. Don't even waste a rental fee on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't get too far","review":"To be fair, I am not an Adam Sandler fan anyway, but my kids wanted to watch this.

I couldn't even muster a smile during this piece of junk. Bad, bad, bad. Adam Sandler is always terrible but this is off the deep end of Sandler terribleness.

My 16 year old told me before I watched this film that it had a \\"message\\" and didn't have same amount of comedy he was used to watching. He then proceeded to watch \\"Billy Madison\\" for the umpteenth time mouthing most of the jokes as they happened. This isn't going to happen with Mr. Deeds, nor will it be a classic one to watch over and over.While I felt the movie had some entertainment value, it is definitely one to rent and not one to watch again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Sandler, you'll love Mr. Deeds","review":"Mr. Deeds is a very good remake of the movie Mr. Deeds goes to Washington.

It made me laugh. It was clean enough for my children to see with me. It was sweet but not syrupy. And it was classic Adam Sandler. I've seen the classic Mr. Deeds movie and while it tickled the funny bone, it was not as funny as Sandler's version. This movie rates second only to Wedding Singer in Sandler's long list of hits, in my view. The butler was great. Ryder was OK, occasionally funny in her own right. And there was, of course, the regular cast of crazies that always brighten up the screen in any good Sandler flick. See this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Phony and cheesy","review":"I was honestly confused during this movie. A typical Adam Sandler movie is filled with gross humor, and not so nice people. This movie was totally the opposite, but it wasn't good. The actors were fake, predictable, and the plot was very weak. I'm not sure if Adam meant to play his character in a phony, cheesy way, or if he didn't know how to play a nice, regular person. I think that he should stick to his normal roles. I wouldn't suggest you see this movie because it's not very good quality, and you'll want to turn on another movie right after, due to the lack of entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb and dumber","review":"Great way to put yourself to sleep.

I like the story, and I particularly like the Deeds character, I wish there were more people in the world like him.

When you didn't hear the best entertainer of europe, you miss definitely one of the greatest singer.The album has songs for everyone. Just to dance and enjoy or for the silence moments in your life. Wonderful lyric, a great band and a great singer. You have to hear him and you will be catched by him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Americans Should start to get him now","review":"Rob's voice has finally come of age in this collection of songs. He is a delight to listen to as an alternative to all the scatchy voiced male alternative rock/pop singers. His voice is liquid gold and Americans should start to get him now! A good recommendation if you love his voice, is his \\"Swing when you're Winning\\" CD. He is not the most handsome man (despite what the song says!) but has charisma and stage presence, coupled with his voice that make him a very sexy entertainer. I am one American woman in Los Angeles who WILL travel to whatever state in the US he finally decides to do a concert in, and probably sit front row! And I will drag all my girlfriends who I have turned on to Rob too. Just name the state!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Will he finally make it here?","review":"He's a mega star all over the globe, 5 years strong; but in our little world he's Robbie who? Will he make it here this time? Chances are NO! I bought the Euro version months ago and love it. Even thou his US label changed the org. tracks (for the better I think) the Radio Gods (programmers) still wont give him a chance. Keep up the hip hop,rap and the same tired rock. I for one know better. If your a fan of RW obtain both versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"ESCAPE TO HIS WORLD!","review":"This is Robbie William's most ambitious and cohesive release to date. No wonder he has been signed to one of the biggest deals in UK history! He covers lots of subjects.....fame, love, society, etc....he is in fine voice....emotional at one point and full of grit on another.....lots of great band work also...lots of funky beats, fast rockers....a pleasant release for anyone who likes great music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Effort by a Great Singer","review":"Robbie Williams is a showman, he puts on a great show, and his two previous albums were great music. This album doesnthave a song that radio or the public will like. Sexed Up is embrassing and im not sure what hes trying to say. Feel is a songthat I guess Robbie thought would get huge airplay and become the hit that will break him into the USA market. It wont! The album is a mixture of fast and slow songs, it will not win him any newfans and might end up losing him some."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahh, the beautiful disposable pop","review":"I wonder if anyone is lacking in irony enough to accuse Robbie Williams of being ear candy... or lame enough to accuse people of accusing him of being ear candy. Either way, this album is inconsistently wonderful, and even the low points are fun. When I say low points, I just mean indistinct. His voice is a wonderfully predictable mix of alternative and R & B, and the production is perfectly clean and sterile. You just want to sing along to everything and not feel any shame... except for that \\"monkey\\" song, which has too many words to remember. There is plenty of wit (\\"Handsome Man\\"), as there is plenty of lame (\\"Handsome Man\\"). You'll play it constantly for a month, then get sick of it. Then remember it 4 months later. Give it a spin in your car with your arty Velvet Underground fan friends (if you know any), see them squirm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utter Brilliance!","review":"Robbie is at his absolute best in this album! Not only does he give us his signature tongue-in-cheek but also some deep feelings of what is going on in his life which makes him more real and more human. Granted, this is totally different from any of his other albums (of which I own them all) but that is a statement about his music writing abilities. He is not stuck in the same groove as other artists. Having such a wide range of style is fantastic because it gives more listeners more opportunities to enjoy his music. I hope this album which is full of catchy tunes (hot fudge) and poignant memories (nan's song) will be the one to break him here in the US because quite frankly I can't afford to buy tickets home to the UK every time I want to see him in concert (and let me tell you...one of the best concerts you will ever see in your life!).I love this CD and every other CD Robbie has ever put out. Give it a whirl and you won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Robbie Keeps Getting Better","review":"I have been a Robbie Williams fan for several years and have all of his CDs, but I have to say that Escapology is his best album yet. I loved every one of the songs and can listen to the CD all the way through without skipping any songs. All of the songs are so well-written and sung beautifully. His first single off the album, \\"Feel\\", is the perfect song to display Robbie's vocal abilities, along with \\"Love Somebody\\". I particularly enjoy the humerous \\"Handsome Man\\" and the rock-influenced \\"How Peculiar\\".Although you will find rock, pop, and maybe even a little country influence on this album, Robbie simply can't be compared to any other artist out there. I hope more people here in the US will discover his music - it would be a shame if they didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunningly Amazing!","review":"I was sitting at a train station in Europe, listening to my radio when Robbie Williams came on. I was blown away by his voice and immediately looked him up online. Slowly began purchasing his music, one album at a time, and now have made my way to Escapology - by far the best album thus far (I just purchased his new \\"Reality...\\" album as well which I have not grown to).I been listening to the songs on this album over and over again and can't shut it off - 'Come Undone', 'Love Somebody', 'Monsoon', and 'Love Somebody' are some of my favorite hits.If you are trying to get introduced to Robbie Williams, I would recommend this track listing or his \\"Greatest Hits\\" compilation.Also surprised he is not big in the US...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help with hidden tracks???","review":"Track 14 (Nan's Song) contains 2 hidden songs.

If anyone can help,please e-mail me at joechan099 at hotmail. Thanx in advance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Fan","review":"I couldn't be a bigger fan of Robbie Williams, but this CD was a big let down. First of all, be warned, its full of bad language. My 13 year old son is also a fan and I won't let him listen to this one. Secondly, this is mostly Robbie bragging about himself and his prowess. He just signed a big contract and I think his head is about to explode. He also puts down his fans saying, basically, that he is just using them for what he can get. The melodies are nothing new either. The two stars are for 'Feel' which is a decent, thoughtful song. Sorry, but most people can't relate to the rantings of a British pop star."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only that rope would snap...","review":"...the one on the album cover I mean. Musically this man couldn't escape out of a paper bag. At least his clinky little tunes used to have the power to nauseate, notably Rock DJ. His new album, whilst less offensive than the previous two is only so because of its uniform blandness. It is to your lasting credit America that you give the third most/least talented member of dire boy band Take That the short shrift he deserves. Britney looks like Patti Smith next to this plonker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring back the old Robbie","review":"Im shocked, Robbie has tried to be so arty but it hasnt worked, bring back the old robbie, your not moby you know!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just say NO to cheating record companies","review":"I urge you all to refuse to buy discs like this one that are not proper CDs, but abuse the CD name to sell you something that cannot be played on many CD players.Just say No to cheating record companies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Half A Star Rating Is Proper","review":"To compare him to Elton John(True KING OF POP) and George Michael(Pop Prince Of Yesteryear)is ridiculous! This is the BLANDEST recorded music from any artist...lackluster, no punch noise. Just because a guy strips naked and shows his privates doesn't make him a \\"musician\\". Williams is so lucky to have scored the mediocre \\"Angels\\" as any form a hit single in the U.S.A., period. So called 'singers' of his calibre are a dime a dozen here in America. Nick Lachey's \\"Soulo\\" album easily outshines any of Williams' recorded efforts on any level. And all you people wonder WHY America hasn't caught on to pseudoporn pinup Williams?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let the cover fool you","review":"I saw this album and I thought cool title,cool cover and it's Robbie Williams,ex Take That member.I bought it and I was like what is this?The lyrics make no sense and the music is so boring.The only good songs Robbie Williams has done are with Take That and \\"Angels\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a voice! What a lyricist!","review":"Why isn't Robbie a big star in the US? It seems that the world knows what the US doesn't - that Robbie is the most original singer/songwriter to come along in a very, very long time! He's charming, adorable and writes original and singable songs that he sings in his own inimitable style and swagger. His infectious, randy charm comes through in songs like \\"Handsome Man\\" and \\"Me and My Monkey\\". This whole cd is defintely a must own, as is the rest of the Robbie Williams discography! No one can do it like Robbie can!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD in years","review":"I can honestly say this is one of the best cds that I have ever heard in my life. 98% of the songs are excellent and very pleasant to listen to. This is the first time I have bought a cd from robbie williams and am planning to get some of his other stuff. Anyone who likes good pop music should get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy 'Em Both!","review":"Robbie delivers again! \\"Escapology\\", his fifth studio effort, is among his best...but they are all SO good! But if you like what you hear, buy both the U.S. version and the international version because they have different songs on them. The U.S. version omits the songs \\"Song 3\\", \\"Hot Fudge\\" and \\"Cursed\\"...while adding the songs \\"One Fine Day\\" and \\"Get a Little High\\". Also, as with all of his cd's, look for the bonus track about 12 minutes after the \\"How Peculiar\\" reprise...it's called \\"I Tried Love\\" and it's hilarious!! I whole-heartedly agree with the other reviewer...you won't use your \\"skip\\" button once!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most impressive CD this year","review":"At first sound, one might think that Robbie has done a total 360 from his risky songs, and bad boy lyrics, but don't let the smooth sounds fool you! It is amazing how Robbie is able to create such a beautiful melody in the track, \\"Sexed Up\\"; yet, he is still able to throw in the phrase 'screw you'. Nonetheless, the CD is top of the line...if I had to take one CD onto a deserted island, this would be it. Please do not be disenchanted because of other Robbie Williams songs you have heard, or by the idea that he is a \\"typical Brit postar\\". Escapology truely is sinfully listenable, and never tiresome. It is perfectly blended with a mixture of soft songs, to rock songs, to songs that seems to have a more 'oldies' vibe (take for instance \\"Something Beautiful\\").A few of my favorites of the CD are \\"Feel\\", \\"Sexed Up\\", \\"Revolution\\", and \\"Something Beautiful\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great serving of Robbie!","review":"I have never been able to figure out why Robbie Williams isn't HUGE in the US. He's so talented and just plain fun to listen to and sing along with. This is yet another great collection of songs that will hopefully catapult him into the ranks of musical stars where he belongs. \\"Monsoon\\" is probably my favorite of all the songs because I can't help but laugh right along with him. Definitely a must-have for Robbie fans...and everyone else too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Robbie Wins while he's winning.","review":"As a long-time Robbie fan (Okay then, since Slane) this album shines with Robbie's growth as a songwriter. The many time songwriter of the year winner wins again.Just like the hit song \\"Millenium\\" showed the cheeky-rebel can't cheat the oncoming middle age mellowness, but it's a fresh combination that exudes from the earlier tracks in the album. The imp still lives, in the man! Buy it.With Robbies earlier albums already Five star earners, this album should be a six."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"What is it with this guy, each and every album he produces is different to that of the last one. That has probably been the secret of his success in the UK and Europe, but at the age of 27 surely he should have found somekind of diretion.Alas this album highlights that Robbie Williams just follows the latest fads and changes. When I think of the music produced by British artists over the years I think of Radiohead, The Beatles, The Sex Pistols etc bands that actually pushed the boundaries of music. Now all we get is this guy who seems to think that the world revolves around him, without him actually achieving anything.What with the garbage being churned out in the music industry today it is hard to see how this album will fail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrogance doesn't pay !","review":"A star can't shine forever, ain't it ? At least to me ! Mind you, I was a big Robbie fan, owning all his albums and singles, until he turned Sinatra. Being the most decorated Brit popstar, and later managed to be a sweet ol' crooner, really got to his head I suppose ! None of the 14 songs here is even worthy of mention. Simply said, they are all tuneless and void of melody. I can't even remember a single tune here, not to mention his arrogant lyrics (especially in \\"Handsome Man\\"). Has any songs been released as singles ? Not that I know of. Well, none of em is good enough !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ear Candy music","review":"If Robbie Willimas could be compared to a food type itwould be KFC, nice to listen to, but it has no value whatso ever. The songs are so simple on this cd, it could ofbeen written by a child.He really needs to go back to music school, Sexed Up is justplain stupid, his image of going out and getting drunk wonthelp the dismal first week sales either. Robbie has reallyhurt himself with this album. Its quite sad, really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robbie William's Worst","review":"I think this is the worst CD Robbie Williams has released to date. The music is so unappealing. I bought the CD in Europe and I was particularly irritated by the copy protection that won't let you save the CD in your hard disk (this protection should be illegal in the US, right?)--and by the ... euros I had to shell out.

I'll tell you one thing--she's definitely not the typical female writer. She talks about crazy stuff like people eating boogers, razor bumps, bed wetting, and lap dances. I spent the same amount of time cringing as I did laughing. Two single, young black females move to three different states in search of love, careers, and satisfaction. Neither is searching for the same thing at the same time which helps them to give each other honest advice. I'm glad the author chose to tell the story from Misty's point of view though, because as entertained as I was by Reese, she was a little too extra for me to bond with. The only thing I didn't like was how the author kept calling Reese's dialect \\"ghetto talk\\", as if only ghetto residents speak the dialect.

A selection of some of Zimmer's best work. Nothing new. But it's great hearing the tracks live a good way of getting a sample of Zimmer's work. I didn't have the separate soundtracks for all the cues so for me the CD is excellent and refreshing.Journey to the Line and Mother Africa are two of the most powerful tracks and my favourites but none of it is bad.

This tune's absence (there's a truncated version) from the \\"Thelma & Louise\\" soundtrack album was a glaring omission, and thankfully it can be found on this recording, faithfully and beautifully executed by slide guitar virtuoso Pete Haycock (who performed it for the film). It's an absolutely beautiful version...I recommend this Hans Zimmer album in its entirety, and I also recommend Pete Haycock's new CD, \\"Pete Haycock's True Blues LIVE\\", which features more amazing slide guitar artistry by this artist (check out the RMI Sound website or Pete Haycock's website for info).Kudos to Hans for this collection of film music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am surprised that so many gave this color book a good review.

Hastings does a superb job of covering the conflict; however, I would agree with some of the reviewers that Hastings' book falls short in some areas--especially how UN and ROK forces turned the tide of the war in early 1951. I would have liked to have seen more about that, especially what happened in Hoengseong in February of 1951. Still, the book has a lot to offer and for serious students of history, it is a good book to start one's study of the Korean War.Jeffrey MillerAuthor of War Remains"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Korean War","review":"This book was purchased for a Korean war veteran who is interested in researching his participation in this war.

Hastings tells the story of the bitter battles at close range on impossible terrain in brutal weather. Some 42,000 US soldiers died in just three years' fighting. The US attack into North Korea brought the Chinese into the war and caused serious consideration to be given to the use of The Bomb. Hastings' use of interviews with some two hundred veterans, from both sides, including Chinese, gives his work its veracity. He also covers the political battles at home, including the big one between Truman and the deluded megalomaniac MacArthur.An excellent addition to your history bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting look at the war","review":"This is the only book I have read on the Korean War. Another reviewer has suggested that this book is best viewed as a supplement to other, larger works. However, from the point of view of a novice, I found this book to be illuminating and interesting in its own right.To me, this was an even-handed account of the war, trying to give at least some rationale to the actions of all the countries involved , including the Chinese (I was naturally disappointed, being Canadian, about the lack of information on our troops, but it was a relatively small complement).All in all, I would call this an interesting analysis on this \\"forgotten\\" war. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so impressed","review":"Having read this book after several others on the subject I found it a little disappointing. It's obvious that the author is British because a larger portion of the book is devoted to the British units than is probably justified considering they comprised only a small fraction of the UN forces. For a more insightful and comprehensive rendition of the events of the Korean War, I recommend \\"Korea: The Untold Story of the War\\" by Joseph C Goulden."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red China definitely used Chiang's old weapons arsenal","review":"The US provided Chiang with many weapons to fight both Japanese and Communists. When Mao Zedong took mainland China he inherited a huge arsenal of american-made weapons (like Khomeini did from the ousted Shah in Iran in 1979). Go to search engines and put in in quotes Li-Fujen: Kuomintang Faces Doom (1949). This is for more on Chiang's defecting-to-Mao soldiers having american weapons.These american-made weapons definitely helped the Red Chinese cause. This book is definitely too flattering to Red China. And the US was 97% of the UN fighting force in Korea. Americans had 5,764,143 men in combat in Korea. The rest of the UN contributed a small 156,000. The US was way more efficient than Red China in this war case closed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brit bias is obvious","review":"The author here is British and this book screams it from the first page.

Should they get 20 stars at least in comparison with this 5 stars \\"masterpiece\\"?In my opinion, 5 star means \\"excellent\\". Is this excellent?People give 5 stars just because there is the proud King Crimson name on the sleeve. Deep down, guys, and tell me how would you have rated this, if this album had been issued by an unknown band?This miserable album lacks of good melodies and inventive playing. Pop, nu-metal, stupid electronic voice effects. Cul-de-sac...So, my suggestion: save your money for something better. Naturally, if you are KC die-hard fan, then buy this, because this album was made (unfortunately!) by the band called King Crimson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the standard bearers for true progressive rock","review":"While the move to a more metallic approach may be in part an attempt to reach a younger audience, it is by no means a callous one: the band sounds inspired and invigorated. One suspects the power percussion of Pat Mastelloto is just more suited to a heavier style than Bill Bruford's jazzier grooves. Guitarist Adrian Belew remains Fripp's best hiring move: still providing smiles among the many shadows, and his voice sounds stronger. The usual daunting instrumental passages are some of the Crim's most interesting in years. And while the songs aren't quite at the level of the gems on Thrak (save for the cheekily witty \\"Happy With What You Have To Be Happy With\\"), \\"Eyes Wide Open\\" is simply lovely. Not sequenced quite as effectively as it could have been, but still multi-dimensional listening, a rarity these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"This has been one of my favorite releases of the past four years.I must have listened to this a hundred times by now.The whole album is superb,but my favorites are the instrumentals.Level Five,electrik,and dangerous curves are extremely addictive.And man can these old guys get heavy when they want to.Fripp and Belew's guitar performances are nothing short of amazing.Im only really a fan of the Thrak,Construction Of Light,and Power to Believe Crimson.This is definitely not for everybody as Crimson are a very abstract and difficult band to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"King Crimson cover... well, King Crimson!","review":"'Happy with what you have to be happy with' is a good swipe at younger bands who lack any talent (I think Limp Bizkit especially). But that is the irony; 'Happy' is the only song on this album that is any fun to listen to... The other songs are tired, obligatory attempts by King Crimson at being, well, King Crimson.Very formulaic It's King Crimson doing their thing, which means making sure they sound like themselves. I think it is worth noting it took a long time to make a subsequent album, maybe because their creativity well was drying up.Except for the burst of energy that is 'Happy with what you have to be happy with', which is fun, most of this material is copy and paste of past Crimson material, e.g. 'Level 5' should be called 'Thrakcture' 'cause it simply is that, a reworking of two previous songs kind of mixed together.

At the same time, flourishes of their 80's work can be heard, too, so what we really have, to my ears anyway, is an album similar to \\"Thrak\\" - more melodic than \\"C of L\\", but still metallic, edgy and offbeat.

It is a bit rough at times and the sound quality, while still very good, could have been better given the year it was recorded. The band is both tight and a bit loose at times. Simon Fowler's voice strains on occasion but overall they are in fine form and this disc is a great deal of fun. It is always a pleasure to listen to Steve Cradock in a live context be it with OCS or with Paul Weller. He seems to come from the George Harrison school of guitar artistry, where every note counts.

Indeed, it could have been dry as hay. But Smith crafts a convincing narrative out of his materials, no small feat in a work of this length. In its scope and balance, this work is too impressive to be given just two stars. Instead, I think the following conclusion from a review in The Journal of Interdisciplinary History is more on target: \\"Yet, in spite of the daunting nature of his task, Smith must be judged overall to have written a successful synthetic treatment of his many-faceted subject. The writing is compelling and often sparkling. The thinking is always informed. This is a book that serves many functions: It should be a standard reference, a work that one dips into for the sheer pleasure of reading bits and pieces, and an essential study of the problems underlying a history of the human sciences.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Setting is a Synagogue","review":"Wanted to correct previous poster.

In some cases, the names exist only as descriptors and the location remains a mystery without another textbook. In other cases, there is a structure named with location shown in many places, but there is no description of it's function in the book. Acronyms exist without a glossary listing of them, so the only way to know the acronym is to flip back in the book until you find the location it is first used - fun for a >600 page book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing......","review":"I just bought the CD and I have listened to it 20 times.

Not to mention, he's absolutely adorable. Take a little bit of a raspy blues singer w/ an unbelievable range- add a little bit of rock edge w/ a touch of pop & you've got Tyler.It's hard to come across great musicians these days, everything is so generic. But he's not that at all. He's a savior to what the music world is coming to. He's live a sigh of relief that maybe, just maybe-- everything won't be computer generated or pure bubblegum.And to add the cherry on top, Tyler is as sweet as can be- and sounds JUST as wonderful live, acoustic- as he does on his album being backed.

Buying the Tyler Hilton CD totally 100 % changed our outlook on that. Tyler not only writes his own music, but he can play the guitar and has an amazing voice. He has the power to change a persons mood just by playing one of his songs. The reason everyone is getting sick of rap is because its all the same stuff. They just talk about girls and nothing else. But Tyler actually writes about important stuff.. people can relate to his music. My favorite song of his is, Picture Perfect. Most calming song ever. All I can really say is, Tyler is a very talented guy, and anyone can admitt that he is really a nice change from rap and more people should get to know him and his music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I first heard of Tyler Hilton while watching One Tree Hill.

She is befriended by a man. and also a boy from her class. They become pretty good friends, but then something unexpected happens. I think that this book is geered toward 12-any age.

At the beggining of the book his father gets killed and his tribe gets enslaved. The slave-ship sails of without his cripple sister whose only twelve years old.During his time in slavery At-Mun he physically treated badly. He is sold twice, once right before he was to be freed. Every chance he gets he tries to find his sister.Upon his eventual emancipation, he buys a slave to free and marry her. Then he sets up his own tannery and starts a family.Overall, this non-fiction about slavery and separation evokes satisfaction. But does he find his sister? Read and find out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent vocabulary resource!","review":"I've used Amos Fortune Free Man as a powerful tool in building vocabulary and dictionary usage skills for my fifth graders. It is not an easy read, but does open young eyes to the way of life in colonial America. The book develops the character as they read, and I point that out to my students. Advanced readers told me that they thought it was boring at first but got better as they read. The concept that fiction and historical fiction books often develop in that way came through clearer by having them read the book than by my merely telling them. They learned not to give up on a book after reading just a few pages. I highly recommend it for gifted readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romanticizes Slavery","review":"I find this book to be extremely inaccurate and that it romanticizes slavery, giving the reader the opinion that slavery wasn't as bad as historians have made it out to be. It was written by a white author during a time when things of this nature weren't really discussed. I think the tag line on the back of the book states something along the lines of \\"You have to work to be free\\". Who says Amos wasn't free when he lived with his family in Africa? So he had to become a slave to figure out what it meant to be free? It gives young children the wrong idea about what really happened during this time. To Be A Slave by Lester is far better than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Boring Than I Thought","review":"As with most other kids I thought this book was not worth writing. While reading the description it sounded fantasticly exciting. In the beginning it actually sounded like an interesting piece of history. By the end it was one of the most boring books I've ever read. Now I have come to realize that just because a book wins the Newbery Medal does not mean that it is a good book. With 1,000 good books one book can be published because it is pollitically correct or is spewed out by a good author. I have no doubts about Elizabeth Yates but I think that Amos Fortune is a book about a man that had a good life, but one that was not nessicarily worth writing about."},{"rating":"1","title":"kinda good","review":"this book was not the best. Some parts where exciting, but most of the book was boring. I would not recamend this to a younger kid because it has some big words."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beloved hero","review":"What an inspiration this book is. \\"Amos Fortune\\" is the Newbery Winner from 1950, and it is a worthwhile read. Amos himself is dignified, admirable, and solidly written. This book is an inspiration to children -- a life quietly lived pursuing the goal of freedom and self-sufficiency, while helping others as much as possible.Set in New England in late colonial/revolutionary/early American times. This book has it all -- plot, action, sadness, courage. It sets an example for kids who need to look outside themselves for the meaning of life. My favorite character was Violet, that encouraging, supportive industrious, strong wife. But then again, I'm a mom.Amos Fortune belongs on your child's bookshelf.Parent notes: a hard look at the capture and captivity of Afrincan blacks for slavery in the New World, the middle passage, violence against blacks. Uplifting book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Man With Courage","review":"The thing I like best about this book is Amos goes through life without losing hope, never complaining.

My 12 yr old daughter had a Newton's CradleNewtons Cradle - Largethat she loved. It was endlessly fascinating to her to drop the ball and watch it seem to ricochet off both sides. When the cradle finally broke, I thought I would find something different, yet similar. That is why I bought the R.O.M.P. The R.O.M.P does what it was advertised to do, but unfortunately it turns out that this is only (mildly) interesting the first time you see it. This isn't the sort of toy/device/equipment that you will find yourself playing with days later and then again days after that. Note that the pendulum is a pendulum-like; as on a grandfather clock, it is straight and stiff, not flexible like a string or a chain. I don't know why but I think that it is something about the pendulum's straight stiffness (as opposed to the flexibility of a string) that makes this toy less arresting than it might be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnetically Stimulating","review":"The Hog Wild ROMP is so much fun. Watching the random movements of the pendulum is very stimulating. I love to change the positions of the magnets and try different polarities. The base is solidly constructed, and the magnets are robust. The mounted arm is a plastic material, (I wish this was metal, but it should last as long as you are careful). The pendulum is plastic too, but this is OK because it needs to be light enough to move around. I also find that the plastic pendulum will flex a little, which is fun when playing with the attractive nature of the magnets. Overall, this is a great gift for anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"Cheap, moves for about 5 seconds... Waste of money ...will most likely break within a week.

I happened to look online and saw the Winsome Wood Wine Tower. At first glance, I didn't know what to think, but then I looked at it again and visualize it in my dining area. Afterwards, I just knew it would look great and match perfect with the other furniture that I have in that area. The first steps were very simple, but when I got to the last step, it took me some time since I had to make the holes a little bigger. All in all, I spent about 2 hours putting it together. Anyway just as I visualized, it looked great! There were minor scrapes (I guess from the shipping and handling) but nothing that was too obvious. I am so happy to have found this wine cellar. I couldn't be anymore pleased. This is an excellent piece for the price as well. I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great wine rack","review":"Great wine rack for the price. It has a nice espresso finish looks like a high quality furniture piece. It was not too complicated to put together sturdy and stable once it is tightened correctly. You are are using threaded screws into predrilled wood holes, so take you time and get it right the first time.The packing could be better as the middle shelf had a dent and became seperated in shipping. Otherwise this would have been 5 stars for the price. Amazon replaced it right away with a new shipment, but I did not like the fact that they had to ship a whole complete set rather than just the one piece. I did get the new one in teo days though and just had to remove the damaged piece and have UPS pick it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great piece at a great price","review":"We got our Wine Tower yesterday. We were looking for a piece that we could store both the glasses and the bottles, and that would take up too much space since we only had a small corner of our dining room to spare. This was the perfect choice! We saw similar pieces for much, much more. This tower is sturdy, just the right size, and looks much more expensive than it is.Also, shipping was fast, and more importantly, free! This is my first time buying a larger item like a piece of furniture from Amazon, but it definitely won't be the last!"},{"rating":"1","title":"flimsy!","review":"I'm not sure if my husband has, but I have never taken the time to review a product until now- I had to warn other people. I give it two stars instead of one only because it looks nice from far away. But it's misleading; this piece of furniture is SO FLIMSY and cheaply made! We are going to have to nail it into the wall for fear it will fall over. For this price I would expect much higher quality. Shame on this company. Do not buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"difficult at best","review":"I opened the package and checked off all the pieces. I was missing 2 screws but figured I could use some of my own. After putting the right side and back together, I couldn't get the bottom piece of the back to stay in. After 20 minutes of fiddling around, I realized that the side piece was broken. I figured I could glue or drill a screw in to keep it together. I then proceeded to try to put everything together on the bottom half. Two hours and a lot of swearing later, I realized this thing was not going together. I ended up packing it up and sending it back. I'm happy Amazon will refund me the money. I'm very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Budget Wine Tower","review":"I ordered this wine tower from Amazon because the price + free shipping just couldn't be beat. After reading the reviews here it seemed to me that the tower itself is great, but the real gamble was what condition it would be in when I received it. For whatever it's worth, my wine tower arrived in perfect condition, no damage or missing parts. It was also the dark espresso as advertised (some reviews said it was lighter). I managed to put the tower together in about an hour using a small cordless drill with the proper allen wrench bit on low torque. I only used the supplied allen wrench for hand-tightening all the screws.Overall we're very happy with the wine tower in our dining room. I also added a cheap strip of battery powered LED lights to the top (tucked them behind the lip so you can't see them) and when we have guest over, they illuminate the glasses hanging upside down. It adds a stylish touch for little to no effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This was the worst piece of furniture I have ever purchased.

Suppressed by the author until after his death, the world did not see this wonderful story until 1971; more's the pity. For this is in many ways THE classic gay novel; the characters all ring true; the class milieu is perfectly evoked as only Forster can; and the happy ending, however unrealistic it may be given the novel's setting and times, is almost obligatory for such a story. This one is absolutely not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm half-way through","review":"Well I really haven't heard of anyone ever reviewing a book they haven't yet completed but here I am. I have already read Forster's 'Where Angels fear to tread' and I didn't think too much of it. Our college library, however, is stacked with copies of all sorts of material on Forster & I do remember the Merchant Ivory film although I never saw it. I had a terrible day at college the other day when I picked up Maurice for a read, I never take fiction from the library - I always like to have my own copy. But reading Maurice - well I can't find words sufficient to describe how much I already love the book & how I don't want it to end - so I'm prolonging my love-affair with it. I wanted to read other people's opinions & it's nice to know that the book has received its due admiration. For anyone who hasn't read it - Do read it, it's beautiful and interesting. None of the best-seller crap & yet a page-turner. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great wonderful","review":"a beautifully written novel dealing with two men incollege who fall in love the novel deals with the predujiceagainst homosexuals i the early 1900's strongly recemonded this book changed my life"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Penguin edition instead","review":"Buy the Penguin edition instead.

This book was impossible to put down yet difficult to finish and say goodbye to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautifully written love story 80 years ahead of its time","review":"The film of \\"Maurice\\" produced by Merchant Ivory a number of years ago is one my favorite films. I was curious, having never read E.M. Forster before, to see how much of the issue of homosexuality was a product of the book and how much was played-up for the film. The book did not dissapoint. An honest, self-aware writer, E.M. Forster tells a beautiful story of a fairly unremarkable young man who is forced to (by virtue of being gay) become remarkable. Problems of English repugnance at homosexuality (a feeling he shares himself at first) and of class make him into a grownup, into a real man. In the book this becomes a wonderful liberation--that does not come through as well in the film. A marvelous read. Not published until after his death in 1970. Only a few read it when he actually wrote it in the teens. Too dangerous. A shame. Far ahead of it's time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let me count the ways...","review":"Why do I love this book? Is it because E. M. Forster presents a wide and believable spectrum of queer men? Because of how the title character is such a good example of the heroism ordinary people can have? Because of the fact that it's a piece of Edwardian queer literature that doesn't end with insanity, despair, or death? Because Alec Scudder is the best bisexual character in all of literature? Yeah, it's all of the above.Various literary critics and historians have voiced the opinion that E. M. Forster was cowardly to have not published it during his lifetime, but given that he was a somewhat retiring person who came of age as Oscar Wilde was undergoing his trials, I think it's pretty brave that he wrote it at all. \\"Maurice\\" is never sensationalized, nor is it cliched. Things I found as flaws revealed themselves as underscored points upon re-reading. I will go so far as to say that this book should be read by every single person on the face of this earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweet universal romance","review":"This book is wonderful. It is romantic and sexy and very brave for the time in which it was written. I love it(and the film) because it doesn't worry about being realistic but gives the characters the ending they deserve. It's so passionate and great and should not be passed by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Queer Lit","review":"The politics of the book's release and Forster's own closeted life have to be considered outside of the actual book. As a work of literature, \\"Maurice\\" has always been a favorite of mine. Certainly, it gives a true and honest account of what it must have been like to live as a shadow in society if you were a gay man in early 20th century England. I believe that many reviewers have mistaken Forster's penchant for illustrating \\"the muddle\\" (see Mr. Emerson's final speech in \\"A Room with a View\\") of his characters as his dislike of them. As with almost all of his other novels, the hero of the story isn't actually heroic until the end, when the muddle is lifted.In all events, \\"Maurice\\" is an engaging and delightfully unsentimental love story. To this day, I can promise that nearly every gay man can easily see a part of his youth adequately reflected in Maurice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid!!","review":"I have purchased this and to my grave dissapointemnt this product does not work.

I was surprised to find that I hated every song on this album, the melodies have no direction but have the same repetitious guitar patterns and simplicity of all the albums before it.

None of the albums with him on it are any good, although I can't say that about \\"High Voltage\\" because I have yet to hear that one. This CD, however, is simply awful.

Not that I don't like \\"Back in Black\\", but it's a bit repetitive. The title track gets everything started, and it doesn't let up a bit after that. The slow, creepy \\"Night Prowler\\" is a cool way to end the album, also. Every song is excellent, and the songwriting isn't quite as immature as Brian Johnson's.

He and Angus and the boys put out classic 70s rock that still stands the test of time. Some people bash AC/DC for having such a long career out of what many believe is just simple rock music and suggestive lyrics filled with sexual innuendos. Isn't that what rock and roll is all about?

Scott always harnessed a playful nod and a wink sense of humor in his lyrics and vocals that would raise the level of the material up a few notches. You never got the feeling that he was taking himself too seriously. Musically in many ways AC/DC sticks to their patented formula, but on this album everything works very nicely. The title track became the band's first legit hit in the U.S. and remains one of the most famous classic rock guitar riffs to this day. For straight ahead rock n roll with a slight bluesy touch in spots it does not get much better than this. For me \\"Highway To Hell\\" may be the all time best AC/DC studio album and remains a hard rock classic from the end of the 70's."},{"rating":"2","title":"HIghway to Hell (Been There, Done, That)","review":"Killer Album, lets me go back to when music was music.

The thing is that I really don't understand how a reviewer said that this remastered cd sounded bad. The sound is clean and clear. The guitars are more \\"alive\\" than the original cd version.

It, like back in black, is fillerless and is never boring. Bon's last album, and he saved his best singing for his last, he is insane here. best 3 songs: highway to hell ( what a memorable riff), if you want blood (angus at his best), touch too much/girls got rythm ( these two are eqaully ridiculous and amazing). worst song: love hungry man. this is one of their more melodic songs and is a great song. I love the chorus. Over all , great ( in my opinion) the second greatest album ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highway rocks!!!","review":"This album is definetely, along with 'Back in Black' one of the best Rock albums of all time, and I don't mean to overrate this collection of 10 tracks of pure Rock & Roll. With singer Bon Scott making his last record before his death the following year, 'Highway to Hell' burst out a spate of Rock anthems such as the title track, \\"Touch Too Much,\\"Beating Around the Bush,\\"If You Want Blood,\\" and the rest are just as great to make the whole album a worth listening without skipping a single song from start to end. Get this album and if you want a taste of the best classic R&R that's ever been recorded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another AC/DC classic","review":"High Way to Hell is great every single song is worth listening to. The title track High Way to hell is just freaking awesome Angus Young really knows how to play those solos each song is filled with altleast one or two kik a** solos. Anyone who listens to good old rock n roll will love this ablum and some other great AC/DC albums High Voltage,Let there Be Rock,Dirty Deeds done Dirt Cheap,Powerage,Back in Black,'74 JailBreak,Back in Black and For Those about to Rock. I give this album 4 stars since all the songs are worth listening too and the great thing about having the digipak is you can get to read some tidbits about the bands history and some well written articles.

The songs on this CD jsut plain rule! This CD has alot of really good songs, my favorites are Shot Down in Flames, Touch Too Much, If You Want Blood, Beating Around the Bush, NIght Prowler (which got alot of unwanted attention when a 'night prowling' criminal that wore an AC/DC hat started commiting crimes), and Highway to Hell, which is very ironic, because about six months after the release of this album, singer Bon Scott died on a night of drinking. Bon had always had a booze-sex-drugs-brawl lifestyle, and Highway to Hell seems to be a recognization of where he really was.

He had a unique graspy sounding, but clear voice.He set the stage and established a fan base for the next album (Back in Black) with Brian Johnson. Brian Johnson has a real rough voice and has to strain to even sound half way descent. His voice, especially now, doesn't compare to Bon Scott. But with the original drummer Phil Rudd back, the band sounds a lot better than they did before. Bon Scott was a natural. Also, with hit singles like Highway To Hell (#47 on the billboard charts) and Touch Too Much. It showed that american radio was starting to catch on. There could have been more hit singles if the band would have released more. This album sounded more polished than the others. With Angus Young's guitar solo's and Bon's Graspy but Clear voice, this album will always be played on rock radio now and way in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"bon scott was the man","review":"i have always loved this cd. i have always been partial to the bon scott era and this cd is the best i think. the saddest thing about this is that i think bon scott was just beginning to discover his talent by then. his writing contributions on this album are the best he ever did and i always wondered how things would have turned out if he had survived. i also admire the way the band carried on when he died because he was the patriarch of the band. the young brothers and the others always looked up to bon for guidance and i think bon would be proud of them for carrying on after his passing. his music will live forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome Album Ruined by Loudness War","review":"\\"The Sound on this cd is SO much louder than the original\\" \\"This has got to be the best this album has ever sounded\\" Yeah, right. Highway to hell is one of the latest victims of the loudness war, and this cd is compressed to death. Clipping is evident and the sound is consistently grating. Too bad increases in technology mean worse sounding cds. Pick up the orginal Atlantic cd - its much more dynamic - and consequently better sounding. And to those who say older cds are mastered not as loudly as todays - yeah, that's the point - more dynamic range. If it's not loud enough, guess what? All you have to do is turn up the volume.

Maybe it's because it was Bon's last-- so fans are being overly sentimental, but it is not the strongest of the Bon era material. I love early AC/DC -- but this album pales in comparison to High Voltage and Dirty Deeds. Yeah, the song \\"Highway to Hell\\" is a classic -- and a couple of other songs are merely okay (The Girls Got Rhythm, Shot Down in Flames, Love Hungry Man). But this album is nowhere near a classic. If anything, it is the most monotonous album AC/DC ever made. You can skip this one. If you don't believe me -- fine, buy it.

Trust me, they are right! We all know the album is a classic, brilliant music. Anybody who has heard the Vinyl or previous 1994 remaster knows that this 2003 remaster sounds terrible! Its has way too much treble and there is no slam/punch to the drums and bass. It sounds nothing like how this album sounded when it originally came out on Vinyl. If you love this album and care about good sound quality, do yourself a favour and buy either the 1994 remaster or UK Vinyl. You will see what i mean, this just sounds tinny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth It Just For the Title Track!","review":"Not sure if you've looked on Napster or iTunes, but there is precious little original AC/DC to be had.

Anyway, I'm not the world's #1 fan but there are a few AC/DC songs that are in my all time classics -- the title, the title track for Back in Black, and You Shook Me All Night Long (Back in Black also). The rest of the songs are good but I'm not familiar with them. One thing that I love about the whole thing is the vocals and instruments all work together versus against one another and the sound works... crazy, but it sounds \\"natural.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"this made them superstars.","review":"This release was giganitc in 1979, it was a huge hit and it has all great melodic metal songs on it.I had to get one than one album of this one because I wore out the grooves on it. Metal fans of the day were delighted and even non metal fans lapped this one up. Song's like the classic 'highway to hell' , 'if you want blood' , 'night prowler' (the evil killer Richard Ramiriz thought this one was taling to him, which only proves nuts are everywhere) fans of later styles of metal are lame to criticize 70's metal because it is what it is and it's melodic enough to be enjoyable to nonmetal fans often. You can't say that about alot of thrash which has very small listenership these days. SO drive on down the highway to a monster classic cd that made this band a WORLDWIDE SENSATION! It really did!

Raspy, foul, and uncaged. I love it, and it shines on this album. The Young brothers wrote some of their most kick-ass riffs here, with the sludgy title track, the good-time salute to general teenage boy-ery \\"Girls Got Rhythm\\", the kinda-depressing-but-fast-paced-so-it's-not-really-depressing \\"Shot Down in Flames\\", and the ominous \\"Night Prowler\\".

The author says, you are not judged by what is done to you, but by how you respond to what is done to you. This is some powerful stuff. Lots of information, lots of examples, a fantastic reference guide. Hardwick has a relaxed, interesting style of writing.

I sent it back three months ago and have called every two weeks since to find out when we could expect what I thought is/was going to be a NEW player for a $90 service charge. I am continually told it will be another two weeks before they are in stock. After reading the other reviews I have resigned to the fact that I will probably never see a replacement.

It seems I am not alone on this issue and I wish GoVideo would get the pants sued off them for Fraud.If you have issues, call the Attorney General of the State of Arizona. I am doing that right now. 1-800-352-8431.You can also call corporate and get EVERYONE's voice mail (does anyone really work at GoVideo?) I think they exist to rip people off.

Finally just before the warranty ran out it quit altogether. I contacted GoVideo for support, no easy feat as I waited on hold 45 minutes to 1 hour after no response by email (including 2nd and 3rd emails) for 1 month. They told me my only option was to send the unit back and pay $89.95 for a \\"labor charge\\" and they would send a new replacement.

The manual states the battery should last 2.5 hours, but I found it to be more like 1-1.5. Then, I tried to contact GoVideo customer service and received an automated reply, which was unhelpful. I tried again, and they never responded. Luckily, amazon accepted the product for a refund since it was defective.

I have no complaints. There are better portable DVD players on the market, but you will pay much more for them. This has to be one of the best that you can get for under $300.

There was no story, no plot, just a series of poorly intertwined sub-plots that weren't even amusing. Poor ol' Charlie Brown sells his comic books to buy gloves for his girlfriend and then gives them to Snoopy. He also is selling wreaths door to door, Snoopy steals candy canes from a tree and uses them as dancing canes, Peppermint Patty forgets her lines in a play - and she is a SHEEP!!

Even though there was no more four-octave range, the depth of feeling and the emotional interpretation far surpass anything she did in the '50s or '60s.

Intermittently dark, with scattering of choral tonalities that pulse sat around each counterpoint. Young's score stands very well by itself, would be well received in a concert hall with each cue keeping you on the edge of your seat. The final film in this chronicle is \\"Hellraiser III:Hell On Earth\\", as Randy Miller picks up the baton and continues the saga of Pinhead.

Julian learns that there's more to live than revenge, even regarding his enemy's daughter. Neither character is perfectly likeable, but that seems to make them more human. It does get frustrating sometimes to see how little they trust each other (repeatedly), but trust takes time, especially in their circumstances. In the end, they both learn and grow--as individuals and in love.It's a very long book, which is quite nice when one reads as quickly as I do.

The historical guest 'stars\\" like Tesla and Sir Arthur conan Doyle make for even more fun. It's great to see a show this well produced and featuring a long ago time period that may have some historical inaccuracies but not overly so. We need more period dramas out there and it's a great thing to see a very good one on television being produced somewhere and in english. So I would say that any fan of dectective series that take place in the past should enjoy this show. It's fun to just sit back and take in the atmosphere.

The concentration on gore and spaghetti shots is as off-putting as the continual barrage of politically correct messages.My wife and I were expecting a series with genuine substance. From several of the positive reviewer comments, it seems this series is considered great viewing among those who regularly buy lottery tickets.

This gives fans of their first three albums (78-82) exactly want they've been waiting for for the last 18 years! A raw AC/DC boogie approach with bitter violent street rock lyrics! Best moments:\\"17 stitches\\", \\"union man\\", \\"stir crazy\\" and \\"heat of the moment\\". The best heavy metal reunions so far are LIZZY BORDEN's \\"Deal With the devil\\", WITCHFYNDE's \\"Witching Hour\\" and ROSE TATTOO's \\"Pain\\". More please, guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest lead singer AC/DC never had!","review":"Rose Tattoo are just great. No disrespect to the other guys but frontman Angry Anderson is the business! Bad, vibrant and on stage, he has that same charisma/sense of hunour that made Bon Scott so great with early AC/DC. Angus and Malcolm Young should listen to this CD and think just how much better Angry's voice is than Brian Johnson's these days.Pulling Angry into AC/DC would inject new life into the band and make them vibrant again. Combine Angry's voice (and harder lyrics) with Angus and Malcolm's riffs and there's a classic album in the making for sure!In the meantime, enjoy this CD from one of the orginal hard rockin' bands that sound as good today as they did in the late 70s and early 80s. It's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lester Flatt: RCA Country Legend","review":"This is the GREATEST. I have been waiting years for this. It was worth the wait.

Resolution and color depth is really poor. Watching DVD's on this monitor are practically impossible, all the people are RED and black. Its obviously not the DVD as I have a DVD player at home hooked up to a TV. The issue is not the brightness and contrast on the monitor as I have tried that as well.2. My monitor now has a wonderful WHITE line in the middle of the screen. The one issue is my monitor is 2 years old, but still this white line means I am going to have to throw this away. I initially paid 400.00 for it and now i really regret it.3. Please read point #1.

It came factory sealed. (Best Buy was sold out when I drove 2 hours to get one.) It has gone out after 10 months of use and Westinghouse will not honor the warranty nor give me any help with figuring out what is wrong with it to service it.

As mentioned in the other reviews, I also found the stand a bit \\"cheap\\" but where else can you get a 22 in LCD for this price! Still unable to make the speakers work, but not a big concern. Anyhow, strongly recommend this one if you can get it for under $200."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value, Great Picture with DVI Connection","review":"I paid $180 (no sales tax) for this monitor at Best Buy. With a DVI connection, the picture is superb. VGA connection shows noticeably blurred text, to be expected on an LCD.For the price, this monitor is hard to beat.

You will definitely notice the difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"BF2 gaming ok","review":"I also bought mine at BestBuy in store for $180.

I did not test it.Cons: No DVI cable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Picture is good, other details so-so","review":"This monitor has a good picture. So much desktop real estate improves productivity.It has DVI and VGA inputs, which is good. The monitor automatically and correctly chooses the input if there is only one input signal. If both inputs have signals, it takes a painful 7 button presses to switch to the other input.The monitor obediently switches to power save mode when instructed by the video source. But, it takes a relatively long time (5+ seconds) to come out of power save when the source is restored (eg after moving the mouse or pressing a key). My other monitor comes back in less than 2 seconds."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY VERY short life","review":"I loved this monitor when I purchased it.

It was very bright, out of the box, but some adjustment on both the monitor and the computer gamma settings fixed that right up.My desk is at perfect height for the angle of the monitor, but the angle is not adjustable, so keep that in mind.One other thing, if you play games, make sure your video card can handle the native resolution (1680x1050) or you will have to run it at a lower resolution.Overall, I really like this monitor and would definitely buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Life","review":"I purchased 2 of these monitors 23 months ago.

However, when it was hooked up to my desktop it worked well, and I had no problems with it considering the price (180). Do not buy this if you plan to hook it up to a laptop.

It is extremely well written, and full of fascinating anecdotes.

The main reason Mexico went to war against the United States was because it didn't won't slavery. Because Mexicans had been subjugated to slavery under Spain.3) Mexicans also became slaves under the United States.

He is protecting California at the year 1850 he is a family person in San Francisco with a wife and a son. As a family person he has kind of family problems. He can't keep his promises towards his wife and she going to see another man. Well well this is definitely not the Zorro I knew and I did feel that one of the best heroes of my childhood is turning in to something different. The only similarity I found is that he is still after the bad guys and still protecting the good but I am not sure anymore about his future.For a project of $80 Million dollars I was expecting much more I do not recommend this movie and I will give it 2 stars only for the beauty of Banderas and Zeta-Jones."},{"rating":"2","title":"BANDERAS IS ZORRO","review":"This adventuresome comedy depicts Zorro (Antonio Banderas) as a balancing force for good; the savior he should be. But, after ten years of fighting injustice, he now faces his greatest challenge: his loving wife Elana (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is throwing him out of the house.Zorro's counterpart, Alejandro de la Vega, fearful of the loss of his family, stops only for a moment to renew romance to save the lost marriage, and the lost hope that his ten year old son displays in him, without knowing that his father is Zorro.Great family entertainment.The added features show the special effects and how the sequences are constructed and are very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent sequel","review":"As sequels go, this one was entertaining.

If California was about to become the 31st state, then the flags would only have 30 stars...The map of the United States that they used is the WRONG one!

There are some good elements lost in the mess, but they're crushed under layer upon layer of other stuff, that was seemingly added by an endless parade of Hollywood executives.Zorro is still a great, enduring icon, probably today moreso than ever. But when the filmmakers make a Zorro movie that isn't about a charismatic swashbuckler, but instead seems to center on explosions, a weird proto-socialism and divorce (in 19th century California, no less), you know the heart of the film has gotten lost. Oh, and there's some truly awful \\"cute kid\\" and \\"cute animal\\" bits.Skip this one and watch the original a second time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie Good, DVD Bad","review":"If I was reviewing the movie itself, I would give it three stars. While a lot of fun and I enjoyed it thoroughly, the plot itself had more holes than a colandar. It just didn't have the quality of the first movie.I gave this review one star because of the DVD itself. Apparently, Sony took the full screen version and cropped off the top and bottom of the screen to make it appear to be widescreen. There were many instances of the tops of heads being truncated and, in the scenes where Zorro is talking to his son in Spanish, many of the English subtitles had been cropped out. I found that part especially annoying!Frankly, presenting this as widescreen is out and out fraud.

The intro is kind of misleading because it's kind of hot, but most of the album isn't. Some songs play with the beat for so long that it makes you want to skip it (see track #11). Also, I didn't like how an old Outkast beat was jacked on track #9(from the Aquemini outro). Speaking of Aquemini, the hook from \\"Slump\\" was jacked too (on track #13). This album did make me wonder where Witchdoctor went. He's so underrated. If you're not a die hard southern rap fan, skip this one.Personal Favorites: Concrete Law, Hit & Run, Lord Have Mercy, 5 Duece - 4 Tre, & Come See Me"},{"rating":"2","title":"it aint that bad","review":"maybe im a little biased because ive known this brother for over 20 years but i dont think the albumn is that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"one dissapointed cuzz from tha souf","review":"This album was aiight. the only reason why i didn't give it 3starz was because it was below my expectations.

However I also just bought a couple of 2GB SanDisk Ultra II cards. The printer doesn't recognize these cards when inserted into the appropriate slot - it gives an error message that the card could not be recognized.

Unfortunately I did not found anything new, nor interesting, nor inspiring.Sorry to say but waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book All Around","review":"This book is written in a very easy to read format that people from almost any sector of business, manufacturing, or service can relate to. The practical guidance it offers in understanding lean is fantastic, especially for anyone/organization considering beginning a lean journey. A format/theory is offered, yet with caution to find one's own way, that makes complete sense. Lean isn't easy and the authors make it clear, but they provide ways of thinking through a lean journey that I think EVERY lean leader should consider. I wish Jamie and Andy would write even more books on lean. Great stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book that Doesn't Go Away","review":"I will agree with just all the other reviews listed. It is an excellent Lean book and very well written. It appeals to both a novice and a seasoned Lean practitioner, a testimonial to the authors.What I found interesting in the reading is the ease in which the authors discuss Lean; a quality that comes from someone that has lived it versus just writing and teaching it. I liked the fact that they took on the subject without all the jargon and references to Toyota. It made it a much easier read and more practical. In fact, so practical that you felt the authors had added insight about your company. Knowing that was not true, I realized that it was about the thoughts they had stimulated. This is a book that doesn't go away. You keep referring to it time and time again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced - Just a workbook - Expected more - Nothing New","review":"I read the review of the book prior to buying the book and I was impressed by the way the review was written. When the \\"work booklet\\" came, I was immediately disappointed because I expected, for the price, a \\"hard bound book\\" with some real depth of the game including many techniques to try. The booklet was so small that I read everything within an hour. The 24 hour service was to call the casinos around the U.S. I did'nt need that. I felt that I should be able to call the Author or someone associated with the Author and get some real Help, as we say (from the horses mouth). This booklet gave 1 technique and I have known about that from other books. Personally, I wish I didn't buy this book. As far as I am concerned I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTING","review":"Why do so many of the previous 5 star reviews include a plug for a future edition of this book or a direct reference to the author as a friend? Could it be they're less than truthful, or at least biased? In fact, this book is already outdated, and it's advice for making a feature film for less than $10,000 is ludicrous. If the author had added a \\"0\\" to the sensational title and dealt with REAL WORLD facts and tips about making such a film this could've been a good book. As it is, it's nearly useless because it has no connection to how to REALLY make a micro-budget movie (ie. video or gray market stock, credit cards, deferrals, etc.)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good book for starting film novices.","review":"Don't be fooled that after you follow this book, and make your \\"used car\\" budget film that you'll soon see it on the big screens everywhere. You'll end up with a first project on a journey of a long learning process. Is it better to spend the ten grand for school? Maybe. A lot can be said for taking that plunge into cold water and getting your feet wet. Although, some people want the prestige of a piece of paper from an institution. Most of the methods are sound, but the book is pretty much outdated for today's high tech world. Beginning filmmakers rarely shoot on film, but instead go for cheaper video. It's a less painful process. Especially for your pocketbook. It's a good book for student or hobby filmmakers. But please don't shoot a feature using this book as an example.

The only advantage the DC powered pump had was that it would have been a complete spare pump should one of the main pumps fail. With the Powersource 1800 backup I have backup power not only for the sump pump, but also a power source to power radios, computers, phone, small electric heater, etc. in case of an power outage emergency.

It is not the same version as the one that was released internationally, that cd was acombination of this album and of TNT, both which are imports. Here we have 8 meaty tracks that we can sink are teeth into. From the very beginning, the band proved they could rock, and that they would be a force to reckon with in the coming years. You want tracks that rock, then I suggest you listen to: SHE'S GOT BALLS, LITTLE LOVER, BABY PLEASE DONT GO, SHOW BUSINESS, SOUL STRIPPER. The only track I think is a little below the rest is STICK AROUND, its not a bad song, but it is just average compared to the others. You want a surprise, then I suggest you listen to LOVE SONG. Its an AC/DC power ballad long before these type of songs became the rage in the 80's. So recommend that you get you hands on this album any way you can.

The work of George Marino ( as credited) is brilliant.Absolutely none of this is dated. And to show just how good this album/cd is, the album still has fan faves that work in concert.My only complaint on re-hearing this album in remaster form after more than 15 years, is that the JACK has lyrics that are very different to the current ( last ten years or so) version of the song, and it is really Bon Scotts lyrics that are so very superior in form to what Brian sings. Bon is the better singer, but since he has passed on in flesh, and lives on in album, we will not know just how good the current band would be with Bon.Buy and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Awesome C.D.

The other night he sat me down to listen to the Bonfire box set- I was hooked on Bon Scott. Up to this point I owned only Ballbreaker and Stiff upper lip, I have since bought all Bon Scott cd's and have to say this is rock energized to the max. IMHO the newer stuff sounds tired but then as we age we all slow down and with all the touring and hard living these lads have done I guess they have the earned rite to sound tired.

Graded alongside other 311 albums this fairs very well - only suffering for a slightly thinner guitar mix than their last album, \\"Soundsystem\\". Standout tracks are the dynamic title track, the relentless \\"Wake Your Mind Up\\", the jazzy \\"Champagne\\" and the melodic singalong \\"I'll Be Here Awhile\\". In terms of what 311 can offer in comparison to their contemporaries, 311 are unmatched - purely because no one else mixes it up like them. RHCP are obvious analogy candidates but even they have taken a more well thoughtout commercial route. \\"From Chaos\\" is an album that relies on straight-down-the-line, honest, fun music and lyrics. Okay, so they're not as profound as Joni Mitchell or Bob Dylan, but that's not the point. This is an album you can put on and it makes you feel good. Why these guys aren't bigger here in the UK beats me."},{"rating":"2","title":"311 does it again","review":"311 is one of those bands that doesn't get credit for doing what no other band does and thats combining so many different kinds of music and making it sound good. I wasn't too impressed with an album like 311's self-titled, which is to me a bunch of random lyrics spitted out between guitar riffs...it gets old very fast. \\"From Chaos\\" is almost like another little step from \\"Soundsystem\\" (which I think is the album that really showed off 311's style). This is the first time 311 really took time on their lyrics and made them mean something for everyone. Tracks like \\"Amber\\", \\"I'll be Here Awhile\\", and \\"Champagne\\" are the more mellow tracks that show off 311's amazing sound. Of course you have to like 311's hard rocking style too. If you like \\"From Chaos\\" then defintely get \\"Evolver\\" (the newest one) that album to me completes 311's music."},{"rating":"2","title":"True 311 Fan","review":"I've been a 311 fan for close to seven years now and have every album including the Live version and the video. Out of their true albums that they've release I would rank this fourth best. Every real 311 fan knows that Grassroots is by far the best. The blue album and Music are a very close second and third. Transistor would have to rank fifth and I hate to say it but Soundsystem is just not really good, that is if you really listen to 311. From Chaos is an excellent album. It was nice to finally hear 311 go back to their roots with hardcore rap and reggae that didn't have cheesy lyrics like Soundsystem. Basically, every song is good especially 1, 2, 4, 11, 12. My least favorite song is the single, You Wouldn't Believe and, even that's a good song. I would definitely buy this album especially if your a 311 fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Combination of Grassroots and Soundsystem","review":"I think this new album sounds fantastic in comparison to the last two, which I found alright at first but got bored of them quite quickly. I can't see that happening with this one so much.It struck me as being similar to soundsystem but with the sounds of the album grassroots as well. It's just a pity it doesn't have some of the funkyness of music.Sa's vocals are far more prevalent than they have been in a long time which is a great thing and Nicks vocals are as good as always.In the lead up to this album I was wondering what 311 would have to do to not be boring without going in a completely different direction or going electronic, but they proved me wrong with this one.I can never really see 311 returning to the glory and brilliance of the self-titled album but this album is a big step closer."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Chaos...The 311 legacy continues.","review":"in this new album 311 uses their unique style of music that only they could produce...it is an energy packed, over-all great album which has multiple musical personalities, including ska-ish, reggae-ish, rock-ish, alternative type songs. 311 has been great form the start and they are continuing their streak of greatness with this album..."},{"rating":"2","title":"delicious","review":"311 are the greatest. i'm not one of those jerks who say they are down with 311 when all they own is the blue album. 311 have been rockin' me raw since they're debut(music) all the way to this feast. enjoy it, cuz if you don't then you're not right. keep listening to limp bizkit and [stuff] like that, you morons. 311, aaaaaaaaaaah pure deliciousness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than any of their recent CDs","review":"Overall, From Chaos is a very good CD.

Fans of Music and Grassroots will appreciate 311's latest effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"simply terrible","review":"i have been listening to 311 since 1995. i loved them back then, and as time goes on they seem to get worse and worse. this album is proof of that fact. it is their worst effort yet, and i am both saddened and disappointed. i would advise anyone thinking about buying this album to not waste their money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Variety","review":"As always 311 has released another great CD. With songs such as Amber, I Told Myself, and You Wouldn't Believe, this album is no less than any other they've put out. They've retained their unique sound in all of their songs and no 311 fan can afford not to buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"Some of 311's stuff is amazing and then some of it is just so so (TO ME)... But anyways yeah I've been listening to this cd straight through and its rare that I dont skip songs. So... Yeah. I think they did pretty good on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uneven","review":"I am a huge 311 fan. They are my favortite band for many reasons..From Chaos i believe is thier weakest album..The first half of the album i never could get into and i find myself always skipping to the later tracks...I still think this is a great album, but songs like you get worked and full ride have to be my least favorite 311 songs, and brings down the album as a whole..however, songs like uncalm and wake your mind up kick offer much better listens..I always thought of this album as a b-side to the blue album. Def. there weakest of thier 8 studio recordings..grassroots and transistor being the top 2"},{"rating":"2","title":"From Chaos comes clarity, I tell ya!","review":"This album is great. I own 8 out of the 11 albums they came out with and From Chaos is really good! \\"Uncalm\\" is on my top 3 most favorite songs from 311. All the songs are ridiculously sick-tight! And yes, \\"Amber\\" is a good song (still), even though it got played a trillion times. I still like it even though there are 311 bandwagoners out there who recently made 311 their favorite band because of that song!!!!By the way, Kroq 104.1 are 311 haters! They didn't even play the 311 songs I requested on 311 DAY!, but now they're playing some 311 songs only because 311 is coming to Fresno! Anyways, 4 stars for FROM CHAOS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"311 Loses Their Beat on this CD","review":"While I was reading these reviews, I was amazed at how many people raved that 'From Chaos' was the best album since their self-titeld release. You people cannot be true 311 fans if you think this CD even compares to 'Music' or the Blue Album. Soundsystem was a great CD with a fresh 311 sound, but on From Chaos, there are only a handful of songs that I consider 311 worthy. Songs like 'You Get Worked', 'I Told Myself', and 'Sick Tight', are just knock offs of the Blue Album. From Chaos, Amber, Hostile Apostle and Full Ride are the only songs that reflect 311's style. All in all, I'd say that From Chaos is my least favorite 311 CD, but it is worth the money if you are a real fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"uuuuuuuuugggggghhhhhhhhhhh","review":"I found this CD, actually not mine, and at first I thought it really rocked, but the more I listened the more all the music seemed become a blur of noise...nothing very memorable save Amber, maybe. Don't buy this CD, save your money. I don't feel this music at all..its just annoying with that \\"SA\\" guy who can't rap at all...the high nasal whinning sounds of Eminem or something...and Nicks voice is so monotonus, sounds lika robot. Anyway theres not much to this CD, just the same old same old. Either their pushing it too much or boring the [stuff]out of you. Pretty [bad]. Don't bother. Oh, and by the way, No Doubt and RHCP ARE way better, I'd buy their stuff over this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastico","review":"I think this is there best cd yet.

From their first single \\"You Wouldn't Belive\\" and to the other tracks the cd is worth adding to your 311 collection. For fans of 311 this is a must but if your looking into becoming a 311 fan buy their other albums first like grassroots 311 soundsystem and live to really experiance the power of 311."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of funky grooves","review":"I like 311, I think they are one of the premier funk rap/rock bands of today, songs like \\"Come Original\\" proive it. Thier followup to thier album \\"Soundsystem\\" is a good one filled with numerous songs that are good and that you can groove to. My favorites on this album are: \\"You Wouldn't Believe\\", \\"I'll be here Awhile\\", \\"Amber\\", \\"Sick Tight\\", \\"From Chaos\\" and \\"Hostle Apostle\\". I love the lyrical delivery by Nick Hexum truly a standout vocalist. Not to mention how good the rythym section works together for fans of the new Rap/metal genre or 311 check out this cd"},{"rating":"2","title":"311's Newest CD","review":"Well, I've got them all, 311, Grass Roots, Music, Live, Transistor, Soundsystem, and now From Chaos. 311 does it all. They touch on raggae, rock, rap, techno, just everything. This CD is a must for the true 311 fans. Songs vary in overall appeal, but 311 is still putting out a great album. Not my personal favorite, but a great collection of tracks from a band who is saying some pretty deep things. The title track is just incredible, and the rest follow behind it. You cant go wrong with this one, but check out the other ones too. \\"Music\\" and \\"Soundsystem\\" are my personal favorites...Ben"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funk-Rap Fusion","review":"311 is back in form - they've always had a hip, goofy edge to their music, which can be a dangerous thing as it can delve into the cheesy (um, that AI song on Soundsystem?). They've also been a powerful fusion band from the beginning, incorporating funk, metal, rap, reggae, even jazz into some of their recordings. This album represents a step up on the fusion line, and perfects their fun edge without being silly. I've only listened to it a couple of times, but overall I'd say it is a great, new-sounding album that should put Omaha, Nebraska (or is it L.A. now?) back on the map. Honestly, this album shows growth in the same way that Pearl Jam's progression of albums does. If you're looking for 311's best album, I'd probably suggest Music, but I think this effort is awesome - you really have to hear it to understand how a seemingly passe genre (i.e., rap-rock) can still take new directions and make some exciting, exotic-ally flavored music."},{"rating":"2","title":"311 From Choas","review":"For 311 fans this is a must buy. After listening for the first time you can hear different elements from all of their previous albums. From the harder stuff to the softer this is a great album by the boys from Nebraska."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent - 311's Best","review":"Once in every band's career, all the stars align, things come into focus, and an album is made that will remain as the nexus of that band's musical output. For 311, \\"From Chaos\\" is that album. The differing styles, experimentation, and phases that 311 have gone through over the past 10 years or so all come together in this album: the laid-back musings typical of \\"Transistor,\\" the riff-heavy metal of \\"Grassroots,\\" the positivity of \\"311,\\" the clean arrangements and spare production of \\"Music,\\" and the forward-looking approach of \\"Soundsystem\\" can all be found on this album. Each of those previous albums is an outstanding collection in its own right, but \\"From Chaos\\" typefies the 311 sound-- and lays the groundwork for the future for this one-of-a-kind band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tied With Grassroots as arguably the best 311 album","review":"I bought this the day it came out. I also bought this on vinyl (limited to 4000 onl available from the website or concerts). When I first bought this, I rarely listend to it and stuck with my at that time favorite Soundsystem. Then I rediscovered this. This has some great tunes to relax with (Champagne, Amber, I'll Be Here A While) as well as some great rockers (Wake Your Mind Up, You Get Worked, Uncalm). Simply, this would make a great first cd for a new 311 fan, also, vinyl is still cool so get the LP while you still can. 5 outtakes (which are pretty good as are most cut songs) from this and one from the Soundsystem sessions can be found on the bonus EP that comes with the Enlarged To Show Detail 2 VHS and DVD which I highly recommend too. Simply put, this album is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah","review":"It sounds like they tried to combine all of thier styles that have been heard on different albums. Some of thier songs sound similar to Sound System, while others are like Transistor or Grassroots. It's unique for them because they have thier newer style but their bringing back the old stuff too. Personaly, I like Transistor and Grassroots the best out of all thier albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"FROM CHAOS ROCKS","review":"From Chaos is the BEST 311 album for I while. I didn't like Soundsystem that much, so From Chaos is a significant improvement to my ears. Their style is more **In your face** to start with and mellows out in other parts.Overalll the different styles mix in nicely together and it is an AWESOME ALBUM: If you don't have it, grab it, it ROCKS!!!I still think the 311 album *music* is better, although it is different.Some versions of FROM CHAOS also have the bonus track *We Do It Like This* and a multimedia component (The Australian version does.... :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly disappointed","review":"Before the album came out, 311music.com said that this was going to be a beautiful album. Instead, it turns out to sound like \\"Grassroots,\\" only 5 times worse.

My mom kind of digs it, but otherwise it doesn't get played at all. I think it's safe to say that 311 went \\"Britney\\" on this album, with all the recycled beats and songs about female \\"empowerment\\". It doesn't really sound good though. I actually ran into Nick Hexum a few weeks back and he had nothing but good things to say about this album. I asked if I could sneak a listen to a few tracks so we went out to his car and turned it up. And then I turned it off. Who do these guys think they are, Janet Jackson?! I gave Nick my honest take on the four songs he let me listen to and he took a few minutes to fully digest it. And then he punched me in the face. He said that \\"in the end, revenge sends zen to the defendant.\\" And I said that \\"in the end, SA Martinez is a flower and a [bad]MC!\\" before sprinting away. I definitely liked these guys better when they were called C&C Music Factory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good...","review":"I'm not a 311 hater, it's just that I think this cd has a lot of filler.

I am not this harsh on most games, but this game is the worst I have ever played. It is very difficult to control, and to drive the nice cars (ferrari,porsche) you have to win a lot of races. It is not enjoyable, very non-addictive, so-so graphics, and there is not a very good choice of tracks. The graphics of the cars are so bad you can't tell what kind of car your driving. The only good part of this game is that you can customize each car.

Yes, I often make my decision on where to eat after reading reviews of people who ACTUALLY HAVE NOT BEEN THERE, AND HAVE NOT EATEN ANY OF THEIR FOOD. Does this seem slightly absurd to you?At least the second reviewer has ACTUALLY PLAYED THE GAME. Let's see, who would I trust more--one who has played it or one who has NOT played it? Well let's see--which mechanic would you choose--one that is qualified, or one who doesn't even ACTUALLY own tools? Which Doctor would you choose?

I would rather play Pole Position than this game anyday. The controls are absolutely horrendous, with your car wanting to skid 24-7 on every turn. The in-view camera is even worse. The game attempts to copy Gran Turismo, but the game fails miserably at achieving mediocre status. To put it mildly, after purchasing the game, I returned the game within a day. Overall, get this game if you're desperate. Otherwise, stick with any other driving title -- even Looney Tunes Racing is much better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is stupid","review":"I rented this game about 2 days ago and returned it yesterday.

There games are always good. Just wait for Gran Turismo 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better Driving Games out there!!!","review":"Alright, i love driving games!! Especially ones that look at feel like driving a real car. This game falls short on all counts. The graphics for the game are impressive, but that is about it. No attention to driving details. Steering reacts like you are driving a go-cart, and handling is very unrealistic. The problem lies in the fact that when the car turns it pivots from the exact center of the car. instead of the front wheels pulling the car in the diretion of the turn..If you like driving games and want to spend your money on a driving game, go get Ridge Racer V, or GT3.

I started making bread and this mixer simply wasn't powerful enough. This professional powerful mixer handles bread dough and other heavy duty mixing very well. I read many of the other reviews and was somewhat apprehensive of my purchase. I have found that like any other small appliance; it took a little time to get used to the difference between the mixers. I like this machines extra capacity,power, and stability. This mixers bowl can be raised or lowered closer, or further ,to beatens simply by turning a screw in the front of the stand which solves some of the scraping problem mentioned in one reveiw. On the negative side-this machines beater's do not rotate as fast as my previous mixers. I wish it was faster but overall I enjoy this machine and like the extra power and capacity. Sincerely, Gail Benjamin-Albuquerque, NM"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I've had a 350 watt, 5 qt, Kitchenaid mixer for 25 years that still works perfectly. When I saw this more powerful one, I decided to buy it--solid state, bigger bowl, more power for bread dough, plus mine was harvest gold color--yechh.I was so disappointed in this new model: it's much noisier and doesn't seem to mix as well (need to scrape more often, even though the beaters are perfectly positioned); the design of the handle on the bowl is most uncomfortable when trying to carry with one hand or empty batter into the baking pan.Unfortunately, I'd given my old one away, but I am so disappointed in the new one that I've purchased the 5-qt Commercial model and am getting rid of this new one.Still, I would probably recommend this model if you make BIG batches or a lot of bread and need the extra power and capacity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic gears!!!!","review":"Sorry to disagree with most folks.

I find the bowl difficult to remove and I don't think that it mixes well; a lot of scraping necessary. It is great for bread kneeding; that's about it though.

We use it very often, and have used it in a single day for about 8 hours straight of mixing, it barely got warm. We have never had a problem with it, so I can't comment on any service issues, but we have been so happy with it that if it did break, we would rush out and get the exact same one again. That said, I do agree that the stationary head can be a hassle at times, but this is a minor issue the majority of the time. Be aware, however, that it is a heavy mixer to lift, so if you will need to position it every time you use it (as I do) and you have difficulty lifting a somewhat heavy object, you may want to consider another mixer, but you will never get the quality of a Kitchenaid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Thought about buying the 325 watt machine, but wanted the something more powerful so I could just cruise through smaller batches without the chance of straining the motor.

Perhaps I'll just initate that--and drop in this CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time with this","review":"Don't insult these two lengendary groups by buying this cd. If you really love these two groups, go buy other cd's where they are not joined at the hip. The Delfonics have 200 great songs, why try to put 5 on one cd? This cd is just an example of the man trying to make extra money."},{"rating":"1","title":"this sound track is not recorded from the original artists and is in very bad rythmn and dialect.","review":"This is one of the times in which I can truly say without intent that this is one of the most poorly made copy of the Delphonics and the Chilites you will ever here. It's such a let down that I stopped buying CDs' for a short while. I would not advise anyone to purchase this CD, not even my worst enemy![...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sensitive \\"Vermonty\\" book","review":"Of any book I've read the masterful description of a man falling in love is most fascinating and heart wrenching. \\"Seasoned Timber\\" is about personal morality. It takes place in the 1930's in a small fictional Vermont town at a poor private boarding school. The life portrayed is set against the backdrop of a world in turmoil. The present reader knows World War II was about to start. But Dorothy Canfield Fisher wrote the book in 1939. The principal of the school has fallen in love with a woman half his age and is also grappling with the moral issue of declining a $1 million gift to the school with the stipulation that no Jewish students be allowed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Encore Please!","review":"Well, I do not own Surrender. So I thought Encore was the perfect follow up to The Andrew Lloyd Webber Collection which contains his most famous songs.Encore is kind of refreshing to me as I have not heard any of the tracks besides Think Of Me from Phantom Of The Opera. Reworkings such as With One Look from Sunset Boulevard and Memory from Cats - are both sung here in Italian.I especially like Away From You from Rex and Whistle Down The Wind as these are sung with a lovely lilt. Look out for other rare and unreleased tracks like One More Walk Around The Garden, What More Do I Need and In The Mandarin's Orchid Garden.This is great record for quiet Saturday afternoons where you can hear Sarah weave her vocal magic around these songs. Encore keeps growing on me each time I listen to it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely - Just Lovely!","review":"Overall I was very pleased with the content and quality of this CD. Once again, Sarah sings beautifully. I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 simply because, like another reviewer, I, too, felt that it contained too much old material. I used to enjoy 'Memory' but it's been overdone to the point that I cringe when I hear it now. It's sung in Italian here and called 'Piano' but it's still 'Memory'.I especially liked 'One More Walk Around the Garden' (Carmelina), 'There is More to Love' (Aspects of Love), 'The Last Man in My Life' (Song and Dance) and 'Chi Il Bel Sogno Di Doretta' (La Rondine). 'If I Ever Fall In Love Again' (The Crooked Mile) is especially well done as well.I do enjoy playing the CD but I find that I pick the songs that I play rather than allowing it to play all the way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm so sorry for that \\"Music Fan\\"...","review":"I didn't know Sydney, Australia is such a culture desert. Sarah is the one and only diva that can interpret the songs so delicately. It's not only because of the high notes, her young voice, romantic lyrics, orchestral music, theatrical magic... it's the emotion that penetrates you until it [stinks] up your soul. Someone compares it with a spiritual experience. I say it's an addiction.I like \\"Nothing Like You've Ever Known\\" and \\"Whistle Down the Wind\\". This album has many songs that I've already had, so I only give it 4 stars. The albums \\"Time to Say Goodbye\\", \\"Eden\\" and \\"La Luna\\" are the must-see. (Or should I say... the must-listen, must-own...)Enjoy the richness of Sarah's music. If you can't comprehend, I feel sorry for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"No! Please no more!","review":"If you like Sarah I guess you'll love this stuff, but it's depressing to realise how many do. This collection is more of the same: a thin voice that's so characterless it could have been computer-generated.Seeing on these pages that people who've bought a Sarah Brightman CD are also likely to have bought Bocelli and Celine Dion, makes one suspect there is a computer somewhere with an evil genius cackling over a keyboard.These singers have one thing in common: voices like fog horns with no tone, no finesse and a mechanical ability to hit notes that would peel paint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sarah, we need new material! PLEASE!","review":"I've been a Brightman fan for 12 years, and I can't TELL you how irritated I am that she is recycling her work to the degree that she has of late. I've been listening to most of the songs on this album for AGES. We need something new! Please! I'm giving this CD 1 star not because the music is bad--on the contrary, it's quite good. But, I can't handle ANOTHER Sarah CD that isn't all new music. I can only hope that Sarah and Frank Peterson frequent Amazon and read these reviews so that they will know it's time for something fresh. (Incidentally, I realize that this CD was released by the Really Useful Group (ALW). Even so, there isn't enough new material here to warrant this album.) Seeing another retread of her songs is making me want to amplify my search for new/different/better artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classy,Romantic, And Stirring.","review":"Encore is the perfect CD for those who love diversity. Classy, Romantic and Stirring. My two favorites are Piano and One More Walk Around The Garden.Piano (Memory)is even more soul stirring in Italian than the english version.If the english version was perfection she improved upon it. One More Walk Around The Garden is sad and soul stirring bringing a tear to the eye on every play.Sarah sings her way through every song with the voice that earned her the title Angel of Music.Everyone a Gem. A must have for every true fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"encoe cd by sarah brightman","review":"sarah brightmans new encore just rocks. buy it today its number one with clarabelle collins infact i do listen to it all of the time. been a very faithful fan of sarahs for so many years now. i think she is a great singer and. also a nice lady my big dream is to meet her inperson someday. if iam lucky enough to but who knows its a small world after all. yours truly clarabelle"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great CD, but nothing new.","review":"Sadly, as with much of Sarah Brightman's recent record releases, this album is not much more than recycled material from her sucessful European album Surrender: The Unexpected Songs. If you like the variation on the Andrew Lloyd Webber songs (Songs from Cats and Sunset Boulevard in Italian etc), or really want a more substantial version of this album, I would highly suggest a copy of the Surrender import, as you will find it much more musically satisfying. Like La Luna (recycled material from her '95 Import Fly) Classics (stuff from many other albums) or The Andrew Lloyd Webber Album (recycled material from another import), this is nothing new. I guess the next step is for As I Came of Age to be resold as \\"The Early Years\\" and Dive to be resold as \\"Aqua\\". At this rate, maybe Sarah won't have to ever record a new album again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I have to agree","review":"I have to agree with the above review. As an early fan of Sarah Brightman, I have almost every one of these songs already on previous CD's; the same recordings and everything. While she truly has a beautiful voice, I just don't think it's very fair to her earlier fans when they want something new and fresh to listen to. Everything on this CD is recycled; I could have made it at home on my own computer! There are no new tracks and nothing very enticing about this CD to make me buy it. If Sarah decides to start recording some new songs instead of continuously marketing her old stuff, I might, just might, buy it then. But only until then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good translation of an important historical work","review":"For those unfamiliar with this work, it is the first work to contain a number of key figures in later drama and literature, including King Lear, Merlin, King Arthur, several of his knights including Kay and Bevedere, and Cymbeline.The work was compiled as a popular history of Britain in the same format that Saxo's Gesta Danum was written. It is thus an open question how much of the work comes from Welsh myths which have otherwise been lost. At the same time, the historical accuracy of the work is not very high.I rather liked the translation by Lewis Thorpe. His style is fairly matter-of-fact but nonetheless allows it to be read in a manner similar to the more challenging novels of today. All in all, I would highly recommend this work to anyone studying older Welsh material as well as those looking for the genesis of the Arthurian stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"back to basics death metal 102","review":"this takes them back to 93 after the end complete this sound like it should have follow that great cd not 12 years later.this is real solid metal no more experiment trials by fire / stick to what work brutal force riffs and landslide sound in double bass.extremly groovin guitar riffs and pure obituary style songs back to basics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer","review":"I enjoyed this album! It was about what I expected when I listened to it. Heavy metal, just what it is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Right on!!!!!!!Obituary is back!!!!!!!","review":"People it doesn't get any more brutal than obituary,I have been a fan since \\"slowly we rot\\",these guys are definately keeping it true,if you are a \\"TRUE\\"fan of real death metal then pick this up and listen to it over and over.Obituary does not disappoint,they are on the same line as Death and early Sepultura.I have seen them live numerous times,awesome show,if they come anywhere near you go see them,trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Obituary : \\"Frozen In Time\\"","review":"Yes, Obituary is back. Prepare to bash in some more skulls, and kick some teeth in because this is one brutal offering. I think it's the best Obituary I've heard since \\"Cause Of Death\\". The direction here is pure old school Obituary with the same massive crunch, grooving riffs, and the voice from hell that we all came to know and love back in early 90's...Not much has changed between now and then, and that's why I really enjoyed \\"Frozen In Time\\". They stayed true here, and the results are incredible in my opinion. I hadn't been listening to Obituary for years because I thought they were done. \\"Frozen In Time\\" is one hell of a comeback!!!...Great Job Guys!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good comeback","review":"I, like most thought Obituary had broke up err sumthin... but nope, they're back, and still pretty damn good. Some songs a bit ont he repetative side, but at least they have the same overall death metal sound!!!! Welcome back"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frozen in \\"Back from the Dead\\" Time","review":"I really think the album is a sequel to their last studio release Back From the Dead. Nothing new, a little boring, and not what I expected from a reunion album. I bought the album expecting to refresh some albums like Cause of Death, The End Complete and Slowly we Rot, and it did, in a very small way.Still , the album has great tracks... My favorite track is Lockjaw because it kind of mixes two Obituary stages through the years \\"Cause of Death\\" to \\"World Demise\\", On the Floor sounds a lot like Back to One from \\"The End Complete\\", and Slow Death is a good headbanging track. I'm really glad theyre back though, since Obituary is one of my favorite Death Metal bands. But we have to give credit where credit is due, and having bands like Vader and Dismember still around, we can see that the original essence can be kept. Not enough effort (in staying fresh, that is)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Redundant","review":"I was never a huge Obituary fan, but I liked their albums a bit. This one is pretty redundant though. A lot of the songs could almost be instrumentals. The riffs are definitely Alan West, but have little variation. John Tardy's vocals are better this time, he enunciates well. Overall, Obituary deliver a passable, if uncreative take on purist Death Metal with their trademark sound, but that's all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just for Check Ups","review":"This breathalyzer, I'm convinced, isn't totally accurate. However, it does tell when you have quite a bit of alcohol in your system. So if the number is incredibly high, it does not mean you are that number but it does mean that you are probably unsafe to get behind the wheel of a car. What I also like is that anybody can use it. You don't have to put your mouth around it, simply blow air towards the reader. Not a bad product for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Company President (small co.)","review":"We use it after gathering for sociial engagements. It is fun and sometimes eye opening.

Just a basic product"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"This product did Not work for us. We followed the directions to properly calibrate the device, but when it came to trying to get the breathalyzer to register, it was inaccurate. We tried numerous times, but the device would either not register, or would register a result and then within 5 minutes the result would be drastically different (example from .10 to .04). We decided that a better resource is to use good judgement versus the breathalyzer and Not drive after consuming any more than 1 drink. (We were attempting to see if we would 'know' when our blood alcohol level was above a .08, but the device certainly did not assist with the process.) Maybe a more expensive device would be more reliable. However - Amazon was very prompt about refunding our $30, and the return process was easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish i could give a negative star rating","review":"This did not work, blew 0.00 after 12 drinks..does not work and you should not buy it, this is a scam....they should not be able to sell it"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE --DOES NOT WORK DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"DO NOT BUY --INACCURATE READINGS..HAVE 2 BEERS AT .9 HAVE 10 RUM AND COKES .2"},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing is worthless.","review":"Blew a 0.00 the entire night.

This book contains two novellas and at first I didn't realize they were related.. The first is a brisk, seemingly silly little mystery featuring quirky characters but the second is a really profound portrait of regrets, aging and death, a little like Ethan Frome in tone, and brings in some characters from the first novella which me think that reading more of the series will bring out more depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST SAW THE PLAY","review":"It is a wild, woolly, farcical, slapstick, poetic-philosophical comedy, which deserves a reading, as the Irish accents can be largely non-understandable. The play had the feel of a classic, although it helps to know the times and the Irish reaction to it, historically."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their coolers are better!","review":"Poor instructions and difficult to build and set up. You have to go into command code to activate the remote. The hard drive cage and optical drive cage are a PITA! You need a long screw driver with a magnetic tip to install the mounting screws. The new version is greatly improved with better cages. If you want to use Vista and Zalman the new version of this case is the best that Zalman has to offer. The Upscale touch screen model does not work with Vista ATT. I'd recomend Silverstone over the Zalman cases even if the Silverstone is made out of steel and not aluminium as is the Zalman. After the install and getting the bugs worked out this unit is pretty good - getting to this point is the hard part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biscuits, butter, and a Bible Belt redhead!","review":"Myra Sims is a girl we think we know and really don't know as well as we thought. Gabe spins out the love of his life, his brother, family members, and himself in My Brother Michael as clearly as can be. But, we find that just maybe he didn't tell it all. Myra returns the favor in her own version of the story in Myra Sims. By reading both books you are able to get closer to the bottom of what might be closer to the truth. Janis Owens can sure tell a story and what's even better is that she can tell a story twice. Readers will devour both books and after doing so might just become confused about which version to believe. One thing is sure, both books move you right next door to a real Southern family. Before you know it you'll have a cravin' for biscuits, grits, fried pork, fresh coffee, and a big helpin' of anything that Janis Owens decides to put on paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book, fills in all gaps left out by Gabriel Catts.","review":"This excellent book fills in all the gaps left out by Gabriel Catts in the previous book, MY BROTHER MICHAEL.

The printing on the page is off to one side every now and then, the spelling errors are unbelieveable. I don't think there was any editing on this book whatsoever! The book is totally based on a MAN getting the job. What a MAN should wear to the interview. Even tells you how to pick out the correct tie to go with your perfect suit. But never, talks about a woman getting the job. I totally feel this is sexist and I'm VERY disappointed! Do NOT buy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!","review":"This book is a must for anyone who wants to be a 911 Dispatcher!The most helpful section in the book to me was the frequently asked questions in an oral board interview, how to answer these questions, and how to prepare for the oral board interview.MANY of the questions in the book were actually asked in my oral board interview!!And, having read the book, I felt confident and knew how to prepare and answer the questions effectively.And, yes, I did get the job.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Section is Great, while the rest is useless","review":"The only section worth reading in this books is the example section they give you for what you might be asked in an interview. The rest of the content is readily available on the web for free if not already common sense (dress, positive thinking, prep, resume). After reading I would say this \\"book\\" is worth $10. (By \\"book\\" I mean some photocopied pages put together with a cheap binding.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"PPK's Formirovanie is great if you love progressive trance. They are much better than Oakenfold at telling a story with their music. If you're not into listening to an entire 7 -10 minute song (they have a few of these), then you'll probably skip through most of the album.

The wussy monotonous mid-tempo drumming on every song drains the music of a lot of potential intensity. This is some of the most boring drumming you'll ever hear from a metal band, and it plays a significant part in relegating this band to the boring conventional mainstream drivel category. 5/10.If you want a metalcore album that will really kick your speakers in, check out the self-titled album from With Resistance. At least listen to it before you give me a not helpful vote, I'm trying to help you out here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Remains","review":"Ok for starters this band is amazingly awesome, extremely potent, breath taking, and powerful! Roadrunner found a gim when they found Still Remains. From start to finish these songs knock you down, kick you around and leave you w/no remorse! This cd rocks! The drumming and guitar work is simply amazing! The good tracks are To live and Die by fire, In Place of Hope, White Walls,Bliss, and Recovery but all the tracks are great check this band out NOW!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, but not amazing.","review":"An awesome CD, all in all.

This band is ideal for someone transitioning from punk/emo to metal. There are elements of these 2 types of music & is evidently quite a good mix. Overall their album is quite \\"moreish\\" in a way where all the songs are consistent; there is not a song I don't like. To give this album a wow factor, one or two songs need to hit the roof with either the vocals or music. I have not listened to their previous album, so I cannot compare at this stage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and Nasty, but it works","review":"A light in my garage went out, and this fixture was cheaper than replacing the ballast in the existing fixture. I thought, \\"how bad can it be?\\" Answer is . . . pretty bad. Very cheap construction and the parts did not fit together particularly well. No instructions were provided, but having done this several times that was not a real problem for me. The metal bends VERY easily, so be careful when installing it.That being said, it does work, and so far no annoying hum.If you want the cheapest alternative, this will work, but I would suggest spending a few dollars more (maybe $5) and getting something a bit better made. Halfway through installation, I considered replacing the ballast in the old fixture rather than installing this mess, but I was too lazy to deal with the delay and returning this fixture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!

It's dynamic. \\"Dirty Deeds\\" & \\"Ride On\\" are my favorites. AC/DC [like most bands] was better when they were young. Bon Scott had a firmer grasp on the human condition than Brian Johnson, though both wrote a lot of songs about poon, ballzzz, getting drunk, & not being nice all the time. Back in Black and DDDDC are the only AC/DC records I can listen to... both have just enough soul and hooks to keep me interested.

Pick this up after you get the classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is their best","review":"Am I the only person who thinks Bon Scott was vastly superior to Brian Johnson? AC/DC was a simple, brilliant blues-rock band in the early days. After Bon died they became a nostalgia act. Dirty Deeds is their artistic peak, and it is still fresh.

While I don't think it ranks as high as \\"High Voltage\\" or \\"Let There Be Rock,\\" \\"Dirty Deeds\\" is certainly a fine Bon Scott record with a few great moments. The near-flawless opening title track is thunderously good, with a catchy chorus and mean riffs from Angus Young. Killer cuts also include the classics \\"Problem Child\\" and the playfully juvenile \\"Big Balls,\\" as well as the blues-driven \\"Ride On.\\" There is only one wince-inducing moment, \\"Love at First Feel,\\" in which Bon's lust for an underage girl repelled this reviewer, but otherwise, \\"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap\\" is a good album that sounds dirty, but far from cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"ew","review":"waste of money, came late too, it does not taste anything like mango, in fact it tastes like a bad formula for kids"},{"rating":"1","title":"Many False Reviews","review":"I know for a fact that many of the Canus reviews are written by individuals that work for the company .

But,as it is, the content is a fascinating account of the unique crazy band-leader with contributions from his co-workers and close family. Some home-movie is included and shows (albeit briefly) how colourful the City Slickers shows were.

But after listening to it once, I have no desire to hear it again, and it's been shelved. Nevertheless, I'm glad I have it for the few Olivia tracks that are featured."},{"rating":"1","title":"sordid lives","review":"The music and lyric components of \\"Sordid Lives\\" is lively and entertaining. However, the inclusion of dialogue from the DVD is annoying and dissonant. The product labeling is not clear that this product is part of the actual soundtrack for the film (or series). The play goes from musical and fun to mumbled spoken lines by the cast- which if you have not seen the production, are confusing and interruptive to listening. I contacted the seller to see if he had sent me the wrong product. He responded that he did not know about dialogue/music, because the AMAZON LABEL did not include the info about the dialogue as part of the product description. IF I had known that, I would not have purchased the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"sandra d","review":"It is apparent that many of those who failed to garner any enjoyment truely believe ONJ to be Sandra Dee.

In comparison with most of her recordings, Olivia's songs in this album are pretty disappointing. Her participation is not what I would have expected. With the exception of two, the rest of her songs were not recorded in a studio; they were taken from the movie scenes. They are really brief, they have no music arrangements and the sound quality is awful. It is a pity that other artists had been treated better in this CD. Olivia songs sound terrible in comparison. Spare yourself the heartache of listening to Olivia's wonderful voice completely wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Away Now!","review":"Get away from this soundtrack now unless you are an absolute die-hard Olivia Newton-John fan. It is horrible. When you are used to Olivia's innocence and pure voice, it is just pure nerve wracking to listen to this. When she came out with it's a b**** sortin' out our sordid lives, and you'll probably get a really s***ty prize, that is just when I had to turn it off.

It may have worked when new though, so I cannot rate it on how it should work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh no, not again!!!","review":"This soundtrack is just the latest victim of a horrible concept: mixing dialogue from a movie with its soundtrack. If the dialogue cuts were separate from the tracks, maybe I could handle it by skipping the talk, but this one overlays the dialogue onto the tracks, much as they are timed in the movie. I am sick and tired of this trend. Plenty of soundtracks have been ruined for me in this manner, from Pulp Fiction to Desperado. Confound it, if I want to hear dialogue, I will buy the... movie and watch the appropriate sections. Cut this ... out!!! I buy a soundtrack for the MUSIC, not so I can \\"relive the magic of the film\\", or some such garbage. Sexy Beast is a great movie and contains a fantastic compilation of tunes, both techno and lounge, and I had hoped to have them all on what promised to be a great CD. I can pass on this absurdity."},{"rating":"1","title":"STOP THE DIALOGUE! GREAT SONGS RUINED","review":"I would give this soundtrack 4 stars for its tremendous blend of exciting music but the dialogue absolutely ruins every single track. I have my own life and groove I want to get on. I don't want to constantly be reminded of the same dialogue each and every time i pop in the CD. You can watch a movie two or three times and that is usually enough. But songs - you want to listen to good songs hundreds of times. ... believe me - no dialogue no matter how good can stand up to that kind of repeat listening. and besides, what if I want to play a song with a different mood in mind? I can't escape the mood set by the dialogue. I loved the movie. But if I want to hear dialogue I will watch my DVD. Stop this UNBELIEVABLY HORRIBLE trend. It is beyond terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy Beast-the definitive techno album","review":"I loved the movie, and now I am still groovin' to the soundtrack. Among the classics, (Stranglers, Dean Martin), are some incredible beat infested mixes by UNKLE and South. Go right to tracks 4 (Cocaine and Camcorders), and 7(Paranoid), and shake it fast to the UNKLE variations. Movie dialogue is a welcome treat; it's well-mixed, and there's even a snippet of the heart-to-heart Don had w/Gal by the beach in the film. Watch the movie, then throw a party afterwards with this CD blowin' through your speaker."},{"rating":"2","title":"definitley could do without but.....","review":"This movie has an ecclectic soundtrack which is a compilation of classic Henry Mancini songs mixed with U.N.K.L.E.tracks.

As my introduction to them, this compilation is not very good. Or maybe I just don't like the group's sound as much as all the other roots I've fallen in love with. Third World seems to lack a distinctive vocal sound. I found their harmonizing to be boring. The song that they're perhaps most known for, \\"96 Degrees in the Shade\\" is pretty mediocre in my opinion. Their version of Bunny Wailer's \\"Dream Land\\" is pretty weak. Maybe I need to check out their earliest albums, since the few songs on here I did think were decent were from their early days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the same book that was released before","review":"I purchased this book because my old paperback needed to be replaced. I also wanted this latest edition that covered his life after the war and with all of the photographs that the original book did not have. This is a wonderful book with many photos but if you have read the original book this is not the same. It does not have anywhere near the text or his personal accounts and stories from his war experiences that were in the original and that is very disappointing.

A different person led each lesson.We found it to be very easy and very rewarding. It is not very time-consuming, but it really does get you thinking about God's will for your life, and it generates some great discussion among the group.Some of the Just for Fun activities are kindof cheesy, like playing hide and seek and dancing around the room.

The game its self is really entertaining, with the goofy art style, and rock'on music, really makes it a \\"one of a kind\\". The controlls are pretty simple; attack, and jump is really all you do. This is your basic beat'em up game, only, is very difficult. Most likely the farthest you'll get to is stage 3 ( if your lucky ). If this game had infinite lives, it would had been a very challange, but exciting game. You don't get alot of lives, and when you lose them all you start from the very begining... The game has so much going for it, like the gameplay, the funny animation, and great music, BUT fails to be great because you can't get very far...2/6"},{"rating":"1","title":"excellent book, bad edition","review":"The edition of this book is very bad with plenty of spelling errors which at times make sentences difficult to understand. example: \\"eveque\\" (bishop) nine times out of ten is printed as \\"evoque\\" (to evoke), \\"maintenant\\" (now)becomes \\"main tenant\\" (hand holding (?))the first name \\"Boniface\\" at one stage becomes \\"Bon il face\\" (good he face (?)) and so on and so forth.Very sloppy work from Amazon for one of the most important French novel of the XIX century."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Definitive Racing Biography","review":"This book is still today a classic, and an absolute must for any motor racing fan-- independently of their favourite category. Beautifully written, it narrates in detail the life, times, and racing of one of Formula One's most intriguing drivers. It is full of interesting anectodes and important facts about Gilles Villeneuve's racing and his all too brief presence on the international scene. It is full of interesting notes on his character, personality, and private life-- never crossing the line, however, in morbid curiosity or tabloid cheapness. You will read it over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Biography","review":"Perhaps the definitive biography of Gilles Villeneuve, Donaldson writes very entertainingly, and the book will make you laugh and feel sad. He covers Villeneuve's personality well with quote's from freinds and family, and provides a balanced view of a warm, freindly, but sometimes naive and thoughtless person. Some of Gilles' exploits will shock, but it's amusing to hear from those on the receiving end. Covers his life and professional career chronologically and very well.

It was nice and a time saver that it had the \\"squirrel cage\\" fan attached so I didn't have to take the old one off my bad motor and attach it to the new one.

I have purchased (and enjoyed) the haribo gummi sour cherries and they were very fresh when I received them but they still had the gummi texture that I was looking for. I had someone else try the candy just to see if they agreed with me and they said the same thing I do, that these aren't anything like gummies. I don't know... maybe I got a bag from some weird mutant batch and maybe they aren't always like this.

Some of the hypothesizes are so bourgeois, it's hard to believe that any black person actually believed them.Still, this book focused only on presumably straight, black men. It doesn't interview black women, even though blacks have debated whether Friedan's \\"feminine mystique\\" even applies to them for decades. Don't let James Evans' position on Florida's working fool you: most black women were not barred from working by their husbands.Next the book lists the marital status of the black interviewees and just assumes that all of them would want female marriage partners anyway. Yes, this book was published only two years after the Stonewall Riots, but it still feels painfully heterosexist as a modern reader.Still, if you like books like \\"Black Metropolis\\" and \\"The Black Bourgeoisie\\", you might as well read this too.

Compared to Idle's contributions on the Python CDs, it is slightly less than extremely bad. Compared liberally to Idle's various work, from 'The Rutles' to 'Road to Mars' to 'Pass the Butler', it is no longer extremely bad but is still quite bad.

It's a little wider in diameter than many...another attribute that I wanted. In addition, I wanted a cap that would solidly click on to the lower portion when configured for writing...like this one does. I have a Cross Apogee which does NOT do that. Since the balance of the pen depends on the cap being attached when in writing mode, the solid lock of the Townsend is highly desirable. The Apogee cap sometimes comes loose when writing.The ordering process was easy on Amazon and the delivery was much faster than I'd expected.Cross rolling ball pens all seem to come with a black ink refill.

I have owned this Townsend pen for many years and paid about $100. The refills are expensive but that comes with the territory. However, the friction fit cap is problematic. There is a nylon or plastic liner in the cap which fails to grasp the pen over time. I have had it replaced once, and now need to do it again. Good news is that Cross offers a \\"free lifetime\\" repair warranty.

I wish him much success with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Connelly's first book is a good one","review":"If you haven't read Michael Connelly it's never too late to start (as a friend of mine recently found out). Harry Bosch is introduced in Connelly's first book (along with Eleanor Wish, the good looking FBI agent). The characters are realistic and the plot involving former Vietnam Vets who have found a new way of making a good living never lets up. The politics, the corruption, the desire for Harry Bosch to \\"fight the good fight\\" for LAPD comes thru. Bosch is no \\"Saint\\" but Connelly writes so well that you feel you literally know the characters as you read his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard To Put It Down Once You Start Reading","review":"This was my first Michael Connelly book, and after breezing thru this I know it won't be my last. The action gets started right away & never lets up. Det. Harry Bosch is a former Vietnam War vet, a tunnel rat who saw plenty of action during his tour there. It turns out the case he's called in to work on involves the body of an old war buddy named Bill Meadows. Harry has to find out who killed him and why. His maverick ways of doing his job have gotten him in trouble in the past, transferring him to Hollywood Homicide where he is under surveillance by 2 IAD detectives named(I kid you not)Lewis & Clarke! I won't divulge any further info but must tell you if you like great mysteries with likeable detectives then get started with this book & look for further books with Harry Bosch as the main character. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Echo","review":"I had been trying to decide what my first purchase for my Kindle Fire would be. After reading a sample of The Black Echo on your sight I wanted more. It also showed me that it was the first in a series by Michael Connelly that featured Harry Bosch.

It's received such great reviews, I don't understand.I read \\"The Poet\\" and found it to be quite enjoyable and engaging. So I eagerly wanted to visit more of Connelly's works so I started at the beginning with \\"The Black Echo\\", however this book never captured me. I found myself screaming \\"Would something PLEASE happen!\\" Perhaps I was more interested in the serial killer plotline of \\"The Poet,\\" but it was a real chore to finish this one. Maybe it's the Harry Bosch character, or the slow plotting, but I'm hesitant to visit any other Connelly books now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best...","review":"I have read almost all of Michael Connelly's books.

Connelly hit a home run on the first pitch. The story is readable, with many interesting twists--but nothing over the top. The dialogue sparkles and the characters are real.

When Harry gets the call for a body in a drainpipe, he recognizes first the tattoo, and then the face of a former fellow \\"tunnel rat\\" from Vietnam. Though meant to look like an overdose death, Harry suspects murder and is soon deep into an unpopular investigation of bank robbery, diamonds, and more murders. Harry is an amazingly complex character who elevates this solid police procedural into a vividly realistic mystery. This winner of the 1993 Edgar Award for Best First Novel is highly recommended.http://www.stopyourekillingme.com/C_Authors/Connelly_Michael.html"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bosch Begins","review":"I've worked my way back through the Harry Bosch books over the last couple of years and finally arrived at the beginning. This is a sweet introduction to Harry and all that follows. Harry is called out on a body discovered in a tunnel in LA. Mr. Connelly uses this to lay the ground work for Harry's character and his history (Vietnam, tunnel rat, foster care, etc). Harry is paired with FBI agent Eleanor Wish. This is an excellent police procedural.

If you like series and police procedurals pick this one up first. CONNELLY ROCKS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book - tight plot","review":"I read \\"Black Echo\\" just after \\"Along Came A Spider\\" and was struck by the similarities in the plot structure. Fortunately, that's where the similarity ends, as Connelly is a far superior author than Patterson. The plot opens up nicely and is interesting enough to be challenging. There's one rather blatant flaw as the final course of events is exposed, but this doesn't ruin the suspense. Definitly entertaining, this book is perfect for rainy days or long trips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read Concrete Blonde first","review":"Unlike most authors with continuing characters, Connelly has not published the Bosch stories in chronological order. Black Echo is an entertaining novel but it reveals key plot elements of The Dollmaker case, described in the Concrete Blonde. I didn't find the plot as compelling in The Black Echo as in his later books, but perhaps that's because of my lack of interest in war experiences. The writing is unusually descriptive -- I was starting to cough with all Bosch's smoking. (Surprising he wasn't the character needing a heart transplant, described in my favorite of Connelly's books (so far), Blood Work)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story with a very contrived ending","review":"I liked this book, but the revelations about a certain character's involvement in the case within the last 30 pages ruined it for me.

This is the first book in the series, it deals with Bosch being busted down to Hollywood homicide from the elite LAPD robbery/homicide division, and the happenings of an investigation that begins with a dead body in a drain pipe at the Mulholland Dam. I won't ruin the surprises or plot twists, but it is safe to say that if you are a fan of gritty mysteries with tough-as-nails gumshoes, Harry and his story will enthrall you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Connelly disappoints","review":"I've been anxious to read this book because I enjoyed The Poet,Blood Work and Void Moon so much.

I'm hoping the others are better, and I'll give second in series a try. Do they get better?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot. I found myself interested in the main character, the L.A. community which is an integral 'character' in the story and the well-written supporting characters and street scenes.

Outstanding by any standard, as a first novel it is truly remarkable. The author creates four-dimensional characters that catch at the imagination and populate credible environments, in a gritty tale of death and deception.

Torchure are an extremely talanted 5 piece German Death machine who offer a great variety in their style. The songs are rather long, 6- 7 minutes but they are totally interesting and will not bore you at all. They play a style that will appeal to fans of Morgoth, Pestilence and Asphyx. Torchure plays semi technical Deathmetal with some slow doom/Death parts. Songwriting is very creative with memorable riffs crushing production, good musicians all around. There are a few acoustic passages and keyboard interludes which sound extremely dark and wicked, adding to the pure DEATH atmosphere. If this band had been on a more prominent record label back in the early 90s, they could have been as well respected as Pestilence. If you are a fan of early 90s German Deathmetal, \\"The Essence\\" is definitely worth buying.

I tried stretching the rubber around the hinges, but it really looked crooked and incorrect. I ended up just keeping the old stopper. This one is a huge leak risk the way it lays awkwardly from being wrapped around the hinges of the old stopper.

First, it is fully compatible with MacOS X 10.2 (Jaguar) as well as MacOS 9. Second, it introduces a new file format, SITX, which allows for considerably greater compression, though SITX files can only be opened with StuffIt version 7 and above."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good......","review":"I'm sorry, I have to agree with the rest of the bad reviews. This book has to be the worst excuse for a math book ever. No examples, all theory, and worst of all, it doesn't have anything to do with Computer Science! Please, anybody who reads this, if you're buying this for pleasure reading, you're wasting your money..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wordy and confusing! What a waste!","review":"From the reviews of this book I thought it might help me learn about proofs. But it is terribly confusing and so very wordy. I think the author doesn't know how to express things clearly or concisely. You just have to read and read and read. Can't the author just get to the point? Also, I really don't think that she knows what the subject is used for. I'm studying computer science and looking at this book you would never know that discrete mathematics had any use in computer science. Too bad that this book is so disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Discrete Mathematics Book on the Market BY FAR!!","review":"This book offers the best interpretation of proofs, induction, and any discrete topic! It is by far better than any Discrete Math and Applications text available! This is one text that you don't need to buy the Student Solution's Manual to find out what the author is talking about. However, more solutions for the author's problems in this text would be nice for the upcoming edition. Throw away Ken Rosen's garbage and read this one to pass your course!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Pointless","review":"This book doesnt seem to have any head or tail. Half the time I wonder what exactly Im supposed to do, and WHY I should be doing it. The author does not properly impress upon the reader the reasons why each subtopic might be important, so you come away with the idea that \\"well, we're doing it this way because some mathematician did it this way in the past\\".Unfortunately, I suspect this is the case with most, if not all books dealing with discrete math.(Note: This is from a Computer Science Major, maybe math majors have a different view)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor explanations; difficult to understand.","review":"This discrete math book is just too difficult to understand and doesn't help the reader. Nothing is explained well, although lots of words are used. Also, it seems like the author thinks the readers are stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a worthless waste of paper!","review":"This is absolutly the worst math book I have ever seen, and I've taken a lot of math classes. The only reason I made sense of any of the material in this book is because I have had a lot of the same material covered in other classes. Many of my class mates did not have that advantage and it's unfortunate that the math department at my school made such a poor choice in a text. The examples were unclear. The information was presented in the wrong order to be understandable. I threw it in the trash after the bookstore told me there is a new version out. Unbelievable"},{"rating":"1","title":"No explanations, no examples.","review":"I wrote a long review *blasting* this book and its associated class at a local university, which I had the misfortune of taking. However, my review was either rejected by Amazon or removed afterwards due to the author's complaints. So I will try again, much more briefly this time. This book is garbage! Having endured this book and its associated class at a local university, it boggles my mind that anyone could give it a positive review. The people giving this book 5 stars must either be the author herself, or her friends in academia doing her favors. There are no explanations or examples of how to solve the type of problems given, and the author assumes that you are already a Ph.D. in Mathematics. This book should be labeled, \\"For Math majors only,\\" as it has absolutely no relevance to Computer Science or programming. It is abstract, ivory-tower nonsense at its worst. Major thumbs-down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Online Student","review":"I see a teacher supported this book, how he could think this book is at all helpful outside of being a good door stop is beyond me. The text is as clear as mudd, the examples are lacking and often have errors in them. The sample questions leave a lot to be desired. Terrible book, I recommend this book only as a means of torture for your worse enemy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book IF you know how to use it.","review":"This is a solid math book that covers every topic you'll need to know in the area. Make no mistake this is not a kid's book, and one must know how to study and read math in order to utilize it to the full potential. Many people that rate math books poorly do so because they have not developed adequate skills in studying math. If you take your time, work out the examples with the book, read and read again all of the concepts are about as clear as they can come from a math book. Most teachers/professors prefer to use their own examples, because that's how they abstract the problem in their own mind. It's easier to create a problem, than sit down and observe a premade example. Aside from some slightly screwy lesson organization it is a solid book. If you have patience, and try to do more than briefly skim over a lesson to understand it this book will be more than adequate for the topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and Clear","review":"I honestly can't see how you'd make a book explaining such topics as prime numbers and set theory any clearer than this one. I consider this to be a high quality book. It's easy to understand and reference. Its one drawback is that it covers only a limited number of topics, and none of them are heavy duty. If I found a book that explained graduate level math as well as this one explains undergraduate math, I'd consider it to be gold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Math Book Ever!","review":"By far this is the worst math book I have ever encountered. The author introduction of the subject is very weak and brief. She tries to compensate for this lack of detailed explanation by introducing \\"lousy\\" examples that does nothing for the most part but confuse the reader even more. I have had several advanced math courses, and read numerous math textbooks, but this is the worst!In short, this book is not worth the HIGH price, in fact it's not worth even the paper on which it was printed. I was \\"forced\\" to purchase this book for a course, which is required for my major.If you do not have to buy this book, then don't!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"This book was one of the best math books I've ever read. Just being able to say that speaks for itself; reading math books isn't the easiest thing in the world. Each subject is full of examples to solidify your understanding of the topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, even the prof said so","review":"This book is horrible. I am a graduate software engineering student and took this course at a local university. The prof said that the book is horrible and used his own exaplainations and skipped the books explainations. If I was forced to use the book's explaination and examples I would be S.O.L. The only reason every discrete class uses this book is because there are no other discrete books in competition. If you are a comp sci student they should break discrete math classes apart to discrete for comp sci and discrete from math majors. They should also have comp sci teachers teaching this because math teachers don't usually have a clue how to relate discrete math to computer science."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"This book should NEVER be allowed to be used by students for undergraduate Math classes. It is unclear, confusing, lacking clear examples and too presumptuous of the readers current skill level. I am amazed and astounded that people consider this text as the 'Best Math book ever'. IT IS HORRIBLE."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Scent of Orange Blossoms","review":"I bought this book after my Jewish Moroccan friend invited me to dinner. The dinner was fabulous!

So, I will try some of the recipes from this book soon to have what she was cooking that day."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit Confused","review":"Somehow, if it was there, I missed the fact that the book I ordered was written as a play. I had read the Clavell title, The Children's Story, many years before and remembered it as a story, not a play. The basics of the story are still there, but because it was written as a play, I feel reluctant to share it with a friend who generally doesn't read fiction, and may feel uncomfortable reading a script."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for all freedom loving thinking people","review":"\\"I pledge allegiance......\\" What does it mean?

My Mom explained exactly what it meant. When I was older, I read the entire book (It's a very short story) and it had more meaning. In our current times, it is a must read as this country falls for \\"anything\\", and we'll go down because of it. This should be read in the schools, but we all know it would NEVER get close to a school. Too bad.

I did all the research, shopped around and decided on the Brother MFC-5200C, mainly because I previously had a brother fax machine that was a workhorse and lasted me years! I loved that fax machine and when my research came down to a few that included a brother I thought I'd go with what I knew but from day one I had problems with this printer. It was still under the manufacturers warranty so I called brother to fix it. They gave me such a run around and then finally sent out a replacement. The replacement lasted about 5 months and then the printer broke. We couldn't receive faxes or do anything that involved printing. I ended up just giving up and buying a whole new multifunction printer by a different maker.All I can say about my whole Brother experience is I have never been so disappointed in a product or manufacturer before!Do yourself a favor and save your money!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brother gone bad","review":"This was a huge disappointment as this unit replaced a great model 9200c. The unit is tinny sound..squeaky belts..most difficult for single sheet feed, due to a rear entry where a compartment must be opened..ends up jamming most of the time.

However, the Kindle Edition of this book is full of errors, most of which appear the be the result of a bad OCR transcription which the publisher didn't bother to proofread. It contains things like \\"pointy fiat\\" (should be \\"pointy hat\\") and \\"har.d\\" (should be \\"hand\\"). Proper names are routinely butchered. \\"Jade\\" becomes \\"Lade\\" or \\"fade\\". Commas become periods and vice versa (especially in sections done in Death's voice). Some of the footnotes appear to be mismatched. And to top it all off, there are a few sections that actually appear out of order. (did the pages get mixed up as it was going through the scanner?) HarperCollins should be embarrassed for trying to sell such a shoddy e-book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the allusion","review":"This was a lot of fun to read for the subtle and not-so-subtle allusions to rock and the various artists. Susan as a reluctant Death made for some engaging reading as did the antics of Ridcully and company. Pratchett must have had a great time writing Soul Music. I like these new characters added to \\"the usual suspects\\". Death was at his engimatic best. Colon and Nobby made for some interesting comic relief throughout while CMOT Dibbler as the band's manager was all you could have expected and then some.
