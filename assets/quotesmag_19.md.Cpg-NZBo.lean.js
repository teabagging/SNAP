I like the thick, puffy pages that I can use to help teach my 3-month-old how to turn the pages, but the story isn't well-written. I also thought it was funny that the back of the book tells parents to imitate the sounds of the animals that the tadpole meets in the pond, yet the animals in the book are minnows, salamander, beaver and heron.

As a designer working for clients who have a wide range of style goals, I find this disappointing. This TV personality's design range is narrow, at best, and there are not very many rooms or projects in the book, once you get into it. I look for books to give or loan to clients to help thtem get a grasp of all the possibilties and of the basics of design, and this book is NOT one that I can use in my work. I recommend The New Decorating Book, which is broad in style and which explains design in ways that anyone can understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lowell's Own Style","review":"I like Christopher Lowell's show in general. He has a very destinctive style, and that is what is very apparent in this book. If you love his style you will love his book.

Try, Lynn Peterson's Real Life Decorating, or Decorating for Dummies, or Eclectic Living by Bari Lynn."},{"rating":"2","title":"good ideas for beginners","review":"I didn't know anything about decorating so this book was useful.

He does a great job explaining each of his 7 layers of design. What I found most helpful were the step-by-step photos as he applied each layer.

I did learn a lot from the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money...","review":"If you've ever watched his television show, you've already heard everything the book has to offer.

I guess I don't enjoy him or this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The show is great, The Book is the worst!!!","review":"One of the worst decorating books I have ever seen! The ideas are just plain bad. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of no help at all","review":"This is the kind of book that gives decorating a bad name. Instead of talking about good design, he digs right in to \\"decorating,\\" which in this case means layering on the junk. One shouldn't start with paint (or fabric) or anything of the sort. Good design begins with good over all use of space. It's only after one decides how a room will be used and gets the basic furnishings in place to carry out that function that one can -- at the END, not the beginning -- put the finishing touches on in the form of color, texture, and so on. I think Mr. Lowell would make a good cake decorator, but a designer he's not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Actually, I did not pay for this book, because a friend gave it to me as a shower gift, but the book is not worth the money because its content is so limited. I get the feeling that the author was trying to stretch his material because as another reviewer mentioned you see the same room again and again. I guess some people buy this thin book because the author is said to have a TV show, but I work and have never seen it, so I'm not sure of this author's qualifications."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the show, not the book","review":"I am a fan of Christopher Lowell's TV show, because it is such fun to watch. The book makes me realize that he's fun on TV but probably not a great design authority. The rooms he would have us create are too-too. Looking at my friends' homes and at my own, what I see is that we have too much darned stuff. And we talk about needing to clean up the clutter and simplify our surroundings so that we can relax. Mr.Lowell seems to want us to add something everywhere we look. I guess I am looking for something more sophisticated than what this book can teach me. One thing that scares me is how many of my less-than-talented friends are going to use this book as a license to junk up their homes."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've seen it all on the TV show","review":"If have watched the show at all in the last year, you've seen something from this book. It is missing the freshness and creativity that his show once had. I wonder how much of the material stemmed from freebies from retailers.Christopher Lowell is a creative guy, capable of much better. I gave it 2 stars out of loyalty for the years of watching the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best decorating book you can buy","review":"With so many great decorating and design books around, why would anyone buy this one? The photos aren't that great, the projects stretch out for pages, the content is limited, and the message of empowerment and doing your own thing is nothing new and is actually conveyed better in many other books I have bought. To be empowered and free to be brave and do your own thing means that you need to know more about design. If you don't, you stuckwith simply copying what someone like Christopher Lowell tells you. It means doing your thing -- not his. And Mr. Lowell is not an accredited interior designer. I recommend several other books, because they are giving me the background I need so that I can make my own decisions. My favorite is The New Decorating Book, which is gorgeous and informative. I also like Use What You Have Decorating -- which is not very attractive but offers some good ideas in the writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christopher is AMAZING and so is his book!","review":"Of course we all love Christopher, but I'm not praising his book just because I think he's fabulous. His book provides us with hands-on material we can read and re-read until we completely understand. The book explains each of the 7 layers of design and makes it sooooo simple to decorate an entire room. He also has instructions for projects and they're so easy to understand. You'll love the chaise lounge in the back! The book is written the way christopher talks. It's fun, and easy to understand. He even gives you a list of basics to have in your \\"tool box\\"! If you're planning on re-decorating a room this book is essential!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A not so serious book for those serious about decorating","review":"If you can only buy one book on decorating, this is the one. Mind you, I am writing this as a total neophyte decorator. I bought a fixer upper and had never decorated before in my life. Christopher seems to have taken all of the thought work out of decorating and left you with the fun. I especially love his recipe for picking colors. I've followed it for my living room, hallways and bedroom. They look absolutely fabulous. Doing that gave me enough confidence to venture further on my own with color and voila- I have a beautiful and happy house. Mind you I am still in the process, but so far he's been right on with everything he's said, from ceilings to floors.Oh, and this is a totally FUN read. Not too wordy and definitely not boring. This is written by someone who has found his niche and LOVES it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little restraint please","review":"Don't get carried away with Lowell's ideas. He's fun to watch on TV but be careful of the taste level, which isn't always high. His work seems to come from the school of clutter, because he leaves no surfaces untouched. Everything is \\"decorated\\" and loaded with too much color, pattern, froufrou and too many objects. Take some of his good ideas but use a little restraint and be a little less theatrical when doing your own home. Once in awhile, it's nice to leave a little breathing room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"This book isn't worth the money. I like Christopher's show (on those rare occasions when I'm home during the day and get to watch it), but I watch it because he's theatrical, weird, sort of fun, definitely NOT doing real design for real people. The book purports to offer real design guidance but it's just a tarted-up bunch of ideas and projects that are stretched and stretched and stretched to fill this book. Not worth the money. p.s. Very funny review by someone else who refers to Lowell as a man's man. Hahahahahahaha."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Christopher Lowell (the Richard Simmons of decorating) may be fun to watch on TV, but his appeal does not translate to books. He's an entertainer. The book turned out to be terribly lacking in content with several pages devoted to one project or idea. One gets the feeling that he was stretching limited content. I felt cheated when I got this book because there wasn't much in it. And his message of being free to do your own thing is found in virtually every good decorating book these days. Nothin' to see here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"I was never much of Christopher Lowell fan until I became a stay at home mom. I started watching his show and now have read his book. His approach helps take the fear out of decorating. I love the fact that he is on a \\"no white walls\\" campaign. I'm a huge fan of painting walls and adding color. It truly is the cheapest way to warm up a room. Christopher is right when he talks about keeping your large furniture pieces in a solid, neutral color. I made the costly mistake of buying a sleeper sofa in a floral pattern print 3 years ago. Although I still love the colors, I'm not so crazy about the pattern anymore. Also, finding coordinating fabrics has been nearly impossible. Where was Christopher when I needed him?! It is too expensive to get it reapholstered, so I plan slip-cover it in a neutral fabric for a fraction of the cost per his suggestions. No other books break down decorating in such easy to understand steps."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Road Map to decorating success","review":"I am a big fan of Christopher Lowell and generally like the decorating solutions he comes up with. Granted, many of them are not my lifestyle and not what I could live with, but I can appreciate the thought and talent behind each project. Since his background is theatrical, one would expect a degree of the theatrical in his style - sleight of hand, smoke & mirrors, dramatic touches - is what makes him so much fun to watch. Think of the book as a road map that shows you how to get to your destination - a successfully decorated room. By breaking any project into seven clear and logical steps, what might otherwise be a daunting task becomes a relatively painless process. I'd suggest this book to anyone based on the Seven Layers alone. The only real fault with the book is that it isn't long enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much in this book","review":"I like Christopher Lowell's show and his fun approach to decorating. This book was disappointing, though, because there isn't much in it. Christopher takes the same room or project and stretches it out over too many pages. I just didn't feel that I got my money's worth from the book because of the limited number of rooms and ideas shown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christopher does it again!","review":"This book is nothing but AWESOME! From the minute it came in the mail, I ripped open the box and got out my post it notes to reference pages I liked. By the time I memorized this book practically I have so many post it notes sticking out of it it's ridiculous. I want to do something off every page practically. I love how easy the book is to read, and logical he is about talking about each step. You can be a pro (or at least look like one) by just following his steps. They totally make sense and you can't screw it up if you follow the plan. I'm ready to gut the entire house and start from Step 1. Christopher is the man! You really can do it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK but not great","review":"If you can only buy one decorating book, definitely do NOT buy this one. It's ok but not great. It is not comprehensive. It doesn't have a lot to say. It stretches out projects to take up space. It's worth maybe 1/4 of what it sells for. There are many, many better decorating books on the market.. If you like Christopher Lowell's show (I do), then watch it as the entertainment it is intended to be but don't expect a good design book to come out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Introduction to Design","review":"This book arrived quickly and in excellent condition. The information was clearly presented and helpful for getting started on redecorating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the $$$!","review":"Though much of the information contained in this book has already been shown on his show, I found it useful and worth the money. I found it helpful to use as a reference as I redecorated my living room, and wow, what a difference! His approach to decorating is completely different than the \\"decorate your home from one piece of fabric\\" approach, but I found Lowell's method far easier to execute successfully. Though it may not be the method most decorators are taught in school, IT WORKS, and it works for the layperson that has never taken a design class of any kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need more layers","review":"What I liked about this book was that Lowell broke the decorating muddle down into seven simple layers. What I didn't like was that the layers needed to be more in-depth and more examples needed to be given, rather than use just one room to illustrate his decorating lessons. For example, in layer two discussing the placement of furniture, he did explain his placement for that particular room, but not for placement of furniture in other rooms with different configurations. It would have helped to have several examples of placement of furniture, taking into consideration traffic patterns, conversation areas, etc. So, although the pictures were beautiful, I felt that there should have been a greater variety of examples of how each of the principles applied in different types of rooms/homes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I love Christopher Lowell's TV show, but this book leaves much to be desired. Considering its size and price, it doesn't have that much in it. He takes one room or project and stretches it out instead of showing more projects or variations on the theme. It's more like a long magazine article than a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-levels...YES...but is it level....NO!!!","review":"I got this out of the box and the instructions say that's its calibrated from the factory....well to my suprise...it wasn't.

Some of the strategies mentioned are worthwhile, if a bit common sense (i.e. don't say a weakness that will disqualify you from the job--duh!), but most of the book is fluff.And the 500 questions? More like 30 or so. The author groups maybe 50 questions together at the start of each chapter, questions that are virtually identical (\\"What is your main weakness?\\", \\"Where do you see room for improvement in yourself?\\" \\"If I asked a coworker, what negative thing would he say about yourself?\\") and then a common strategy is proposed for all of them (which almost always consists of \\"don't say something that would disqualify you from the job.\\"The only positives in this book are some of the insights drawn from his experiences in headhunting life.

Using brief stories of individuals or of particular religious orders, it is full of wonderful old archival photos of sisters, and it is a great testimony to women who not only provided health care to many throughout the United States for almost 200 years (for instance, many religious provided nursing care to soldiers of both sides during the Civil War), but to the forward-thinking women who invisioned, set up and maintained the scores of hospitals and medical facilities throughout the country, especially during the 19th century.

NO-xplode can be rough on kidney and drinking lots of water can prevent that. Also, it is recommended to be followed by a whey protien."},{"rating":"1","title":"tastes horrible and only partly works","review":"not the pumps described even though i tried everything else.

Basically, when I use this product (Whole House FM transmitter) - I have to have the FM receiver right up on it, then I hear some music; the radio has to be at full volume and god forbid you accidently hit the power switch, then your stereo will blast. Really, in a nut shell, this product is no good.Please keep in mind, I live in Orange County (South Los Angeles), so maybe this is why this product does not work for me; but I also tried it on the way to and from Vegas, it almost sounds like the speakers are going to blow, but without any volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW, Best FM Transmitter on the market!","review":"I have had other FM transmitters and they work well for about 20-25 feet, this one works throughout my whole home and also outside around the yard, in fact one day I put the station on in my car and drove down the block and it was working for about 3/10's of a mile.

The sound quality was much better than the Tunecast II. I do a lot of driving in the Volusia, Seminole, and Flagler counties in FL and didn't have to change frequencies.I won't give it a 5 star rating because it was a little awkward setting it up in my truck, and it is very pricey. It was stolen out of my truck, so it looks like I might purchase this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful","review":"I ordered this unit and tried all of the dip-switch combinations to vary the frequency, but was unable to get any of the frequencies to result in a clear signal. I live in a large city, and either other stations would drown out the signal coming from this unit or it gave a very low signal-to-noise ratio - reminded me of a crystal radio. I know others have said that it works great, but it did not work for me.Also be aware that the seller has a 30-day return policy that is strictly enforced. I wish I would have known that earlier. I got the unit during a period when work was very busy and didn't try it until it was too late."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expensive, but probably the best you'll get","review":"Firstly, if you're not planning on using this product with batteries, then you're going to get a humming sound in the background. If you use batteries, then there's no interference.The transmission power is good, as stated.This product is expensive ($USD90). I bought a similar product, of lower quality, in Hong Kong for about HKD30 (~USD4), and it did the job, except that it would occasionally just turn off if it was knocked. Power output was OK. But I wanted something that was reliable. This prodcut, so far, is.Read the other reviews. Accept the fact that you're never going to get perfect transmission. Use batteries. If you want the best FM transmitter and acknowledge that none of them are perfect, then wear the cost and get this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the C.Crane FMT","review":"I purchased the \\"C.

From the start I have only been able to get the weakest signal. I called and they suggested \\"putting it in a higher location\\" and told me I could extend the antenna - it is just a wire, if it needs to be longer why doesn't it come that way? Even with the radio in the same room it is weak. They said that it doesn't work well with radios that don't have digital tuning - like most of the clock radios and boom boxes in my house! Also they said that often it doesn't work in bigger cities - too much interference. They should really put that on the website. And now, after a few months, I get nothing - seems to not work at all anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Does The Job","review":"This unit was purchased to transmit a Sirius Satellite radio signal throughout an 1800ft + condo.

He just droned on and on about random statistics about the ship blah blah blah.... Every few chapters we would hear from the men actually on the ship. That was quite interesting. Everything else I found tedious and boring. Therefore, I advise others NOT TO READ THIS BOOK. GO DO SOMETHING MORE INTERESTING. LIKE WATCHING PAINT DRY.

There is no guarantee that the necklace you receive has actually been appraised at all.The reason I am writing this is because I received a horrible quality necklace with many pits and a very dull luster.

The author's are constantly comparing themselves to Neilsen and tearing his books down. While I agree with the authors that there is no \\"one size fits all\\" approach to designing on the web and that different things work for different sites, Nielsen does as well. It seems to me that the authors should have worked on providing more useful content and a better layout (the book is laid out very poorly) than trying to bring Nielsen's views down.I highly suggest that you don't purchase this book, but if you have money to throw away, send me an email, I have some real estate in Flordia I want to sell you too."},{"rating":"2","title":"a little bit of Heaven","review":"This movie was a good movie but sad in some ways but a good movie.

This romantic drama is very charming and of course, Kate is a delight like always. Kate gets to stretch her acting chops here, she effortlessy plays Marley...a free-spirit who lives her life by her own rules but then she gets the worse news anyone could ever get, she has colon cancer and the chances of survival are not good. I liked this movie, the supporting cast is great from Kathy Bates to Lucy Punch. A Little Bit of Heaven may seem fluffy and weepy but I think it's one of the most rewarding films I've seen in many years. My only gripe is I thought the guy who's plays Marley's doctor, Julian wasn't very engaging and lacked chemistry with her. But still, it's definitely worth checking out...enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly not a Rom-Com","review":"The movie is very slow. How the heaven and three wishes thing works, just doesn't fit well into the film. The romance doesn't work. I really expected to like this.

The acting for the most part is just mailed in, which is disappointing when you consider Kathy Bates is in this film. The plot is full of clichès and tries to be serious but fails in a laughable way. The comedic sections of the movie are not bad but still not worth money. The high points of this film are Whoopie Goldberg as God and a scene that involves the title phrase, which I will not spoil as it was the only scene really worth watching.

Three wishes by \\"God\\" where did that even fit in???? SERIOUSLY! There are so many many things that I would like to say about this movie, but I will refrain.

I did not look well the material as I returned the item without using it. Probably it could be good for those who are studying the 2000 examination (it ends on september 2005), but as we have a reference PMBOK from 2004 I suppose a book released in 2005 should be updated with this reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful-ish","review":"This guide is basically a PM-BOK-lite.

I am still kicking myself for not buying the 'Saturday Night Fever [The Original Movie Soundtrack]' soundtrack for $5.00 because I thought the \\"album only\\" tracks were for the CD, but it only meant you couldn 't buy the tracks individually for digital.'Number Ones' follows the straightforward format of The Beatles' '1,' gathering the chart toppers from both sides of the Atlantic in sequential fashion.Containing both the folk-pop of their early career and the hip disco hits before and after 'Saturday Night Fever,' 'Number Ones' has all the hits you could hope for. The only thing I dock the album for are the dimishing returns of the last five songs. Knowing you can treat yourself to your i-pod or a burned CD, that's a trifling downside indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some classics are not here","review":"Okay, the title says \\"Number Ones\\" but by which chart are we talking about, and which country?

Even though they've become poster children for the disco era, their songs have a much greater range both in terms of style and chronology.If anything, it doesn't really do them justice to try to squeeze a five-decade career onto one disc (plus a short DVD), but this is a good introduction to one of the most successful, influential, and durable groups in pop music history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing the #2's and #3's, etc.","review":"This collection seems to shoot for the casual fan and fanatic at the same time.

I often wonder why bands limit themselves to the #1 songs, but I guess that happens when you already have numerous \\"Greatest Hits\\" and \\"Best Ofs\\" out there. Anyway, there's no doubt these are all great songs, and I can't imagine how anyone could not like The Bee Gees.

The Joey deck plays true to the one seen and used by Joey Wheeler in the anime series. Some cards include the Time Wizard and the Flame Swordsman. I like the idea of these kind of decks so that you can get some semi-rare to rare cards and customize a great deck. I have used many cards from these decks and have constructed some Match-winning, blow-out(8000 LP to 0 LP) decks.

While the music itself is pure 60's go-go, it can hardly be promoted as Andre Williams - if he appears nowhere on it!

Don't buy this book!","review":"I am a voracious reader. I love historical fiction. I hate this book. I am 100 pages from the end and I'm hoping I can make it to the end. This book was recommended to me because I loved \\"Pillars of the Earth\\", and honestly, it has been a painful and tiresome exercise just getting through it. I bought a new book on my recently purchased Kindle and it is helping me remember why I LOVE to read. This book has been like my worst school assignment ever. RUN NOW! Find something else to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't recommend","review":"I started this book and only read a chapter. Written from what seems to be a feminist position without much detail or interest in characters who aren't female."},{"rating":"2","title":"slow start but don't give up","review":"The first 200 pages felt tedious. The character development felt lacking... I couldn't relate to any character, nor did I feel connected to any of them. I'm glad I didn't give up though. The story built slowly and by the middle I couldn't put it down. Gedge does a tremendous job of giving the reader a real sense of the time period and the perspectives of both sides of the \\"argument\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story of those who fought for their FREEDOM....","review":"A beautifully told story, that captures the spirit of the Welsh. A people who love and respect their land, and who love and fight for their freedom. I started the book ignorant of that part in history, events and people and I finished it with a vivd image of what happened, Pauline wrote with such talent that you felt as though you were there. Not only is Pauline Gedge a fantastic writer I believe her also to a be a marvellous teacher. A book I would recommend to all of those who treasure their freedom. Thank you Pauline for writing about those patriots, they didn't want to be forgotten, and now their story lives on ..... No one could of done a better job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"I loved the plot. I hated the length and detail of the time spent in the mountains and gathering forces to fight against the Romans.Overall this book was great. It's great historical fiction and I found it easy to relate to the characters. I'm usually not interested in books/movies from this period, but I gave this book a chance and I wasn't disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous historical fiction","review":"Impossible to put down, this novel brings gloriously to life the tragic struggle of the Britons for freedom in the face of Rome's inexorable might. There is the occasional historical inaccuracy, e.g., a Roman general marries a Briton and brings her back to Rome, where she is accepted by Romans as his wife; Roman law did not recognize marriages to non-citizens, especially among the aristocracy. The rest of the book rings true, however, and the minor flaws are more than made up for by the gripping, fast-paced narrative and the carefully drawn characters. A pity this fine book is out of print."},{"rating":"1","title":"British goods","review":"Nice pot.

Jazz Tuba with strings.............. this is tasteful MMJ!","review":"MMJ - Modern Mainstream Jazz. Jim Self is not only an outstanding Dixieland tuba player but a pioneer on the fluba, a combination of tuba and flugelhorn. 25 strings, one of three rhythm sections, and other exciting soloists: Dan Higgins - soprano, alto, tenor, and flute; tenor-saxophonist Pete Christlieb, and altoist-flutist Gary Foster.

(Ackerknecht's is old and assusmes too much historical and cultural background; Bettmann's is even older, and more fun than accurate; Rhodes' is too British for most students.) Most history of medicine is written for readers learned in history or medicine, and Magner is unusual in addressing the actual student and the curious general reader. Magner has obviously taught a real class, to real students. Unfortunately, the publisher is apparently accustomed to sticking it to medical students, who may bear crippling loans, but can expect to make decent money some day. For liberal-arts students, the price is cruel. Why not an affordable paperback, which would be very widely adopted?"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a phenomenon","review":"I will say just one thing, I like it. I like it a lot. They still making great progressive metal that isn't played at light speed with million notes per second.They made a great album, even though I thought that they couldn't top Hypothetical, this is just as good.

The songs on \\"Spinning Tails\\" meet me where I am and make me want to spin them around again and again. I can relate to all the subjects in the songs.I really enjoy Steve Pullara and His Cool Beans Bands' music.The library even has this CD and my mom and dad like it too! That's really cool beans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A color all it's own!","review":"Steve Pullara and His Cool Beans Band seem only interested in creating great ecclectic family/children's music. If that's what your looking for and want to hear, buy this album.My family loves this CD! It's really fun to listen to, while also keeping the whole family entertained. This CD is void of cutesy or even sappy lyrics which I think adds to it's broad appeal. Steve's music also spans generations in a natural way and why we like it alot! Also, nothing on this CD evokes anything purple from the jurassic era, if you know what I mean. \\"Spinning Tails\\" has a color all it's own. If family music had a color, this CD would be it! It's also a great car trip CD! You can really feel and hear the band's own enjoyment come thru on every song (a good sign.) My friends' kids made up dances to a few tunes (maybe the cockroach conga), go figure... Hey Steve, when's the next album coming out?"},{"rating":"2","title":"funtastic!!!!","review":"This cd is great because it mixes all different music styles and creates a meld of songs that lift your spirits and make you soar.\\"Donut Man\\" is hysterical and my Daughter laughs through the whole song. Then you have \\"Snowflake are Dancing\\" which calms her and she usually falls asleep to it. You gotta experience the creativity and humor that Steve Pullara filters into his music. It delight both young and the more mature of us. It pulls out the kid in all of us. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spinning Tails","review":"I think youngsters & their parents will love this CD. The tunes are refreshingly fanciful & fun with a real creative flair in terms of the sounds & descriptions. The CD has great musical stories that are sure to capture your kid's attention & imagination.

It had several large dents from shipping. Worse, it was missing one of the screws that hold the bottom hinge assembly in place, preventing the door from opening and closing normally. The hole itself was stripped, so I couldn't even replace the screw. I had to epoxy the assembly in place to keep the hinge aligned properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Met all my expectations","review":"My husband and I bought this fridge as a surprise for our teenaged son. It holds quite a bit and have no complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Great Book","review":"After reading the book, I read all of the reviews below. This book isn't as bad as the worst critics make it out to be, but it's not as good as the apologists purport. It's just another read. If you get assigned it for a feminist class, relax, read it, and move on. It's a strange book because it's not really about Bosnia - not having much to offer about politics or the war. It's not about sexual politics - being just another feminist screed. But it's mostly about the writer's own personal thoughts on rape as a military tool. If that interests you, you'll enjoy the book. If not, you probably won't be able to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Questions","review":"I believe much of Beverly Allen's book. I do have questions. I think it is worth 3 stars but if some dock it to one, I will give it 4.I wonder about some of the accusations in the book, which would be quite serious, such as the \\"Alpine\\" incident referred to in a below review. What is additionally serious, is the Serbs known 3 fingered salute. The book refers to this too. If the claims could be substantiated and are true, it would be important."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping and sick!","review":"This one really creeps up on you. Tom Moran delivers thoroughly entertaining, genre-bending blend of humor, mystery, and--oh yeah--plenty of horror. Following the exploits of the comically inept, but lovable, John Smith, the novel deissorients and shocks its readers as it descends from comfortably humorous to grotesquely horrific. Be warned: this has one of the most graphic climaxes out there. With the exception of some poor editing by the publisher, this is an excellent debut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Read","review":"This book was very intriguing. It covers a variety of genres, including horror, suspense, comedy, and romance. Mr. Moran does a good job developing chracters and proceeds to weeve a great story. It's definitely a book you can't put down until you're finished with it. Mr. Moran also uses the story to explain (presumably) his philosophy on money and it's ill effects on personalities. It was a great read and I look forward to more novels from Mr. Moran."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer grooves","review":"Funk is my favourite genre of music and for my money this new release from Sco is probably the best jazz-funk/funky jazz album since I dont know when. It probably wont go down well with jazz purists who dont like seeing funk, rock and other elements being brought in. I'd be surprised if we dont see any DJ remixes because some of the tracks are simply killer grooves. Avi's clipped rhythm playing's the funkiest thing since Chic called it a day. The bass throbs in a great finger funk style and Adam Dietch is a cracking skinsman. Overlaying it all is Sco's inimitable lead playing. I loved Uberjam, but 'Up all night's even tighter and more danceable. For me, this is the best album release so far this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battle Axe Warriors","review":"If you love underground hip-hop, this album takes you deeper down. Much, much further away from mainstream. The odd flows and beats is what makes this album very dark, but very consistent. Emcees Moka Only, Swollen Members, LMNO, Mr. Brady, & Buc Fifty go out on a limb and steer clear of your \\"typical\\" hip-hop. I compare this compilation with Anticon. I recommend this to a true underground hip-hop lover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay","review":"This budget cd,\\"Essentials Best of Bob Marley\\" is just borderline average. As the above poster says--there is something wrong with the sound quality. And supposedly, this is a \\"remastered\\" cd. The actual sound of the music is faily good quality. What is bad is the vocals. Right away, I'm like, what? No, no ,no. This sounds like they mixed good music with the scratchy sound of a 45 rpm record and tried to sneak it past the consumer as remastered. There is some good here. It contains songs that are not ususally on a Bob Marley best of, like-- Duppy Conqueror, Soul Rebel and Soul Shakedown Party. Yes get this in a better quality, but if you must, don't pay more than four bucks for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garcia Mostly Delivers","review":"Dylan covers can grow tiresome because nobody can truly capture the essence of Dylan except the man himself. That being said, The Dead probably come the closest, and this collection by Jerry Garcia is good, if not great.

It was supposed to arrive by 3/6/12 but has not. I am very frustrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ah yeah","review":"The guy who has reviewed this thing, Patrick, complaining about the sound obviously is clueless when it comes to live Dead/Jerry. Clearly, the sound quality isn't going to be 100% perfect because it comes from sources that weren't studio quality. I have no idea why someone would complain about this knowing from the start that it would be this way... who knows? Anyways, the song selection is incredible and the playing by all members of all bands represented is beautiful. The guy that mastered this did a wonderful job with what he had to work with and I suggest it to anyone that appreciates either Dylan or Jerry. This schmuck obviously has never traded Dead tapes or just has his head so far up his ass that it's sticking out where his neck used to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best starter Deck","review":"The reason I nominate this the best Yu Gi Oh starter deck is because you get the ultimate Relinquished.It has the power to take another {opponent's} card's attack and defence.E.g.

I admit many people forewarned me about this record, but being Annie the kind of singer and songwriter she is, I decided to give the record a try. Adicionally, Larry Fast was involved in a couple of songs, so that added to my decision.To put it bluntly: I was dissapointed. The songs are too bland and \\"syrupy\\" to my liking (granted: What was I expecting from a record dedicated to angels? - my mistake!). The lyrics are good, though, if you are into this sort of thing...From a die-hard prog music fan: There are better records!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mystical And Celestial Marvel !","review":"\\"The Dawn of Ananda\\" is Annie Haslam's most celestial and mystical CD. It is equally spiritual and surreal. The songs are so good it sounds like Enya and Kate Bush helped out. But no. Annie Haslam is so innovative, creative and compassionate, she needs no assistance. Haslam's vocals are incomparable and the lyrics are both poignant and glorious. \\"The Dawn of Ananda\\" can appeal to classical music fans,a spiritual person or a fan of a peerless diva. Ms. Haslam is actually at her zenith 25 years after her commercial popularity. In addition to music fans, this CD will appeal to people who love Angels, Animals, the afterlife and the sacredness of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I love this purchase!

Unfortunately much of the stuff that was left out was integral to the story backdrop. You get 4 tapes and about 35 minutes for each- so they left a bunch of stuff out to make it fit. Otherwise it could have used at least on more tape, and that was probably too expensive to package... I am not happy with the result. However, the reading was very good, the story as read out loud leaves a bad thin film in the mouth, and a feeling that you were cheated out of the story entirely."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing out of the ordinary, really","review":"too long, boring, pointless.....if i wrote a book about coming of age, i would definitely have more action to report."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginal & Boring","review":"I read a lot of books, and I seldom find one as tedious and boring to read as this one. Nothing happens! As a family memoir (if I were in Baker's family), I'd appreciate this work, but as it is, I could not find anything to take with me. The character development is minimal at best; because of this, I felt nothing for the Depression-era struggles this family faced. Mr. Baker's descriptions are simplistic at best and he uses far too much foreshadowing to make you want to even continue to the next page because you know exactly what will happen. Don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best...","review":"Russell Baker, who won the Pulitzer Prize in 1979, deserves to be a national treasure on the basis of this book alone. It traces his youth in rural Virginia, from the death of his father when he was only five through his growing up years between the wars. The rest of the book is a paean to his mother, a strong-willed optimist who never accepted defeat as an alternative to success. Her unfailing faith in the talents of her young son were not misplaced. This is an iconic and magical piece of literature, a story of courage and love, of the bonds of family in spite of tension and disagreement.Wonderful both as a story and as a piece of writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"(...)","review":"(...).

It opens with a gentle Dead Can Dance-style mood piece, then BAM! Anthem rock comin' at ya! (That happens on two more tracks.) From there it settles into mid-tempo goth rock with plenty of guitar for most of the album. Over half the songs are definite keepers.Requiem In White alumnus Christopher brings the right brooding, emotional quality to the vocals, and the poetic lyrics keep the vibe strong. The piano ballad \\"Aurora\\" features a great duet between Christopher David and Selina Silecchia.The rock standouts are the \\"Les Sylphes (RTW Ver.),\\" \\"Voice,\\" \\"Indolence,\\" and \\"Succession.\\" The desert flavor of \\"Haven\\" is more developed on the follow-up e.p., \\"Sahara Seas.\\"While \\"Fohn\\" doesn't have as much variety of sound as their next full-length album, \\"La Reveuse,\\" it's a good first showing for a band that embraces the poetry and romance of goth while keeping the guitars at the forefront. Overall, enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serene, yet dark atmospheres","review":"Judith's premier CD release is a great introduction to this constantly evolving band. With everything from compelling, sensual tunes such as \\"Les Sylphes\\" to the fast and furious post-punk \\"Secession\\" and the European dancefloor hit \\"Mirror\\", this release is quite a force to be reckoned with. Most of the songs on this release were written by Christopher David during his last months with his former band Requiem in White."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless waste of time.","review":"The mystery could have been so profound, but limped in front of me like a lame duck. The characters were shallow and undeveloped. There are cripples and elderly who move faster than this plot, seriously! I sincerely hope that future humans are nothing like this person writes them. If they are, let's pray for WW3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not his best","review":"\\"Polaris\\" is a good book though I do not think it is Jack McDevitt's best work. I almost liked \\"A Talent for War\\" better because on some level I feel that that book is inadvertantly (or purposely) a social commentary. Though, I did like seeing the storyfrom Chase's point of view in \\"Polaris\\".I really like Jack McDevitt as an author. His books always make me stop and think - to wonder if we will ever travel amongst the stars like his characters. My favorite book of his is \\"Eternity Road\\" - I've reread it multiple times, and it's hard to drive down a highway and to see overpasses without thinking about \\"Eternity Road\\". I highly suggest it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sci-fi mystery!","review":"I greatly enjoyed this novel. I read somewhere that Jack McDevitt is the next Isaac Asimov - that may be going too far, but he's the only author I've seen get close to Asimov's ability to utilize heavy science fiction, engage the reader, keep the action moving, and create a totally intriguing mystery. This book definitely made me want to read some others by McDevitt.As far as the book itself goes, I do highly recommend it to any sci-fi fans out there. If you're not into sci-fi, but are curious, I'd suggest you grab this book. I will say the premise kept me guessing for the most part, but I had pretty much figured it out by the time McDevitt clued his main characters in on what had happened. The twists at the end were not so surprising as I think they were intended to be.I would definitely recommend this to any sci-fi fan, it has a great plot, awesome characters, very solid science, and an intriguing universe set up in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A space mystery disappointment...","review":"Normally I try not to read reviews before I get to read the book so that I am not prejudiced, for or against, by the reviews. Now I wish I had read the reviews as it would have saved me some time and money. I am a big McDevitt fan, but quite frankly this story left me \\"high and dry\\". The characters are well developed and even interesting, but the plot itself is so lame and the premise behind it is so preachy I found it often annoying. There is very little science in this \\"science\\" fiction novel. Indeed, it could easily have been written as a western or a 1930's film noir script. There is far more Sherlock Holmes, than Hawking or Einstein in the story. I hope McDevitt's future novels are more interesting than this one was, but then again it wouldn't take much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great novel","review":"I really liked this book, it was very engaging straight away and has a great plot. McDevitt is a brilliant sicfi writer and I always come back to his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughts on Polaris","review":"As the sequel to A Talent for War, Polaris has a very different feel to it (though some of the plot points seem a bit cut and paste). Overall I'm rather enjoying this series, though it is quite the mix of genres."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good yarn","review":"It is a mystery and science fiction tale wrapped in one. McDevitt's retelling of the Mary Celeste story is entertaining and consistent. McDevitt's books are consistently well-written and fun to read; this one is no exception."},{"rating":"1","title":"McDevitt's flat note","review":"The first McDevitt books I read,Seeker,Omega, andThe Engines of Godreally blew me away. So I was looking forward to \\"Polaris.\\"It is too bad I had high expectations. This book comes complete with: stereotyped character types, an incomplete grasp of basic human psychology, stilted and uneven story pace, and a smattering of Big Ideas that become trivialized in the ho-hum of the plot.I grit my teeth and read till the end, but I was not rewarded for my efforts with any cookie.It is too bad, because the Big Ideas and awesome backdrops to his stories can make for wonderful reading. But this book is really all too boring.McDevitt has some very strong strengths as a writer, strengths that are emphasized in his earlier books, and some of his later books. Unless you are a devotee of this series, I wouldn't advise anyone to waste the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"Like other Alex/Chase stories, this one doesn't have great vision or interesting technologies (10000 years in the future and human still die of old age at 100 or so), and you're taken to a lot of places to meet one-time characters whose sole purpose of existence is to offer information to advance the plot. However, the plotline is not bad, it kept me reading even though the author made the answer of the mystery clear way early in the novel.The underlying issue here is not as interesting as the one in the Talent for War, but by telling the story from Chase's point of view, it gives both leading characters some depth that didn't exist in the 1st novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"sponge bob is the bomb!!","review":"i'd say sponge bob is very cool. this one was not the best one i'd say because 95% of the movie you could not hear what sponge bob was saying because he was talking all prehistoric like a cave man but i got to say it was very ummm lets see kind of interesting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WHERE SPONGEBOB STANDS ON DVD:","review":"HERE ARE THE NUMBERS:(EXCLUDING the defunct and rip-off that is The Complete 1st Season box set) There are a total of 31 episodes unreleased in the Spongebob saga...So if you are this far with the 'Theme' based DVDs as I am, I say stick with it VS. going with the box sets since they already SCREWED UP The Complete 1st Season box set by NOT including the Pilot episode, \\"Help Wanted\\"...Since the 'Theme' based DVDs like this one are able to include 10 episodes, and there are 31 left, there is likely to be 3 future 'Theme' based DVDs released, leaving one episode missing.

A dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why bother?","review":"If you're going to attempt to remake a classic film shot-for-shot, especially one in which the original music carried so much of the drama, would't it stand to reason to market that score rather than the dreaded \\"music from and inspired by\\"? I'm so completely sick of these compilation albums that have nothing to do with the movie. This is just another example of the Hollywood tail wagging the dog in an attempt to use a movie to sell records (and vice versa). I wonder if there used to be a time when the movie was used to sell the movie? Besides, like so many \\"music from and inspired by\\" soundtrack albums, few of the songs appear in the film proper.If you like the real music for \\"Psycho\\" (and I'm of course referring to Bernard Herrmann's FANTASTIC score), get Joel McNeely's rerecording with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra on Varese Sarabande records.

Kopechne","review":"This novel is based on the Chapaquidick incident with Ted Kennedy and Mary J. Kopechne. It is told from the perspective of 'Kelly Kelleher' as she lays dying in the over-turned car underwater. She relives her infatuation and awe with the famous senator, his attraction to her and ultimately, his desertion of her to save his own life. Her naivete, gullibility, idealism, foolishness and youth are all too apparent as she faces death all alone. At this existential crisis, she is still unable to believe the the man she so idealized has sacrificed her so easily and without even a thought.Like all of Oate's books, this is well-written, dark, and hard to put down. It held my interest all the way through. It is that rarity of books, a literary page-turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy-handed underachiever","review":"Joyce Carol Oates is capable of much better. For proof, see novels like \\"Them,\\" \\"Wonderland,\\" or \\"Expensive People\\" - or short story collections like \\"Heat.\\" But here, she takes a tragedy from over thirty years ago and exploits it to what I can only call ill effect.I am no great friend of Ted Kennedy. I'm ashamed of what he did when he drove Mary Jo Kopechne off a bridge in Chappaquiddick. But as painful as that must have been for Mary Jo and the Kopechne family, Oates wants us to feel that pain as well. The unfortunate result of her heavy-handed, self-righteous interpretation, though - and her inexplicable use of repetition - is that it's painful to read for the wrong reasons.Like I said, Oates is capable of much better, and I'm one of her great fans. But \\"Black Water\\" disappointed me, and I cannot recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God I didn't pay money for this","review":"Ms. Oates needs to go back to her alma mater and demand the money she paid for composition class be reimbursed. She clearly missed the courses \\"Punctuation, the Reader's Friend\\" and \\"Verbs, Every Sentence Should Have One\\". The writing style is disorganized and is lacking direction. But if in your confusion you miss something, not to worry. The writer apparently anticipated this and even the most trivial of details are repeated over, and over, and over. If this wouldn't have been a bookclub selection which I felt obligated to read, I would have returned it promptly to the library and reclaimed the part of my life it sucked away. It's pointless dribble makes most tv sitcoms seem complex and infinitely more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not use for a book club!","review":"We used this book for a book club book.

She is a prolific writer and this \\"practice\\" is evident in all she does. No one can touch her ability to tell a good story. Black Water is just that- a good story. Not her best but very good. The focus on a girl's loyalty to an image is what propels the reader to keep going. This idealism, if understood by the reader, makes this an entertaining read. However, as with some of her writing, she repeats pharses or events for effect and in this book it comes through as being boring and kind of annoying. SUPER summer read."},{"rating":"1","title":"catched my attention, but the whole thing was very confusing","review":"I Read this book for my English III class, since i like mysteries, i figured this book would get my attention. but it didnt, i think this book skipped around a bunch, between the black water and the girls life.

The main song I wanted on the first disk, \\"Southampton\\", was pretty well orchestrated, but it sounded like you could reproduce the sound easily through a digital keyboard.

The characters are the same, but they have different messages for the reader. The movie and the book give two somewhat different versions of the main characters and reveal what a screenwriter can do when translating a book into a movie. Both versions are plausible."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, boring","review":"I bought this book because after seeing the movie I had a lot of questions I thought would be answered. The book and the movie do not resemble each other at all. Some of the characters have the same names but that is as close as it gets. The stories in each are completely different. Nothing matches anything. The book is so boring to read it put me to sleep. It just rambles on and on. Usually the book is better than the movie. This is not the case. At least the person that wrote the movie completely changed the plot to make this story interesting. Reading this book was a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant Read","review":"A Single Man by Christopher Isherwood is a poignant story about loss, homosexuality, and a time period that served as a transitioning point for the country.Positives- I love that the novel takes place in a 24 hour period; so much happens and is addressed in just one day! Politics, education, age, sexuality...- Isherwood was groundbreaking- credit must be given for his decision to address a topic that was for more taboo than it is today.- Isherwood's control of language is exquisite without being over-the-top.- The stage of grief George is at is captured so well; the point where one is trying to forget but is still definitely mourning.Negative- The only real aspect of this book that I thought was a bit trying was that with Charlotte; I understand the parallels and contrasts being made between she and George, but it just didn't seem to necessarily mirror the significance of the other events during his day. Personal preference, I think.Great, quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done!","review":"Mr. Isherwood's writing is perfection. Gay, straight, alien--everyone can appreciate Isherwood's perfect characterization and the sadness of Dr. Falconer. In this one instance I would also recommend following the book with the new movie by Tom Ford. It's a faithful and equally beautiful masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"death","review":"this is a book everyone should read, better than a medical/psychological attempt to prepare for the death of love and one's self; I can't do it justice in a few words, but if you have any concern for the the \\"accidents\\" of life and love and death--including your own, this is a MUST read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to put together.","review":"I would have rated this item 5 stars if it had a better way to keep it from falling over. The first night the wind was about 10mph and it blew over. Bent the top, but I was able to fix it. Otherwise this item is very well put together and the stainless steel looks like it will not rust after time. The controls are easy to use and all the parts fit real good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good heater","review":"Works as advertised, and you def. want the deluxe for the quality of the hood. I was a bit disappointed with the seams. They are visible and not polished out, but its a minor facial thing. The heat generated is good 10' plus as long as there is no breeze. Anything over 5 mph and you get flame flicker which cuts down on the heating of the element. Use it on our back patio and so far it has broken the chill at 36 degrees. So we are happy. Our patio is covered,so there is less than the 10' feet of clearance, but I checked for heating and we are not getting any issues there. Def has my recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Product with pleasing appeal","review":"Very nice exterior surfaces. Mid-range heat distribution.

Doesn't Perform","review":"I thought we'd done our homework ... reviewed a few types and brands and watched a couple of demonstrations on YouTube. Our Patio Heater assembled easily and looks good but the slightest breeze totally messes up the flame. We live in Kansas by the way, so it's always breezy. To keep the flame inside the grid I have to turn the level down very low and the grid - which is supposed to turn orange from heat and radiate warmth - barely changes color. This thing has been very ineffective for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy with this heater","review":"I had some reservations about ordering this, based on the reviews that commented about missing parts and difficult instructions. However, since it seemed to be a good quality heater, I decided to go ahead (I actually ordered two of them). Perhaps they've improved the instructions since prior reviews, but I did not find them difficult to follow. I also did not have any missing parts for either unit. All parts fit together perfectly. Both units fired right up and provided nice uniform heat. Although, I will say the lighting operation is a little strange, but it works fine once you get used to it. Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for 10-14 year olds","review":"This book is a very well-written saga about the Cherokee and the Trail of Tears. Yellow Leaf is a small girl who becomes separated from her family on their travels to the reservation and is taken in by a white trapper. He raises her but not without the clashing of their two worlds.I read this book as a 10 year old and had to read it again recently because of my favorable impressions. It touches on the devastating effects of the removal of the Native Americans but still has loving moments that leave a positive impression on the readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't believe the hype","review":"Bought a bottle of Rejex last fall. Made sure the fiberglass sides of my camp trailer were clean by using rubbing compound. Applied a very liberal coat of Rejex. This spring again washed the trailer and applied another coat of Rejex to the front. After a trip last month to Alaska and back I washed the fiberglass to get the bugs off the front. What a disappointment. I could not see any difference between using rejex and plain old car wax. This product is not worth the extra money, stay with plain wax. The positive reviews must be written by paid reviewers, not actual users."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works well","review":"I have been using this product for at least 7 years. I used it on my Audi S4, lexus RX450h and also on BMW 550i. Like any product you should know its limitations. It is not an impeneterable armor, however, it is extremely effective in protecting against birds'droppings and road grime. I do not exaggerate when I say that a wet piece of tissue will immediately wipe off such contaminations without a trace. Otherwise, you will have to exert pressure in rubbing off this nasty stuff and in the process you will create swirl marks. I have not been using other products on the paint of my cars."},{"rating":"1","title":"LITTLE OR NO EFFECT","review":"Rejex is suppose to not allow bugs to stick.

My experience with Rejex has been 100% positive and I'll continue to use this product on my cars and windows. Rejex is easy to apply, lasts sereral months and keeps the bugs and road dust off the car. Brake dust doesn't stick to the wheels after applying Rejex to them. I have even applied the product to our stainless steel sink after polishing it and it shined for 2-3 months! clean the surface prior to applying Rejex (window, paint, wheel cleaners, etc...), then finish with Rejex. Let the product sit for 2-8 hours before buffing it off and you'll be very happy with the results on new or older paint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, there is Canadian cool. . .","review":"What a delight!

It's unfortunate that I picked up this audiobook read by him. Now I think that not only is Bernie Mac not funny, he also sounds like a Jerk. This book is the story of his life, it's a sad life punctuated by the loss of his mother when Bernie was 16. It's obvious that Bernie had a rough life, and his rise to stardom was an impressive one that included doing stand up at church at age 8. However, it's so depressing throughout the entire work you'll want to throw the tape out by hour 2 of this 4 and half hour abridgement. At no time is any part of this book funny, and the reading by Bernie Mac is delivered so flat as to seem monotone. I don't think Bernie was trying to make himself sound selfish, but that's really how it feels towards the end of the work. I feel bad, but I have to recommend not spending your money on this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of Bernie Mac","review":"I was deeply moved by this book. It was insightful and funny.

The story of a lifetime of crying and laughing was so intense from one chapter to the next that I realized I too was crying and laughing at the turn of the page. It's sad that his life ended so early. It's for certain he would have had more pearls of wisdom, either written or verbal, to share in his own distictive style. Yeah, Bernie! When you get to the pearly gates tell St. Peter you've been chosen as the comand performance entertainnment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read and new found appreciation from THE MAC","review":"I appreciate every word shared in this book! Bernie Mac exposes the readers to the hardship, loss, and struggle that he endured on his road to success. Many would have given up years before he saw success. Throughout the book, he reiterates the depth and strength of his mother and the many lessons (MACisms) that she engrained in him. I never expected to experience the range of emotions that were stirred within my spirit throughout the reading of his story. Great big shoutout to his wife, Rhonda, you are an inspiration and a motivation. A difficult but beautiful story. Thanks for not giving up during your journey. I greatly appreciate your story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick Read","review":"I enjoyed reading and learning about the life of Bernie Mac. I am not one for reading non fiction books, but this was excellent. My husband and I were able to sit and discuss the book together which was an added bonus.Bernie Mac definitely tells it like it is. It's good to know that he didn't just wake up one day and become Bernie Mac. This book lets our youth know that they can be anything they want to be if they just remain focused-despite any put-downs from their friends or family members."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nostalgia trip if nothing else.","review":"I didn't buy this book expecting to be informed. Generally, if I see a book on hacking in the mall, I mark it as lame. However, I figured it would be a good laugh, so I bought it. What I got was a return to my childhood. Back when the XT and the Apple II were high tech. Back then, these methods actually worked. Alas, if you don't live in a rural area that has yet to see indoor plumbing, this book won't be much help. In fact, all of it is pretty much common sense and *WAY* outdated. If you use the stuff in this book, expect to get caught. Old timers like me will dig this book for the memories alone. Newbies, on the other hand should steer very clear. If you're reading this, then you are probably online. Save some money and look up everything you can on computer security.

Maybe they don't know how to use them, but once I teach them, they say, \\"Wow, this is easy!\\" Word to the wise, this book is written for kids who liked Wargames back in the 80s. Check it off teaching you anything. If you want a nice laugh and discover those Pac-man days once again, go for it man! Maybe you can bring back the Regan Presidency.

It was like reading a book with a friend. There are lots of good recipes in the book, as well as sage advice from various local bakers across the country. And an old book by Ruth Wakefield is quoted with guidance concerning pie baking problems. It is an interesting story on various levels, with the historical nature of pie in America being shared. While much of what is included in the book is from everyday people, there are famous people who pop up. Like Edison. There is a fun quote from Thomas Alva Edison: \\"The English are not an inventive people; they don't eat enough pie.\\" And George Eastman, the inventor of the Kodak camera. He was evidently a consummate baker and cook. Eastman's \\"Favorite Lemon Meringue Pie Exactly As It Was Written In His Own Hand\\" is included. Overall a good read. P.S.

Her approach at looking at the basic symbolism of each card opened a whole new world for me; it all finally made sense. After learning what the symbols could suggest, each page for each card has a list of possible questions to connect with the ideas put forth on each card. I highly recommend this book for the beginner."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"Ms. Jayanti is big on the history of tarot cards and obviously a psychology buff. She interprets the cards as a psychologist might see Rohrschach ink blots. \\"I don't work with the tarot to predict the future,\\" she says.Tarot is a great teaching tool for substance-abuse counselors, according to this author. She lets the client do the interpreting of the cards as pretty pictures, much as a psychiatrist might ask a patient to interpret ink blots.This author calls it a \\"fallacy\\" that some think tarot readings help you find out about your future. To her, the cards are merely a symbol system that can assist you in understanding yourself -- and you can forget about predictive readings for others. \\"Lighting candles or saying prayers\\" to her is \\"just plain ignorant.\\"I'll take a book that tells me how to read the cards.

You should also read it when you are interested in various kinds of tarot-decks wich are covered extensively in this book or have no basic idea about tarot interpretation. Be not deluded however to place tarot in such a microscopic level as Jayanti does. One should not forget that tarot is a philosophical machine wich can postulate metaphysical mechanics. This book has a somewhat \\"materialist\\" approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldnt recomend it","review":"I guess I thought this book would have more to do with reading tarot cards and card meanings instead of a long history/symbology lesson. I understand that the cards are symbols that everyone sees differently but did she have to be so vague about EVERYTHING? I felt this book was more about Qabala than the cards themselves. And if your going to write a book for \\"dummies\\" try not making it so complicated. I bought this book three years ago and honestly got about a 3rd of the way through and put it and the deck away.

There was a lot of information on Qabala and mystery schools, which I didn't think went well with a book for begining tarot readers. She doesn't really believe or care that much about card reversals. Is this to save the space or was it too hard to explain to us \\"dummies\\"? I read the whole book, but it took forever because I couldn't get into it. I've read many other tarot books, and I would reccommend any of them over this one. If you feel you have to read it, please check it out of the library or borrow from someone else.

I was an amateur to put it lightly. It was suggested to me that i try this product. I took this product and went to the gym. I was at the gym for maybe 15-20 minutes and felt an uncomfortable feeling in my bowels. So as you can gather i did not finish my work out.

I think some people can have bad reactions, but that is true with any product on the market. My advice would be to try it yourself, and if you have any problems, sell or give the powder to someone who uses it. It's a pretty popular pre-workout mix.Also don't over do it. It says 3 scoops is the max dose, but I've never gotten near that, and don't think you would need to, unless you are a hardcore workout warrior.

Bottom line: I stopped the coffee to ensure I was gauging the correct result/effects but to my disappointment I experienced no clear effect whatsoever. No burst of energy, no focus--nothing. Good news is I didn't get sick like some peeps. Bad news is I dumped about $25 in left over product in the trash.

Despite the fact that the author has put everything ever written about Down syndrome into this book (although with an emphasis on eugenics and abortion), I would not recommend this to students. People, including those with Down syndrome, aren't worthy because of their cognitive or language abilities. They are worthy because they are human beings. Kids are kids.

After about a week, they all have had their quircky problems.1. One of the handsets broke, luckily they actually sent me a new one.2. Occassionally when you pick up line 1 line 3 lights up (seems to be a common problem).3. The lines \\"hum\\" periodically. After contacting the trouble shooting desk, they recommend I get the jack replaced,well, it still does it.4. They do not work well with cordless phones, the lines do not release, unless you do it manually.I am in the process of returning these and getting something else, they ARE NOT DEPENDABLE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good - But thats all...","review":"Very disappointed with the performance of this phone from ATT. Speed dial is useless, you need to press so many keys it is easier to look up the number. Caller ID only works on one line at a time. The keypad locks up once in awhile and requires pulling power from the phone to make it work again. Sometimes the phone \\"senses\\" a call waiting and mutes out the caller's voice for a few seconds at a time. And the last is the best; when answering a line, the phone will sometimes (not often) conference another line in and I get to speak to my customer on one line, and we both listen (at the same time) to a loud dial tone from another.Final opinion: A hand crank phone is better (we have more than one of these phones, so these problems are consistent). After 6 months of ownership we used these phones for target practice and purchased GE phones. Now they make good phones!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AT&T 955","review":"I just purchased 3 of these phones & they work great so far.The only thing I wish it had was a duplex spkr. phone & that itwould be offered in different colors.

He explains a great deal, including several quantum mechanics concepts and also including topics that have not been seen a thousand times on other media.They use anologies, not technical jargon, to illustrate complex concepts..... and in ways that are creative and suprisingly correct (basically anyway).The DVD was meant for the 'average' person and is highly educational, but will not go over your head.It is science for the non-scientist and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting","review":"I've only seen the story of everything episode, myself, which I thought was actually amazing.

Their complaint was that the dvd seemed to make up alien creatures and it was founded on nothing. They thought that anybody could make up whatever they wanted about aliens.

Of course the aliens in the dvd were founded on nothing since there's no available evidence to go on."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's speculation I know","review":"This is a one disk quickie that looks like it was pumped out for the Discovery channel.

(I stripped the timer by turning it backward. A No-No on these cheap appliances.) I much prefer the rice from the Sunbeam. The fuzzy logic rice comes out too light, i.e. there's no density, weight or toothsomeness to the cooked rice. I'm not a rice expert but I know that according to my preference the Sanyo overcooks the rice.Also, the Sanyo has no alarm to inform you when the cooking ends and warming begins. You have to use your separate kitchen timer if you need a reminder. There is however a thirteen (13) minute digital display countdown to finish.I suspect I'm going to replace my Sunbeam food steamer and, to save valuable apartment space, give away the Sanyo fuzzy logic rice steamer which I bought in part to save space.

This book has neither. Oh sure, the heroine, who isn't really all that likeable, has lots of sex. She'll sleep with almost anybody at the drop of a hat. However, there's not a lot of detail in the sex scenes and who cares anyway since Maddie and the reader never get to know anything about any of her partners. There is no buildup, no getting to know any of the men and hoping she will get together with them soon.I read all the Black Lace books, so obviously, I'm not a prude, but I couldn't like Maddie because she was such a slutty woman. I guess the reader is meant to find her near public sex acts daring and titillating. I just found her unsympathetic and got bored by the lack of detail and character development."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-Hum","review":"After reading the previous reviews, I decided to order this book, but was very disappointed. The story primarily consists of a not-particularly likeable heroine having sex with just about every man she meets. Very little time is spent on characterization, and there is almost no buildup of sexual tension. The sex itself is light on details and relatively unimaginative. If you like your stories with a lame plot, shallow characters, and lots of white-bread sex, this book is for you!

It is very relaxing and reminds me far away lands covered in tree and stone. \\"Saruman\\" was an unreleased track from the \\"Dol Guldor\\" recordings. Both tracks have no guitars or vocals, which I think is perfect for these two particular songs. There are vocal samples from Tolkien brocasts, which are placed perfectly in the songs.

The premise was interesting: an insider's look at being a personal assistant to a mega pop-star, with some family drama thrown on top because in this case the pop star and the assistant were cousins who grew up together in Oklahoma. Of course the Assistant Cousin gets sucked into the screwed up family drama of Pop Star Cousin, who has been a star since her pre-teen years and whose parents are her over-controlling managers. The Pop Star's life becomes a total train wreck and I kept waiting for the Assistant Cousin to be the voice of reason to help stop the train, but she got drawn into all the mess, too.

If you have to click on iTunes to bring it to the foreground, why not just click on the control to mute.On XP, as other reviewers have noted, the driver is buggy and hasn't been updated since 2004. If you are lucky the PowerMate will work for a few minutes - usually it does nothing at all in any application (oh - except glowing and pulsing!).

While the Da Vinci code was a faster paced affair. With both books I found myself running to the internet do research parts of the books I had just read. Great learning expierience from both books. Overall The Club Dumas was written better, and I found myself rooting for the characters more. Plus there were a couple laugh out loud momemts of dark humor I did not expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read for people who consider themselves readers!","review":"This was the first book I read by Perez-Reverte, and I'm hooked. I've read just about everything that has come out in English and some that were only available in French until recently. (Unfortunately, I don't read Spanish or else I'd be up-to-date!)\\"The Club Dumas\\" has just the right blend of skepticism, hints at supernatural goings-on, and thrilling mysteries. This is the sort of book that will keep you up all night and make you glad that you did.The only major drawbacks to this (and unfortunately to most of Perez-Reverte's books) is his flat characters. His female characters seem to be cardboard cut-outs. There is very little emotion here, but Perez-Reverte more than makes up for the lack of depth in his characters with his erudition and obvious love for his craft.Dear readers, keep reading these great books, especially \\"The Club Dumas\\", and dear translators, please hurry to translate his other works into English soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A club you'll want to join.","review":"There are two threads running through the book, and one comes to a much more satisfying conclusion than the other. I appreciate the art of the red herring, but the one dangled in front of both the reader and the lead, Corso, lost its potency -- especially as the thread that is unrelated to the herring really takes off.Regardless, I enjoyed the book. I like literary thrillers that intertwine history with fiction. (Although, I think books like this and \\"Da Vinci Code\\" really should include a page at the end that points out what is real and what is the author's construct -- I have met too many people that accept too much in this genre as whole fact.) The characters are expertly drawn, especially Corso and the mysterious young woman. And the obsession that bibliophiles feel for books is also well explored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful book ...Lousy Kindle edition","review":"I read this book a number of years ago and loved it! It still has a wonderful ability to draw me into the world of these characters - fictional and \\"fictional\\".

About ten years ago I was disillusioned with Dumas when I learned that his works were heavily based on collaboration. The author did a thorough job of detailing Dumas' works and collaborations. I no longer fault Dumas for collaborating to the degree he did because the author protrays Dumas with the art of story telling. I thoroughly enjoyed the mystery and suspense surrounding the main character, Corso. The author leads us on a merry chase with a nice surprise ending. I collect first editions and wish I had a book detective like Corso. I hope there will be a sequel where Corso joins \\"The Club Dumas\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Club Dumas","review":"THE CLUB DUMAS, by Perez-Reverte....I had a difficult time getting INTO this story. The author's characters were not very interesting to me....may be to others but not to me. His character descriptions and his general descriptions of scenes and people seemed like they were written by someone who was working overtime at being creative...they didn't \\"feel\\" natural or \\"genuine\\"....more contrived, as though the writer was a student in a composition class who was trying to impress an instructor. This purchase was just fine in terms of getting what I paid for...the physical condition of the book was very good...delivery time was excellent. I just did NOT like the book. I read it because it was being discussed by my book club. I think part of the reason I disliked it so much was that I had a hard time getting in to it so it felt like a READING ASSIGNMENT rather than an enjoyable read....It's a book I would not have finished if it had not been an \\"assignment.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seedy, trite and politically incorrect -- a pure delight!","review":"A marvelous suspense story. The wide variety of on-line reviews should tell you that there is something more than meets the eye here. The author adroitly ties sophisticated 20th century Europe to Dumas's bohemian 19th, as well as the hysteria of the Inquisition. The gin-soaked, unscrupulous protagonist, who demands payment in the face of the devil, is my kind of hero. And the ending, far from murky, is most satisfying. As for the concern over the mysterious girl, remember what the narrator instructs us in terms of reader response -- she may be what we want her to be. One thing is certain, Perez-Reverte and The Club Dumas would not have survived the Inquisition, which is all the more reason to enjoy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshing and brilliant \\"what's going-on; whodunnit\\" read","review":"I cannot recommend this book highly enough.

Lots of twists and turns to keep you guessing, LOTS of eccentric characters (a fallen angel, a satanic high priest, a woman who thinks she actually is a character from the Three Musketeers) and some great literary allusions. Nothing and no one is what they first appear to be and you can't be sure of anyone's motives or what actually is going on until the very last page.

I went through over a 100 pages in one reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dark, clever thriller","review":"This is a literature-loving whodunit. The main character, Lucas Corso, tries to unravel the mysteries of two texts, one a supposedly original chapter from The Three Musketeers and the other an ancient guide to contacting the devil. He is helped and hindered by a fascinating group of characters as he muddles his way to the end. I was engaged the entire way and gratified by the twist near the end. I enjoyed this book a great deal even though I haven't yet read Dumas; this book has inspired me to correct that omission."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eco's pendulum gets a nasty twist...","review":"When reading this book one cannot ignore the influence of two great writers: the one is Umberto Eco, whose style and Idea, as well as the way of writing surely reflect through the writing of Reverte; the other is Hermann Hesse in his Nobel Prize winning book The Glass Bead Game [Das Glasperlenspiel], a book which, I suspect, is not known to Reverte. Alas, this current book does not stand in the standard of such great Novelists. Though the plot seems to be very 'intelligent' to say the least (through citations and so forth), the end is very badly written, the whole subject of enjoyment from this book is thus questioned. I wouldn't advise reading this book if you're an intellectual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, only mediocre","review":"The premise of the book definitely has potential to be intriguing, enticing, and unusual, but the potential is just never fully realized. Two separate plots are loosely joined in the novel--the search for demonic books and the answers therein and the half-hearted muddling about a Dumas manuscript--and neither is fully fleshed out. Some of the plot twists are simply silly and the eventual denouments (two, one for each of the plots) are by turns ridiculous and boring. The main character is intriguing, but around him are assembled cardboard cut-outs of characters. Not a terrible novel, but just so much less than it could be. A shame. I was convinced to buy the book solely by the book cover promise that it was a cross between The Name of the Rose and The Three Musketeers--it is, resoundingly, not even close. Rather than buy this book, read (or re-read) either of those other two--it will be a much more satisfying investment of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Mediocre","review":"Oh! how I was desperate to like this book. Especially since it was my bathtub reading. And especially, especially since I was reading The Three Musketeers at the same time (as my nighttime reading). I just never got into the character of Corso as much as I'd have liked. Though the ending is alright, the middle of the book was too hard to get through--nothing dangerous, nothing interesting, only mildly intriguing, nothing that would make one to want to continue reading. I hope you like it more than I."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly complicated and uninteresting plot; boring chars.","review":"I barely made it through this book. For me it was incredibly boring. The plot lines were complicated, but that's OK. I figured I'd get it at some point; never did and never did care if I did! What was particularly odd is that there really are two different intertwined plots or stories and you keep wondering how they're going to be inter-related. By the end of the book (if you make it) you discover the secret -- they're NOT! I really dis-liked this book, found it boring and the characters uninteresting and flat. Two stars is a really generous rating..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've read lately","review":"It's great, one of the best books I've read in many months, it kept me thinking to solve the mistery, and every time I re-read it keeps me intrigued.

The threat of devil worship and low-hanging evil is ever present. The plot's riddle, involving Lucifier, Alexander Dumas and every valuable, ancient book known to antiquarian bookpersons, is a labyrinth of dead ends, wrong turns and finally utter confusion. I could not put this book down. However, the ending does not match the rest of the book--and maybe it couldn't--the rest of the book is THAT GOOD. At times, when reading it alone at night, I kept looking over my shoulder to see if the devil was lurking in the shadows.

So many details - where's the story???"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great pleasure book","review":"I read this book, having seen the movie \\"Ninth Gate\\". While the book is much better, and more enjoyable, I admit the experience gave me a good visual on the setting and some of the characters.Perez-Reverte's writing is often compared to Eco, but I personally prefer it more. Some say it is a \\"popular\\" imitation of Eco, but I think those opinions do not do Perez-Reverte justice. His writing flows, and is pleasant, compared to Eco's heavy, dense writing which seems to beat you over the head with details from topics flying all over the place.The \\"Popular\\" setting, of Dumas' \\"Musketeers\\" and references to Agatha Christy, Maurice LeBlanc, and of course, Sir Conan Doyle makes for a fun read, with a very real feeling while invoking the devil and fallen angels and the occult.If you like any of the above mysteries, or enjoy reading about fallen angels, or just enjoy reading a well written book, this is a great one to pick up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoyed \\"The Flanders Panel\\" better.","review":"After having enjoyed \\"The Flanders Panel\\", I was looking forward to \\"The Club Dumas\\", and was hooked by the first chapter. I found the storylines of bibliophiles, the occult, and especially the possible forgery of the books intriguing. However, it all fell apart after the revelation of the sham Club Dumas, and just got worse when the final plotlines were revealed. I found the ending to be unclear and convoluted.

Thankfully, Arturo Perez-Reverte is one of them. I absolutely love the suspenseful, intelligent, sardonic way the story is told. All the characters are very interesting and complex, and none of them are really to be trusted. This is a book to be enjoyed and to re-read.

The books that I have downloaded up to know have been free classics. They were, in general, very good. This edition, however, is chock full of errors.I have scanned the other reviews and there is no mention of this. Is this then only occuring on my Kindle, or is the Kindle communinty completely tolerant of these types of problems?Since there are no live human beings at Amazon, it will likely remain a mystery.

The characters were interesting, although mildly eccentric, and unlike any the literary community has seen in the last few years.

The Club Dumas began intriguingly enough, but soon became bizarre. The female character, Irene Adler, is utterly superfluous; did Perez-Reverte think he needed a romantic interest? And why on earth a \\"guardian angel\\"??? Then the hints of supernatural evil are, well, beneath the abilities this author demonstrated in Captain Alatriste. I will try one more of his novels, but if it resembles this one, I'll pass on the rest of his oeuvre."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Uncle\\"","review":"I will make this short and sweet.

Slow and tedious in sections, I found myself wishing that I could cut my wrists with the pages to end the horror. What is ultimately the true source of frustration is that this book has so much potential. A deal with the devil, a mysterious vixen, an international search for a demonic book, ohhh, the wasted potential.Look elsewhere for a good read. I feel for those who judge this as an intellectual mystery. Please. In the end the bad guy all along is unmasked as... the evil mastermind! The mysterious girl is... mysterious!

I got to page 237 and had only experienced one pulse-quickening episode, when the protagonist, Corso, is chased for a few seconds down a narrow street by a menacing driver. He slips out of the way at the last moment and bumps his poor, widdle hand.If you are intrigued by leather book bindings and obscure 16th century demonology, you'll happily breeze through the first 237 pages.

Here's the short version of my grievances:1/3 of this book is taken up with grating, failed Raymond Chandler-type descriptions of the various facial expressions the main character makes, and how they resemble various woodland creatures such as rabbits and wolves. All of this nonsense perplexed me until I looked at the author's picture on the dust jacket. He looks kind of like a bunny.1/3 of it is taken up with him being menaced by a shadowy group of sinister RENAISSANCE FAIR TYPES who act out \\"The Three Musketeers\\". ooo, spooky. I realized about halfway through that this book was little more than a fancy Nancy Drew mystery.1/3 of it deals with someone finding a book that summons satan. Not bad, if done right. Not done right.None of these goofy plot threads have much to do with each other, and the whole thing comes across as an attempt at an Umberto Eco book written by a college student."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Club Dumas","review":"This book looked like a winner: a novel about about books. Set in Spain, Portugal, and Paris and featuring an odd, yet likable protaganist, it opens with an enticing prologue. The narrative style is intriguing; it's written as an account by one of the characters. The reader is given a strong, Agatha Christie-esque hint about the end. But the novel simply peters out. The intrigue is lost. It wallows in melodrama, perhaps imitating in some unfulfilling way the works of Dumas himself. I wanted to be surprised, enchanted, or even shocked. But instead I was just bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could have lived without this one.","review":"Don't bother. The characters in this book are very one dimensional. Corso is a cliche sleazebag, the man he works for is a cliche rich-guy-does-occult, and \\"the girl\\" is a cliche mysterious beauty. The only thing vaguely interesting about this book is the little pieces of information about old books and the woodcuts. Very disappointing ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perez-Reverte comes undone.","review":"The Flanders Panel was book with such a compelling story that many of the ridiculous idiosyncaries could be masked. Not so with Perez-Reverte's second effort. The absurdities are blown up ten-fold, showing the style for what it is -- basic noir. As with the last book, it's well wrapped in \\"art\\". The first, great paintings; with this, great literature (What next -- a Mozart scandal? Rand?). But the booze and cigarettes, guys on the run, sympathetic dames with big breasts in seedy bars, men with too-young women, show the fine line that the author has been treading. This time, he went to far. The story is interesting, but at times totally ridiculous. Pass on this one. And find out with the third book what this author is really worth"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perez-Reverte does it again.","review":"Once again, the author writes a book that has you guessing right up to the very end. His books never disappoint. What was disappointing was that no one seems to have proofed this book after sending it through the OCR software. I don't know how many times Paris became Pans. Many, many of these errors making it difficult to read at times. Punctuation disappears and words are restructured. Very distracting. Otherwise it would have been 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"fantastic and very intelligent book.twists everywhere it possibly can and leaves you wanting a sequel immediately.a must for anyone that actually still reads books that are not about some \\" celebrity \\" ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighter than \\"The Name of the Rose\\", intriguing to the end","review":"I rate this below \\"The Name of the Rose\\" and above \\"The Flanders Panel.\\" Intriguing story, I never got bored, except with the older, jaded man/hard-boiled but still innocent young girl love affair. Always find those a little sleazy. Otherwise very readable, and the end a pleasing surprise, a dose of reality when I expected an occult ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy OCR","review":"The novel in itself is fine, and I would probably rate it a 3.5 stars. It is a book lover's book, clever in places, somewhat self-satisfied (and then lengthy) in others. Two recommendations:- read the book first, see the movie after- avoid the e-book like the plague. I can see that given the book's number of languages and the abbreviations they had to disable the spell check for the OCR to work at all, but the result would have needed significant manual correction before being released on an an unsuspecting public. Try to look for \\"Paris\\" among the many \\"Pan\\"'s (?!?) or the \\"rain\\" in the many \\"ram\\"'s. Once or twice, hey, life ain't perfect, but this is a mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT storytelling & probably this author's best!","review":"Arturo Perez-Reverte is that rare author today who writes exceptionally well-told stories without any filler. 'The Club Dumas' is a great example of his engrossing & entertaining no-nonsense style. It centers around a book dealer who finds rare volumes for wealthy clients. In this case, a book that is very old and said to contain a spell for summoning the devil. Problem is, everyone who he encounters that owns it winds up dead in some ritualistic occult way! The book gallops along at a very exciting pace until it reaches a very unexpected climax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paul Heaton is surely a great singer, BUT... With The Beautiful South!","review":"Since I discovered The Beautiful South back in 2001, I became a fan of this extraordinary English band!Searching in different Web pages more information about them, I found out that the 'engine' of this band was this guy, Paul Heaton.Sure he's really a good singer-songwriter, but in this solo effort... Having read all the things that other Music reviewers said about him, I surely expected something by far, much better than what he has recorded in this album.So, I really think that Mr. Heaton should consider to reunite with The Beautiful South buddies once again..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't overlook this album!!","review":"Well, I am please to inform those of that are fans of the Beautiful South that this is a remarkable record considering Paul is on his own. The sound is that of the South and a little bit more. He seems to be experimenting with techno sounds on a couple of tracks, but not too much so that it makes you skip to the next song. I like most of the album and really really dig the rest. It is worth the import price. I should also mention that he seems to be trying out three new female vocalists here since the departure of Jackie a couple of years ago. Only one caught my attention, but they all serve his voice well. If you go to the French Amazon site , you may find it cheaper there. Good luck and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul is still alive","review":"Well,strange story. When i discovered the Housemartins in 1986 i thought the beatle's spirit was in their LP.

Of course the beautiful south came but the spirit has gone away ... however their first 3 LP were quite good .... but the rest was a kind of bad soup ...But Paul is Paul, it means one of the most fantastic \\"pop voice\\" i've ever heard (with Morissey, Fergal Sharkey ....).

Gena Showalter has created a beautiful, mystical land, full of intriguing races and a rich history. The characters were well-developed.

I want to revisit Atlantis again and again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story of adventure!","review":"I recently discovered Gena Showalter last year and once I read a couple of her books, I could not stop myself from buying the others just to read her fantastic tales!Gena gets into the heads of her characters so well that she literally brings them to life. Every time I read one of her books, the characters just seem to pop out and I can actually imagine them in my head as I go through the book.With Gray and Jewel, these two were a wonderful, passionate pair. His need to help the damsel, but never really letting his greed get in the way of what he truely wants. You feel his pain, you feel hers and you can not help but root for them and then feel like you want to slap them for making the bad decision, heh. I love the humor that Gena has herself and that she places in her characters to really make the characters and the story interesting.Thank you Gena!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I really like reading books by Gena Showalter and I especially liked this one. It had an interesting plot and lots of unique characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"I really loved this book. It had the perfect pace and I loved the different take on how Atlantis was formed and why it sank. I loved how the hero and the heroine had a previous connection with one another, though I kind of wished that the connection was explained a little more. Like why it was Gray and not some other guy that Jewel connected with. I also loved how readers got to see what happened with Darius and Grace. It was also great that even though both Gray and Jewel thought that they would not be together, Jewel's determination not to let the fact that he was from the surface and she was from Atlantis stop them from being together. I also really enjoyed the how we also got a look at more of the different creatures that live in Atlantis. It was just a truly touching story and an excellent read. Plus, Gena Showalter is one of my favorite authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jewel of Atlantis","review":"The book arrived in very good condition. The storyline was better than I thought it would be, it kept me on the edge of my seat til I finished it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enter Atlantis...","review":"This is the second book by Gena Showalter I have read. The first was Heart of the Dragon, which is also set in Atlantis.The Jewel of Dunamis is a very sought after item. The Jewel is not a real jewel at all, but a demi-goddess with the gift of prophecy. She can be a powerful weapon. Gray James is an agent from the surface, sent to retrieve the Jewel of Dunamis unaware that she is a beautiful woman.A recommended read that I would give 4.5 stars to if possible. I couldn't help but compare it to Heart of the Dragon which I really really liked a lot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Drool Fest :)","review":"I loved this book, I really did. I love all of her series..

It took a \\"unique\\" point of view towards prisons and concentration camps. However, the more I read, the more I saw that Mrazek actually had an ingenious point. One of his chapters highlights how concentration camps in Czechoslovakia and Indonesia actually inadvertently pooled many of those nations' best and brightest peoples, allowing them access to the best doctors and educators. I won't reveal too much more, except to say that this book really challenges you to think daringly about colonialism and power relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underground classic","review":"The gems of this collection are \\"Lover Man\\" and \\"Bebop\\" - the notorious takes Bird recorded drugged out of his mind in CA.

Push button design is nice, but ear bud fits funny and doesn't want to stay put. Distance between the ear bud and the microphone is too far and can't be adjusted.

I thought I was buying pure stevia like other stevia products I used in the past. I knew something was different as it takes a lot more of Stevia Supreme than the other pure stevia products (1/3 of a teaspoon vs. 1/32 of a teaspoon). I finally read the ingredients (should have done this before buying), it is greatly diluted with erythritol. If I wanted erythritol, I would have bought erythritol. They probably do this to increase their profits.I bought Stevia Supreme because it seemed to be a very good value, but it only gives 150 servings for the 5 oz bottle. The pure Stevia products on the market (that I thought I was buying) give you well over 1000 servings for a comparable size bottle. Too bad they are pitching this as a \\"stevia\\" product instead of a \\"stevia blend\\". I will read the labels more closely in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yum! Yum!

Based on the reviews, this seemed like an excellent product. About the only good part about this product is that it does sweeten. However, it tastes bad and the aftertaste is even worse.

I read the reviews and hoped this would be different. Nope. Bitter and a funny back taste I have difficulty describing. It's just foul.

If these guys continue to be the same for any longer they will regress because they sure as heck ain't moving forward. On Nimrod GreenDay didn't branch out because the songs still sound like typical GreenDay. Their Good Riddence song was written even before Dookie came out, and the version of GR that came out on their Stink Breath single sounds just like Words I Might Have Ate from their 1992 CD.

The new track Maria (which was the b-side to the \\"Waiting\\" single on pink vinyl) is awesome...another Green Day winner. However, Pop Rocks and Coke, the other new track, is somewhat mediocre. Buy this record if you haven't purchased the previous Green Day releases (Dookie is essential) but if you have them all...skip. Instead, buy the 45 of \\"Waiting b/w Maria,\\" just for the b-side.

They didn't even touch on their first 2 albums, I really like Kerplunk, which started their whole career.I love every song on here and they are great, but too many good songs are left off to make this a good cd, a 2 cd greatest hits that would flow and include much more stuff would have been awesome, but that obviously didn't happen. Green Day is amazing, but this just isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHIPPED ME WRONG ITEM","review":"Now i do realize they tried to contact me via amazon but without my permission they sent me a CD instead of the VINYL ALBUM I ordered.

While the authors are very well-qualified in this subject I feel as though it wasn't written for the average person. This book WILL NOT help you when you go to your Saturday garage sale or flea market. The book spends way too much time on furniture and the second half of the book is all 'practice appraisals' which are for objects the average person will never buy or be able to afford. I felt like this book had a certain 'snob' appeal and if you can afford to buy a $5000 or $10,000 piece you probably have enough knowledge without having to consult a book.

I guess it might work IF you were to come across the exact item(s) discribed throughout the book. It's like trying to read an encyclopidia, only not as informative.

The work begins with a discussion of the factorsto be considered in an appraisal i.e. material, origin,age,size, condition and purpose/utilization. The author teacheshow to examine an antique by making mental notes and observingimportant details; such as, carvings, initials etc. He providesan example of the Gorham Company markings on objects. Forinstance, a bell shape stamp means that the item was madecirca 1900. An item may have several valuations; namely,retail value, cash value, liquidation value, replacement valueand the fair market value.

I personnaly get bored easily with lyrics that make the singer the victim. This whole album,as well as their debut is full of \\"you've done something to hurt me, and i'm going to get you back\\" or at least somthing close to that. \\"Sick Of My Life\\" is a perfect example just from the title.Also the guitars are extremly boring, I'm a guitar player and a metal head, and it takes more that intense distortion to be hard or heavy.

The first CD is better, but that doesn't make this one [is bad]. I just got the 3rd album, Faceless.It's really good, about the same as this one. The best songs are Awake, Greed, and Vampires. They all have the best guitars. Tony Rombola, the guitarist, is awesome. He plays that guitar better than Metallica's Kirk Hammet. Sully Erna, front man, is a powerful vocalist with an incredible voice for metal. This band is a mix of Metallica and Alice in Chains.

I was not dissapointed at all. Their CD rocks with the same energy as their live show.

Quickly I realized how bad Godsmack rips AIC off. To the point where it makes me sick. I mean I have nothing against being influenced by a band but to copy their sound exactly is stealing is should be a crime. DO NOT BUY THIS CD AND DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BAND!!!!!! The name Godsmack even comes from a AIC chains song called \\"God Smack\\". It really cant get any worse than this, or can it? It can! I heard Godsmack is now coming out with an aucustic EP. Alice In Chains Had two Aucustic EP's one called \\"Sap\\" and the other one called \\"Jar Of Flies\\".

And get this disc!","review":"So for those three million people out there who bought the first CD, make sure you get the second one. Godsmack builds on their first, but at the same time completely blows it out of the water. This is the best true ROCK CD to come out in a long time. It is loud and hard and pure and cuts right into your head. Sully's growling vocals are better than they have ever been, and the band as a whole seems to have gotten like 10 times tighter and become even better musicians than they were on the first CD. With \\"Awake\\" Godsmack proves they have the talent to become rock/metal masters like only Metallica has ever done. Godsmack isn't just another flash in the pan metal band taking advantage of the \\"return of the rock.\\" These guys are for real and you should definitely check out this CD, it will BLOW YOU AWAY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tough Decision","review":"So...I am a member of this CD club, and I was trying to maximize the number of free CDs I could receive from the club. Well, they told me if I ordered my feature selection, Godsmack - Awake, I could pick two additional free CDs (I chose Faith No More - Angel Dust and Dilated Peoples - The Platform). On the other hand, I could have just purchased another CD to fulfill my membership agreement, but I wouldn't get the additional 2 free CDs. So I decided to order the featured selection and am enjoying my free selections! Why do I tell you this? Just to show you how devoid of emotion, feeling, and talent this godsmack album is. Its worth more as a bartering chip than an actual musical selection. If you like classic rock, you won't like this. If you like hardcore/death/thrash, you won't like this. If you are in the middle of the road and like your hard rock/metal with some melody, there is so so much more out there that is worth your while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good riifs, but where are the lyrics","review":"Godsmack makes a great sonicly pleasing sound. But I must say, that the lyrics coming from this band have to be among the worst rock has to offer. Godsmack would make an OUTSTANDING band if they could write. The lyrics are always bad, and sometimes laughable.If you are looking for great riffs, and nice loud pure rock and roll, Godsmack is for you, they rock hard. But if you prefer the whole package, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are a follower or have no original thoughts...","review":"For starters, any band that actually gets their name from an Alice in Chains song has to be cool right? Godsmack takes this one step further and actually steals their entire sound. Creative genius. Godsmack has taken their spot as leaders of the new wave of unoriginality and proven that talent isn't necessary at all to sell a lot of records. Novice guitar players take note, Godsmack has proved that you don't really have to know how to play the guitar very well to master a borrowed sound. Bottom line, this is a great cd for the trailer park party or the frat boy get together. I'm going to go watch NASCAR, later..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give these guys some GNR!!!!","review":"ahhhh yet another Godsmack album, so what does that mean? More tired rock cliches, more riffs that never sail and more of Sully Erna's melancholic rock jock persona. Erna's still growling about pain and suffering and blah blah blah! He sings \\"sick of my life\\" and \\"all i feel is hate\\" with about as much feeling as a drunk Britney Spears. Not only that but all the usual cliches are there, rat-tat-tat guitar riffs turn into boring choruses, guitar solos come alive about as often as Gary Coleman's (...) life and the occasional groove is thwarted by Erna's processed lyrics. For an album called awake it sure is a great sleep inducer."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as first","review":"I didn't really like this album as much as I did their first one. The songs aren't as good and they're aren't as many. I mean what are there like 11 tracks? I got this CD and was quite disappointed. If you wanna check out Godsmack get their first album instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT what i expected","review":"Its too bad. Their first cd was awesome. I loved it, its one of my favorite cds.

I'd buy Godsmack instead, then put Awake and Sick Of Life on mixes, and wait for the third Godsmack album to come around."},{"rating":"2","title":"My \\"Awake\\" Review","review":"Well, Godsmack has released a second CD. Their first album was better, but this one also delivers the same great guitar riffs and vocals that Godsmack (the album) delivered.

We have a singer with the same messege in every song (\\"Go away! Stay away!\\"), a guitarist who plays the same power chord over and over, and a crappy drummer. The only slight props I can give is to the bassist. This CD is terrible, don't get it.Favorite songs: Sick of Life"},{"rating":"1","title":"Godsmack smacks of God!","review":"Eww.....I hate Christian rock. Sully Erna needs to stop talking about his Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. The music is really great, and the guitar player is definitely amongst the most innovative of his generation, along with Munky, Head and Madonna. Too bad every song is about their religion, which really bothers me. They market themselves as being dark, but in reality they're just like DC Talk and MxPx. Which leads me to give this album 1 big \\"Not cool, man!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"An aquaintence of mine lent this to me, telling me it was as good as Metallica, maybe even better. My respect for him as a music fan is now pretty much non-existent. Think of the worst songs from Reload (pretty bad huh), now multiply the boringness and shlockness by about 10 and you have the best song on this album. To be honest i can't even tell the difference between each song. They're all just really loud and bland. The musicianship is completely hackneyed and uninspiring. Metal is suppose to have a fast vigorous rhythm section, heavy creative guitar riffs and lots of sudden changes in tempo. Godsmack has nothing, except for loudness and a worthless vocalist who tries to imitate others. There is really nothing that remotely saves this album. Even the cover art is horrible. I get to see the perpetrators of this peice of ..., which just makes me angry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please save your money","review":"All I can say is Alice In Chains Rippoffs.

This album still has many good songs such as tippin, awake [as we all know], greed, and sick of life. I haven't discovered any others yet. If this album hadn't sounded like the first, then I would have rated it 5 stars. Godsmack seems to have a problem saying Go Away or Keep away. Overall, a good buy except for the fault of sounding the same. Worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album rocks!!!!!!!","review":"This album is awesome. Sully's vocals are a lot stronger than before. The guitars and drums sound heavier than before. I liked how the CD came with an enhanced portion which had a little menu that had the songs and when you click on them it gives the lyrics, picture, and a video clip of them talking about the album. Each song has its own clip. I just wish that it would have included the music video \\"Awake\\" in the enhanced portion, but the CD is still cool though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard rocking CRUNCH","review":"Good 2nd effort from the Boston 4-some... as hard and crunchy as it may be..... I like it a ton..... but, it sounds like it is more of the same (as their 1st self titled disc from 1998). Same in-yer-face attitude, hard guitars chords, lyrics chock full of sorrow, pain and anger - what is new here? Don't get me wrong - I like this disc. There debut was so strong and it broke new ground... along the likes of Creed (a strong first album, followed up by more of the same on their 2nd)... where is the creativity.... or something just a little bit different.... to leave a slightly different taste in your mouth. If you like the 1st Godsmack - and are looking for more of the same - you will absolutely DIG this disc. Buy the disc, hit yourself with a 2x4, and enjoy. Best songs... Sick of Life, Vampires, Forgive Me, and Black Magick."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing followup","review":"I thought the first Godsmack cd was one of the best metal cd's in years.

Awake, their second go, is on a whole just much less interesting than their original. Awake is great, as are Sick of Life, Greed, and Bad Magick. However, after Bad Magick, the CD goes way downhill. It can't hold my interest after it gets past the aforementioned 4th track. Any album that has 4 decent tracks followed by 7 junk tracks doesn't deserve anything more than the rating I gave it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need a hard rock fix?","review":"Godsmack does it again with a disc that's even better than their excellent first one.

It should be more realistic. Their song awake is the one that I didn'tlike. The guitar was good but the vocal was horrible. If you want metal listen to Mettalica. Its alot better then this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as their first","review":"I was disappointed the first time I heard awake. But it is very entertaining after you have listened to it about 3 times. Just like their first CD, the best songs are at the beginning. Similar lyrics as the first, but these songs sound very similar. Still a great CD and I would recommend it to anyone who loves hard rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"this is a great followup to great cd.Godsmack improve their sound and go for a harder sound.best tracks are \\"Awake\\",\\"Sick of Life\\",\\"Greed\\",\\"Vampires\\"and \\"Mistakes.\\"all of the other songs are excellent to.GO BUY THIS CD NOW OR U MISS OUT ON THE GREATEST CD OF 2000!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More effort please.","review":"I hate to write this review, but this needs to be said, this CD shows a serious lack of effort. I loved their first release, it's one of my favorite CD's of all time, but it seems like they didn't even try on this new album. They didn't even TRY to do anything new with the lyrics, the songs all sound the same (Sick of Life and Greed demonstrate this all to well), and am I the only one who thinks they are ripping off Sevendust with all the low end guitar and bass? Godsmack seemed one of the most innovative bands in terms of musical talent, but now I can only hope that they will try harder on the next CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wake up!","review":"I grow tired of some people harbering this label that GS is trying to be AIC. Get over it already! Every band has influences and I am sure GS was influenced by AIC sounding materal and greatly by Metallica, but this band stands very strong on their own. Guitar riffs are amazing, song writing is strong and vocals totally rock. I by far enjoy Erna's vocal style to any hard rock band, it is rough, but understandable, audible and stong. Another awesome piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Godsmack's sophmore effort is a worthy one","review":"Although I don't like it quite as much as the first (yet), it's growing on me. There are plenty of good tracks here. Sick of life, Vampires, Awake, Bad Magick are my picks of the disc so far. I have yet to sit down and intently listen to the disc undistracted so my previous list may change.The ECD feature is nice, but it's set up a little strange. Each section of the extended portion is referenced by a track title from the disc. Some of the info bytes are not listed under the title of the track mentioned. It's kind of wierd at first, but I ended up not caring.The sound is heavy and hitting, just as Godsmack's first disc. I particularly like the riff on Vampires, and while, for the most part, there are no lyrics for the track it is my current disc fav.If you liked the self titled, initial Godsmack offering, you will enjoy the sequel as well. Enjoy. Don't rock too hard boys, you might strain somethin' and delay your third."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"My friend got me into this band a little while back and I thought they were pretty good. Then the new album came out so next time I went to the mall, I picked it up. I must say, I'm very impressed. This is much better than their self-titled debut. My favorite songs must be Awake, Greed, and Spiral. Sully's voice is great and the music is awesome. It's best displayed in Vampires were there are no lyrics, just sound clips telling us why we are fasinated by these creatures. If you're a fan of metal, this CD doesn't disappoint. Pick it up today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's really simple.","review":"If you want Metallica's musical intelligence, Alice in Chain's sound, and Corrosion of Conformity's driving bass and guitar.

Now, I LOVE the song Awake. I couldn't get enough of that song on the radio, so I bought the cd. Well, by far that is the best song on the cd and the rest just kind of either fall short, or fall off altogether.I think that if you're a Godsmack fan, then you'll probably love this album. But if you've only heard Awake and think it's pretty cool, then you'd be best to steer clear of this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"BELIEVE ME WITHOUT WRONG !!!","review":"AT FIRST , I'm not a fan of them. But i have some friend who's really into godsmack. so i don't understand how them like enjoyto this band.But Sick of Life this song is a pretty good.The rest song......too bad.

However, despite the best efforts of \\"Mistakes\\" and \\"Trippin',\\" this album fails to capture the darkness that made their debut so compelling. There are plenty of colossal riffs - check out the raging \\"Sick of Life\\" or \\"Bad Magick\\" - but it's moments like the sixth and seventh tracks, \\"Forgive Me\\" - an aching lament to a lost lover - and \\"Spiral\\" - a searching track full of harmony and energy - that show the band at its best. If you liked the first album, you should like this one too, but understand the songs are tighter in production this time around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is still one of my faviorte cds.

It stains every fabric it touches and I can not get it out.I have soaked the items in Oxy Clean and in bleach and still that dye remains in the wash cloths. It makes everything look like it is dirty no matter how many times I wash. What bothers me the most is that these items that are destroyed are less than 2 months old. I replaced my old items recently and now the new ones look worse than the old ones.While the product itself works and smells great be sure you are not using a wash cloth that will matter to you when applying it.

Most of these things can be done easily in your own home!It really focuses on \\"adult\\" schedules and I like that. When you're juggling a job, family and who knows what else you dont have a lot of time and that is the focus of the book.The author knows the subject well, and it shows. It also focuses on hard work, not fluff or BS. This is not a \\"get skinny quick\\" scam book by any means.

But its soon forgotten, replaced by a bouncy, whistling theme that is not soon forgotten about. You'll never forget the theme. The theme is indelible.Morricone must have known he had a charm with this pucker up and blow line, because he centers the whole score around it. As soon as you think it has disappeared, or is out of ear out of mind, it reappears. As if your walking through the film with the whistler.The key here is the melody. How simple it is. How it rests in the ear. Marricone's ability to build a towering score--full of orchestral light and shade--is amazing, but given that Marricone is Marricone, not a bit surprising."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't See its Offspring","review":"I recently purchased the AT&T 436 and it displays call made from land lines as it should.

'Protect me from what I want', 'Plasticine' and 'English Summer Rain' are my favourites songs from this album, which is probably the most emotional album released so far in 2003.I also liked title of the album that very clearly symbolises what Placebo are all about.

With an almost hypnotic tone to their music, Placebo sings with a silent anger. You can tell from the symbolic title Sleeping with Ghosts that this isn't cheerful rock. Placebo is aboout the bitterness of relationships, and all their songs are filled with grief and disappointment. The highlight is \\"The Bitter End\\", which is about a relationship falling apart in front of their eyes. It's really out there, but its original. And that's a miracle."},{"rating":"2","title":"could have been better..","review":"placebos 4th album is a mix of there previous efforts, with some new ideas aswell.i dont think that its better than any of there other albums, the best in my opinion was without you,though sleeping with ghosts is still worth a listen, theyve got some really good songs, some listenable, and some you skip. being a huge placebo fan, i expected more, but still happy with the outcome.fav songs: bulletproof cupid,the bitter end,this picture,sleeping with ghosts, ill be youres."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good music but not their best.","review":"This album is hard for me to review.

I saw them in concert a few weeks ago and it was great. When they played songs from this CD, they didn't seem out of place or anything, but they just weren't as good as other material.

Usually I enjoy extremely techinque music because I appriecate listening to good musicians but a CD like this shows how not being overtly complex can be a good thing, but oh, this CD is very complex.

They also don't consider the album before it, Black Market Music, to be typical of the band. But, hey, when 50% of the albums put out by the band are considered atypical, uh, I think you need to redefine what you think the band is really like.Also, I love Black Martet Music too.

However, Duetos seems to be a loose collection of Gal's appearances at other people's shows, and her voice just gets lost in the fray.

Darrach seems only interested in the ugliness of the characters & does so quiet creatively. I'm sure he has a lot of people mad at him right now. With all the books about Fischer I guess he was trying to do something different. Three fourths of the book is about whether or not Bobby is going to take the plane to Iceland for a game that the entire world is anticipating, a kind of way to keep the reader in suspense. Only the end got into the tension and psychological madness that these games can become, which I really liked. I have to admit that I skimmed over the rest because it all boiled down to whether Bobby was going to play or not, and a simple yes or no would have allowed him to fit more interesting details like his relationship to girls and the odd things that geniuses can do with their brains."},{"rating":"1","title":"Say NO to Sloan","review":"I will never buy anything with the name \\"Sam Sloan\\" on it.Hopefully this book will sell zero copies and in the future anyone who thinks that asking Sam Sloan to write a forward for their book or to contribute in any other way will be discouraged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucid, compelling, informative","review":"Batchelor hits a home run with this text. The narrative device of contrasting Asian and Western personalities who were key to the interplay between Buddhism and European cultures makes this book easy to get hooked into.

Seriously. There's a little for everyone in this story; drama, suspense, mystery, romance, and lots of adventure.

Some words are unnecessarily difficult for a young child to understand, and sentence structure and flow are very choppy at times. It's almost as if a third-grader and a twelth-grader took turns writing the sentences.Second, the book claims that Summer is \\"good\\" and Winter is \\"bad\\". The two forces initially are at peace, but then Winter starts freezing people. Summer decides to rescue them by warming them up. Then two sides decide to negotiate a peace. Huh? It's just so ridiculous. I would have preferred a story that shows that both summer and winter as being equally valuable, but just different. I get the feeling the author lives up north somewhere and just personally hates the cold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go elsewhere","review":"This is indeed a rare classic and if you must have it, I guess you can pay an average of 100 dollars for a used or new one.

Total cost then around 20 bucks new and you'll always have the file (assuming you back it up)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here we go again!!!!!!!!!","review":"With all due respect to Richard Carpenter, this collection is a disappointment. I have a very high end audio system. If he was going to remix these songs, why not get rid of all of the excess and artificial sounding reverb and clean up the vocal tracks? Why not try to create an intimate in your room sound instead of the same old, tired, re-packaged sound. The SACD track only helps alittle. The vocals still sound edgy and grainy to me and since the original tracks were analog, this was in the mix or the mastering. Next time, go for a cleaner, more intimate sound, not the same stuff we've already heard countless times."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 2004 update","review":"Originally released in 2000, SINGLES 1969-1981 itself was an update to the older SINGLES 1969-1973.

Overall, it is a good show to watch. the one thing that i was kinda disappointed in it is the ending. They leave it so open at the end that they make it look like there is going to be another season, which there is not from what i am aware of. It kinda reminds me of a 26 episode show and stopping it at episode 20. They do answer a lot of questions about things, but do not really put and end as to if the 2 stay together, if they stay on earth, or if they ever let any of their friends from school in on that she is actually an alien.

As an editor of MAVIN, a multiracial magazine, I would think that the stories told in *What Are You?* would incite well-versed reactions. However, I had butterflies opening the envelope and while quickly skimming the table of contents. Quickly the euphoria changed to familiar, yet repressed feelings of 'other-ness,' alienation, ambiguity--almost sadness. The book's impact is inevitably felt on all levels, as being mixed is something you can never truly 'abandon' or 'escape;' it is intricately woven into every experience, simple and profound. Now I understand that the source of my confusion is the gradual process of the book's impact as it revisits myriad experiences in my history, and stirs them all up again. As they settle back down, the influence of each experience has been slightly altered and better understood. Congratulations and thank you for creating a powerful resource whose impact waxes daily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inside Her Head ...","review":"Reading this book made me remember a biracial childhood friend. As young children, we thought of her as no different from the rest of the kids in the neighborhood. However, as we got to high school, people wanted to define her, wanted her to define herself. She didn't. I admired her for that. I always wished I could've felt comfortable enough with her to find out just what was going on inside her head during those times. After reading this book, now I feel that maybe I have a glimpse of that. This book will help anyone who is not biracial have a better understanding of the thoughts and experiences of those who are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfair, Unbalanced, and Unqualified...","review":"Tom McGill's \\"engineering\\" background is about as relevant to interpreting the population status of a marine mammal as an auto mechanic's background is for performing open heart surgery.

If someone has read this book and thinks it's crap, that's their opinion. If they think that this book is the gospel of manatee science, that's their opinion also. To each his own. In my opinion, while this book claims to be created under the cloak of \\"sound science\\", it actually is just crap. Just because you claim to be using actual data doesn't mean that you are interpreting it properly. At best, this book is a heavily-biased interpretation of the truth. I recommend that you save your money and go to any public hearing in Florida regarding manatee speed zones. You'll hear the same thing that appears in this book (basically a lot of whining) and you won't have to pay for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk journalism","review":"Note to Joe T: Are you reviewing this book or are you just reviewing the previous reviewer (which is a violation of Amazon's policy)?

The posted reviews are a clear indication of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, but don't take it seriously","review":"I would have to agree with the reviewer from Tampa. This book is unintentionally funny, but can't be taken seriously. The author suggests an X-Files type conspiracy that is pretty far fetched. It sounds like he's simply a disgruntled boater that wants to go fast, regardless of who or what he runs over. Having said that, I'm sure this book will be a favorite among redneck boaters and good-old-boy Florida politicians opposed to any sort of environmental conservation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Data Analysis","review":"It is clear from several reviews that some take strong issue with Tom McGill's data analyses, but none have shown where he erred in using the state's own data to arrive at his conclusions. Since McGill did not edit or change the data in any way, and since he only used basic statistical methods to analyze the data, it is folly to argue that his analyses is biased. It is often the tactic of extreme environmentalists to attack anything that challenges their opinions. I think that is one of the main messages in McGill's book. It's too bad people can't examine the data for themselves rather than denigrating the analyst. I think McGill has captured the essence of what's wrong with the enviromnmental movement, and it's no wonder he is being attacked. I think his book is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time...","review":"This book is incredibly misleading - the author has no authority or scientific data to back up his rediculous claims - esp. his conspiracy thoery that scientists and environmentalists (including Rachel Carson) have been misleading the public for years. I was asked to read this book while working for boaters facing a manatee \\"problem\\", and was so disgusted and annoyed with the poor writing that I could barely finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money....","review":"I picked up this book for 2 dollars at a local flea market. I was disappointed that I didn't purchase a funnel cake instead. The author probably thinks that hurricanes are also a government conspiracy to eliminate boating in Florida.

If you're looking for non-fiction, save your money on something more non-biased."},{"rating":"2","title":"$MC Frightened","review":"The $ave the Manatee Club does not want you to read this book because it shows them up as the frauds they truly are.

Followers of the likes of Dave Foreman and Reed Noss seek to slander the decades of hard work, serious research and honest effort that make this book a must for all schools and libraries. No, \\"Conspiracy of Ignorance\\" doesn't waste the reader's time with the sugar coating of Language Deception, but it does provide the meat and potatoes of facts, unvarnished. I hope that many, many more will read this book for themselves and consider that Captain McGill does not stand to profit from the manatees. He clearly seeks only to share the truth about them -- a truth that no one supporting The Wildlands Project will acknowledge or admit. While the proofreading could have been better, this remains a book with facts to be reckoned with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary what some publishers will print...","review":"People really shouldn't try to use words like \\"data\\" unless they have some understanding of how to use it properly. One of the fears that the State of Florida has in openly making its scientific data available to the general public is that you end up with a lot of so-called \\"experts\\" with no scientific background performing their own \\"analysis\\" and coming to their own wacky \\"conclusions\\". This book represents those worst fears, and definitely plays fast and loose with the truth. I suspect that the author would conclude that the law of gravity was some sort of government conspiracy if it ultimately meant that he would forced to slow his boat down. If you're looking for factual information recreational boating management in Florida, there are a lot better non-biased sources than this. But as one of the other reviewers stated, if you're a Florida good-ol-boy who thinks every form of regulation is some sort of government conspiracy, you'll probably love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not junk science, but definitely a junk book","review":"The author should know \\"ignorance\\" when he sees it, because this book is about as \\"ignorant\\" as it can possibly get. This book basically sidesteps the truth and simply attempts to incite the growing manatee controversy with a series of blathering conspiracy theories, half-truths and outright lies. The true definition of \\"junk science\\" to the author is simply scientific results that do not support his views. The book is mildly entertaining as long as the reader understands that its essentially pure fiction, with little or no basis in fact. And this review comes from someone who is pro-boating, but tired of gross distortions of the truth on both sides of the issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is successful..... in making a bad situation worse","review":"After reading this book, I'm not at all surprised at the range of comments by reviewers. The author isn't the first disgruntled citizen with a printing press who thinks the entire world is one big governmental conspiracy. You'll either love this book or hate it. That's pretty obvious from the reviews. If you attempt to remanufacture scientific data to meet your own preconcieved opinion, you can probably find a link between manatees and Al Qaeda. Readers should decide for themselves, but this book reads less like a journalistic expose and more like the random rantings of an unhappy boater."},{"rating":"2","title":"Data yes, comment so-so","review":"The author truly believes that regulators have ignored important evidence about the manatee and he is right and has the data to prove it. The truth is that manatees become more endangered the farther (further?) from Florida you get.Here in Florida, we know darn well the manatee is not endangered. Moreover, we know that \\"man-made,\\" whether it's canals or channels or power plants, have in fact made the critter flourish. (I'd made a cruel joke about the manatee being a bellwether for global warming -- the warmer it gets, the more there are -- but that would probably p**s off everyone.)That said, Tom misses many opportunities to suggest solutions. It's easy to bitch, but tough to solve. Nonetheless, he's telling the rest of the world what we in Florida have already realized.

Instead, short shrift was given to the real story in favor of the author's decision to make herself the story. I didn't find her even remotely interesting and her self-absorbed view of the world was tedious. So many chapters were wasted on kids playing, who played with whom, what games they played.

Now that he's 3 and knows all his ABC he will laugh at how wrong this puzzle is, and thinks this is \\"silly\\". And if this is left in a certain position in a semi lit room, sometimes it will just yell out an alphabet non-stop. Also, this doesn't have an on/off switch button. So to stop the sound, I have to keep it face down so no light can get to it. Now that we have a younger child, we'll just have to take off the batteries in this puzzle for him to play as a normal wooden puzzle so as to prevent teaching the child wrong association to those alphabets!

It takes less than 5 minutes to take the nozzle apart, take out the old o-rings, put in the new ones, and re-assemble.After replacing the o-rings, both nozzles work like new again. I do wish Bionaire would spend a few cents more on materials, and perhaps use silicon or teflon-encapsulated o-rings that would last longer than a year.

I use them primarily to water the grass. It's nice not to have to squeeze a trigger for a full hour when watering newly seeded grass. That's the main advantage of a fireman's type nozzle. Your hand doesn't get tired. My only beef with this product is that it is difficult to make the spray fan out wide enough to be effective. I learned a little trick of adjusting the zozzle flow from off to high and then I back it back down to medium and the water fans out nicely and throws far enough to be effective. Otherwise, I could not get the water to fan out correctly for watering the grass by going directly from off to medium flow. This little trick made the product quite useful where otherwise it would not have been useful at all for my purposes."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOZZLE SIMPLY DOES NOT HOLD UP!","review":"Amazon was kind enough replace the original nozzle 2 times.

Bought in April 2009 and the housing blew after a short time of use and really no way to get inside and fix it. The allen adjustment doesn't help. Now the water comes out 2 places and it's just a good soaker nozzle now. As it's a water waster maybe they will have a Cash For Clunkers nozzle program someday?Update 12/10/11A lot of people read these so I'll further explain my opinion of the product. I agree, Amazon is great! The problem is with a product like this, Amazon has little recourse on the seller after the warranty expires. This nozzle works fine for the first few months in daily use and might last a year or more in light use. The problem is that the inner o-rings are not compatible with the water in some areas. If the water is questionable in your area (hard with minerals) I'd stick to a simple brass nozzle that's available on Amazon as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as it looks","review":"this hose nozzle did NOT last one year before it started leaking a lot water at the mid-level. my advice: skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bon-Aire Hose Nozzle","review":"I am very disappointed with this nozzle. It is a very nice nozzle but not worth the price. In order for it to work properly I think you would need the water pressure of a fire hydrant.

If you attach this to one of thosesissy 1/2 inch curlycue garden hosesit really does hinder its performance by dramatically reducing the water pressure that the Bon-Aire nozzle will deliver.Well? Do you want to impress your snap dragons? Do you want to see steam coming off your car when you wash her down? Then whip out your big hose and attach it to the Bon-Aire Ultimate Hose Nozzle. You don't even need a rubber washer with this baby...bareback is fine. No leaks without a washer whatsoever. 99.9% effective.So give your hose a Bon-Aire and watch it squirt!

First I tried to water the plants on my patio. The water either splattered too hard or trickled out too slowly. There is not a nice softer spray to effectively water plants. Okay, I thought to myself, \\"Maybe this will work great to hose down the patio.\\" Wrong again. I put the fire hose type nozzle back on so I could get a lot of pressure. Now I am mystified why this nozzle is getting great reviews. My $7 hose sprayer is back on my hose so I can easily water my plants. Maybe the nozzle will last a long time, but it won't make a difference to me. I am no longer using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last very long","review":"I looked for a good quality nozzle, something that would work better and last longer than the home-center junk. I thought I had found it. It worked fine for a couple of months, but then started leaking-badly. I took it apart to find the O-ring that seals the two pieces of the body was cut (simply by the action of adjusting the stream-very poor design). I went to the hardware store and picked up a new O-ring and it is sealing once again. It appears that, based on the design, it will fail again before long. Most people would have tossed it when it started pouring water out, but I gave it a second chance.Bottom line: Don't buy it unless you are prepared to \\"fix it\\" when it starts leaking (pouring) water out and based on the design, that looks like it will be a frequent occurrence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dual Purpose!!","review":"Everyone seems to be overlooking the obvious.

I tried everything to get them off, even so far as to put the hose in a vise so it can't move and then put a huge wrench on and turn the nozzle. All it did was break the nozzle.

Also when you first turn it on, there would be a delay in spray strength, like something would have to click inside before it would spray with more force which lead to you to having to constantly have to adjust it.

It worked great in the display, but when I hooked it up at home, BLAH. The setting we use most, the wide-shower, was hardly a shower at all. The flow was low and the pattern was MUCH to heavy for delicate plants.The distributor GLADLY and quickly sent a replacement, which also aperformed in a like manner, so I checked our pressure. We have 85 lbs. PLUS at the bib, however we use a 100' hose, and an hydraulic hose reel. That device dropped the pressure to about 44 lbs.After replacing the hose with a 50' one, performance increased. Still, the wide spray pattern was nothing like what I saw at the demo. Additionally, to obtain this setting, it takes a bit of fidgeting back-and-forth in order to get it just right.Overall, it's STILL not the ultimate nozzle,... just so-so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted 4 months then leaked like crazy","review":"Purchased four of these great looking nozzles, then within four months of purchase, the first nozzle started leaking and gradually became worse and worse day by day. The one nozzle at a time, all of the remaining three nozzles started the same leaking problems, and within 30-days of the leak start, each nozzle was unusable.Something like this isn't worth the hassle of returning to the seller, and actually feels much better to write a review warning others, enjoyed tossing each nozzle in the trash, and moved on to the Nelson 50503 High-Pressure Rated Fireman's Style Industrial Spray Nozzle with Large On/Off Lever.

In fact, I just ordered three more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok if you like to drench","review":"Bit of a let down here. From all the reviews, I thought maybe my search for the perfect nozzle would come to an end. It didn't. The sequencing of spray patterns on this nozzle is not what you are used to. Sure, it has a unique ability to produce a fine spray and a fire hose kind of effect, but when switching between patterns it passes mostly through various streams of concentrated water that dench anything in its way. If you are trying not to splatter mud, create craters or wash away feshly planted seeds, this is not your nozzle.

I have no pressure reducer on the incoming water, and am using a commercial grade 5/8\\" hose (same one used with both nozzles). This item is obviously of good quality with metal parts and easy to turn control. The spraying modes are fine, just the streaming which is really inadequate. I have changed back to the $7 nozzle for car washing, side of house washing.

It would be nice to have a separate shut-off so you wouldn't have to continually search for your desired spray pattern, especially when washing your car.

I love that it turns off in both directions. It seems very solid and should last a very long time. It doesn't quite spray 40'. I guess it depends on the pressure from your hose bib.

Enter Scot Harvath who is in the city visiting a friend. Before you know it, Harvath assembles a team of ex-war heroes all with there own specialties, and calls for his own Jihad on terror. Think 24 only much more graphic and that's what you get. The pace is relentless and takes you behind the scenes of America's war on terror. There's no question that this book will most appeal to action junkies but it does pose some interesting questions. How far are we willing to go to protect our country? Are we willing to Torture? Sanction Assasinations? The end was completely unexpected and leaves you wanting more. Good thing more is on the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takedown","review":"I found Takedown to be one of the most exciting books I've had the pleasure of reading.

I'll keep coming back for more as long as he keeps putting them out.Jan Grosklaus"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"As a lover of contemporary fiction, I cannot describe the level of frustration I had reading this book. Though much balyhoo'd in its editorial review and it's enthralling inside jacket overview, Thor's depiction of a massive terrorist attack on New York City was shallow to point of amateurish. His descriptive words of choice have less color than the ink they're printed with (\\"The terrorists came in fast, but he shot them dead\\"). His ubiquitous cast of characters all started with the letter \\"H\\" for some dreadful reason, and the character development was nil. Thor also likes to show off his detailed knowledge for tactical weaponry and gear, but nobody outside of the special forces understand (or cares) what gauge bore the gun of a tertiary character is holding- especially when the story is so flat. This was the first book I can remember having to put down before reaching the end, because I just couldn't stand it anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like cars that blow up in mid air for no reason, you're smart enough for this book.","review":"An action/adventure novel for people who like mindless action films. Many of the plot points require the characters to forget all their training and do something profoundly stupid. Acts that might be excused as a momentary lapse on an ordinary day but go against all concepts of self defense, common sense and doing one's duty on a day when NY City receives an attack that makes 9/11 look like a warm-up.Paper thin characters, cliches, and just plain bad writing are found throughout.

Normally I love the action thriller type of book written by authors such as Clive Cussler, Vince Flynn, Tom Clancy and others. But this book is extremely disjointed with a lot of content that contributes nothing to the story. There were a few elements of interest like the troll but most of it is dull featuring a fairly incompetent hero Scott Harvath. I doubt I will read another Brad Thor novel because I don't trust that the book will be well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takedown is a letdown","review":"This has been one of the most disappointing adventures in reading that I can remember.

This novel was set around a horrific attack on New York City. The action ranged from Morocco to D.C.Fans of Thor will find this book to be much like his others: a page turner with non-stop action.

Why do authors feel they must leave the reader hanging... is it to make sure their next book gets read purchased?

Frankly, the lectures are obtrusive and interfere with this reader's enjoyment of the suspense and the plot. Vince Flynn's characters hold similar attitudes, one deduces, but Flynn doea not bludgeon the reader with the party line. Nor does Daniel Silva whose Gabriel Allon is also a swashbuckling hero. Please, Mr. Thor, back off the lectures and put more effort into character development and making sure the transitions are handled competently. Let the exposition make the point, not thinly disguised authorial commentary. When that occurs, I'd very much like to read more thrillers by Brad Thor, but meanwhile, I'll stick with the Ludlum successors, with Flynn, Clancy, Silva, Child, and other more skilled writers of thrillers."},{"rating":"2","title":"another good brad thor novel...","review":"moves along, has a tint of reality and is scary for that....overall, a good read.

More than 1000 pages of small print on very thin paper. Difficult to hold, impossible to travel with, but some great excercise for those in need of arm work.The romantic conquests are nonstop (he seems to specialize in sisters) and it is sometimes difficult to believe this isn't retrospective wishful thinking on the part of an older Mr Casanova.The strength of the book is its wonderful look at 18th Century Italy, and other places, and its descriptions of both the well-appointed and Everyman.

Well, I was disappointed to learn that his great sexual adventures are not that much of adventures for today's people. For example, he fainted when saw a lady's ankle. On the other hand, I really enjoyed seeing the world through the eyes of the 18 c. person: the values and motivations that stood behind his actions.

His contribution to guitar harmonics is monumental. His style and smooth jazz sound are simply beautiful.This recording at the Purple Onion is unfortunately some kind of joke. It seems to me to be more of a stand up comedy routine where bits of light jazz are played in the background of very weak stand up comedy. It actually shouldn't be billed as a jazz album per se, more like a comedy / entertainment cd. There is very little actual music on the cd at all. Serious Breau fans will be very disappointed.The 1 star is not a reflection of Lenny's playing, it's for the schmuck at the microphone who won't stop with the cheezy jokes.

I've even started on making a simple Renaissance costume and it's working out pretty good. This machine works great with light to medium weight fabrics. I picked it because of the removable arm which comes in handy when sewing arm holes and the like. I also picked it for the 60 stitch feature (I've only used about 10.)Now that I'm sewing more advance projects I've found it a little harder (but not impossible) to work with heavier fabrics or many layers because the machine isn't strong enough - this is the only reason why I gave it a 4.Even if I get a better machine I'm keepin' this one.

The stupid singer's voice is almost unbearable, the songs are ballad-ish and too pop like. The only thing that saves this from being a one star album are the songs Tell Me and Wait. Those are actually pretty good songs. But the rest is disgusting. i just don't get how this band got any commercial success in the late 80's world of metal.

Baierlein does not give very helpful explanations, which leads to misunderstandings or even a complete lack of comprehension in the reader. In addition to that, many of the problems are extremely challenging. This was my first upper-level physics course and I also had a visiting professor unused to teaching; it is possible that this book could be successful in a graduate course, or that it could be salvaged by a truly excellent and experienced professor. I, however, would have preferred to use a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anachronic book","review":"I could not agree more with the previous two reviewers.

People cannot hear your messages because the quality of sound is either too low or too muzzled. Many features don't work well as advertised.We needed 4 phones. We returned them and purchased a Voice Logic Voice Pro 412 system. This little system is awesome and, best of all, it works.Whatever you buy, stay away from the 964!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor support & difficult to program","review":"I have had this phone for about 9 months. Programming the phones is very difficult. In order to get help from customer support I had to use a cell phone. Most recently all I got was a recording telling me my call was being transferred - for 17 minutes, but it never was transferred. I used the cell phone because in order to get help with programming the phones, you cannot be using the phones - they do only one thing at a time. I have found that if you are on one line and the other rings, the answering system will not pick up the call. The only time I get messages is if the phone is not being used at all. My intent was that if I was on one line and the other rang, that the answering function would pick it up. I bought 2 phones to ensure this would work but after 9 months it is worse than ever. Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"I bought this to be a stand-alone phone for a home office. Although this phone seemed packed with features, there were a several things that detract. 1) If you're on one line the answering machine will not answer if another call comes in. 2) The answering machine can not be selectively turned on or off for individual lines. 3) Poor sound quality on the recordings as well as VERY low sound volume when picking up messages remotely. 4) My unit had a defective power supply (LOUD hum) and AT&T would not replace it w/o sending in the whole unit. Not good, stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I purchased this phone as a stand-alone that could be expanded as I brought on additional help. It worked fine as a stand alone, but when adding additional phones in the office, I came to realize the same thing that the other reviewer have. The Auto-attendant simply does not work. If the auto-attendant picks up, you're console phone is dead until the caller hangs up and a couple minutes later the phone will ring. When you answer it, it's a \\"call\\" from the phone company saying: \\"If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try your call again.\\"If you're buying this phone for the auto-attendant/answering system feature, DON'T. It doesn't work. If you're not concerned about that, buy the 955 for less money. It's got all the other features and seems to work great. I do have one of those. I should have bought my first two with the 955 and just used the voice mail from the phone company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has one major problem","review":"Bought three of these phones for a small office. All features worked reasonably well with the exception of voice mail. Recorded message quality is poor. The major issue is the same as described by reviewer Laura G related to DTAD & Auto Attendant.

If your system carrier is unable to adjust strength, then do not buy these phones! AT&T advised me to return the phones."},{"rating":"1","title":"These phones do not integrate!!","review":"As a small business, I needed an inexpensive telephone system. Purchased three of these phones to integrate with the 955s. All of the complaints I have read in the other product reviews are my complaints. These phones do not work together as a system.

Bad purchase.....Big, costly mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy","review":"The 964 is a bad phone system -- answering system is faint and unclear; after the TAD picks up a call and the caller hangs up, the phone continues to remain on for more than 3 minutes (Surprised I even bothered to wait that long.)unless handset taken off the hook; programming is lousy; buttons are too small. It is only useful as a single-line phone which is why the 1-star rating aptly applies. Do not buy this phone system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"I second all the complaints here and add another one. Not only can you not selectively turn voicemail on/off for different lines, you also can't have different outgoing messages for each line. So you must be content with one (garbled) outgoing message for all lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"This phone is crap. Mine just died after 2 years","review":"I think this phone was designed by people who either never used a phone, or hate people who do.The circuit board inside the phone began to fail almost immediately near the headset jack. There is a delay from when you pick up the phone to when the first tone is generated. It doesn't play well with other phones - when I get a call and tell someone else in another room to pick it up, the ATT phone apparently generates some sort of tone (probably used for their intercom system by other ATT phones) that keeps people on other phones from using the line. Oh.. and the caller ID stopped working.The overall user interface is poorly designed.All the buttons on the left side of the phone surface just stopped working, so I need to buy another one. Of course, I would never buy another ATT phone - the problem is that aren't that many 3 or 4 line phones with caller ID available. But the next one won't be ATT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Voicemail/answering system poorly designed and often quirky","review":"The answering system gets confused if you try to replay the previous message during playback. And once you listen to all new messages, you have to listen to old messages in reverse. So if I don't catch all message number 2 out of 69, then I have to listen to all 69 messages before I can go back (hitting the \\"Backward\\" button while it's playing just confuses it). But say I save 20 of those messages (don't delete them). I have to go backwards through those 20 messages just to listen to message number 2 again. Maybe my phone has a manufacturing defect or maybe it's just bad design, but either way I'm getting rid of it. Unforunately there aren't too many options for business phones with the same features. Gheeze, doesn't anyone sell a decent desk phone with a headset jack and a answering machine for around $100?

We purchased 2 each 944 and 2 eacch 964. This was for a small office (2 people) The 944 phones worked together but the 964 phones did not. The manual was the worst to date I have read on a phone system and gave no detail. After countless hours with support staff on phone (email support was a joke they copied sections from manual and sent them to me even though I had described following every step of the manual to them in detail) it was determined that while they advertised it would work with any anaolg line system it would not work ours because our system had been upgraded by BellSouth.

The system never worked as promised and phone manufacture gave up trying to solve problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible System","review":"I have a small business and purchased three of these phones, and all are absolutely a piece of junk.

Featurewise it is ideal for this purpose. However, I have lost power in the building a few times this year and the internal battery backup has never retained the program settings - which are extensive and confusing.

The laughs, the sorrow, the warmth and realness of relationships will keep you enthralled throughout the story. Your heart will ache with Billy as he comes to realize that his immediate world around him is changing, and things will forever be different, hopefully, for the better. It shows how love transcends and blurs the lines separating black and white. This a great human interest story that will appeal to anyone.

Full of funny scenes and conversations, poignant descriptions of people and places, and touching portraits of the friends who filled his childhood, it is a true, complete, fulfilling tale of growth, with all its joys and pains. The book conveys with honesty and sensitivity the confusing emotional and intellectual chasm of growing up between the races in the southern United States in the mid-twentieth century. Sadly, the black and white worlds Mr. Hunt describes can't blend any more than allowed by the vision of a child's affectionate and colorblind eyes. Nonethteless, Mr. Hunt manages to capture a very real and tangible love between people; he is a solid storyteller and a talented dialogist who has given us a sweet, memorable tale.

The book provides a thorough grounding in subject-verb agreement, phrase structure and rules concerning phrase structure, tense and aspect, modal auxiliaries, negation, yes/no questions, imperatives, WH-questions, articles, reference and possession, passive voice, and many more.Personally, I think this work would benefit instructors more than students, though advanced English students might find this a useful tool.

It's a thorough, hard-cover reference book that can be used for years, or, at least until the major rules of English change.If you are new to English grammar, do not buy this book. It's too technical for students trying/continuing to try to learn grammar.

Common grammar terms were not used, nor was the extensive terminology adequately explained. There was no glossary and the in-text definitions were incomplete. The index was inadequate. I have taught grammar for 20+ years, and have had classes in 5 different languages. I would *never* inflict so much useless information on my own students because it would confuse them.

With the story well backed up with a mythology explanation and the dead-on characterizations, this book is almost like reading an episode of the show. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"One word can explain this book......","review":"I LOVE this book! It was one of the best buffy books I've read! If you haven't read it yet may I suggest you stop reading this review and go get it! The story line was awsome! The climax was awsome! Overall it deserves an award! So that's why I gave it 5 stars! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An impressive addition to the Buffy Series","review":"I loved this book! The story lines where exciting! Veronique is an anchient vampire that cannot die, but be passed on from body to body, and when she comes to Sunnydale the scooby gang finds her to be more than one slayer can handle. But that's not Buffy's main concern. Joyce Summers, her mother is very sick and it could be life threating. I find this book to be a very good read, Holder and Golden once again provide a exciting storyline with convinceing charecterization. I'm sad to see they won't be doing any more colloborations after this. But I look forward to their individual books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hip hip hooray for this one","review":"Yes, Immortal was long, and yes, it dragged at points, and yes, it was one of the best Buffy books. With the Buffy/Joyce/cancer saga, we somewhat got to see the pain Buffy goes through while trying to deal with her Slayer duties and her daughter and friend duties at the same times. Veronique was a strong character whom everyone hated, despised, but also wanted to see a good fight from. The beginning of the book was long and droning, and stayed that way for about two thirds of the book, but the last third was filled with suspense, action, horror and such wonderful Buffy realness that I couldn't set it down. It may seem too long at first, but stick with it, because it's a highly rewarding book in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buffy To The Rescue","review":"What can you say about Buffy The Vampire Slayer that hasn't already been said? IMMORTAL is a typical Buffy story, with the typical cast of characters and the typical formula plot. Fun, but Shakespere is in no danger of being replaced. The biggest letdown of the audio version was, sadly, Charisma Carpenter, or Cordelia to her fans. The lady is an adequate actor, but her reading skills need a LOT of work! This could have been a more enjoyable program with a better narrator. Sorry, Cordy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but some problems","review":"Golden and Holder show once again that they have a great grasp of the Buffy characters and how they relate to one another. The bad vamps in this story are little to drawn out and vague, and plus Holder and Golden trademark flashback chapters tend to get in the way of the flow of the book. But they do keep it fun and it stays in the spirit of the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring but good new characters","review":"This book was suppose to be all dramatic abut it justcame on as boring and pointless.

My mother had the same lung surgey about 7 or 8 years ago, so I knew what Buffy was feeling, and my heart really went out to her! The chapter with Veronique back in time are really good, as are the ones with Angel. One chapter that is really cool, though, is the one where Willow channels Lucy Hanover. If you want to know why read the book. If you don't know who Lucy Hanover is you should learn more about the show, or you may be confused!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!","review":"This book was wonderful, it was just like watching a episode of Buffy, only better!

Her debut was good, and her sophmore release showed maturation in musicianship and lyrics. However, her third album has taken about 5 steps back and shown that she apparently has some wild oats to sew. This is one of the worst albums of 2007, or maybe one of the 10 worst ever by a major musician. I was very, very dissapointed, as I am sure many fans are. You may like the album if you are 12, but half of it will be censored due to Avril's new proliferation of profanity. What happened? I sure hope none of this has rubbed off on Derek Wembley from Sum 41, if so, we are all in a world of hurt. Avril is still talented, it has just been buried on this album. Hopefully she can get back up after a knockdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH MY GOD!!!","review":"Am I listening to the same Avril Lavigne that 5 years ago made fun of Britney Spears?!

I could not find it specified anywhere on the page & that's when I saw the deluxe CD/DVD combo. I checked it out and sure enough the only way you can get the unedited version here is to get both the CD & DVD !! I personally think that sucks!

But I have only one word to say about it - why?!There are a few decent songs - \\"When You're Gone\\" and \\"Innocence\\". The rest of the tracks are just BAD. Avril is still singing songs that a 16 year old would sing. That was okay when that was her age group; but she really needs to grow up now.Avril comes across as a snotty brat with a too-high opinion of herself on this album.My advice - skip it and buy \\"Let Go\\" or \\"Under My Skin\\". While these aren't top-notch albums, they're still good, and WAY better than this \\"effort\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, TRASH","review":"I am very disappointed with the content of Avril's newest CD. I attended a concert of hers summer 05, and MORE THAN HALF OF THAT AUDIENCE WAS CHILDREN WITH THEIR PARENTS! I cannot believe she has stooped so low with the language used in just about every song! What's up with that. She is no longer any kind of a role model to the younger crowd. It's no wonder kids have such profane language these days. Kids who will be singing to her new songs will be getting more comfortable with the F word, as it is in at least 3 of her new songs. I cannot believe that her mother and father are \\"proud of her,\\" nor her family's \\"Christian\\" family! Shame on you, Avril!

To get the unedited version of the CD, you have to up the extra money for the deluxe package with a worthless DVD on the making of this album. This marketing ploy is unfair to all Avril Lavigne fans. I was extremely upset to have to pay the extra five dollars today to get the version of the album I wanted. If Avril had anything to do with this, piss on her!

It turns out I really like it. I thought this cd would be so bad but it turned out to be one of my favorites. I will admit that it's not the best damn thing from Avril but it comes pretty close. I only think that Avril picked the wrong song as her first single from the album. To me Girlfriend was the worst song on the cd. Avril Lavigne definately did not lose me as a BIG fan! This album is definately worth buying!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little to different","review":"I have her 2 previous albums and I attended her concert a couple years ago. I love her music, so I rushed to the store to get this CD the day it came out. I was not impressed at all with it. It sounds like she is only singing songs that her record company wants her to sing. Her songs were kind of pop-ish before, but this stuff sounds like Britney material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Step backwards","review":"Two steps forward (her first two cds), one step back (her latest cd). I was really looking forward to a 3rd cd by Avril, but I was bummed when I put this disk in my car stereo! This sounds like it should be her first debut cd as it is defintely taking a step backwards. Is she is trying to be more punk? Maybe, but it does not work. It is soooooo immature! We all know she is capable of much better. Her first two cds are still some of my favorite songs. Avril, if you are listening, we are looking forward to number four. Number 3 is a miss. You are still a hottie though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Cheesy","review":"Somehow her music just gets worse.

Avril was nothing but throw away pop on her first record, but her second record was like an entire other person and it was very good. This, This, This??This is terrible. Not just a let down, but a bad, bad record. The lyrics are strung-together cliches that required no effort, the music sounds programed and the style is pure, unadulterated, pop garbage. She stepped right in to fill the void left by Britany Spears, that's what she did. Also, it appears she is suffering from Fergie worship.Please, please, someone get her some Tori Amos, Alanis, Sarah McLachlan! Anything to stop her from recording this bland, boring tripe! Why waste the talent shown on the second record, why waste my time and money on this disk. I won't, I downloaded, I deleted. Bad, bad record by any standards.My teeth where rotting from listening to it, it's that sugary."},{"rating":"1","title":"An album with potential; lost within each chorus","review":"There's no doubt that Avril Lavigne has talent and she's very popular right now and pretty much always has been.However, this cd is very mediocre. The bridge has a lot of potential, but then the chorus kicks in and it just sounds so out of place with the rest of the song. She sounds like she just screams for the sake of it sometimes, and the lyrics are childish like they've been written by a little girl, not a fully grown adult.She seems very boy-crazed on this cd. Is it to do with her engagement to the lead singer of Sum 41? Maybe? Who knows.Avril says that this is her best record yet, but I think that it's her worst: Superficial and bland.Good for hardcore Avril fans, but even they might be bored. Tread carefully..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happen to Avril??","review":"This album is nothing like her previous ones. It's not even \\"Punk\\". The song writing is very poor. It's like she lost something. She changed her image, dyed her hair blond, got a nose job and dress like the people she talked and dogged about. I used to have more respect for her, but now she's says one thing and do another and promise not to be the so called \\"SellOuts\\". She's a sell out like Christina, and the rest of the bimbo young women out there. Nothing to offer except selling sex. She's cute but nothing else. She need to focus on her music and be less vain like this bimbos out there. The young women in the music industry are all becoming sell-outs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the H*** were YOU thinking ??","review":"Yes indeed Ladies and Gentlemen this has been another exciting episode of BRAT ROCK.

I guess marriage softened her but this new bubble gum image and that blonde hair has got to go. She has so much talent and she's just throwing it away. It's so disappointing with lyrics like, \\"hey, hey, hey you I don't like your girlfriend, I think you need a new one...\\" Hopefully my little Candianan will knock it out of the park on her next album.

I even ripped the audio from the DVD to a CD so that I could listen to it in the car. This CD is beyond disappointing. It is SO bee-bop and sugar-pop that it really is sickening. She will likely win a few Britany Spears fans but it's such a shame that she's gone and flushed herself down the pop toilet. She had a unique sound with a depth and maturity that surpassed her age - I was really looking forward to more of her talent. It's like she heard \\"Oh Mickey You're So Fine\\" from the 80's and decided to write an entire album based on that one song.

She is so far removed from even remotely sounding punk and even farther from having any of the DIY, rebellious, and anti-authority ethics that bands like the Dead Kennedys, Minor Threat, Discharge or Black Flag helped established for the underground punk scene of today. Just because she's packaged by some major label to \\"look\\" rebellious by wearing a skull and crossbones or anarchy shirt (what would an anarachist even be doing on a major record label making music for MTV??) and carrying a skateboard does not make her anything.

My question is, how has she not been sued for copyright infringement. The claps, the cheerleader-esque chanting, the chord progression. I know that everyone has influences, but this is taking it to a new level. I hate when people steal music from some other artist (who may or may not be brilliant, it doesn't even matter). Musicians who do things like this ruin the credibility of other GOOD musicians. I mean this is in the same league with Vanilla Ice's sampling. Looks like Avril ordered a sampler platter and just kept going until she had an entire song....that someone else wrote 20 some odd years ago. It doesn't stop there. Avril's five note repitoire and amateurish lyrics did enough to make me want to crawl into a deep deep hole for a number of years. At least until this pitchy Canadian two-faced theif is out of the business."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE AVRIL LAVIGNE!!!","review":"I got this CD when I got my gift certificate from the Sciencepalooza aaward I won.

It is the very censored version. My first clue should have been the lack of the Parental Advisory label on the front of the CD. The UPC code matches what Amazon lists online for the EXPLICIT version. I purposely ordered the EXPLICIT version because the MP3 version is not available for download on Rhapsody or Yahoo Music.

But I heard 'Girlfriend' and I knew that something had gone terribly wrong. I loved 'Let Go' and 'Under My Skin.' It's hard to believe that these are all by the same artist. Complete trash. I hope she'll go back to her old 'style' in the next album. Her career will be a dead end if she continues to release 'music' like this. I don't know why most artists completely change their music by the third album. If you're having so much success with your style as it is, why would you change it? I want my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bubblegum junk","review":"My god, this album is terrible, it sounds like music for a kids Saturday morning TV show.

Avirl just fell into this category. What this ruffly translates to is that the second album was not the same success as the first, so she wanted to get back to what she did right the first time. The trouble is, she is a much more talented artist that this album, and we know it. While some will welcome the return to the bratty girl sound of Let Go, I'm disapointed. She showed on her second album some really good material and the change to really shine among the ton of girl bots out there. But instead she chickened out when the sales weren't quite up to par on her second album, and went \\"back to basics.\\" While I like some songs on the album, overall it feels like a step back"},{"rating":"1","title":"Her lyrics are so annoying","review":"All of her songs sound the same.lyrically They all seem to be either about other chics(if she wasn't married i'd swear she was a lesbian),or about herself.She is so damn full of herself it's pathetc!

I was hoping her next album was just as original as the first. Unfortunately, there's nothing that sticks out in this album. Every song sounds like the other. I really do like \\"Keep Holding On\\", but it's the only song I like at all. It's almost like she just wrote whatever songs she could fast enough to produce another album and please her fans. She's lost her edge."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked her...but...","review":"I have the other two albums and I enjoyed them thoroughly. I was looking forward to this album and when I got it, I listened through it. Honestly, I think I found two songs I liked. The rest weren't that catchy or were lacking something. I found I didn't like the lyrics or the music and it didn't seem worth listening to. I give this album two stars though because I know she can do better and I like \\"Keep Holding On\\". Come on, Avril, try harder next time..."},{"rating":"2","title":"31 Years Old and Loving It!!!","review":"I love Avril. I love that she writes and produces all her own songs, started off songwriting and released her 1st album at such an early age. \\"The Best Damn Thing\\" Is just as good as the 1st album \\"Let GO\\" but perhaps better. She has grown, she enjoyed the success of \\"Let GO\\" and then released \\"Under My Skin\\" This album was terrific, but didn't sell as good, people thought, she was trying to be somone out of her skin when in reality this is who she is. And it suits her just fine. So she went back to writing and singing songs like when she 1st hit the scene. You have to appreciate Avril, she has some serious balads. \\"Keep Holding On\\" is just as Beautiful as the song she wrote that Kelly Clarkson sang \\"BreakAway\\"...Go ahead and get this album and sit down pull out the lyrics and read along to her new songs, and you will crack up and bang your head to her catchy tunes.I did...She might be married, but she is live and vivacious!

Bringing this possibility to a level of understanding is a huge challenge, and Mr. Swords does this through his main character, John Cassidy. John is faced with a moral dilemma that becomes a monumental risk to himself and his family. 'Shadows on the Soul' tackles the question, 'Are we a product of our society, or are the rules and actions of our society influenced by what we all harbor inside, be it goodness, evil or both?'

They include for instance a vintage photograph of famous architects actually costumed as their own creations: the Fuller Building, the Waldorf-Astoria, the Squibb Building, the Chrysler Building, etc.Written over 30 years ago and thus also a reflection of the 1970's, this work is definitely a classic well worth reading today for anyone interested in New York or in cities in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Too Much To Think About Sometimes....","review":"A very inventive concept of New York's \\"culture of congestion\\" and how people are affected by the architecture they create. It is heavily researched and exhaustive, and after pretty much the third page I agreed with his concept of NY being \\"totally fabricated by man\\". What could of been a fascinating article becomes a spastic, heavy-handed read with a sledgehammer effect to your brain. (However,for those of us reading it for school, there are plenty of pictures that fill up the almost devastatingly vast 300+pages quickly.) It will scramble your brain with its thousands of nearly bumper-stickerish statements (\\"It hides life.\\" \\"The Mountain MUST become architecture.\\") written with pretentious glee. However, I believe an independent scientific study has concluded that when pretending to read this book on the train people around you will assume your IQ is 40% higher than truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delirous New York","review":"I sent this to a friend in the Netherlands and have not heard from her so a review is out of the question."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great starting point.","review":"An easily digestible read filled with delicious facts about the big apple. This book can change the way one sees New York forever. Be it from a street level, or from an intellectual level. \\"Delirious New York\\" helps to rediscover Manhattan, and it helps to discover the idea of Manhattan in places far away from \\"The City\\".This publication is a perfect starting point for any exploration into the past or the future of urbanism, architecture, and of course New York City and the people who helped to shape this ever growing marvel.A must read, and a perfect gift for anyone who is even remotely touched by New York."},{"rating":"2","title":"the culture of congestion","review":"This is by far Koolhaas's most accessible work, as it is rooted so clearly in detail from the city's past. Further, the book is simply brilliant. His take on urban history is to Jane Jacobs what Socrates is to common sense. New York is a special case of modernism that sprang from a special constellation of poltiical and technological forces that collectively create a cultural \\"big-bang\\" at the turn of the century. Read it. Blow your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll never look at NY the same way","review":"Here's an undergraduate architecture student's perspective: I really enjoyed this book! It's not difficult to get into but be prepared to venture into some pretty fantastical theories about New York. I couldn't help but think that some of the explanations and narrative were a bit forced to fit into some very memorable lines and titles. Just go with it though and you'll be glad you did; it's a captivating interpretation of New York that is certainly at least as valuable as whatever you'll find in a history book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok bag","review":"Its cheap and useful.

As with most knitting book the ideas may only be revolutionary to those newly inducted in to the craft. However the idea is to consolidate the theme of \\"oddball knitting\\" into one volume. It is not as much patterns as tactical approaches.Personaly I found this book more useful for projects using expensive materials such as Qiviut (which comes from the Artic musk ox,) is a tad expensive for sweater projects. On page 96there is an ideal scarf pattern for this material.In the back of the book you will find a project index and a yarn index."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I was hoping to see some new and creative ways to use leftover yarn.

There were a couple of nice patterns, but overall there wasn't much new or inspiring. There are plenty of scarf and shawl patterns available on the internet, and the ones in the book aren't too intriguing. This is definitely just a book to browse at the library or bookstore for ideas, but not a necessary addition to a collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small stash-busting for patterns, big on advice","review":"I excitedly awaited this book's arrival--which I got through a swap with another knitter. Most of the patterns I won't probably knit, however the advice/information in this book is really worth the trade. It tells how to measure how much yarn you may have left on a skein/hank for a project. Also how to tell the weights when you have lost the ball band. I would like the poncho on the cover better without the ruffles and may just have to make it that way. However, for a beginner this is not an easy book. It is a good book for those of us who have knitted many projects for awhile and have a good many hanks/skeins of leftover yarn we want to put to use. However, it doesn't give a whole lot of new ideas, as we already know to use our leftovers for striping. I like the rug pattern and may make that too. I already have alot of hat patterns so that was not too impressive for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"More about the \\"how\\" rather than the \\"what\\"","review":"If you are looking for a treasury of patterns for your oddiments of yarn, this may not be the book for you. However, this reasonably priced volume has the \\"how\\" of oddball knitting, including calculating how much yarn you have, weights, lengths to finish a row, how to combine colors and most importantly, how to safely store your stash of yarn. The patterns include a stunning shawl, scarves, hats, purses, socks and an Amish-inspired afghan.There are 31 patterns in all, but the main use of this book is to know HOW to combine yarns to make something out of nearly nothing. If you are bothered by those golf-ball sized bits of sock yarn after making a pair of socks, or want to use a single ball of novelty yarn that was so tempting you bought just ONE, this is for you. But this book demands you use YOUR creativity, so don't look for designs here, just seeds for design ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book--but don't buy it for the patterns!","review":"I got this book out from the library and liked it so much I'm buying it--even though I've sworn off buying knitting books.

As well as hints for preventing and dealing with moth infestations, storing yarn, and fantastic technical details about figuring out how much yarn you need for a project. It has some nifty patterns, but you can find all sorts of stuff on-line for free. The real value of this book is helping get your creative juices flowing. Note that, since it's for people with lots of leftover yarn, it's written for *experienced* knitters, not beginners! It's published in paperback, which helps keep the cost down. If you've got more than one giant box of leftover or neglected yarn, this book is for you (as well as anything by Kaffe Fassett)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time!","review":"I'm SO glad I got this book from the library instead of buying it.

If I had read the reviews first I would have missed out on a great deal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD as gift","review":"Player is not recommended. It does not play the new DVD's well at all. DVD player cleanly for 40-45 min. then will start to freeze picture and sound or just picture while sound continues. The movie will play like this until the end or it may just kick you out of your movie. Older DVD's play just fine. But, I like the newer DVD's with my surround sound. I'm kicking this one to the curb. You get what you pay for!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't buy it again","review":"In my experience, it's a okay player for the price (purchased a year and a half ago). No complaints about the design of the remote, and the player has has some cool features (like zoom). My biggest gripe is really just a nuisance: it takes forever to load. Occasionally, however, it will freeze completely, and none of the controls on the machine or the remote will work, including power, eject, etc. I have to unplug it and then plug it in again. That's why I've given it two stars instead of three. If I were to go back in time, I wouldn't buy it again. I spend a little more and get something better. On the other hand, if you don't mind a long wait for your DVD to load or having to unplug it to reset it sometimes--it's never happened to me *during* a movie--it might be [economical]enough to consider if price is the most important factor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying.","review":"I purchased this player about 3 months ago. It's been nothing buttrouble since. Movies freeze and then the player boots you out ofthe movie. Discs get stuck in the player and every command from the remote takes time to complete it's intended function. At first player worked good but progressively got worse to the pointthat any dvd is useless. Also the player wont play disney discs with out inputing certin commands. I would have thought better of a product from philips. This player is a real disappointment. My advice, dont purchase this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK, JUNK, JUNK, JUNK!!!","review":"I have purchased many Phillips/Magnavox products in the past and been pretty happy with everything until I purchased this DVD player. One word - JUNK.The problems:1. When I turn off the DVD player, 1/2 of the backlight continues to emit light.2. Half of the time when I put a DVD in, the player just sits there spinning the DVD and not playing it.3. Sometimes the DVD player will not open to allow me to remove the DVD!!! Even turning the player on & off doesn't solve the problem. I've had to use a flat head screwdriver to PRY the tray open!!I returned the 1st one due to these problems. The second one worked fine for a few months, but now is doing the same thing!I use the DVD player maybe once a week. I plan to trash this thing. No more Phillips for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS MACHINE","review":"I purchased the Philips Model 621 and it would not even recognize the DVD when I inserted it. The message \\"Please insert a playable disk\\" kept appearing. I took the machine back and bought another one, same model. On our first movie, WHITE CHRISTMAS, it worked fine for about 1 to 1 and 1/2 hours. Then it froze. After a few minutes the same message, \\"Please insert a playable disk\\" appeared again. I don't intend to buy another Philips.

It has trouble reading some discs now and when it does takes a long time. Okay, so it's a Philips and it is complete garbage. With what's out there now that's cheaper and better, I give this one 2 stars.I have found this to be an good player for DVD's but not much else. A few things on some of these reviews are just not true for this player, and I have tested these formats and been successful:-Video CD (VCD): ONLY ON CD-RW'S- It does play, even has a light up icon that says \\"VCD\\", just doesn't play very well- will fail to load sometimes and may skip-DVD-R's: The ones I've tested work perfect every time, don't know about DVD-RW's yetSo, this is not the greatest of players ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless you have money to burn...","review":"Unless you have money to burn, I would highly suggest *AGAINST* purchasing this DVD Player. The other day I finally gave it to charity. It stopped working a little over a year after purchase. I started getting \\"NO DISC\\" message as if the laser had stopped reading the DISC. I always expected more from Philips. I only used this DVD player about 25 times, and never moved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets worse over time","review":"This player has been unbelivably frustrating. When I first bought it, it played 100% of the DVD's. Within 2 months it would only play 80% of the DVD's I put in it... and now 6 months later it only plays about 10% of the DVD's I put in it. Doesn't matter if it's a new DVD or old... it either won't load, won't eject, won't play, or keeps looping infinitly, or stutters stop/start/stop/start constantly.A total waste of my money... I won't be buying from Philips again"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, well designed Kitchen Cart","review":"All solid wood (except 3 panels which were quality press-board) this is the nicest 'small' rolling butcher block cart I've seen. 'Classy' for being simple and efficient - made in Thailand. All pieces fit together tight, clear instructions, and it was easy to assemble. One note: be sure the drawer roller is located on the back of the drawer when piecing together... I missed that detail and had to take apart sides and reverse - easy enough. Extra screw was added for each assembly need (nice!) Highly recommend. Be sure to shop around for lowest priced 'external website' supplier (as I noticed one for almost half of the advertised price after I ordered from the Amazon recommended vendor - fortunately, the vendor is honoring a 'match-price' offer), and check the shipping charge - as this piece - being mostly solid wood - is a heavy 66 lbs! -s"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality for the price","review":"I bought this cart once and when it arrived, it was damaged.

Although it's not as weak as those 2, it is still a huge step down from Mostasteless. I was hoping it would grow on me, but it hasn't. Twiztid have all but abandoned the more traditional hip-hop sound and are trying to be ICP Jr. It's too bad, because they really are talented MCs. But the vast majority of the songs on this album are sub-standard rap metal drivel. The Doors cover is particularly painful. The song with 3 Six Mafia is pretty good, and Maniac Killa has it's moments (Blaze's verse is pretty dope). But on the whole, this album is hugely disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Legendary","review":"This cd is just great!

If you're not into the original series from 1930-1979 (56 books in all), there have been many updates and additional series spawned from this character. You may think old when you see these books, but the stories are great, there's always a little edge of danger, cliffhangers on each chapter and it shows young ladies a strong, independent character with drive and smarts.

This armoire was the perfect solution. It was also the exact color of our existing living room furniture. I really like it because of its simple contemporary design. Alot of the Sauder-type entertainment centers are odd colors or too country/traditional looking for my taste.My only complaint is that once we put it together, one of the side panels started to come apart from its frame. We used wood glue on it and it's been fine ever since. I also wish that instead of the CD slots it had a drawer for DVDs or more shelves. We don't really use the CD slots, but we put them in anyway.

Readers can truly enjoy this book if they read related stories like THE SUMMER OF THE FALCON, THE CRY OF THE CROW, and THERE'S AN OWL IN THE SHOWER.

Also, the stickers denoting the pieces stuck to the cart to well, there are stickers that use modern adhesive technology and do NOT require 20 minutes of elbow grease to remove.Lastly the gap between the drawers of the lower cabinet is twice the size of what the picture shows and the top drawer does not close in a flush manner (i.e. no gap at the top of the drawer and a 3mm gap at the bottom).All in all I feel like I should have billed someone for my time.This cart turned into a huge pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb for it's price","review":"I recently bought this dvd player and I have to say it's incredible. It has the essentials of a good dvd player, but not all the capabalities of reading CD-R's and so-forth. It has great sound options. So, even if you don't have surround sound, it sounds acceptional. The only problem that I've seen is that when you mark your spot in the movie, it only stays there saved as long as you don't eject the dvd or turn the dvd player off.

Sometimes it wouldn't even load the disk, or play past the welcome screen. I returned the first one because the player skipped so much it made movies unviewable.

It also bodes well for her that the title track, pretty big right now, isn't even the best song on the album by a longshot. It's also encouraging that she had a hand in co-writing several tracks. She also manages to sample David Bowie, of all people, and to great effect on the slinky 'Body II Body'. Other standouts here include a beautiful cover of Divine's 1998 hit 'Lately', 'Always Come Back To Your Love','The Boy', and \\"Til Night Becomes Day'. With any justice, this cd won't get lost in the shuffle and justifiably sustain a long chart life."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Give Her Effort...but...","review":"No, no, no, no! I mean, I give her credit for trying to pursue her dream, but why pursue it if you sing like a retarded cow and look like one too? She looks like one of those starving children on those commercials with a good hairdo. Besides that, her vocals are weak and blank sounding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great First Album, Can't wait for the Follow up!!!!!","review":"She has a beautiful voice that can handle any style of music. She is a talented singer as well as song writer.Her voice is very crisp and clear with an enormous range.I've followed her since her early debut on CMT.All though I enjoyed the whole CD. I was disappointed That Angel Eyes was on there twice.I wished there been a few more songs on it also.I loved Circle of Love and If Only. Circle of Life has a catchy tune that I can't seem to get out of my head.Didn't We Love from Coyote Ugly along with Cry like Memphis are probably my next favorites.The CD is a great mix of Country and Soft Rock. I truly believe there isn't a bad song on the whole CD.

I can find any word I need and it contains many example phrases. However, it has a very poor binding. My 5 star review is solely for the content. I'd give it a 1 for durability since the pages will begin to separate from the binding. If you use it everyday, plan to buy another copy within a year or two.

There are over 50,000 entries in this small book alone!If, your interested in the German language then I would highly recommned you do as I did.

Clearly intended to impart to the reader various spiritual concepts involving this present life and what lies beyond it, the teaching element doesn't come across as heavy-handed or artificial but is woven neatly into the story itself. Enjoyable, inspiring, and highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!!!","review":"My favorite pieces played by a wonderful player...and she's really hot too!

Third, it's supposed to be easier to blend but it certainly is not, and I found that it tends to look far more streaky than the regular old sunless tanner. Don't use this product unless you want to look goofy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this book","review":"This book goes to my bio as one of the worst I have ever read. Bad history, bad caracters and especialy bad scenes. Like the one in which a barmaid figths and defeats plate armored dwarven warriors with a dagger! Her description of how magic works in a ADD world and of events in the Dragolance Saga reveals that the author had only passing knowledge of both at time.

I had good expectations for the book.I was disapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the finest DL books","review":"Berberick puts on a fine storytelling display with this book.

Frequency is an interesting music-based game allowing you to blast through techno remix songs from many different popular artists. The visuals in this game are pretty trippy, offering an entertaining experience while you blast through levels of music. It's nice to know that people are still coming up with innovative new gameplay styles. (The gameplay itself feels quite different from, say, Umjammer Lammy.) The only thing I really found negative about this game was the lack of sophisticated remixing of the songs after you 'own' them. That's perhaps something that can't be overcome in a game designed for a console, but it's definitely something I would look for in the future -- can't wait to see Frequency 2!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mom flunked","review":"I bought this for my 12 and 15 yr olds based on the positive reviews.

I know that other reviewers have posted that this version is missing many scenes, but it really didn't seem to matter. The story is wonderful and so action-packed that I couldn't put the book down. If you've seen the movie, you don't know the whole story. There is so much more to it and a movie just can't encapsulate the essence of these characters.

The letters she wrote contain practicle advice for anyone in any era. In the \\"Dialogue\\", Catherine asked questions of God and His answers and are truly profound! St. Catherine was uneducated so her words are simple and easy to understand. It is as if God is sitting down at the kitchen table and answering universal questions about why we were created and why we suffer so much. The \\"Dialogue\\" makes sense of so many seemingly unaswerable questions, that it can help anyone of any religion in their spiritual understanding of creation. I was so deeply affected by this book, that I had to read the \\"Dialogue\\" in it's entirety. A must for all spiritual seekers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MP3 capability is good, DVD quality suffers","review":"THough I may have a defective unit (I am about to send it back to Philips) this unit drops about 30 seconds of audio after any PAUSE, FWD, REV, or layer change.

What I found on the album was simply wonderful. Quirky and clever lyrics, catchy music, and amazing talent. I fell in love. For weeks they were all I listened to (I drove my roomate nuts... though she loves them too now ^^) And even now I turn them on whenever I feel the need to be put in a better mood.

However, I found that it is nicely made and a good gift for any Narnia fan. Maybe the other one was a fluke or something. I certainly wouldn't ever just tear the strap off, and I was careful when I removed the watch from the pouch to look at the back. The chances of it catching on something and coming off or coming apart are too great-- it sticks out from my wrist quite a bit more than an average watch. It's delicate, and I can see it coming apart with daily wear, especially if you don't remain aware that you have a collectible on your wrist. The case is just as lovely as the watch, and looks really good displayed next to my miniature wardrobe replica.

It also has great resources (like websites and children's books) in the back of the book for the different dialects. (Such as Kalderash and Lovari)However if you have an advanced grasp of the language, while this book would be a very good brush up, it's not as in depth as you might need it to be. This book makes verb conjugations very easy to remember, and also teaches you the language with some popular romani folk tales and songs.

Firstly, he describes the complicated process of teaching the visual cortex to see even though the eye may be clear. Secondly, he offers hope to blind and low vision patients. They are alerted to the fact that there are always new developments and procedures and should therefore always check with their ophthalmologist to see if their condition can be improved. Thirdly, it is a story of optimism and courage.Little mistakes, such as calling the conjunctiva the white of the eye, when the white is actually the sclera, don't impact the storyline.Dede Silverston"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crashing into obstacles","review":"The disturbing image of the youthful Michael May running blind and crashing into schoolyard goalposts remained with me throughout my reading of this book. I was disappointed by the presentation and was not all that enamoured of the protagonist himself. Make no mistake, his sporting achievements were impressive. However, his incessant bragging about his attractive wife could only make me smirk at the irony of a blind man obsessed with female pulchritude. Using his new eyesight to leer at the girls walking past a local coffeeshop was just plain juvenile! Yes it's true he never got a chance to do this during his immature teenager years, but still. The book was dull and boring when I had expected so much more; the writing was pedestrian and cliched. This could have been so much better. The most meaningful part of the biography was May's struggle to achieve Olympic records in downhill skiing. He seems to have dared so much more before he \\"dared to see\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Novel or screenplay?","review":"The writing is so excruciatingly deliberate and painful I read it as fast as possible to get it over with.

His first book, Shadow Divers, is a must read for all men. 'Crashing Through' is very well written and educates the reader about sight, seeing, and all that goes into that complicated process as well as describes the heroic life of one who moves from blindness to sightedness.

The story is about Mike May, a blind man from a very young age, and his decision to have a surgery that allows him to see again. Mike's whole life is portrayed, and while it is interesting, it is not altogether fascinating. What is really compelling is what will happen to Mike after he has the surgery. Unfortunately, it is precisely at this moment that the book lost its appeal for me. The author quickly turns to describing the minutiae of May's daily life and what it's like to see ordinary things for the first time. After reading page after page of this, I finally gave up and stopped reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"FASCINATING AND COMPELLING","review":"This book works on so many levels. Not only is it a story about a man's restored vision (and the science behind it), it's also a story of a family's love, and what it means to trust in yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"I read Crashing Through in two sittings, I could not put it down. Not only is it an adventure story, human interest story, love story, and humorous book but it taught me a lot about the process of seeing. I loved it and have recommended it to all my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oliver Sacks he's not.","review":"At least in the 6-hour audio version, Kurson hampers an otherwise fascinating story with awful prose; his apparent goal is to see how many cliches he can jam into a single sentence. Unnecessary and obviously concocted \\"quotes\\" like \\"Oh please, please, please, God, let him live!\\" became so irritating I started to pay attention to them instead of to the book's subject, and finally gave up. Kurson's treatment is as superficial, melodramatic and predictable as a Lifetime drama, which is not only unfortunate for his audience, but unfair to his subject. Equally irritating is the audiobook's reader, Christopher Evan Welch, who treats periods like semicolons and adopts a sort of breathy falsetto when reading a \\"quote\\" from a woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly enjoyed","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. It gave great insight into the world of the blind. It also made me appreciate my sight. It was a very fast read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Model Glove","review":"The Everlast 4310 Glove is not a good speed bag glove. In fact, it is not a good bag in general. It is listed as a \\"ONE SIZE FITS MOST\\". What it really is... is printed on the glove as a \\"S/M\\". I wonder what that means? Oh I know. It is a SMALL/MEDIUM glove. It has almost no padding to it and feels and looks cheap. It is a vinyl glove which is fine. I did not expect it to be leather. You will be money ahead if you take $4 and go to Home Depot and buy some cheap leather work gloves. I have also seen this glove listed online for as little as $5.00. Shame on you Everlast for putting out this junk. Returning the glove for a return is out of the question do to having to pay for shipping costs both ways and possible restocking fees. Sometimes you are the windshield and sometimes you are the bug... In this case I was the bug. See you at Home Depot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!! Do not buy these gloves!!","review":"These gloves are really poor quality. The inner lining makes them very difficult to put on or off especially when your hands are a little sweaty from hitting the bag.Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap plastic","review":"Gloves are cheap plastic. Although they are the right size, the thumb don't fit well. Compared to old school bag gloves, they suck.

It is obvious to me that _Let's Go Europe_ is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame and worthless","review":"This deadweight trunk of uselessness is better a door stop than a guide. Dont be fooled. Buy each country if you are going to use Lonely Planet. It is not so much the size of the book, but the useless info they include. It did make me think about going to Morocco, though. Still wondering why they would include it in a European guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was awful!!!","review":"I just received this book as a Valentine's gift from a co-worker and finally sat down to read it last night. The poetry is awful, the stories are mundane. I almost want to return this book to my friend so he can get his money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty watch","review":"Very pretty watch- given to my daughter for her 11th birthday. Fits nicely. The only thing I am not real happy about and wish I had done more research on is the fact that it is NOT water resistant. Would have made a different choice if I had realized that small detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I read and understand Norwegian, so was really looking forward to listening to this production. I had heard part of a Public Radio broadcast of a similar Peer Gynt production and thought this was the one. But it wasn't. Although the Orchestra performance is great, the volume changes between it and the speaking (acting) parts are too great and require constant adjustment of the volume control during listening. Also the actors speak and shout like they are angry most of the time. The play is suposed to be funny and entertaining. Sorry I bought this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what my home practice needed!","review":"My home practice was frustrating, because I could never judge how long I was holding a posture. This cd takes care of that problem so I can get out of my head and into my asana. The soothing sound of ocean waves reminds me to come back to ujai breathing during my practice. The 1 minute and 3 minute intervals are great for those who prefer a yin style of yoga (like me). You can use this cd for spontaneous posture sequences or with your favorite book of asanas. My home practice frequency and length has increased. It's a great purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the gong?!?!","review":"I downloaded the MP3 version of Ocean because I wanted a way to time my yoga poses without having to look at a timer but there is no gong! I've listened to 20 minutes worth of it so far and all I here is crashing waves. I like the idea of it, but it does me no good if I can't hear some sort of indication as to when I'm supposed to change postures. This was a waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Different products?","review":"The MP3 download of the 'Yoga Timer' CD with Ocean and Sunrise tracks has no clear marker of time. The two positive reviews say it's easy to hear the changing for them - one even mentioning a gong - which is not present in these tracks. It's lovely atmospheric music, but other than the waves crashing every 15 seconds - I listened trying to find a counter - there is no timer.I wonder if, perhaps, there are multiple CDs that are being confused?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy and unorganized","review":"The book gives a narrow introduction on JavaScript for an intermediate programmer, so it is cutting corners. Many of them, nuf said!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Literature is Hard to Find","review":"This book changed my life. I was depressed and considering ending it all, then I read the life changing message of How to Use Strategy in Panzer General 2. My world resounded with a new song of joy and I found the will to live again. I applied the Panzer 2 Strategy Guide principles to every facet of my life, and wonderful things began to happen. I turned my will over to the General, and became His vessel, and in my surrender, I found my victory. I recommend reading this book only if your are really serious about living a transformed life, saving money, and finding your True Self."},{"rating":"1","title":"My 65H8O is a lemon!","review":"I ordered a 65H80 in April. It worked two hours then lost the picture. The local Toshiba Service rep could not repair it and the advice he got from the main service office was misleading and incorrect. The instructions he received on CD were in Japanese and the diagrams did not apply to my version of the set.Then I was stonewalled with excuses from Toshiba since the tech and I reported it in June. Today is 100 days since I got the set and only now have I gotten an offer to replace the set, but now the model is no longer available as a new mmodel (65H81) is coming out.The service from Toshiba has been HORRID!! I cannot recommend Toshiba television products based on my experience with customer service alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy At All - Toshiba 65H80","review":"I ordered this item September 20th. It came around October 30th. It had a picture for all of 2 hours. Then all I was able to get was colored lines running up and down the screen. Toshiba sent 5 technicians out on different occassions. The TV was drilled, taken apart, played with and put back together. Still did not work. Finally Toshiba approved a new signal board. Signal board was installed and the picture was better but horrible. Now it is December 2nd and I still have NO TV! Toshiba is a horrible company. I will never do business with them ever again. It is worth paying an extra 2K to go with a Sony."},{"rating":"2","title":"A big screen TV yet small on your pocket","review":"I own this set for about a year now. the picture quality is awsome when you play movies on dvd. it has component video input which gives the best and clearest picture.the price is reasonable now, however when i bought it the price was twice as much as is now. if own a dvd player and you love movies,i highly reccomeng one of this to get a movie experience which you never had at home with a tradional tv set.please make sure you have enough space ,beleive it is big one !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally","review":"It's about time a new one was released...Why is their new album still listed as Devil Wears a Lamb's Skin? Anyway... I don't have the CD yet, but I do have a tape copy of the demo for this album. It sounds great. These guys definitely deserve recogniton, they work their butts off and they lay down some awesome grooves."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word ... Dry.","review":"This book will give you very interesting information regarding Elvis Costello and his musical career but it is dry and very English. The biggest downfall was each chapter follows the same format: history of the CD that year, stories of the songs on the CD and then reviews by pop and music magazines. Then on to the next CD, alas it leaves something to be desired. And the author's obsession with Bebe Buell begins to bore the reader as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turns gold into base metal","review":"A missed opportunity - a lot of information, a lot of poor writing. Holds the interest due to the weight of collected research, but reads as unedited scrawl from an enthusiastic hobbyist. Strange that the brilliant songwriter should be treated with lumpish prose. Costello admirers are among the more literate consumers of popular culture. They will find the book both desirable for its information, and repellent for its style. Hinton's gifts seem to be in research rather than clear communication. He could learn a literary trick or three from his subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"LET THE AUTHOR TALK...","review":"I've never been so aware of an author before. Usually, even in a biography, you can kind of lose yourself in the story. Not here. Apparently the writer is getting paid by the word, and the longer the better. Turn to any page and there are examples like: \\"Sniffing glue and being sick had replaced rural weekends, tower blocks were suddenly more romantic than a bluebell wood, and anger and amphetamine seemed infinitely preferable to drifting away on a dope-fuelled reverie\\" (Honestly, I didn't even look for this. I opened the book for an example and it is the first thing I saw!) It is a very annoying read that also concentrates too much on live performances and interviews in the press. I guess I'm still looking for a book about Elvis that concentrates on the SONGS - a book that is much more browsable than this one. Some decent anecdotal song information is here, but you have to suffer through so much garbage to get it that you should save the money and form your own opinions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Informative and Unorganized","review":"This book is nice if you don't mind skimming four hundred pages in search of the interesting stuff. What a great book this could have been if it were not so hard to follow. It gave quite a bit of miscellaneous information about people and events that aren't very relevant to Elvis's life. I also found some of Hinton's takes on a few of E.C.'s songs to be a bit over-analyzing. But this book really does have a lot of information that would be hard to find anywhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tanzania Countrywide","review":"Great pictorial which covers all the regions of Tanzania in a well layed out manner.Covers areas of the country that we did not visit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Medicine Ball!","review":"The Everlast Medicine ball is a great way to add variety to any fitness program.

It is so intresting to listen to the words what they wrote..Like \\"Lonely Christmas eve\\" by Ben folds. I think that song talks about the grinch alot, Nice beat, and lyrics. When Jim carrey sings,\\"Your a mean one, Mr Grinch\\" He has a nice voice. I love it when he changes his voice to a higher pitch then a lower, very Interesting. The only song I hated is N'sync. All I am saying is that its matters if you like the music or not, Everyone have diffrent opinions, you know. I like the cd, I hope you do to. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for hard-core Christmas album collectors","review":"To put it short, the only songs that stand out are the Busta Rhymes/Jim Carrey collaboration, and the song by the Eels. All the rest are a disappointment. If you're looking for Grinchy songs, get the original Grinch TV Special Soundtrack. The only reason this gets two stars is because the Busta Rhymes/Jim Carrey \\"collabo\\" and Eels songs are very good, while all the rest are very bad (especially the 'N Sync)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely Not One for the Christmas Collection!","review":"First of all, there are only a couple of good songs on it, one of which is Barenaked Ladies singing \\"Green Christmas\\". Most of the songs are either mind-numbingly dull or simply poorly produced. I was also disappointed that the music was broken up with some of the movie's lame dialogue.

It is very accurate at long range and is heavy enough to not be affected by light winds. The main problem I have with the product is the glow in the dark feature. I can't seem to find a good use for it mostly because having to charge and recharge it takes too much time and ends up not being the most useful thing because it doesn't last long enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Frisbee!","review":"Discraft frisbees are much better quality than Wham-O frisbees. Even though they may have equal masses and appear to be the same design, don't let that fool you. Discraft frisbees have a nice feel to them and they fly very far and accurately unlike Wham-O. To top it off, these discs are super cheap. I bought two and they are identical, so no manufacturing inconsistencies. I highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"IT #*%&%#^@ GLOWS IN THE DARK!!!","review":"THIS FRISBEE IS SOOOOO AWESOME!! It, like, totally glows in the dark!

You really couldn't ask for much more. I got the red color because it was cheapest but I actually really like it. It's ultra bright (think safety vest orange) so it's tough to lose in the sky or grass, even around dusk. Feels a little more rubbery/maleable than a wham-o disc but flies as well or better. Would definitely recommend picking this item up."},{"rating":"2","title":"hurray for discraft, but...","review":"These are of course perfect...the weight is there and we've been enjoying the heck out of them.

It has good visibility in the daytime and evening.The weight of the disc provides for stable throws that will go far with a good arm, and the it's pretty easy to catch. It might be a little too heavy for young children.My only complaint (and reason for 4 stars over 5) is that my disc came with tiny burrs left over from the manufacturing process on part of the rim. They are barely noticeable, but although an experienced thrower with a calloused hand won't be affected by them, the casual thrower might develop a cut after an extended throwing session."},{"rating":"2","title":"great, but be careful","review":"This is the official disk to use, and so is useful for practicing for tournaments where it will be used, or for using for games.

Very pretty in the sunlight"},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"Hard to throw. Tend to wobble once air borne and doesn't fly far.

It's balanced, it flies great, and it's regulation-sized.

But thats really no problem, because I bought this for the purpose of knowing I wont lose it when I accidentally throw it in the woods. And this color is perfect for that.

However, when I ordered it, they sent me a white one instead of a yellow one. I called them and they sent me another one which was also white and not yellow. Not a huge deal for me, but it was to replace one that had been damaged and the owner was quite fond of the color, so it became a crucial factor.

They are the only ones I even consider using or buying. I've played Ultimate for 4 years and these discs will fly perfectly. Whamo's are pretty feeble in comparison.

It is this type of belabored point-making that is very unsettling to a distressed person in need of comfort and answers. It was like a chatty housewife telling me about her kid's tonsillectomy while I lay bleeding waiting for an ambulance. Very distressing.The authors also imply a tone of condemnation to those who do not have significant commitments in life (a mortgage, a long-term job, etc.) yet never pinpoint factors in the commitment phobe's life as to why commitment is frightening to them and how the fear can be overcome.However, the authors DID succeed at sighting cases of commitment phobia -- over and over and over.

That work is over thirty years old. In those intervening 30 plus years, the equipment being used in SETI has improved both in performanence capability, signal to noise improvement, increased frequencies or bandwidths, etc.. This can only increase the probability of the reception of an extraterrestrial orginating signal, which is what SETI is all about. This book describes the basic reasoning for such searches, and introduces the new technologies being used. It also re-visits the Drake equation, but with actual numbers for the factor of planets in the Galaxy, a factor simply a guess in the older books.I highly recommend this book both as an introduction and as an update to Sagan's earlier work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial and trivial","review":"I read this book hoping that the glib one-liners and poor in-jokes would give way to something substantial but they never did. It's written in such a trivial and superficial style that makes one think all the time whilst reading it \\"where's the beef?\\" It's full of cliches and what the authors obviously thinks is funny but it really is an unsatisfactory read.The publishers should have worked on the text more as it is obvious that the author cannot write in other than soundbytes in what I would call a type of division four Saganesque. The author obviously thinks he is an authority on the subject of life in space but only displays a superficial and incomplete grasp of the field.My advice is to get anything by Sagan instead.

The animation is simply presented (often the backgrounds are simplified or non-existant) while still beautiful. The character design is lovely, although admittedly they lack any serious depth -- probably because the cast is so large. The sudden decisions to change not only the spelling of all proper nouns but all of the voice casting for the last parts were tragic and pointless ones. The American voice cast stinks in comparison to the British casting of earlier parts.

It does not that that great licorice after-taste that makes you want to have another sip like Aveda tea. This tea also has cinnamon which is not in the Aveda tea at all. Overall, I would NOT recommend this tea to anyone who is looking for Aveda tea. It is very minty and has cinnamon in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"script full of silliness","review":"The script of \\"Helen of Troy\\" is so full of improbable silliness and stilted dialogue it is matched only by the wooden acting that in the 50s seemed a requirement of Hollywood epics. In the end it spoils the spectacular sets and occasionally effective cinematography. The sack of Troy sequence at the end of the movie almost redeems it, and I am almost tempted to raise my rating for that alone. But then I remember the hash they made of the actual seige, with medieval seige engines and uninspired choreography. Paris is played as a 50's hunk who completely upstages Hector. There's no hint of the spoiled, self-indulgent womanizer. Worse, the romance between him and Helen fell a little flat. It's worth having a look at if you are a fan of this genre, as I am, but otherwise it disappoints."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Iliad It's Not","review":"I should have known from the title that this was not going about the Trojan War. The movie is a hokey love story far removed from the original war epic of the Iliad. Paris seems to have taken over the character and physical prowess of Achilles, and all Greeks, including Achilles, are turned into unscrupulous cowards. Homer is turning in his grave. I suppose Hollywood felt that love stories sell better than war movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helen of Troy","review":"For the times great movie, not sure if it followed exactly thetrue story. Watch the recent usa movie and compare for fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as I remember","review":"I loved \\"Helen of Troy\\" when I was a young girl in the 50's. Paris, Jacques Sernas, was the most gorgeous man I had ever seen. I wondered how I would feel about it after seeing \\"Troy\\" with Orlando Bloom playing a rather whimpy version of Paris. I felt no chemistry between Paris and Helen in this new version. I ordered the original and it still stands out as a classic and cannot be replaced with expensive special effects. \\"Helen of Troy\\" has a heart and the audience is compelled to hope that Helen and Paris can have a life together. In the new version, it didn't matter to me if they stayed together or not. I highly recommend \\"Helen of Troy\\" for the descerning movie viewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"simply sensational decorating projects","review":"I have purchased many many decorating books and for the most part I find something I can use from the book.

I accept that not everything printed can be represented in a guide, but from the look of Overstreet, everything from either Marvel or DC can be- even a recent Marvel title which had poor sales and remains in low demand is represented here at its original cover price, but where are the independent titles which have enjoyed a substantial share of the same market? Where is the Gold Digger, for example, whose sales held strong even during the B&W bust, and which remains in demand today?

How the heck do I explain why a baby lion is floating in a pool ring alongside his mum, the cat and dog are canoeing, and later on the lion family are in a ship. WHAT is with the lions? Lions have absolutely nothing to do with lakes, rivers or oceans. There is a place for silly placement of characters, but not in a book which claims to be about what floats.

The problem is that the seam all along the edge of the book is quite sharp, so that whenever our little one would try to mouth it, his face would get scratched up. I'm also a little worried about what would happen if he caught the edge in his eye, so there is no way that we would let him play with it unsupervised.

The bag is a little big and comes off the swivel attachment every once and a while - also frustrating. For the price it was a good value and beginners will enjoy it.

I mounted the platform and went to inflate the bladder, wet the needle as instructed, but when I tryed to insert it, the bladder detached and I spent 25 minutes trying to find the hole(I never have problems finding \\"the hole\\").

Number one the first and biggest problem is that it doesn't come with the F***** lag bolts that you need to mount the thing to a brick wall.The directions are very poor and automatically assume your mounting it to a wooden wall. I mean really how many people have wood walls in their basement? Number two the speed bag platform is made from particle board, and the swivel is made of 95% plastic. The bag itself comes deflated, and doesn't come with a needle to pump it up. The metal framing is cheap, and doesn't hold together right, The holes to mount it up on the wall on the metal framing are absurdly small 5/16 of an inch. So basically your paying $45 for a set of hand wraps, a jump rope, and bag gloves.

There are plenty of other actual minidisc recorders for the same price on Amazon. It's almost impossible to tell unless the picture shows a red colored hole on the side.

Although it can hold more songs than a CD player, I wanted to get away from having to keep up with additional pieces of hardware.The second problem I have with this devise is the aweful software. Lots of problems occured with getting songs recorded onto the disk - too many to mention - because of conflicts with my computer's operating system. A chat with a live help customer service representative gave me a solution for one problem, but it only gave way to new problems.I am returning this minidisk player as soon as the holiday return lines dwindle and have already purchased an actual mp3 player that I have read wonderful reviews about time and time again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not working","review":"Would not record anything at the very onset.

I recieved one as a christmas present last year and I loved it, until it hit about 6 months old, when the buttons only occaisonally worked properly. A little research showed that this was a common fault in the NetMD series, and the other main problem with these things is that the tension on the optical reading system is held by a cheap piece of plastic (unlike metal which almost any other electronics maker would use). This means that in less than a year, chances are you're going to have to start holding the thing upside down to get it to play at all.Sony really cheaped out when they made these things, but then they only cost like $50, so maybe you can buy a new one once or twice a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"great alternative to flash mp3","review":"im not a rich man so when i found out about md players i knew i had to get one. and i sure am glad i did. the player functions exactly as told, delivers almost cd quality sound even though it is much less space, delivers no less than about 65 songs per md, the battery lasts a century (50 HOURS!), and fits in a small pocket. the only problems i had were with the headphones (100% total crap), and with the software. both were solve when i bought better headphones, and downloaded real player. great alt. for flash players."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good","review":"I have owned a refurbed unit for almost a year now, and used it almost every day. It fits in a pocket-T perfectly, only uses one AA battery, and a rechargable Ni-Mh battery lasts a long time. The Sony Software takes a little getting used to, but to be honest I use the CD recorder software the most. I will convert mp3s to an audio Cd and use them. I did have a problem with the volume down button not working too well. The funny thing is I had what should have been a horrible accident fix it about 5 months ago.I had my player in a cargo pants pocket, and put it in a washing machine while I was doing laundry (which I discovered after the load was done). I took out the battery, and opened everything up, stuck it in a brown paper bag in the sun for an hour to dry out. An hour later I put in a new battery, and she fired right up, and the volume controls work fine again.I might also mention Sony put a great set of headphones in the unit as well. A tough unit which I highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad software","review":"SonicStage, the software used to upload music to the NetMD is extremely un-userfriendly. Quite frequently when i try to upload a mix of music, some songs will never make it on while others will be on the player 3 times!I found that the main circular button used to change tracks/ pause/ and play, wears out quickly and you have to press it either very hard or multiple times to achieve the required action.The only reason that this player gets 2 stars is because the NetMD runs off of a single AA battery making it great for long trips or plane rides, because you dont have to worry about finding a place to recharge the battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good hardware, bad software!","review":"The player itself is a good piece of hardware, but after a while the software refused to work.

Shortly after, it broke because the insert where the Minidisks go stopped closing and opening and nothing could be done to fix this. Besides this problem, I was satisfied with the MD player's capacity and trusted that it was my inconsideration by which the player broke.So, I bought a new one. This one lasted not even a year before a problem occured with it. This time the earphone jack isn't working. I can hear from one headphone but not the other with any headphones I use. This is horrible. Now I had to ducktape it so that it somewhat works.If you're looking for a cheap alternative to classic MP3 players, then this is for you. Great capacity, ok sound quality, but let me warn you, if you're looking for something that lasts long, don't buy this because you'll be highly dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ipod's are a rip off","review":"I talked to a guy at radio shack and he told me you can store over 200 songs on one minidisc with the proper format,well he was almost right, the highest i got was 109 songs on one 74 min premium md, it was about 3 hours of music,it's way better than an ipod because the disc come in 5 packs for $9.95 thats 2 bucks a disc, you can put about 3-5 hours of music on one 2 dollar disc vs. 4 hours of music on a 200 dollar ipod, and those other mp3 players that use sd cards are an even bigger rip because if you wanna upgrade you gotta fork over a ton of money on a stupid sd card, so this is way better because you can store the same ammount for less,it also runs off of one aa batterie and last for about 80 hours,this IS the best md player when it comes to cost and quallity,the other ones that cost more might have a radio tuner and a car adapter but this one is the highest quallity player of the m all, oh yeah remember to record in Atracc3 mode on lp4 stereo,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work with Windows 98 OS","review":"It would be real nice if the Target or Sony websites even gave you a CLUE that this product does not work with Windows 98, you have to at least have Windows 98 Second Edition.

If you can do without a microphone input, the unit should readily handle all your recording/playback needs. The unit is extremely easy to use, has a relatively good battery life, and - for whatever its worth - is styled with a classy black and silver case. LP4 allows some 5 hours of recording on a single disc, LP2 about 2 and 1/2 hours (with better quality), and standard speed (near CD-quality) up to 80 minutes. Don't get too flustered about the software ... if you are a typical user, it works just fine, and if you want extra functionality because you are a recording enthusiast, you can use other free software. A bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minidisc player","review":"The seller was superb however the product and program with the minidisc recorder was substandard. Sony has added and deleted features from earlier versions so this generation is incompatable with the way I have previously used a minidisc recorder, namely recording through a microphone or line input.

I also have a hi-mdwhich can record up to 35 hours on one disc. I feel that the media is rather cheap compared to I-POD vs. size and a set memory. I could never fit my music library on a fixed memory I-POD."},{"rating":"1","title":"arrived DOA","review":"No big surprise. I stopped buying anything with the Sony brand back in the late 90's when Sony started to develop a reputation for worsening quality problems. There are almost no mini disc players in existence any more, again thanks to it being released by Sony in the 90's then promptly left to die on the vine.Mini disc has very minimal digital artifact from compression to digital file on a re-recordable disc. I tried this recorder when my 14 year old Sharp minidisc player stopped working. But this one arrived d.o.a. so I returned it for a refund.My Sony minidisc deck I bought in the 90's had technical problems since the day it was new, and still does. But today, there is no other brand that makes minidisc.

There is extensive anti-piracy protection that prevents this in both the recorder and the software, and the only way to do it is to capture the audio from the analog headphone output real time, then redigitize it, changing the sample rate, etc. If sharing live recordings is what you want to do, get a more modern digital recorder, of which there are many good ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"MD quality rules","review":"MDs are as virtual-CD in sound quality as my ear can detect.

It is sensitive and gentle, yet hits on a tender point in any adoption story. How did I come to be available? The questions that she has asked after the book is closed and she is snuggled safely in my arms, reminds me how close to the surface are her memories of China and the question of why she is in the USA instead. Although I have [unsuccessfully] brought the subject up before, this story has given her the freedom to voice her own questions and fears. If Elizabeth can ask questions and get straight answers, maybe I can too. This book is beautiful. And creates an atmosphere of safety and love that gives the adopted child a chance to ask."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book!","review":"My eight year old Korean daughter is quite resistant to talking about adoption issues, but is simultaeously very much in need to information and support as she grows. We found this book at the public library, and she did not initially want to read it, but I brought it home and said that I was going to read it. She finally agreed to look at the illustrations, which are wonderful, and then let me read to her. It has become a very important book for us as a family.The balance between being happy and secure with one's adopted family and also grieving and wondering about the \\"other family\\" is handled very sensitively in this book.

Ben Neill takes some 30 second commercial spots that he made for VW and extends them out into full-length tunes. Some nice Drum-N-Bass grooves with his handy trumpet licks thrown in. Very spy movie-esque. Makes me think of The Italian Job movie.I had originally bought the Goldbug album because it was supposedly an innovative album for the drum-n-bass genre. The individual tracks on that album were kind of hit or miss but I really liked the unique feel of the album and some of the unique things he did with the monster-trumpet-thing and his interesting use of the DNB samples. So that is why I was somewhat disappointed with this album: For all it's charm, it is a little tame. Innovative is not a word I would use for it. But I still enjoy listening to it and it would make good chill-out or study music, especially if you enjoy jazzy DNB, so I do recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liquids poweders and more","review":"If you have ever had trouble getting honey, molasses, corn syrup or other ingredients out of a standard measuring cup you will want to look into this product.

This is one of my more beautiful and insightful editions. The combination of historical text, personal stories, and really well-reproduced imagery does justice to the space program and its participants. I recommend this highly as a book for both those who know the ins and outs of space exploration, but also for the younger set who can learn a lot. It's simple and elegant, but also is also valuable in that it's an accurate and useful reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Anyone who has even a mild interest in spaceflight should buy and read \\"The Infinite Journey\\". The book was wonderfully put together and the pictures alone make it worth buying. The text comprises of the people who made the missions work and some of the anecdotes are priceless. The foreword by Walter Cronkite is wonderfully written by the journalist who did more to sell the space program in the 1960s than anyone else. The essays at the end of the book are also worth reading. My only complaint is that there was no bibliography so you could find out more information on the different projects mentioned but it is a book that I will treasure for many years."},{"rating":"1","title":"a missed opportunity","review":"The concept for this book is good. Unfortunately it misses in achieving that concept.The reproduction of photographs is very well done, though more attention could have been paid to selection. A number are the same ones seen so frequently. The captions for some are incorrect or insufficiently informative.The comments by persons involved in the various projects are a definite plus. The introductions to these by Burrows and parenthetical comments, however, frequently detract from these.The narration by Burrows introducing each project or mission contains numerous factual errors or misrepresentations which seriously detract from what would otherwise be an excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iraq Deployment Ready","review":"After having these sent to me in Iraq, I started buying these by the dozen.

(It starts with the voyage of the Mayflower. Really. I could not possibly make that up.)The color photos of the dolls in the most recent edition are lovely, but a surprising number of the book's photos are of old advertising materials, newspaper clippings, promotional displays and even price lists, plus photos of the company's founding family. Far from an encyclopedia about the popular Ginny doll, the book reads as if someone published the company's scrapbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mannequin Heads/for practicing hairstlying","review":"Bought two of these for my niece's.

A mysterious woman besets the old fencing master Jaime Astarloa. The beautiful unknown wears the finest clothes but her wrist is strong. Indefendable thrust. It's an extremely exciting thriller, a story about power, revenge and political decisions which are marked by the end of an European era. Because of the appearance of Adela de Otero who besets Don Jaime to tell him his secret of the indefensible thrust everything changes for him for one last time. Suddenly he's in the middle of a fight between live and death and he must use all his abilities to parry an intrigue which threatens to shatter a whole nation in its foundations. Well done. You won't get bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I got lured to read Perez-Reverte's Fencing Master on the double account that all my friends were big fans of him (especially impressed by La tabla de Flames, his book on chess and Renaissance paintings), and that I am a keen fencer, having learnt the art of foil with an authentic Spanish-speaking Master.I should have known better. Perez-Reverte's fencing technicalities are bogus, but that's OK because nobody has ever really been able to express what a sword fight feels like in writing, not since the art the literary duel fell out of fashion at any rate. But what was so disappointing was the plot and the one-dimensional characters, which completely failed to live up to the author's reputation for clever mystery.Also, either the traduction (in French) was very poor or the style was terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, especially after his previous books","review":"This books was quite a disappointment. After devouring Flanders Panel, Club Dumas and Seville Communion, I was expecting the same mystery and complexity. For this book, the plot was poorly developed, the villaness was seriously one-dimensional and stereotypical (a real letdown after the female characters in the previous books). I kept reading the book in the hopes of the plot becoming more interesting but no such luck. The ending wasn't as earth shattering as I'd hoped, judging from Reverte's previous works. I'm glad I didn't buy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy reading... too much so.","review":"For my first book from Arturo Perez-Reverte I was disappointed in that the book was predictable by the half waypoint and the characters a bit one-dimensional.

They range from older songs(from the 70's) to songs that you may have just recently heard over the past few years. I first saw this CD when I was at my local library and decided to borrow it. Boy, I was glad I did. Honestly, ever song from start to finish touches your soul. You can go through both discs without saying \\"eh, I wonder what's next?\\" You can't always say that with CD's, especially two-disc ones. Personally, I think the two most heart-wrenching, touching songs are \\"I Can Only Imagine\\" and \\"Rise Again.\\" If your a newer Christian or have been saved for decades, you will fall in love with these CD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok CD, but not outstanding","review":"I bought this CD because, from a TV ad, it had so many of my favorite songs and artists on it, but I've been disappointed with the actual product.

I am not sure what this CD is all about. I am all about supporting artist that nobody knows or cares about (who knows who may make it in the music industry). But I didn't recognize any of the songs on the album, so I gave it a shot. I think I was tricked into buying a homosexual music compilation. I have no problem with gay people, but I just don't like being misled. With lyrics sung by male artists talking about giving another man his love. Like I said that is cool if that happens to be what you are into, but I probably would not have bought it if it were labeled with a rainbow, or a purple triangle, ANYTHING to tell the customer that it was a CD about homosexuality. It is not mentioned anywhere on the packaging, But it is loud and clear in the lyrics. I am not cutting on Gays, and not even necessarily saying the music was that bad... it is just that I would like a little more of a hint before I buy a CD containing content that I am not into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD","review":"The music on this CD is just beautiful and so inspirational.

She has never read Peretti before and loves the books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let the buyer beware","review":"This book is predicated on the false Christian belief that we are, when all is said and done, the ones who allow God to save us. The final \\"savior\\" in the book is not Christ or his substitutionary sacrifice but the power of human prayer. This novel perpetuates the false teaching that fallen people have the ability to decide for God and ultimately save their society. It is a feel good novel that puts the spotlight on the unbiblical notion that if we manufacture good works for God, then he will bless us. This \\"Christian\\" novel contributed to the silly notion after 9/11 that our prayers create a wall of defense around our nation. The novel is misleading at best. Go read Romans or Galatians again for the real way salvation works in the Christian faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT Books + GREAT Price","review":"I first read these Frank Peretti books in the early 1990's.

These books are fiction, and they are not to replace the Bible by any means but This Present Darkness clearly illustrates how powerful prayer is.

I never thought that would run through someone's mind when creating this swivel plate, so I never even looked for it to be plastic. On the picture it just looks like a nicely painted swivel, but when you get it, you can not believe someone who knows what this is for created this. BELIEVE ME DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!!

The songs that a band such as Incubus creates beg to be redone by orhestras/quartets. However the musicians that have covered the songs truely do not deserve to be re-orchestrating the music of incubus. The product of these \\"musicians\\" is childish as far as the music goes. Incubus's infinite depth has been oversimpified and musically trashed. Check out the string quartet version of Led Zeppelin. There is a true set of quartet versions of classic songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hip-Hop violins just don't do it for me...","review":"There are two tracks that are worth listening to on this CD: Miss You and maybe Mexico. The Quartet tried really hard, but I didn't prefer their attempt at trying to copy the tempo and beat of the originals. The CD sounds like it's an attempt at a new hip-hop violin genre that makes me feel like I'm at a square dancing party. My 2 cents: slow the songs down, don't try hip-hop violin, copy the music and flow. My 2 cents to the buyers: Save your [money] and get another album instead; then search for Miss You and Mexico on a P2P like Kazaa!"},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely beautiful..","review":"I just got this cd today.

It felt like my face was literally on fire. I immediately washed it off. It still hurt. I tried to numb the pain with cold water. Next day, my face was pink throughout and pain still lingers. I have tried variety of products, Cetaphil, Purpose, Alba, Lancome, Estee Lauder, Clarines, Chanel, Clinique, and many over the counter products typically found in any drug store. I have never had such reaction. Note, I don't have a sensative skin. My skin tends to be normal with a little shiny T zone. My mom, who has dry skin, tried the products.

The Indians referred to what we call the Great Smokies as \\"land of blue smoke\\". I was left hanging as to why the family of the white child were not sought after by the relatives in NC.

Because I use iTunes, I am forced to burn a disc in iTunes of the music that I want to put on my mini-disc. Then I have to rip that disc into SonicStage which can take a long time. After that I can then select the music from SonicStage and burn a minidisc. This whole Process can take as long as 45 minutes. After that ordeal, the Walkman works great.

After 30 minutes of searching, I found that the name of the software was OpenMG...a bit of Googling and I found a dozen newsgroup posts, and one that told me how to get it...you have to lie to OpenMg.com and say that you have an older version of the player.

I have to highly agree with many others in saying that the radio isn't the best, but it beats a blank & this product is not that huge in that aspect. The best way I have used these minidiscs is putting a group of a specific artists music on one CD & seeing how creative I can become lol.

Then there's the astute dialog, the top-notch acting, and all the family sub-plots that keep things cooking episode after episode.

While some behind the scenes crew did, including the creator of the series, it would have been really nice to hear Arquette and Weber comment on some episodes. Aside from that, it was a good DVD release. Maybe they can get Arquette and Weber to do some commentaries on the third season DVD release.

If this is the best of the 2.4 GHz phones, I'm not buying one and I'll deal with the sticky keys on my AT&T. I'd rather have the sound clarity. This phone has a very hollow and tinny sound.

Juvenal does not claim to be a saint however the rest of the world disagrees. All Juvenal wants to help those in need and to be left alone. However, there are too many people who want a piece of him. They want to exploit this miracle for a profit. And then there's Lynne... with Lynne Juvenal has found a soulmate, someone who he can talk to and who understand him.

While the original document offers interesting perspective, Feral House's release in this publication does not contributed to it so much as it takes away from the document's essence.The additional doodles have nothing to do with historical Christian martyrdom, and some of them could only be described as disturbing and pornographic. The publisher's foreword is pretty blatantly anti-Church and makes one wonder what other purpose Feral House had to publish it than to revel in Christian suffering and make a buck off of it.I would recommend finding a used older edition which the publisher's \\"bonus\\" material was left out."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Horror","review":"No real Christian would ever own this book published by Feral House.

The writer left many details that would have explain the action of his characters. I believe that Mr. Stirling could have given the characters more emotions, like he did in the first two books.

The left-wing revolutionaries fighting against the right-wing Nazis. Leninist/Marxists versus concentration camps.

If you want to know who is evil I can tell you ahead of time they have blue eyes (sometimes \\"piercing blue eyes\\") and/or blond hair. If you want to know who is good, just check their skin color. If they are non-white then they're fighting for justice and freedom. This is not to say that we should be rooting for whites over blacks. I don't mean that. But this predictable politically correct dogma that Stirling serves up is so by-the-book that it lacks fire and imagination.

It doesn't take up much space, so you can pack it on vacation, yet it unfolds to become a nice size book/toy.

Wonderful job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"I feel that it is becoming more and more the case today that surf movies are just a way for companies like Billabong, Rip Curl, Globe, etc. to get their team out in the lime-light. They smear their logos all over the film and back it up with raging, lame, typical SoCal crappy whiteboy music, but A Brokedown Melody, like its predecessors creates a fantastical and complete surfing experience. There are no subtitles telling you who is surfing or who the song is by because it doesn't matter; the movie is too good for those details to make a difference. The movie is one whole journey that has calming and seductive overtones. This is BY FAR the best surf movie I have ever seen. It is an authentic documentation of what surfing truly is and what it should continue to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"An \\"I can't put the book down!\\" story","review":"Filled with mystery, action, suspence, love, trust and drama, \\"In the Middle of the Night\\" teaches a lesson in listening to what your parents say.

All Denny wants is to be like regular kids, answering the phone, chatting all night, but his father wont let him. Then finally, Denny gets enough courage to pick up the phone. This book was great because the ending was so unexpected. I like to talk on the phone alot and this book made me more careful about who I tell things to. I would recomend it to adults and children.

His father was involved in an accident that killed twenty two children. All Denny wants is a normal life like everyone else his age, but Denny's father wont allow him to have a lisence or get a job like normal kids. This stoy gives a look inside the psycological workings of several different characters minds. I'm glad I read it, not because it was the best novel ever written, but becuase of the look it gives at the different characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"Out of all of Robert Cormier's books that I've read, In the Middle of the Night was probably the worst.

I really enjoyed this book because it was suspenseful. It really got me involved with the story. However, it was a little confusing at some parts because it jumped from person to person.

In the story, Denny's father was involved in an accident that killed 22 children.

Because I was into teen romances at the time and assumed it must to be good. Did I enjoy it? No. Were the characters interesting? No. Did the book have any depth? No. I am, however, giving it two stars because I like the way the book is set up- in between chapters, they have little columns and emails for you to read- I liked how that broke the book up.

It's the first one I have read of the Butterfly Trilogy, and I plan to read others as time goes on. It had all of the elements: sex, mystery, and a good storyline without too much unneeded detail.

I have encountered the occasional spelling/grammar mistakes throughout Butterfly, but it still does not deter me from reading it. Very good read. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Story about the metamorphosis of women","review":"Butterflyby Katherine Harvey is a very entertaining read. I loved following the development of various female characters from women with little self-worth to fully integrated women. For some, vengeance is the catalyst; for others, it is the acceptance of self, with all its imperfections. Very tastefully, Harvey attributes this acceptance to having good sex with a partner whose desire is to please rather than be pleased. What woman cannot relate to that!But Butterfly is more than titillating. The characters are richly developed. The plot, entwined with mystery and secretiveness, keeps the reader guessing what will happen next, and, at the end of the novel, wanting to know what happened to the beloved characters. Fortunately, Butterfly is the first book in the trilogy. I can't wait to see what happens to the characters in the subsequent books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Brilliant!!","review":"I have read this book four times and I thouroughly enjoyed it each and every time. It is the epitomy of love, lust, revenge and power. Danny deserved what he got. It is simply the best, More by Ms Harvey would be greatly appreciated!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pttttht :op","review":"Overall, I thought this was kind of a dumb book. I guess for a purely recreational read there is some escapism value to it, and the writing isn't terrible. The story keeps you moving along, but is completely unbelievable. The double premise (a) a woman so bent on revenge that she spends her entire life with only that purpose, and (b) a fabulously successful house of male prostitution/female fantasy fulfillment, is pretty far-fetched. Especially silly is the idea that women would find such a thing therapeutic. Some of the members of my bookclub really enjoyed this one, but I have to say that it was one that I'm sure I won't care to read again - add it to the \\"trade\\" bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious chick trash","review":"It has been a long time since I have treated myself to a read like this one.....and what a grand choice I made to help celebrate my 65th year!

So sit back, enjoy, and dream of a Butterfly in your hometown!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing, compelling, I couldn't put it down!!","review":"This is a smut book with a plot. The twists and turns keep you guessing to the very last page. The intricate way in which several different storylines all weave together is absolutely brilliant, I kept turning back to reread past chapters only to reabsorb each juicy detail. I read this for the first time about 8 years ago, and my paperback copy is so worn I may have to replace it! If you start this one, be prepared for the housework to suffer, you will not want to interrupt this amazing story of deception, lust, greed, passion, and sex aplenty!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Read!","review":"I read this book 10 years ago when someone told me about it.

The club is well hidden above a men's clothing store on Rodeo Drive. Butterfly is where women come to let themselves be free and not have to worry about anything. It's where fantasies come true.When I looked up this book I thought it would be a good book. I was wrong it was a remarkable story. It tells of Jessica, Trudie, and Linda stories. But the part I loved was Rachel's story. Her story is, of love and heartbreak. The story goes back in time to let you know what has happened to Rachel. The first time you meet her you get to know her family and what's it's like for her.You follow each of the women's stories through their time in and out of Butterfly. Some are married and are wanting some positive attention.I HIGHLY recommend this book. I know it is long but worth every little word! I couldn't put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I re-read this book every year while I'm on vacation!

One of my favorites to date.The main character, Beverly Highland has a such a hard and terrible childhood that you find yourself rooting for her and almost clapping for her towards the end. She's a woman that every woman can identify with on some level and you watch her grow up, get smart and concoct the BEST revenge you could ever imagine. She goes from being homely and timid to being strong, ambitious, shrewd, smart, plotting and a real diva.Sure wish there was a \\"Butterfly\\" club where I live! Reading this book was cake and the ending was the icing. Women of the world: Read this book! It will make you feel stronger and even inspire you to do better for yourselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time favorites","review":"After a young Danny Mackay made runaway Rachel an underage prostitute and then left her for dead, she's determined to see to it that he gets what he deserves. She gets a job as a short order cook in modest restaurant and draws crowds with her special hamburger recipe. With new self-assurance, she talks a plastic surgeon into reconstructing her unattractive face for free, and returns to make the restaurant turn into a thriving fast food chain. And all this time, she's cutting news clips on Danny Mackay, who becomes a famous evangelist. The ending is gripping. Ten years after I first read it, I still never get tired of reading how the beautiful, rich, and powerful Beverly Highland, once the homely and desperate Rachel, gives Danny Mackay what he's got coming to him. You'll want to read it again and again, and then order \\"Stars\\" for the finale."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absolute Buy for Novel Collectors","review":"I was first introduced to \\"Butterfly\\" by a second-hand bookstore owner.

It's stories, performances and production refuses to rest on the standerd of like tevelision shows. The stories tend to go far beond the \\"crime scene\\" and takes us into an interesting intanglement of characters perfectly portraied by the cast who brings such honest reality to their performance it makes one wonder if their simply playing themselves. Oh - and what chactors thay are!Then the quality of production is captivating in and of it self. Many one hour episodics are so well produced these days, thay look better than most of the big features we see in the theaters. NCIS than takes this already high standerd in television shows to another level. The color, the sets, the photography are wonderful to watch (one should really see it 9X16, or the HD format).Sit back and watch Mark Harmon's \\"Gibbs\\" take you through a remarkable piece of entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"NCIS - Season 1","review":"I have been waiting for this series to be released on DVD.

Since I didn't tune into NCIS until the 2nd season, this first season set has filled in gaps in the story line. It's well worth watching.With regard to the question about the audio quality in the first bit of \\"Missing\\" after the opening credits: there is one small \\"pop\\" in the middle of one word in my set. I might not have noticed it if I hadn't been listening for it. (It's like a \\"pop\\" on a vinyl record, but mine usually have more than one.) It certainly didn't interfere with my understanding the dialogue. I hope that helps the earlier poster decide whether her set is defective.Note months later: I didn't mean a 1-star rating.

This time I opted for the refund and returned the set at their expense.I have to say though, that Amazon has great customer service and make sure that customer satisfaction is met, so I had no problem with the issue ultimately.

To begin with, everyone is an investigator first and foremost, and never once deviates from their job descriptions to do something completely improbable like Harmless Rabbit used to do, such as borrow an F-14 to go hunt terrorists in the middle of a trial. Also, the characters are completely off the wall and incredibly entertaining: Gibbs is a borderline Luddite with some mysterious redhead in his life, DiNozzo is emotionally frozen at the age of 20, lab tech Abby is a Goth chick that shouldn't be associated with the Navy in the first place, and new girl Kate is slowly losing her sanity after being unceremoniously dumped from the Secret Service--probably because she let them steal Air Force One in the first standalone episode \\"Yankee White\\" in order to preserve physical evidence of a death.

But Gibbs and company did not disappointment! Mark Harmon has always been a favorite and I love his interpretation of Jethro Gibbs. He's tough and doesn't take an b.s. from anyone, especially his own team. They've got the resident computer geek, the Goth lab tech (who is awesome), the resident lothario (although Tony is a little over the top with his sexual comments--would prefer him to be a bit more professional) and Kate, the ex-Secret Service person, who realizes she still has a lot to learn. Will definitely be getting the remaining seasons!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best show on TV","review":"I became a fan of NCIS when I started watching reruns on USA network.

One of these news reports claims that the only form of communication still available is satellite phone. My question is, who in their right mind is broadcasting the news when there's no way anyone will see it? Also, why is there a thunderstorm in the United States when the meteor is crashing in Europe? It's stupid script oversights like these that completely ruin this movie. Bad computer effects, mediocre acting... it's all here.

You'll honestly think you're watching a parody of a disaster movie produced by Weird Al Yankovic. The opening music must have been taken from your stock disaster movies from the past. Like AIRPLANE. But I digress.Want to laugh at a really bad movie that would illicit a \\"Worst Actor\\" nomination to Dean Cain? This is it.

The charge was holding on this one but the handset buttons wouldn't work.

It is a snapshot of the quality movement in healthcare. Like a work of art, what is also interesting is what is not there or the negative spaces. A very wise man once said 'if you can't measure it you can't control it'. The word measurement is sadly missing from the index and table of contents. Measurement is central to quality improvement. Clinical laboratories have been required to measure, analyze and track the quality of their work for over 30 years. Many clinical labs have used statistical process control charts, control materials, standards etc. for decades. However, they have not routinely sought to identify root causes and corrective actions. Perhaps there will be a sequel with numerous valid measures of healthcare quality, more detailed examples of six sigma and possibly other lessons from Deming and Juran."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRM = Bad","review":"This disc has some sort of DRM which won't allow it to be ripped to iTunes and therefore is useless as who even owns a CD player anymore?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The games that started it all...","review":"Remember the days when you'd wait on line in the arcade to play those early classics like Asteroids and Missle Command?

If so, this is the collection for you: 18 arcade originals, plus a whopping 80 titles from the Atari VCS, including home versions of most of those same arcade titles...while the VCS compilation didn't do much for me, not having jumped on the home system bandwagon until the late 80s, it's still fun if you wanna see how much technology has improved in the last 25+ years, yet these first home video games w/their simple graphics and SFX were once considered state-of-the-art(!).

It has a nice selection, and Crystal Castles is a cult favorite of mine and the reason I really got the game. But besides maybe Centipede/Millipede, the others dont hold up, in particular the 2600 games which look terrible today by ANY standard.

This could have been a great collection if they had also snatched up the rights to excellent third party games like Reactor and Solar Fox, but instead you're mainly left wondering where those nostalgic feelings for Circus Atari came from.

It covers things like rationale for such a system etc.I would recommend this book as the essential for any development team about to move into content management systems, or those who have done so on the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tasty but salty.","review":"I bought this for an emergency kit, and I decided to try out the chicken pack. Inside the bag I saw some dried veggies, rice, and some yellow powdery stuff which all looked very similar to those Cup of Noodles that we all used to eat in college. Basically, you pour hot water directly into the bag and let it sit for a while.My initial bite tasted good but it was too salty (hence the four stars). I then removed half of the liquid and poured more hot water in to dilute the salt/seasoning. The second tasting was actually very good. This is definitely not gourmet style food, but it was much better than fast food dining.I would probably recommend packing a spaghetti noodle stainer in your emergency kit to remove some of the salt/seasoning before eating. Too much salt intake will make you thirsty and limited water supply is usually a problem during an emergency."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can trust Mountain House","review":"I just returned from a 3-week trip to most of the national parks located in Idaho, Utah and Arizona.

We did decide to try a couple of meals ahead of time to see how they taste.My spouse had the Beef Macaroni, which tasted okay. I tried the scrambled eggs and bacon, which on other websites received rave reviews. All I can say is, it will have to be a disaster of epic proportions that last several days before I would eat these voluntarily. Yuck!

And this was AFTER letting it dry overnight! Aveeno used to make a WONDERFUL self-tanner, but I can't find it anywhere, much to my dismay.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because after a few times of using the product it seemed like more of it washed off in the shower then actually staying on me.

After I applied my tanning lotion I waited for 4 to 4 hour to get a light tan, I did not what to go form a really white pale guy to a really brown guy, so I did it gradually. AND IT WORKED. Now the next time I'll leave the tanning lotion over night so I can look like a cool Caribbean guy jejeje.

The color is nice but a little to dark for my taste... looks a little fake.Ok then yesterday I was about to apply some but when I put a little bit in my hand it was green. Yes people GREEN! I have tried lots of bronzers, I recommend that instead of this you try the Noxema self tanning lotion (although it has a little not so nice smell) or the Model Co. self tanning spray.Hope this helps and will try to upload pictures about the green stuff that is comming out of the lotion :/"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, works better than all the rest, actually looks natural","review":"I am the husband.

So plan on putting it on at night, sleeping, then take a shower in the morning, and it stains your skin.

It's alarming at first because it's very dark (don't worry--that's just the color guide so you can see where it's going--it washes off when you shower) but it dries evenly and creates a lovely dark medium tan that looks good on my fair skin."},{"rating":"2","title":"This brings out your best!!","review":"This is an awesome product that really works! You don't look yellow or orange (like the oompa luumpas do) but...be sure to wear gloves because the lotion is brown which is a good thing because you know where you have not put enough or too much! It does not smell bad like the others at first, but eventually it does...but do not take a shower right away or it will be all for not! If you have tattoos, you can go lighter over those too!

I applied the lotion on day one. looked a little darker. Than applied on day two and woke up the next morning with little bumps all over my arm. The day went on and i got little bumps everywhere, including my face. the bumps lasted for about 3 days. I have never had an allergic reaction before, but im assuming thats what happened. I want to use it again but am too scared. =( wont be using ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will Work if You Have 2 months to Apply It","review":"I saw all the positive reviews and was looking for something as an alternative to damaging my skin. I agree with the review that said that right after you apply it, you look extremely dark. When you shower in the morning it all washes off. I applied it three days in a row, and barely noticed a difference. Unless you have 2 months to apply this nightly, I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXPIRED!","review":"I was so excited to use this product, as I had heard awesome stuff about it. I was also excited because I'd gotten it so cheap! I had ordered indoor tanning lotions for tanning beds off Amazon before, and they were all fresh when shipped to me. However, I was EXTREMELY disappointed to find that when this lotion came to me, it was already EXPIRED!! It was GREEN. I slathered it on anyway (I was not about to waste the money I had spent), and the color guide turned my body a mossy green tint. The next morning, I washed off, and not a lick of the color (not even the green) had stayed on!! DO NOT RISK BUYING THIS ONLINE. This company makes this product with highly organic ingredients, so its shelf life is only 11 months. It's better to suck it up and spend the money for this tanner, because it's WORTH IT when it's FRESH!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"really 'fake' bake","review":"This product made me look like I had bruises! A $55 order and they wanted a $30 restocking fee. What a crock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fake bake great","review":"I really like Fake Bake. The only draw back is that it's really for the \\"day of\\" if you want to look dark. You must use gloves and rub it in very well, but it will not leave you orange at all. I have enjoyed it and will purchase it again. I also like it has no smell once it is on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased","review":"I was happy with the results, there was no orange tint after.

I'm VERY pale, and have brown and red freckles all over me. Never been able to get a tan, whether from the sun or a bottle. I had pretty much given up and figured I would have to deal with it.I saw this and thought \\"well, the price is right, and its worth a try instead of looking like Casper the friendly ghost\\" But I never thought it would actually WORK.It did. *grin*No orange, like every other product I tried over the years. This was a golden sun kissed natural looking tan. I LOVE IT! No streaking either! It really is pretty much fool proof.Just don't forget to exfoliate really well before you try this stuff, you will be amazed.To all my pale, freckled girls out there...TRY IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a mess","review":"I gave this 2 stars because you can obtain a dark, nice tan for a special occasion.That said, this product is a mess to use. THE GLOVES ARE CHEAP AND BEGAN TO TEAR APART AFTER THE SECOND USE, leaving dark, cancer looking spots on my hands for days.Bottom line, if you are willing to jump through hoops to look pretty for a special party and need instant results, this is fine. Otherwise, use one of the cheaper and more reliable products, like L'oreal. You will achieve the same results over the course of 3 days, minus the mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alot of work for an uneven tan","review":"I used to go to a tanning bed, but fears of skin cancer made me try a self tanner. After reading all the glowing reviews, I decided to try fake bake.

Was willing to put up with smell and light staining of clothes, but just wasn't too pleased with results."},{"rating":"2","title":"works well","review":"Amazed at the color I achieved right away.

Shipment was fast. Gloves come with the lotion. The smell does bother me a little when I sleep but its not as bad as other tanning products I've used. It doesn't make me look orange at all.

I am naturally pale and have a hard time tanning, so I use self tanners to get my glow. I decided to try Fake Bake because supposedly celebrities use it, however I was very disappointed. After two messy applications, I have very little colour as opposed to other sunless tanners I have tried. The lotion smells very good compared to others, but the fake tint is very messy and gets on everything, not to mentioon it stays put in every crease of skin and if you put it on ur face it sticks to every blemish and it gets all over your clothes. There is no way you could put this stuff on any time besides bedtime and then go out, because it would be extremely noticable.Over the last 11 years and trying professional and drugstore self-tanners, I have found the Biotherm SUNTAN Sunless Tanning Milk for Legs and Body works the best. It gives the fastest, most natural colour as well as lots of moisture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Color washed right off","review":"After reading all the great reviews I was so excited to try this tanner. When I first started to apply the tanning lotion I was very pleased because it didn't have the normal self tanning scent that can be very overpowering. In addition, it gave me an instant bronze. I looked like I had just come back from a week long tropical vacation. After years of trying numerous fake tanners, I thought my search was over. When I woke up the next morning and washed the tanning lotion off, all of the color disappeared. Also, I did notice after a few days that it had irritated my skin, which is rare because I have never had any issues with other tanners. If the color had stayed as vivid as when I first applied, I probably would have still given it four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A++++++++++++","review":"Absolutely love it!! But, if you do not use gloves makes sure you scrub your palms. Otherwise, the color is perfect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money.","review":"This makes you look and feel muddy. You have to apply with gloves on because it puts color on you like a stain.(This process is kinda hard if you have anything to do that day, for it takes awhile to apply) It rubs off on your clothes and doesn't tan you that much at all. I recommend Clairins self tanning gel to anyone looking for one which gives you a fast and natural looking tan with deep looking color!"},{"rating":"1","title":".....Disappointed","review":"I expected with how much this item cost and how much they brag about it that I would see better results. I used the product exactly how the directions indicated but didn't see good enough results.( I put it on every day for a week strait and barely saw a tan) Despite what they claim it does not smell good and the smell last longer on your skin than the tan does, even when you take a shower you still smell disgusting. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone, waste of money. Your better off buying the \\"cheaper stuff\\" they do a better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work for me","review":"I dont' understand why this product does not change my skin color at all. I put the product on my face and it looks like I am SUPER tan right away (although sticky) but then I wait 8-10 hours and I wash off the product and my face looks the exact same as it did before I put the product on. I have other product by Banana boat that REALLY turns me tan and I guess I should just stick with that one as it is cheaper and works for me. Not sure if this is a \\"chemistry\\" issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAKE SURE YOU PATCH TEST!!!","review":"I tried this product for the first time and Ive never had any problems with any other bronzing lotions before but I broke out in hives and was in the hospital because I couldn't breath. It's a spray so you I inhaled it as well. Not the safest or best product by far."},{"rating":"1","title":"smelly","review":"I couldn't tell you if it works because it smells so bad, you can't use it. I tried the first day and I smelled all day at work. Then I read the instructions and it recommends that you put it on at night and then shower in the morning. That means you will get it all over your bedding. I would not recommend this product. Very disappointing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed feelings","review":"From my experience with this product I would not purchase it again. I find that it does smell and has a lingering smell after applied to your body. Not unbearable but not the most pleasant. Also it takes very long to try. I read some reviews where others say it dries quickly. NOT the case. The first time I used it i went a bit heavy with the lotion and after an hour I still was not dry. The second time I used it I used a much lighter coat and the product still does not dry fully and smears and stains anything upon touching it. I find that the next day after I use this product it is about 3-4 shades lighter and almost un-noticeable. For facial use - if you have any sort of blemishes use scarcely. This product darkens deeply any sort of blemishes drawing even more attention to them. Overall while this product does provide a natural looking tan with no orange/blotchiness at all, I would not recommend it and will continue to search for a better product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I received fast shipping so YAY to the companyAnd yay to this product, easy and really good!No strange coloration, my bottle smells weird though so one star off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"I used to have to have a friend buy this for me at industry beauty supply stores -- not anymore!

It was just too dark for me. My feet looked horrible. If you have patients & can stand under a light & put it on perfect it would be good I guess, but I don't have the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Bummer","review":"This camera uses a type of electronic focusing where it looks at the image the CCD is collecting and uses contrast calculations to try to guess where to focus. According to the manual \\"the camera focuses at the closest object\\". Well, this is not acceptable. I think the engineers at Nikon were too \\"focused\\" on the cool swivel feature to worry about any type of \\"traditional\\" focusing system. Normally a camera shoots an IR beam at the object, and based on the bounce back, gets the distance, and then focuses based on that. With the swivel head, this camera essentially cannot use that type of focusing. The camera is going back, and I hope Nikon doesn't get hit with an FTC complaint for just how much of a lemon this thing is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"This was to be a camera for my daughter - Good brand, nice features, easy to use, decent price. What a piece of junk. I own several other digital cameras - high end to point and shoot. I could not get this camera to focus more than 1 out of 5 tries. I EVEN READ THE MANUAL!!! Still no better. I tried well lit subjects, high contrast subjects. At the end I just tried to get it to focus on a very patient, non-moving 7 year old. No luck. Maybe I got a lemon, maybe ... I don't know (and likely won't find out). I sent this one back, gave my daughter an old sony. She's happy, I'm happy.... Try something else is the bottom line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixed Bag","review":"I'd actually give the Nikon Coolpix 3500 3.5 stars if I could. It has many features and is capable of producing very good images, but I'm beginning to expect more from a camera in this price point range (~$400 retail). This is a decent option if you plan to use the camera indoors often - the flash white balance and close-range flash exposure accuracy are excellent, as is the Nikon tradition. Outdoors, in difficult light, the 3500 suffers compared to the competition, with poor color rendition and mediocre exposure accuracy. In recent tests in our work group, the 3500 was rated below average overall in comparison to other optical zoom / 3 MP cameras in the same price range. I think the problems with poor color on outdoor shots with significant contrast were its undoing (green tints to a blue sky stick out like a sore thumb). Right now, I'm leaning towards the Sony and Olympus models as the best overall choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera after you learn to use","review":"I went on a trip recently and used my friend's Nikon 2500, after reading the manual and learning the use of the camera our trip was captured perfectly. When I was ready to buy my own digital camera I purchased the 3500 and was very excited when I received it. Hint to most buyers, learn the scene features, the flash settings, exposure and so on. This is not a high end camera for professionals, but if you need a camera for trips or family then I recommend getting this camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is great camera","review":"This camera takes sharp and color saturated pictures. I had the chance to comparewith Nikon 5200 and Cannon G500, both 5megapix cameras. Neither took as gooda picture as this 3.2 megapix gem. Since I broke my 3500, (dropped it off a cliff) the process of looking for a replacement has been dissapointing. I tested the above cameras quite thoroughly.

I wanted a digital camera I could put in my pocket. That I got --and have taken 2,000+ pictures inside/outside, snow/rain forest and have been satisfied with this camera. I have had problems with red eye, but that was easily fixed using the portrait setting where there are flashes before the photo is taken to get eyes prepared. The only thing that continues to be a problem for me is trying to find my subjects in the LCD especially in bright sun. Overall we have been quite satisfied with this camera.Hope this helps"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Nikon ever","review":"I had always though that Nikon brand is one of the top one. How wrong I was...:( This camera is the worst. I own 2 years old Kodac DC3400 2MP and believe you me this camera takes better quality, crisp photos not like Nikon. I could not focus this camera in more than half of the times. The time of flash to reload is a way to slow (you're talking about 3 to 4 sec minimum). The photos of the moving people appears so blury that it seems like I had tryed to shoot a \\"flighing\\" Formula 1 race car on a track. After more than 6 hours of frustraction, I am bringing this camera back to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better cameras out there","review":"I am very disapointed with this camera. The only good thing that I can say is that the camera has a pretty cool swivel lens which allows you to take pictures at all sorts of weird angels. The quality of the pictures are also good.Everything else is pretty bad. Because of the position of the lens, it is VERY easy to get a fingerprint on it. I have many ruined pictures because of this. There is also a red eye problem with this camera. In almost all the pictures that I have taken with the flash on, the people had red eye. Also, there is no viewfinder. Taking pictures at night is a real pain with this camera because all you can see on the LCD screen is black. It can take a few seconds before you begin to see something on the screen, and even then it is very hard to make out what your camera is pointed at.If you were thinking about purchasing a Nikon Coolpix, don't. There are better cameras out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad - except for red-eye","review":"This is the first digital camera that I have ever purchased. The camera is good, except for the problem with red-eye. I read in a lot of sites that this is a problem because the lens is so close to the flash. If you don't mind going to the website or using the software it came with (which is garbage) to fix the red eye problem, then this camera is good. Other than that, I like the camera. It's worth the money and weight (its small). I agree with a few people who say to buy a second battery, it helps a lot!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"This was my first digital camera. I have it for 6 years now. I got it for christmas in 2002. It still works perfectly. I have absolutely no problems with it. I have taken millions of pictures with this camera. As I am very into photography and took classes all throughout highschool as well as now in college. The only thing is that after taking soooo many pictures I did need to purchase a new battery. You must learn how to use a camera correctly before you give it negative feedback. My photographs, both indoor and outdoor got great compliments and prizes taken with this camera.

Okay, I am a slow reader, I must admit. And maybe my reading comprehension level is lower than average. So I make the best with what I have and try to wade through this intensely informative book. The book does make you want to try different setups, to approach sailing differently. But I get bogged down in some of the rhetoric, or what I consider rhetoric. Maybe its just a further explanation I fail to grasp. I find myself jumping back and forth between chapters or pages or even paragraphs in attempt to find SOMETHING more enlivening. The author is obviously a brilliant sailor but sometimes I find brilliance to be boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very specific and helpful: in places.","review":"Because boats vary and conditions like wind and waves change, it is difficult to be too specific about sail trim except for a particular sail on a particular boat under certain conditions. Nevertheless, Walker does give us some very specific advice that I found helpful, and not found in other books on sailing. Some of the information is technical, perhaps too much so, but there is also good practical advice for the racing sailor. Most books on sailing only spend a few pages on sail trim, Walker covers the subject well enough for even the advanced sailor. I didn't rate it the highest because I found some of his ideas not clearly explained."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two lessons learnt","review":"After reading this book, I learnt two important aspects of sail trim which helped improve my racing.1. Tell tails are very important, especially regarding sail twist.2. The positioning of the jib track, whether forward or aft or inboard or outboard is crucial to maintaining speed on a tight reach.Therefore, I am happy with the purchase of the book. I have many other sail tuning books have not transferred any successful ideas to my racing skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of information, but lacking reasoning about why...","review":"The book is filled with solid information about the sail trim. However, I found the book dull to read (despite the fact that I am a keen sailor with a Master of Science in Engineering). The book takes the approach to explain each trim device in isolation. There is plenty of information about each trim device. I could not find any trim device not described in the book. If you want to know everything you can do with the vang, then this is the book for you.The book fails to explain what kind of overall sail trim you want in different situations. There is not a single example starting with a specific situation (like high waves, 2 knots of wind) and then explaining how -- and why -- to use all the trim devices to achieve maximum speed. There is very little information about the interaction of the trim devices."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Engineers...","review":"I have read this book and I will keep it for those moments I want to go to the real deep fundamentals or.... when I cannot sleep.It is a classic and almost required to have in the bookcase but if you want a practical book on trim don't buy this book.

It would also make a difference if the show were a little more consistent but it is not. One minute she's complaining about her daughter (Cheyenne) and her lifestyle or her ex-husband's new wife....then the next she's out contradicting everything she just complained about.

We need more \\"perfect family\\" sitcoms out there that can help encourage us to live the way God meant us to and to strive for perfection. This program only encourages us to do the opposite. McEntire overacts so bad in every episode...but then she MUST always be NUMBER ONE. Lucille Ball is probably turning over in her grave when she hears people compare Reba to her.

This is just my opinion but for some reason this redheaded, overrated, obnoxious singer named McEntire thinks she can act (she cannot act her way out of a paper bag). The first season was made palatable only by her supporting cast. The second season (this one) features a new opening and control freak McEntire using all of her amateurish acting techniques to mug and overract her way all over the place making the others in the cast look bad. Its a show that has gotten progressively worse as the seasons have progressed. I can't believe I allowed myself to be talked into buying this rehashed \\"ROSANNE\\". That is exactly what this show is and it doesn't even merit one star! It is pathetic and unbelievable.

This is not the way it is supposed to be. There are still good, happy families in America, with good, decent standards that are being upheld. Why can't we have a television program that depicts this?

Please check your copy and see if this happens, it is not the fault of Amazon it is a bad transfer to DVD that needs to be fixed. If you need to see this chapter it will go black screen for a short time after the locker scene, and skip to the next chapter. To see the chapter, go backard 1 chapter.

If i knew this at the start, i would never buy this piece of crap...And for Sony, keep on doing dancing robots instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The software brings down the overall value","review":"Though the sound quality and other hardware features are good, I would seriuosly recommend users not to buy this product. The software is such a big hassle that you stop using it as a MP3 player. It is a big pain to check in and check out songs and the user interface of the sonicstage software needs to be improved by leaps and bounds.Besides the discs cost high (5 discs for $8), typical SONY strategy of making money by selling high-priced accessories.You can rather buy an IPOD, if you can afford it, since it has much more value for money. In case your budget is low, any standard mp3 players should do the trick rather than going for the NET MD player from sony."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Player","review":"I just bought this mini disc palyer based on the reviews and I am very happy with it! The sound is great!! The software was easy to install,and the first thing I did was download some of my files onto the disc..that was easy and didn't take long at all.So far I have 26 songs on the disc and still have room for more. There are so many features and options that I haven't learned them all yet. I think the car kit set up is to complicated..just reading the directions made me not want to even bother but I may try it.I felt that you should at least get the optical cable but thats me.I also thought the case was nice,its the kind you can wear on your arm,but I think its to bulky. I would have liked a waist type better.Over all this is a great player and I would recommend to anyone interested in mini disc players."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING!!!!!!!! DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"First of all... This is not an MP3 Player, or recorder. What I mean is, it does not record an actuall MP3 on it. It records a format made by sony called ATRAC3. The software that came with the player is called OpenMG. It is the worst software I have ever used on my PC. Horrible software design, complicated to use the software, freezes up the computer when a file is a bit too large for it, NOTE: I am using a Pentium 4 2.0 GHz with 512MB of DDR RAM, and a 40 GB 7200RPM Hard-disk. This software uses more than 200MB of my memmory!

Too bad it's on clearance at Best Buy, and no other stores in my area had this in stock, so go get it while it's still here! Overall, the player is really neat and a great thing to have if you don't want to carry around a lot of CD's. With this, you can put a lot of your CD's onto one mini-disc-minimizing having to always switch CD's. Also, you can download songs(MP3), erm, \\"illegaly\\" from the most popular sites (Kazaa for example). The only problem is the software: It is a little confusing, but you'll get the hang of it soon. What stinks is that the software only allows you to \\"check out\\" and \\"check in\\" songs. So, if you transfer a Beyonce song onto the player then you are \\"checking out\\" the song. But, in order to not exceed the 3 \\"checking out\\" song limit you have to \\"check in\\" the songs back to the computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT Record!","review":"The product name, \\"Sony MZ-N510CK NetMD Walkman/Recorder with Car Kit\\" (...notice how it says \\"recorder\\"), is very misleading - I would go as far as to call it \\"False Advertising\\" - It DOES NOT have a mic input!I had a Sony MZ-R70 and I was looking to upgrade. I am a student & a musician, and my old MD player worked great for recording both lectures and gigs.The \\"Sony MZ-N510CK NetMD Walkman/Recorder with Car Kit\\", again DID NOT have a \\"MIC INPUT\\" and it was NOT able to record with the microphone plugged into the \\"LINE IN\\".Furthermore, the accompanying software did not allow me to transfer files to my PC that I had previously recorded with my Sony MZ-R70 - it kept throwing back error messages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital Rights Management","review":"The DRM of the supplied software is an impudence: Transferring music from and to the device is restricted to four times either-way.

Even music purchased from RealOne cannot be transferred, though the player is compatible with RealPlayer software. I don't understand the point. The software is cheesy at best, very frustrating at worst. My recommendation is to buy an MP3 player compatible with MS Media Player. I've used these and they are painless and there's no dealing with under funded proprietary software."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good!","review":"I really love this device, it's small, lightweight and easy to carry around instead of a regular cd-mp3 disc. A few things I would have to say that I would like to have seen improvement is the display, if it would light up or something. another thing would be the software that came with it, it sucks. some songs I transfered wouldn't play on the md but when I started using real one player to transfer the songs, it would out perfectly. If you ever pick this, I wouldn't choose any quality setting below a 130, you may not get as many songs on there but I really love the quality of a song and the discs are worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compatible with MP3???","review":"I was under the impression it PLAYED mp3s. After all, isn't that what the idea of compatibility should mean? Well don't be fooled. It CONVERTS mp3s to Attract format.

In the D.C. area, most radio stations are taken making it hard to find an fm transmitter that will work. This has access to stations across the band allowing me to find the best one for my area.

The DLO looks good and I like the features it provides, input jack and charging capabilities. However, the FM transmitter is terrible. My Belkin worked great and I had no problems listening to it on the same stations that I try the DLO. The DLO cannot override the smallest amount of sound on a station. I'm constantly having to change channels and the static on all of them is unbearable. I'm back in the market for an FM transmitter. This thing is basically a charger only, because trying to use it has a FM transmitter is a waste of time and huge source of frustration. Maybe I got a bad one, but based on the product I received I could never recommend this product anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"DLO 005-2120 TransDock micro for the E2xx, C2xx","review":"Before I ordered this product, I consulted the manufacturer of my MP3 player (SanDisk) to verify compatibility with my unit, Sansa E280.

They weren't too interested in resolving the issue, referring me instead to the maker of the TransDock, DLO. Obtaining the correct product information, I emailed VibeCellular with this info and they finally agreed to either replace the unit or process a refund.

There was a constant static sound that was very noticeable at mid volume but was horrible at high volumes. I tried every blank station on the dial but no luck correcting the problem. I live in the Detroit suburbs where there is a station on almost every number on the dial. I believe this was the problem. Also, I use this device on the stock stereo in a Pontiac G6. I don't know if that was a source of the problem or not. I would not recommend this product because of the constant static."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly a PITA","review":"This product was quite a disappointment. Sound quality is poor,there's a constant background hum that rises with the volume, and you need to unplug the player from the device, as well as unplugging the device itself to shut it off. Also,the controls on the player(on-off and volume)don't function when it's plugged in via USB. You need to use the headphone plug instead if you want to turn it off without unplugging everything.All that,and I haven't even tried it with the car moving!I tested it parked in the garage, and was so annoyed with all the problems I haven't used it since.It's not worth the hassle and expense to send it back, so I guess it can lay in the console unless I get desperate for some different tunes.Maybe it will charge my cellphone,though that's hardly worth fifty bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"all static noisie","review":"DLO 005-2120 TransDock micro for the E2xx, C2xxdidn:t work at all to much static everywhere i went."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality for the money","review":"I bought this to replace an Itrip FM transmitter for my Sansa E280 that died after about a year of use. It is of poor quality versus the itrip. It is difficult to find a station that it can overpower and there is always a high level of static even when it is tuned to a frequency with no evidence of local radio station. In addition to the static, it tends to make the bass tones sound like a symbol is going off in the background at certain times and on certain songs (even the highest quality mp3 or wma). It is nice that it includes an auxiliary jack that you can plug other brands into, but the sound quality is too big of a negative. I have ordered another itrip in hopes that it will last longer than a year this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brakes easy","review":"Mine broke after 6 months of use.

Also tried 3 different cars and received the same results in each, even tried moving the audio and USB cables around to lessen this noise but it did very little good. If you are able to get rid of most of the static when parked as soon as you start driving it is there again. The only good is that it works fine as a car charger for the Sansa.Not worth purchasing, buy a Tape Player adapter if you vehicle is equipped with a cassette player or have an audio input jack installed on your car sound system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Transmitter","review":"I've spent many days looking for a suitable transmitter for my Sandisk Sansa E280; with most of the store items being in the price range of $70+ with an unknown customer rating, I needed a little more certainty. I've read a lot of reviews of comparable products and this one stood out above the rest. After ordering through Vanns I was extremely pleased on the speed of the free delivery (less than a week) and the quality of the product was just as I expected. It performs extremely well as long as you spend some time testing out various frequencies. I would highly suggest getting this product as it is not only highly reliable and versitile for other media players, but its ability to transmit high(er) quality audio than its competitors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely functional","review":"I bought this product to use with my iPhone.

In any case, prospective buyers should be aware that they might experience a similar problem if they purchase this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"MI5 Rocks","review":"I got hooked on MI5 last year after a friend mentioned the series to me. I've enjoyed 24 and Sleeper Cell but have found that MI5, with the British accents and intelligent scripts, is even more engaging. Current events and issues are addressed and the writers are not at all afraid to portray things is a very, very realistic manner. MI5 is a more thoughtful, realistic and gritty account of what intelligence officers apparently have to deal with on a daily basis. I think you will like the series a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"BBC Best","review":"MI-5 is a must have for anyone interested in quality television. Knowing anything can happen is a great part of this show's appeal and Volume 3 does not disappoint. A must buy !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MI-5 - THE BEST EVER","review":"I have now been through all 7 seasons of MI-5(Spooks) that are available in the US. I think it's the best spy-action-suspense series of all time. Unlike 24, it is consistently plausible. I say tomyself after every episode, \\"yes, this could happen.\\" There are always surprises and they rarely stretch credulity. And the casting, with all the changes, is remarkable. It seems that what startout as replacements always take you in quickly. The best of the best is Season 7 Episode 7. It rises to the highest level of John LeCarre. Don't miss it! I will, however, always miss Rupert Penry-Jones, who blows up at the beginning f Season 7. He was the most debonair of all the characters. I'm sure he'll go on to leading man fame in the movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect product","review":"Great product for cold weather! I use it on my iPhone.

The problems is, it \\"activates\\" anything I touch as if I had clicked on it. This stinks when I'm just trying to drag something or scroll around. Admittedly, I've only played with it a little (got too frustrated), but so far I can't see any use for this stylus other than as a \\"point and click\\" device -- which means it's basically useless to me. Also, the tip is this very soft, mushy rubber that collapses as soon as it touches the screen. The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because it's possible this thing could be useful for some other device or some other (more patient) user."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality product - BEWARE","review":"I bought two of these and the cedar storage bench - both were mistakes. When I tried to assemble these, two things happened. First, the preassembled sides, apparently with only under-used glue and no screws - fell apart. I had to add glue and provide my own screws to reassemble. In addition, in 1 or 2 of each leg that I tried to fasten the base with the wheels, as I tapped the wheel base into the wood so it stayed in place when you lifted the rolling trellance - the leg(s) split. What poor engineering and quality. Stay away from this company's products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap cheap cheap.","review":"Unfortunately I am talking about the quality, not the price. I ordered four of these and three showed up with broken parts. While the manufacturer was very responsive in sending out replacements, it hardly bodes well for longevity - especially outside where I was hoping to use them. The staple construction is flimsy at best, and the cedar they are using might as well be balsa wood. If your lucky enough to get one with the pieces intact, I wouldn't bet on it lasting more than a season outdoors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kartik Seshadri's Raga Rasa - music making at its best!","review":"This CD is Indian music at its best!

I was appalled at Chambers lack of reality and genuity.Sometimes, when I read stuff like this, I think, if this awful stuff can get published, than so can I. They REPETITIVELY refer to the Anne Frank diary...a nice reference, but superbly annoying when it's talked about over and over again. Jacob simply loves to induldge in the kisses of Peter and Anne, and why Peter held back. Really.I am shocked and galled that this book received the Printz award!!

The main character, Jacob, discovers that his grandfather had cheated on his pregnant wife (Jacob's grandmother)during WW2 and had a child with her. The grandfather, also named jacob, comes across as a decent person though. No one ever knew this untill Gertruii, the women who had his illegimate child, tells relatives the truth after her husband dies and she is termianlly ill. Both Jacob's grandmother and Gertruii still after all these years mourn the death of his grandfather.It is a very emotionally complex story. Jacob discovers things about himself and family that to him are surprising and life changing.I was able to appreciate the story but I didn't overly enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stays with you","review":"This is a book you will not forget. The way in which the book weaves back in forth in time (between WWII and the present) is well-crafted..this is a very difficult thing to accomplish, and only a few writers, such as Connie Willis, have done it well.The principal characters are well developed; the secondary ones (particularly the hero's new girlfriend) much less so.A bit of political correctness detracts from the '40s scenes. Would an anti-Nazi Dutchwoman, on the run from the Germans, really express negative feelings about the gun her companion carries? Would she really say \\"Must you take that,\\" and think snide thoughts about \\"Men and their deadly toys.\\" More likely, she would ask if there wasn't another gun for her. This seems like an importation of '90s feminism into a place where it doesn't belong.Overall, well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Profiles of Courage!","review":"Glad each assemble character had their spotlight episode. In the final scene with the Reaper, real law enforcement would have emptied the gun because a few bullets don't necessarily kill a perp like in the movies or TV. Also, being shot that many times in the chest into a bulletproof vest doesn't stop all the impact and would have cracked or broken several ribs.

It starts at the very beginning , and I am sorry it only goes up to 1966. The chapter on the Non-Partisan League (1915-1923) was the most interesting.

Jack Randall is the caretaker on a ranch of 'spares', full clones of people in the outside world, kept in underground cellars in case their owner needs a part of their body. Dealing with contemporary philosophical issues whilst maintaining the pace of an excellent thriller, Spares deals with the cop, his late wife, hallucinations, gansters, genetic engineering and a droid obsessed with making coffee, Spares has more content and pace than anything I have read before. If complex and intelligent literature appeals but you've not read much Sci-Fi, read Smith."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Loser overcomes all odds\\" fantasy.","review":"This is billed as a \\"noir\\" science fiction thriller, but it's closer to a '40s Mike Hammer fantasy. The hero, a drug addict who can't do anything correctly, including keep his family alive, somehow manages to overcome more obstacles than Hercules and Odysseus combined. It pushes your suspension of disbelief well past the breaking point. There was some novelty, but it wasn't worth the price. The part about the five-mile square flying shopping mall seemed particularly unreasonable."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Snoozer","review":"The only reason I'm giving Spares any credit is for the premise. Unfortunately Smith hardly deals with the Spares, but rather dwells on Randall who is neither engaging nor sympathetic. The spares are just superfluous characters dressing the endless and useless philosophical ramblings and drug sessions of a cop who wasted his life away. The alter universe of \\"The Gap\\" could have been cool, but it takes the reader far too long to get there. Not to mention it is so trite to need a drug to enable your mind to comprehend it. Flying malls that house cities is certainly original, but Smith does not do enough to build his future world. If you eliminate most of the drug trips, and life lessons, you are left with a rather hollow story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A step forward for the band from Baltimore.","review":"Perfect Head starts where Flesh Burns Desire left off and takes Hyper Chyld to a new level of excellence. Fans of everyone from Godsmack to Judas Priest should enjoy this album, although the unique sound and style can't truly be compared to any other band.Songs like Collision and Innocent The Sky have a harder, newer sound while Daylight and Angel Song have a sense of melody rarely seen in todays music. The song Primal Light may be the strongest on the CD, showcasing HC's exceptional vocals, musicianship and writing skills.There isn't a week track on this CD which is unusual for any band.

CPE Bach's music is perfectly poised at the transition between baroque and classical styles. His trio sonatas foreshadow the classical string quartet.The sonatas are interpreted with care and feeling by Les Amis de Philippe, featuring Manfredo Zimmermann playing wooden flute, and Manfredo Kraemer on baroque violin. Kraemer is best-known for his many years as concert master of Jordi Savall's Hesperion XX (and XXI) and Les Concert des Nations.This is music of uncommon beauty and grace. It serves beautifully as laid-back background music, with many felicitous touches to reward one who gives it closer attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"no no no..not Roman","review":"This is the infamous 'Trooper Helm' which has very little to do with Roman helmets of any time period.

I haven't tried to play the computer yet, because most the time we easily have 2 or more playing. For two people, I think this game is a blast once you get the hang of it. The graphics, sounds and commentators are all very good. The way that you control your players seems to be very much in your remote and numchuck and you seem to really have control both offensively and defensively.

Most of this frustration is caused by the manual being horrible at descirbing the required motions with the wiimote.However, once you figure out the controls, the game becomes quite fun. If anything, all you need is good coordination and a good memory to have fun (there are ALOT of different wiimote actions).After you get over the controls (it took me a day or two), you can concentrate on enjoying the game. Slow-motion leaps and dives, 30 foot superman-esque jumps off the wall to steal homers, etc. I've read complaints about the swing being delayed a bit compared to wii sports baseball. My answer? Deal with it! Anyone half good at video games will get used to it almost immediately.

So far I'm quite satisfied with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fun to play","review":"This is one of the most irritating video baseball games I have ever seen. The controls are so complicated to learn and use that the game is just not fun to play. The only reason I can think of that so many people gave this game good reviews is that they played the game on other platforms where the controls were much simpler. The writers of the Wii version of this game got so carried away with the new stuff they can do that they forgot to actually play the game to see if it was fun. Well, I can tell them now to not waste their time. This game is not fun. If this were the only Wii game there was, the Wii wouldn't have sold 5 copies.

I like Wii Sports Baseball better than this. 1st of all, the hitting. Everytime you hit the ball, it goes to center field and you get a single. You can't hit a stinkin' homerun unless you have enough points. The graphics are terrible. Everybody looks the exact same. With the Wii remote, you have to flick the ball to the base you want it to go to. How can you get it to go to 2nd, and not home? YOU CAN'T!!!!! If you purchase this game, you will be dissapointed.

It is technical and it takes a while to get everything down but once you do it's a blast.

Lisa is not annoying at all and believe me I used this tape almost every day of my pregnancy. I even used it the day before going into labor. I especially liked the ab workout. This really helped keep my tummy tone so after I gave birth, it bounced right back into shape. I highly recommend this workout tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to follow with the music","review":"I found this workout to be difficult to follow at times because the people in the video are not going to the same beat as the music. If you don't keep your eyes on them constantly, and let yourself listen to the beat of the music, you will not be synchronized with them the next time you look up at the screen. This gets annoying. The conditioning portion is very good, however, and does not require music. The steps in the workout are a little fast for a pregnant woman who might be a little unsure of her center of balance. I had better luck with some of my \\"regular\\" step tapes, and just left out the propulsion and difficult moves."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little off","review":"After seeing so many high ratings I was disappointed with this video. I don't know whether to step with her or with the music, she is extremely off rythm. She even confuses the girls behind her a couple of times.

Lisa doesn't consider the fact that you are working mirrored to her wich makes it very difficult to keep up with. Also she looks very pregnant on the cover but in the video I don't even think she is. The sound was horrible and annoying her voice has this echoing sound that drove me nuts. I would recommend for everyone beg.to adv. the Kathy Smith Pregnancy Workout and Leisa Hart's Fitmamma both are way better. The only reason I gave this video two stars is because the lower body toning was great. And this might be good for advanced people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too complicated!","review":"I really enjoy step aerobics and was excited to try this pregnancy workout. I am surprised at how complicated the moves are for a pregnancy workout. This workout is much more complicated than my Kathy Smith Step Workout video and the step aerobics community class I took. The instructor goes too fast and does not give enough instruction before going into a new move. With all of the fast turns and diagonal moves, I found myself tripping over the step! This workout seems to defy common sense for a pregnant woman with a changing center of gravity. I think I will save this step workout for after my pregnancy when I am ready for more of a challenge. For now I will stick with more sure-footed pregnancy exercise routines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"I am an avid step aerobics person. This tape is old style stepping, a lot of lunges, repeats, and unfortunately not to the beat of the music. I also found the rythme to be too fast for any step class, let alone a pregnancy video. I would recommend using a regular step video and just modifying it for your pregnancy capabilities. Best of Luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stepping was too much for me","review":"Maybe you won't be, but I was too clumsy to step while I was pregnant.

My doctor told me to ease up a bit on the workouts and forget about squats and lunges which are staples in most of the Firm tapes. So I bought this piece of [junk]. It would take all 9 months to learn the steps. It got my heartrate up, but I would fall behind at every step. Literally. A good brisk walk or run is as good.

After plugging it in, immediately noticed a very strong plastic-like odor. Assumed it would go away after a few hours. Well a few days later and the smell is still as strong and really unbearable in the nursery we put this in. Just read the other reviews for some of the other IQ Air products and saw that some attributed the smell to the V5 filter. Seeing as how this unit doesn't have the V5 filter, it must be something else. I will probably run it in the basement for a few more days to see if the odor works itself out and will call IQAir to see if they have a fix but if not this will be returned and will probably look at the Austin Air purifiers instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it was.....","review":"Up until a month ago, the AP World was worth the cost.

I attached the hinges to the lid, then attempted to attach the lid to the body. Uh oh, here I've run into the same problem as most of the other reviewers --- the pre-drilled screw holes for one of the hinges were off by at least half an inch.

This is anything except \\"easy to assemble\\" as there were two holes predrilled incorrectly, and the interlocking anchors make it quite difficult to re-drill the holes (which I managed to do with some difficulty). In addition, the hinges provided either do not fit the job, or again the specs of this need-to-assemble storage box were off so that you have to cut several corner pieces to allow the top to seat correctly in place. I can say that this is the worst example of engineering thatI have ever seen. Moreover, I had also ordered two of the planter-trellances, which began to fall apart as I assembled it (requiring additional glueing and additional screws just to keep it together). No more purchases from this company for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for.","review":"I opted on this storage chest because I didn't want to spend the money on a teak chest.

We had to purchase new hindges. It arrived with no slated bottom for ventilation. We called the manufacuturer and they are supposed to ship us on one. We'll see if it arrives.

But suffice it to say, that the movie centers around a young man who works at a hotel and is trying to save up enough money to buy a radio. His girlfriend as portrayed by June Allyson is an invalid and he reads her fairy tales. The princes is portrayed by Hedy Lamarr who and the young lad by Robert Walker.

The (I hope unintended) consequence of this is that an adopted child is left wondering why their birth mom is not looking for them. Or maybe she is and she might come take them away? Yuck, yuck, yuck. There are MANY reasons why a birth mother makes an adoption plan. Please read this book carefully before sharing it with an adopted child."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT recommended for adoptive families","review":"I purchased this book because of the many high reviews from adoptive parents. However the first time I read the book to my daughter (who was adopted from Taiwan) was also the last time. I was deeply troubled by the last page which says \\"For finding your mother, there's one certain test.You must look for the creature who loves you the best.\\" I believe the implication of this line is that I, her adoptive mother, love her more than her biological mother does. This is NOT a message I want to give my daughter. I have since gotten rid of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Adoption Story","review":"As the mother of 2 children who were adopted from Russia, I am forever on a quest to find the perfect adoption book. This is the book! Little Miss Spider has been one of my son's favorites books since he was 3...and he's now 6. David Kirk presents a beautiful story and the illustration is incredible. I have purchased this book as a gift for many adoptive families and each family has enjoyed the book as much as my family does. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Pre-reading is essential \\"","review":"As a children's librarian, I was impressed with the beautiful illustrations, thick glossy pages, delightful poetry and script within this story. However, I was a bit disturbed at the message. Specifically when Little Miss Spider was searching for her Mother and found the predator who ate her. I realize that this is the natural order of things in the insect world, but we were wondering if a preschool aged child is ready to deal with these issues. It should be pointed out, that we enjoyed all the other \\"Miss Spider\\" stories and look foward to future publications."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the adopted child?","review":"First the good, Little Miss Spider is a colorful and attractive books for that toddler set, and it takes \\"icky\\" animals and does not demonize them.OK, that being said, Little Miss Spider has a message that was altogether unpleasant for my wife and me. It seems to speak to the children of the world that have been abandoned by their mothers and should seek for love where ever they find it. When I finished reading it, I just added a little side note for my daughter that she need not look other places for love, because she has it here in this family.I don't think that this is what Kirk was shooting for, but it certainly seemed off a little bit to me (and I'm generally pretty open about children books)."},{"rating":"2","title":"We LOVE Miss Spider!!","review":"This book is absolutely beautiful! The illustrations are bright and detailed. The story rhymes and flows wonderfully. We love the story of how Miss Spider met her mom, Beetle Betty. If I were an adoptive mother, I don't know that I'd choose this book for my child though. I think the intent was probably good, but I do think it makes it sound like adoptive children's mothers just run away with no regard for what happens to their children. Of course, we all know that many species of spider die shortly after laying eggs, but this is not addressed in the book, so the reader, as a child, is left thinking Miss Spiders mom just hit the road. I don't really like that message, but I do like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings the show home","review":"This CD allows you to bring the world's famous christmas show into your living room.

I came across Eucerin and decided to give it a try after reading some of the other reviews. I've been using it for about two months and have noticed some 'redness relief'. I also use the Eucerin Redness Relief Daily Perfecting Lotion under my makeup to smooth out the remaining redness. I plan to keep using the cleanser - a little goes a long way and I just need a small dollop to cover both cheeks. The price was also a nice relief since most of Eucerin's products tend to be a little expensive in my terms. So far, this product appears to be worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!","review":"I've been struggling with mild Rosacea for years! Breakouts caused by stress or allergies were driving me crazy; my skin is so sensitive that regular soap does nothing and acne-fiting soap dried it out so much I'd have to use a moisturizer which in turn clogged my pores and worsened breakouts.After using this product for just two weeks I could see a noticible difference. I use it just by itself without the night creme.

Why would they put something like that in a \\"soothing\\" cleanser? Crazy! I wish I had noticed the ingredient list before purchasing and using. The cleanser caused a burning sensation. Luckily I got mine at a local major drug store and could simply take it back.I do like Eucerin products, just not this one. For instance, I like their daily moisturizer lotion with SPF30.

If you are on accutane or have dry skin in general I would stay away from this product since it just irritated me after only 2 washes. Instead I would recommend Cetaphil gentle cleanser and you will be fine. The night creme is a nice compliment if you have dry peeling skin and need relief, but pass on the cleanser.I can't speak for rosacea/acne sufferer's, so I would not deter those individuals from trying this product.

First thing I wanted to do was change the IP address so it coincided with the rest of my network. By doing this the router gets confused and changes to a random IP. It still works with the settings you had in it before changing the IP but you can't connect to it to configure anything else. If you try to use the \\"Access Point Only\\" mode, that doesn't work either and the router stops working altogether. In both situations you have to reset it to factory defaults and start all over.

It's the only thing so far I take away from it. But to their credit they include a base, so I can stand it on end. I can even wall mount it too, but the holes to me seem to be 'backward'.One thing I learned with this hub, is that you DO NOT turn on remote management. I'm on Road Runner, and the administrative functions kept getting locked up by an IP address in the 140 range. It was annoying for a few hours until I figured it out.

I would use IE if I had it, but I am a Linux user, so none of the standards-based browsers that I have will not work at all.I actually found were the bug was, but I can't do anything about.

The trimmer has many adjustments that will allow you to trim a hedge that is up to around 8 to 9 feet tall if you are around 6 feet tall.

On the hedges ~4' tall I make two passes. Very quick. The problems come on the top or backs of hedges when again the house. Then it becomes heavy.

Sure they start getting better this season but this set sucks because there are no special features. There isn't even a greeting from Matt Groening like the previous sets. Honestly this is not the kind of thing we expect from the crew that works on these sets but maybe they were just rushed into doing a crappy release for the 20th season. In that case it still sucks because this is the season they should have celebrated the most with. They should of had so many special features and Easter eggs that you would get tired of looking for them after a while. This is the first Simpson set that I give a bad review to for the simple reason that there is no special features, commentary, or any other great thing like the first sets had. The only good thing about this series is that the episodes start to get good again.JD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on you FOX","review":"Quickly thrown together to cash in on the 20th Anniversary, this \\"collector's edition\\" is a real shame.

The best parts are the special features, the commentaries and the booklet with information about the episodes and such. This had none of those. Its basically just the show on a disc. If that's all you want than great but until now they have all had extras, what happened? Also, because its BD I expected the entire season to be the new high definition stuff, its not. They switched to the HD mid-season. That part is not really their fault, that's when they made the switch but the lack of features, commentaries or quality packaging is completely their fault.

If I had, it would have saved me the trip to the post office to return it. AS others have stated, THERE ARE NO EXTRA'S! NO COMMENTARIES, NO DELETED SCENES, NO REASON TO OWN IT! All of the episodes are available to watch/download somewhere online, so why pay $35 for this?

Full-length commentary on every episode, deleted scenes for most episodes, an introduction by Matt Groening, easter eggs throughout the menu, awesome boxes for seasons 6-12, and other special features.Now, I've only put in the first disk, and watched the first 3 episodes. And wow, what absolute crap in comparison. No commentaries, no introduction, no deleted scenes, crappy menus, boring box, and according to the box, just 1 special feature, a \\"preview\\" of the 20th anniversary special.Seriously, what is this??

I don't really care about the commentaries. I care about the cheap packaging. The discs just slide in cardboard slots. I've taken them out 2 times and they are allready starting to skip. I had to put them into different cases. Now the box just sits here with no discs in it. It'll get thrown to the side to collect dust after while. Also, I don't like the etch-a-sketch look alike pictures that grace the top of the episode selection pages. I always wake-up in the middle of the night to those screens.

I watched them because the commentaries were fun to listen to, I enjoyed hearing about the production and the writers/producers had interesting things to say.

Fox needs to go back to their old style of packaging where you could actually get your disks out with out scratching them up.(post edit)After reading some recent reviews I see that the packaging issue is still there. :(I posted this before in another review the phone number to Fox is 310-369-1000, if you want to call them and let them know how you feel about the packaging.

There's no deleted scenes, no introduction from Matt Groening and frankly it isn't even close to the experience the other collections are.

The only thing other than the episodes is a \\"preview\\" of the Morgan Spurlock documentary that Fox has already aired (although it does have some brief snippets of things that were not in the finished documentary, like Morgan attending an Albuquerque Isotopes game). Also keep in mind that half of the episodes are not widescreen, as Fox did not make the switch to HD until the middle of the season. If you want the full-featured version, I assume you will just have to wait until they get to season 20 in the normal releases...which should be sometime around 2017...assuming they haven't switched from discs to something else (like SDs, or just having everything downloadable)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the love?","review":"I am a hardcore Simpson fan I own seasons 1-12 already.

Like the movie said it is stupid to pay for something you can watch for free. The commentary was the best part and since it isn't there....save your $40 and watch it on hulu or re-runs on fox.

First off, no commentaries; The commentaries are the reason these sets sell because it makes a detail description on the process on how the episodes came to be, both good and bad episodes. Second, no 20th Anniversary feature where the cast and crew discuss on their experiences on working on the show for 20 years. And finally, no intro from Matt Groening; it feels that Groening had no involvement on this release, thus making it an unofficial box set.For those fans who just want to see the episodes and don't care for the features, this set is a must buy.

Hamilton in a while.In this book, Hamilton's lead character has to investigate a series of fires that seem be being set by someone and deal with the \\"Vampire Council\\" (who sort of oversee Vampiric affairs worldwide), who have come into the area, generally looking to assert their influence over the vampires in the area.When I state the plot as badly as that, it might sound a little daft (if I'm honest it is a little daft) but compared to the immediate predecessor books in this series, it makes for a much better read, because it focuses on the story more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uggh! Laurell K. Hamilton has done MUCH better.","review":"I have all the Anita Blake books, and most of them are worn out from reading and re-reading, but this one got one reading, and was tossed.

She is funny, thoughtful and keeps my wife and I intrigued at every point. It is sad, then, that we both feel Blue Moon was a terrible, disappointing book. We have read all her books with rapt attention-could not put them down. This was a major disappointment. The sudden change in personality, moral values,etc. was not in keeping with the character. The excessive,rambling,(and quite frankly, boring) delving into the \\"pack\\" behaviour served no purpose to the plot and left us feeling empty and disappointed. While I could relate to where the author was trying to go, the execution was pitiful. We will purchase the next book, but this one goes in the trash. We sincerly hope Laurell K. Hamilton is not offended by our review; she is extremely talented! I am sure she feels that this is not her best work. Sincerly, Frank & Pam Cannon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Warped sense of humor and fun. Loved it.","review":"Anita Blake raised the dead for a living. She also was granted the title of Executioner. Her ex-boyfriend, Richard, is were. Her current one is vampire, Jean-Claude, Master Of The City. Even Anita did not understand exactly what all that meant.Now the Council is in town. None of those under Jean-Claude or Richard are safe. Anita finds herself surrounded by the pack, the undead, the council, and the human law. It is up to Anita to somehow make all satisified. If that means she has to kill everyone, so much the better. She was not called the Executioner for nothing!***Advance warning here. This series is very gory and detailed. No punches are held back. Anita has a sick sense of humor, but, in my opinion, so do most of us readers who enjoy Horror. I found myself enthralled by this story and laughing at the most unexpected times. Wonderful!***"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping book but disappointed in Anita's choices.","review":"There are few series that have gripped me as much as this one. I must confess there are few books where I want desperately for the author to change their minds. Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time series is one (I actually wrote the author, complaining when he killed off my favorite character). This is another. Please don't dump Richard! I actually had to stop myself from mentally shaking Anita for making the 'wrong' choice. I am anxiously awaiting the next book to see if she wises up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book, in keeping with the series.","review":"I read a review here that said that this one was the dud of the series, and that one might as well skip it completely and go directly to Blue Moon. I disagree heartily! Granted, the supposed main plot, the fires, quickly fade to the background, and I thought the fire man would play a bigger role, but the Vampire Coucil was more important. Plus, it is traditional for the initial case of the book to fade into the background for the bulk of the book, and then pop back up toward the end.Asher was an incredible character, and I really look forward to seeing more of him. I hope he develops well. I also hope for more development of Anita's abilities, which she uses to great success. The wereleopards are going to be important, too.And the council? Well they can be summed up in Anita's words. \\"Incredible power, near eternal life, and they were petty. How disappointing.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Give us something new!","review":"I love the series, like so many others, but have lately felt let-down by the character development, or rather character degredation, of Anita. With Richard it felt like she had a chance at happiness, not the typical marriage and 2.5 kids, but definately not a nose dive into the true human monster, as she seems to be headed to with Jean-Claude. Blue Moon sounds like a big make-up session for them, and I can't wait. Also, I find Hamilton's descriptions of the weres intriguing, and it makes the vampire community boring in comparison. The weres are more like lost souls, looking for comfort, family, love, and understanding, while the vampires (with some exceptions-Willie McCoy, the new Asher, and on occasion Jean-Claude) sound like a broken record - Blood! Sex! Violence! POWER!! are their only words. I'm hoping that Hamilton will Finally tie some ends up and move on to new ones, but overall I still enjoy rereading all the books and will devour the ones to come!"},{"rating":"1","title":"anita blake seems to have done it all already","review":"I love the Anita blake vampire series and have eagerly read every book in the series so far.

It works very, very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to put down.","review":"I have read all of the Anita Blake books and this one is really great. As I started reading it, I was slightly disappointed and thought this book is predictable, but was I wrong.

This book seems like a rehash of the last one. Burnt Offerings was very predictable... a somewhat confused Anita, a tortured Richard, a cool Jean Claude. Change the names of the bad guys, and you pretty much have the same book as The Killing Dance.The \\"mine is bigger than yours\\" confrontations are getting tiresome. These episodes seem to be required every second or third chapter, and in most cases are anti-climatic, or just plain juvenile.I've always looked forward to the next new book, not anymore. I think Anita needs a rest, a long one. Where's Edward when you need him?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A While Ago..","review":"I read Burnt Offerings a while ago...Along with the other seven books whose titles I can't rememeber offhand...I absolutely LOVE Laurell K.

Jean Claude is quite yummy, too bad he's dead. Richard even yummier? Let's see, they are a triumverate, Jean Claude is out of it during the day, Richard is around all the time. They should be able to work something about among the three of them. Perhaps next time. It helps that Richard is at least speaking to Anita again.Yes, one too many plot lines, maybe, but it was very easy to follow all of them. Yes, the leopards need a leader, the Council needed to come into the twentieth century as we are entering the twenty-first, and everyone needs someone. I did miss Edward in this episode, but his Uzi was a nice touch.Keep up the good work. I just got this book from Amazon on Saturday, and I finished it on Sunday.

Is Laurell running out of ideas? Nothing really happens in the first 125 pages. I can only read so much pretentious bragging and threats made by the vampire council before I'm just not scared by them anymore... an neither, apparently, is Anita. Some sloppy editing and writing make this the worst in the series. For instance, Chapter 16 uses the word \\"cool\\" FIVE times in the first paragraph.

Uelsmann shows page by page the surreal imagery of things that don't go together in the real world but are hauntingly combined in Uelsmann's photographs. He wisely stayed with black and white in all of the images because he evokes the dream world or the world evoked by the photographic negative. Color would have competed with his imagery too much. You see a woman's body floating above the water or combined with the roots of a tree or water running backwards as a person emerges from the sea, to name just a few of his works. These are all fantastic combinations and he must have spent grueling hours in the darkroom achieving these photographs.

At less than a hundred-fifty pages, the prose and pacing make it feel twice as long. I can deal with a plot-less story if the characters are interesting and well developed. Sadly, one never gets to know them at any depth. Okay, perhaps a terrific ending will make up for it. It turns out the ending is nothing more than a set-up for a second unwritten book.

Best songs are Psychosilocybin, Hilikus, Medium and You will be a hot dancer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now that Incubus's new \\"aclotm\\" came out....","review":"This is for people who are new to Incubus from their new album. Fungus Amongus is a classic in terms of change.. A Crow Left of the murder nearly a decade later is far more musically sound than Fungus Amongus. So if you are thinking about purchasing this album based on A Crow Left of the murder or Morning View i suggest you check out the incubus official site first to take a listen. Fungus Amongus is a very fun album to listen to. A lot like Primus or old Chili Pepper music but its just not fluent or well done. I recommend it because it, if in the right mood, is a real fun album. \\"Take Me To your leader\\"is actually good. The rest are nice but only if in the mood to chill out and listen to some choppy funk rock. Id first buy SCIENCE which is well done and an awesome album. If you enjoy SCIENCE then go on and buy Fungus Amongus as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cosmic fungus and funk","review":"The first thing to be said, and it seems most of the other posts mention this, is that Fungus Amongus is not for everyone. It very much depends on your musical persuasion. If you have 'Make Yourself', i suggest you check out track 10 (think its 10) the instrumental funky track, that is a similar style to that used in Fungus Amongus.Personally i think the earlier Incubus stuff is the best. I was lost for words listening to this album. It is amazing, the vocal ,the instruments, the whole album is brilliant and i really enjoy listening to it.I advise you get it NOW,Let the Fungus Amongus!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incubus is the best band ever!","review":"I own every Incubus CD I can get my hands on.I even spent $25 for the Fungus Amongus Cd which is a great CD.If you want something to listen to and have fun listening to Incubus is your best choice.I have to say out of all the bands I've listened to Incubus is my favorite.They mix a blend of great lyrics with great music.They write some of the most influential lyrics I've ever heard.You can understand were they are coming from and have fun listening while doing it.If I could go past the 5 star mark on to my own scale I'd most likely put this CD and every other Incubus CD at 10 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good cd","review":"This bands' talent is amazing. They wrote a lot of these songs when they were 16 years old and they also got signed on to record label at 16. If you want to here really good slap bass playing, this cd has it, especially the song \\"speak free.\\" This cd has a good combination of funk/metal and jazz/rock. But don't expect to hear \\"make yourself\\" or \\"morning view\\" type of stuff on this because it's completely different. It shows how much these guys have evolved as a band. Just buy it and listen to it with an open mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"kick arse album","review":"I fell in love with Incubus when science came out and I loved that album, but every album after that got slower, less hard, and more lovey dovey. Thankfully, I found fungus amongus, and holy cow does it rock!!!! If you like albums like 311 music, and urge's receiving the gift of flavor, you're going to love this one. They have an early chili peppers sound, but it its still distinctly incubus, and it rocks from start to finish.~trippel"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"this album is definitely different from the newer stuff that incubus has put out but i think its even better than Morning View- it's one of those cd's you have to get up and dance wildly around your house to- some of the best songs are \\"you will be a hot dancer\\", \\"sink beneath the line\\" and \\"Trouble in 421\\" (which by the way stands for the day after 420 when they're all wasted)- id definitely recommend this album to any REAL incubus fan, its genius!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best incubus","review":"in my opion thsi is the best icubus cd available. this cd is a great combination of funk, jam music, and metal on the market. production valuie is not fantastic, but the content of the music is not lost at all. pick up this cd, if u need something to groove to (great for stoners too)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Best CD","review":"I got this CD when it first came out and I have yet to hear an Incubus album that outdoes Fungus Amongus. I do enjoy their newer CDs as they show progression, but this one takes the cake. This CD is great not just for hardcore fans but for most everyone. The only exceptions are people who dislike funk and metal and people who dislike good music. But most people with good musical taste should love this CD. As a musician I appreciate this CD ten times more than most people probably would though. It is amazing that these guys wrote such complex music in their teens. I also like this album best because there is more soloing for every instrument and there is no DJ. On their newer albums Incubus uses less complicated songwriting and weird effects, which is OK but nothing is as cool as a killer guitar solo. A must have...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"You're probably looking at this right now and thinking I don't like Incubus at all but I do, and it pains me to write this review. I am very glad that their sound evolved. This CD is like a bad mix of the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Primus. So there are some funky beats but that donsn't make up for the simplistic lyrics and boring guitar parts. They don't have the DJ here so that also so brings it down. So the lyrics in the first song are kinda funny, that's it. I actually fell asleep listening to this. How sad is that. That has only happened once before and that was just because I hadn't gotten to sleep till two that night. I hate to say this but this is close to the worst CD in my colection (the worst isn't even in my room anymore and this was close to it). I only still have this because I want to have the entire Incubus collection. Sorry Incubus but this CD is just plain bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Self Proclaimed Music Man 689.","review":"Wow. Someone took my review a little personally. Difference of oppinion is the fabric of America. Don't be so insecure, and please don't bore me with your personal oppinions about me. I just didn't happen to like the CD. Big deal. After reviewing your reviews, it's pretty obvious that you don't have a very diverse oppinion about anything, but that's o.k. You can look up diverse in the dictionary. 99% alternative. For the record, I did listen to it. Unlike yourself, I wasn't trying to be cool by dogging it. Just that comment tells me that you're young and immature. Don't take things so personally. What did you do, sleep with the band? Maybe you can discuss it at your next therapy appointment. Relax, you'll be o.k. and everything is fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"This sounds like it was made ages ago in some loser's basement. 1 flippin' star!!","review":"And it almost pains me too because Incubus is my absolute favorite alternative band. I don't know why Brandon decided to choose this approach, and I'm not surprised that this CD got anything but mainstream attention. It's a shame really.What a freakin' waste of precious talent. And when he tries to rap, he instantly fails. I'm glad they polished their sound as they went along.This CD has no good tracks, and their next release only had one (Summer Romance). So they gradually improved, and hit their hiatus with Make Yourself.Light Grenades overall is a head-scratcher. But Dig is a rock classic in my eyes.Have a great night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dear Thadius from Seattle","review":"If you listen to hundreds and hundreds of CD's, you would be smart enough to know that this is not a follow up to Make Yourself. This is actually their 1995 debut album which was re-released in 2000 (which is actually awesome, if you didn't like this I don't know how you like Make Yourself. But, what do you know, you probably haven't even heard this CD, you were probably trying to be cool by downing them)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chicken ? wheres the CD!!!","review":"I got a cd and instead of a cd coming out, a chicken came out instead !!! Oh well Merry Christmas"},{"rating":"2","title":"An extremely fun funk/metal album","review":"Fungus Amongus is actually where i started with Incubus, and have gotten the pleasure of watching them continually re-create their sound over the years with each album. This album is very much in the essence of Mr.Bungle, Primus, and Snot. I personally love that sound, if you're expecting Morning View or the like, this is definately leaps and bounds away from that sound. I honestly dont understand why people feel a band should carry the same sound with every album, and if they dont people think the album is bad. This is an amazing funk/metal album, know that that is what youre getting, and keep an open mind - this album is loads of fun to listen to. If youre a fan of the Mr.Bungle sound, then this is a great album to buy even if youre not a big fan of the more recent Incubus albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funk it up","review":"I am a diehard Incubus fan and Fungus Amongus (Fungus Among Us) as the root of all incubus is a sneak preview of how genious Incubus is and how smart they were about life as teenagers. The lyrics in fungus Amongus define what they are all about right now. If your heart and soul goes out to this band and you have an open mind you will see the beauty in the music as well as the lyrics, i think when Incubus say that they are somewhat disappointed in this album, it goes to show that they have learned QUITE a bit since then and are being modest about this all out CREATIVELY BOLD album. People that bash on this one need to listen to it with a different set of ears. Thanks, ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just another Amazing Incubus album","review":"I really think that any real incubus fan has to have this album. It's funky..and is really different than make yourself or morning view but still it shows Incubus' unique talent and ability to stay true to themselves. I think the new album 'a crow left of the Murder' will be closer to the old stuff, and will attract alot more of the old fans that were turned off by Morning View, but I don't think Incubus will have anything to worry about because the fans that are just into the MTV stuff will keep listening as long as Brandon keeps taking his shirt off. I'm not sayin that I don't like Morning View or Make Yourself, but if you put all the albums together it really shows Incubus' diversity..And for all of those people who said they didn't understand Formula 421...It's talking about living in a '420' world and how once you enter 42--1 it's not good anymore....Get it??"},{"rating":"2","title":"The fungus was amongus a many a year ago.","review":"If you're looking for something completely different, something hard, yet funky, pick this up. If you're looking for a mellow Incubus go with the first half of Morning View and Make Yourself. This is hardcore funkin' slap-happy stylin' like a corncob in the spot dilly-yo album. You also gotta remember they're younger and this is all most likely jams that they made up, just having fun, and wha do you know, they can actually play their instruments. Good show by young Incubus, worthy of the ten bucks. WARNING: Not Incubus pop like \\"Drive.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Kreachun of Incubus ;)","review":"Yes, sadly enough people are still reviewing this CD. This CD is will only prove what I'm sure we have all suspected about Incubus. They had to start somewhere :P These guys had great ideas from the start. The problem I found with this ever so early music, is that it sounded like everyone was adding their own flavor to the band. The guitarist was doing his own funk thing, while the bassist was doing his whole jazz thing, and so on. This is why songs like \\"Trouble in 421\\" and, \\"You will be a hot dancer\\" stick out in my head. These were a couple of the songs where it seemed like the band came more together than others. And once that happens, Incubus becomes, Incubus."},{"rating":"1","title":"for big-time incubus fans only","review":"I'm a fairly hardcore incubus fan, and if you're new to the band, don't get this album first. Get ANY of their other albums. This is all early stuff, and even Brandon Boyd (the lead singer) says on the CD jacket that this is pretty low quality music."},{"rating":"1","title":"heard it didnt like it","review":"i enjoy incubus they are a talented group but from hearing this it sounds like its written before they learned how to play there instruments properly.its way too intense even most metal heads would probably be a bit intimidated.fungus amoungus is an example of when something becomes so heavy its unlistenable.it sounds more like korn than incubus.in fact it reminds my of system of a downs debut (a much better album) just alot more intense and no real pause for melody ok theyve shown ability in creating something so intense and unlistenable but its just like people who want to go to see a guitarist who can play really fast for over an hour. i like incubus but all there other work is much better than this morning view make yourself science crow left of the murder this dosnt even compare to them i gave it to stars because the song shaft sounds like it could of been a filler of science and i like incubus but steer well clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only nessicerry if your are an actuall fan","review":"Ok, I am a really huge Incubus fan. Seriously I am, but I can't see how people could ever rate this 5 stars. It's there demos from the age range of 15-17 years old, and you know that they are gonna have really bad production. Production is a main thing in a cd that is going to be good. If Incubus themselves intended this one to be good, they would have done something to it.
