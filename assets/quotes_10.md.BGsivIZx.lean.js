When my friend gave it to me I was rather excited because I love almost all of pauls earlier work, and have constantly preached that he was much better without Garfunkel. This CD proved me wrong, however, as I was disgusted by track after track. The song \\"old\\" showed promise at first, but soon became bland and repetitive. The rest of the CD is not worth even talking about, as it can be summed solely with the word awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply disappointing","review":"I've been a passionate Paul Simon fan from his early work w/ Garfunkel to the present, but this is set of songs is his weakest work possibly ever. Paul Simon has created so much beautiful music and brilliant lyrics over the years, but this set is just not up to his former standard. It's like he was on cruise control and just put something out, without thinking much about it or trying very hard. With the exception of 'Love', which is wonderful, the songs are weak and uninspired. The lyrics are annoying, preachy, and, especially on 'Pigs, Sheep and Wolves', badly sophomoric. I hope this CD doesn't show that he's lost his musical genius, and that his next CD will be a return to former greatness, but I now have my doubts. I'm getting rid of my copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious and self-absorbed","review":"Why is it that comedians feel they must make a \\"serious movie\\" and pop singers feel they must comment on \\"life?\\" Guilt at their easy life, for doing so little perhaps.Simon whines and opines about his life, and ends the recording with an attack on police (pigs) and, I suppose, understanding for the predators that mar our social landscape (wolves, \\"never did no harm.\\")The sixties were a virus, not a flowering. Here is another dose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to it 10x before you judge","review":"Paul Simon amazed me again with an album that should be placed on a pedestal that reaches the heavens. In this album, Simon is more obviously the driving force behind the music, but it also keeps much of the African and South American tones of Graceland and Rhythm of the Saints. Thankfully, Victor Nguini is present on the album--he is guitar's posterboy of understated guitar work genius. Like Radiohead, Simon's last few albums are not catchy, but grow on you more and more everytime you listen to them. Even if you hate the music of this album, you should buy it just for the lyrics. Peaceful as a Hurricane Eye is one of the most amazing songs, lyrically, I've ever heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Long Time Coming - A Short Time Gone.","review":"If, after a dozen years or so, this is all that Paul Simon has to say then it would have been best if he had waited another decade before attempting a new album. If he's all done then so be it. He's made remarkable music all of his life, the kind of soul catching music I grew up on both simple and complex-always memorable, engaging songs with which I can mark my own life. Unfortunately this new album is a once great fighter, dressed up like an indian chief, sadly dancing circles in the ring - not pretty, not memomorable and not worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, not prime Simon","review":"You're The One is not growing on me with repeated listenings- and I'm really trying to find the jewels. Frankly, Mr. Simon sounds somewhat dysphoric. Folks, Capeman is truly THE under-rated Paul Simon album. I would have loved to have had the opportunity to see the show (I've been listening to Reuben Blades and Marc Antony for years). If you feel the need to pick up a recent Simon album, get Capeman."},{"rating":"1","title":"short shelf life","review":"As has been pointed out ad nauseum, this record's various virtues are not readily accessible; they do bubble to the surface eventually. The problem is that its many obvious faults never disappear, and in a short while one tires of the whole thing, virtues as well as faults, baby as well as bath water. Simply put: you shouldn't have to work this hard to enjoy a product this perishable.I like little bits of lyric here and there, but not any whole songs--\\"The Teacher\\" comes closest, I suppose. I hate \\"That's Where I Belong\\". I like the \\"release my fists at last\\" line in \\"Quiet\\", but consider the rest of its lyric--as well as its music and noise--rubbish. \\"Darling Loraine\\" rambles; \\"Love\\" never quite comes together; etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dramatically Underrated Album","review":"This album is brilliant. Listen to it again if you put less than 4 stars, serioiusly..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time For The Dog Track?","review":"I even enjoyed much of the Capeman CD, so I have a high tolerance for Paul Simon's quirkiness. Having been a fan for as long as I can remember, I've come to expect certain things from Simon: craftsmanship, evocative lyrics, and experimentation. This CD sounds as though he thought up some \\"profound\\" non sequiturs, plugged in the drum machine, looped some acoustic guitars, and cashed the check. Maybe Simon realized that he didn't have the vocal chops any more (no crime at 50-something) to carry off his trademark well-crafted three-minute pop songs, so he simply decided to go through the motions and retire. I hope I'm wrong, but sadly, something tells me I'm right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Simon","review":"Simon has written a very good album here. The songs are solid lyrically and musically. \\"Darling Lorraine\\" is one of the best melodies he's ever written and the lyrics will have a profound effect on you. What's beautiful about this album is the way the songs complement each other. Very well done. If you're a Paul Simon fan check this out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too little, too late","review":"These songs are only great if you were born after 1980. Paul Simon wrote his best songs before 1970. Everyone knows it. Buy Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme instead. PLEASE!!! Paul Simon's long-term reputation depends on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sad Follow-Up To \\"Graceland\\"","review":"I've listened to Paul Simon's music for decades, but this CD just isn't the Paul we've all learned to love. After the upbeat, unique style of \\"Graceland,\\" I was expecting another fresh, new approach -- Paul's latest bright idea. Instead, I got a CD full of sadly (not badly) sung music, with an overriding theme of feeling one's age in a negative way and an odd \\"I got religion\\" undertone. Yes, we're all experiencing the aging process, but not all of us what to hear it moaned at us by one of our favorites. Sorry Paul, we love you, but you should have kept your mid-life crisis and religious beliefs out of the recording studio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like some of music history's other notable duds","review":"This album reminds me of Bob Dylan's \\"Under the Red Sky\\", The Band's \\"Islands\\", Paul McCartney's \\"Wild Life\\", George Harrison's \\"Dark Horse\\". The voice and sound are those of a great artist, but the songs are so slight, so unmemorable, that it is a tremendous disappointment. Still, the loyal fan listens on, hoping for some glimmer of hope, but alas, none is found. Repeated listenings only confirm the first impression. Ultimately the album is placed on the shelf, to be listened to about once every 10-15 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Verses out of rhythm, couplets out of rhyme","review":"What happened to the great Paul Simon? The guy that made all of that timeless music in the '60s with Art Garfunkel? The guy that made one of my all-time favorite albums \\"There Goes Rhymin' Simon\\"? The guy that created \\"Graceland\\"?Simon has written more than his share of great tunes, and has turned out plenty of good albums. This is definitely NOT one of them.He sings flat and out of tune, the songs have little to no melodies to speak of, the lyrics are just a bunch of pseudo-intellectual but ultimately nonsensical ramblings for the most part, and Simon just sounds like he's had it.This is weak, weak, weak. Considering other fairly recent failures such as \\"The Capeman,\\" and the fact that both his voice and his imagination appear to be shot, it might be time to call it a career."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a masterpiece","review":"I'm afraid I have to agree with the former review in giving this album a poor rating. Basically this is embarrassing to listen to and I think I can rate myself among the fans of Paul Simon. I hate to say this but every time an artist \\"listens\\" to the critics of a particular album and decides to give them what they want, the result is disaster. An artist shouldn't listen to anybody and just record what he or she thinks is best. I'm oneof those who thought the capeman was pretty good. Compared to this it was a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I am a big Paul Simon fan and consider him one of our great songwriters. But I was extremely disappointed with this album. The album sounds great musically. The rhythms are a feast and the production and instrumentation are great. The lyrics are thoughtful and interesting although sometimes a little cerebral or silly. The songs,however,lack catchy melodies. I don't think there is a single song on the album that has a memorable hook. One of Simon's strongpoints has always been that his songs had strong hooks. Graceland, Hearts and Bones, Rhythm of the Saints are some recent Simon albums that are brimming over with songs with great melodies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't run any more","review":"His last album (if you ignore Capeman, which most would consider kind), Rhythm of the Saints, began with the line 'Can't run but I can walk much faster than this...' and many thought it summed up an album of gentle, pleasant underachievement. Paul Simon's pace now seems to have slowed to a crawl - this album is like Hearts and Bones with a tinkling of African guitars and cheap-shot lazy lyrics (reminiscent of Loudon Wainwright III) - but without the standouts like Train in the Distance and Rene and Georgette Magritte that made Hearts and Bones a truly wonderful, if flawed, work of art. Well, people get older, they get a little set in their ways, a little boring, and they start thinking that Uillean pipes are a good idea (cf Van Morrison). Not one song in particular is really worth mentioning. I just hope he plays some of the old tracks on his UK tour!"},{"rating":"1","title":"yikes","review":"I'm sure there are quite a few people here who can't tell that Paul Simon is singing flat on this record (not consistently, but often enough). I don't expect everyone to be able to--just the ones setting themselves up as musical authorities by submitting reviews.And while I'm at it: \\"begging the question\\" DOES NOT mean \\"asking or eliciting a question\\". It means proving by assuming the thing you want to prove is true. It is a particular kind of error in reasoning logicians call petitio principii, a material fallacy of presumption. Review \\"You're the One\\" favorably or unfavorably, but please stop abusing this phrase."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"With the part of me that hurls\\" - I give it 1 star","review":"I'm a Paul Simon fan and I couldn't believe how bad this CD was. The lyrics range from the banal to obscure. One of Simon's faults at a lyricist is occasionally letting his delight in wordplay get away from him. In other words, he can become too clever for this own good. This CD has that in spades. Consider the following \\"gem\\" from Darling Lorraine:So I walked upright up to herand with the part of me that talksI introduced myself as Frank.\\"With the part of me that talks\\"? Yeah, whatever you say Paul. Musically, it's pretty drear and uninteresting. If this was done by any other artist it would be tossed aside quickly. Forget this CD and put on \\"Still Crazy ...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound of Silence would be nice","review":"This is the worst CD that I have bought this year. The only reason I rated it 1 star is that you don't offer fractions. It would have got a .5 then. It is very obvious that Paul Simon has nothing to say anymore. It's tired, monotonous and painfull to listen to. This CD should be replaced as torture instead of the Chinese torture technique."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money!","review":"Listening to this album is painful. Having been a fan of his music, this album is extremely disappointing. Now I'm just trying to figure out how to get rid of it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Paul's Pap","review":"It's obvious from Paul Simon's work on The Capeman to this tossed-off, half-finished piece of hackwork that he has an utter contempt for his fans and American music fans in general. There isn't a single memorable melody here, the lyrics aren't clever in the least, the production is laughable, and the entire project has a \\"let's just get it over with\\" feel that's the most amateurish sound I have EVER heard released by a major record company. Paul Simon now joins Chuck Berry as major artists who are just sailing along, picking up dimes along the road, not caring whether the performance is good or bad...and that really hurts. Here's where Simon joins folks like Peter Paul and Mary as artists who once seemed important, but who, after their true skins were exposed, weren't really major stars at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for the kids - at bedtime!","review":"I play this one for my son at bedtime a lot. Listening to it puts him right to sleep! I've listened to it a bunch of times now, and it doesn't grow on me. It is a dull work. I hope Paul can come through again with great music, but this is not the disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paul Simon is getting old","review":"This album is terrible. It is about being old or about aging. Perhaps that is what he himself is going through, but as a younger listener this is not interesting, and I doubt it is to most of his older listeners.After 2 great albums in a row (Graceland, Rhythm of the Saints) Simon has gone downhill, and that is to put it nicely. You're the One, and Capeman are terrible, and it seems like Paul Simon may finally have run out of good songs.There is one song on here that is actually catchy, and I kind of like it. Oddly, Old is the song. It kind of fun, and takes a more light hearted look at aging than a lot of the stuff here.Avoid this, it is not worth your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother Buying","review":"I found this collection to be nauseatingly self-referenced and ultimately a bore. I actually couldn't listen to each song all the way through. I gave it away to another Simon fan and she gave it away as well. There is one song with some banjo music which peaked my interest briefly but other than that, this music is horrlbly unlike any of his other attempts to entertain. I still regard his first two solo albums and \\"Graceland\\" to be his best. Paul, you're NOT the one this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was he thinking????","review":"I've bought every record Paul has ever made, many as LPs, then tapes, then CDs. I've never been disappointed by him before. I can't find a single song on here that I want to hear again. I don't know what he's trying to do. The rhythms don't work, the lyrics are bush league, and his voice sounds tired. I've bought worse CDs, but not by an artist that I have so enjoyed. I hated this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album from one of the best -","review":"I found Simon's latest offering a tremendously entertaining and moving collection of songs. While I'm hardly an expert on his entire body of work, and don't presume to hold this up to what is regarded as his best, I find even his most pedestrian efforts to be the work of a master songwriter/singer, and this album is far from pedestrian. \\"You're The One\\" seems to find Simon in an enormously introspective time in his life, and he deftly addresses life, love and mortality with equal amounts of wit, whimsy and poignancy. I'm lucky if a CD gets more than two or three listenings in my house. This one has been on heavy rotation for a few days now, and that passes my criteria for a real gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever Happened to Rhymin' Simon?","review":"Another weak effort by Paul Simon. I was excited when this talented composer/performer released \\"Capeman\\", especially since it had been so many years since \\"Saints\\", only to find that the tunes uninspiring and dull. Unfortunately, this new CD isn't much better. Gone are the rich melodies that Simon is famous for, replaced by a sort of odd, chatty, \\"white mans rap\\" that I found boring and lifeless. I'm just glad that I didn't purchase a ticket to his upcoming concert."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's the one all right!","review":"This one's an all-out, start-to-finish winner. Paul's back in fine form. And it is a return to some of his older pre-world beat sounds without abandonning those sounds entirely, which works remarkably well. It's nice to hear some other sounds we haven't heard in Simon's music for some time creep in as well -- banjo and pedal steel, celtic pipes. Lyrically, this one may be Simon's most enigmatic -- but that should only be troublesome to those who don't enjoy enigmas or mysteries and have to be bashed over the head with it before they get the point. There is meaning and depth here along with the usual impeccable Simon production, singing and writing. I could go on at length, but won't... I'll end with one comment on the song Old -- this delightful and playful little ditty (and that's what it is, nothing more) may well be the best song yet written for and about those of Simon's generation -- the baby boomers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless at best, Painful at worst...","review":"The worst case scenario: My cat has a \\"soft\\" claw covering embedded into his paw pad.

The paws last at most 6 weeks, some fall off much faster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea.... just doesn't quite work","review":"I bought this product out of desperation to avoid getting my 4 year old cat declawed, after moving in with a significant other. After reading the other reviews I thought that it was worth a try. Unfortunately, this product didn't work for my cat. The first few hours, maybe even the first day, the product worked suprisingly well. After that I was finding claw cups all over the house. He would hide out somewhere and chew until he could get one off.... and no amount of glue will oustand the persistence of a mad cat. What really turned me off of this product is when I found a claw cup on the floor with an entie nail. The product had become irritating enough for my cat to perfer ripping his entire nail out of his paw, claw cup included. If you are in a desperate situation then give it a try.

Dr. Close bases this book on fact, but for the sake of interest, combined some characters and filled in some holes in the story with what he believes happened. Since he was there, nobody can argue the facts. The book does not give any technical information on Ebola and how it works and how it is stopped.

So there is a lot of discussion for us, but we are enjoying the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A word gardener sampler","review":"Gary Snyder's power appears to come from mountain, meandering and meditation. In this thick sampler we visit his life to age sixty-eight through notes, prose and poems. The soil of his writings range across a fire lookout station in the Cascade Range, a Japanese Zen temple, the engine room of a Pacific freighter, an audience with the Dalai Lama, work and climbs with Ginsberg, Kerouac, Lew Welch, and Nanao Sakaki, travel in Botswana and Zimbabwe with his sons. The essence of his power is nature. \\"Nature is not a place to visit, it is home-and within that home territory there are more familiar and less familiar places.\\" Two sons, one Pulitzer, many other awards so far. He writes, he reads, he teaches. One hopes that he never tires of planting words in the soil that is us. If there are any legitimate Earth heroes, Gary Snyder is one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Japhy Ryder Lives!","review":"Like many readers, I was introduced to Gary Snyder as the character \\"Japhy Ryder\\" in Jack Kerouac's novel, \\"The Dharma Bums.\\" When I found out that \\"Japhy\\", who is one of Kerouac's most memorable characters, was based on the poet Gary Snyder, I had to read his works.This collection of Snyder's prose and poetry is an excellent introduction to the works of a man I now consider a national treasure, not just for his literary works, but as an environmentalist and natural philosopher. His prose is inspiring, revealing the ethics of a man who practices what he preaches, and his poetry is exhilarating both intellectually and spiritually. His translations from the Chinese are rendered in such a way that they are easily accessible to western readers.I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in Snyder's works and Beat literature in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over the Hedge : Stuffed Animals","review":"This big book of comics was very, VERY funny!

Keep 'em coming!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fires are Burning!","review":"The third album by Blackmore's Night was worth waiting for. My personal favorite on this album is \\"Hanging Tree\\", a song with beautiful music and well written lyrics. The cover of Dylan's \\"The times they are a changin'\\" is done with a Medieval flair. The mpg video of the Dylan cover was entertaining. (Did I actually see Blackmore smile?) All in all, a great effort that proves that the master still lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply a MUST!","review":"Like many people here I found out about this by sheer accident... In fact I had never even heard about Blackmore's Night until today. I was looking for something else and happened to stumble across this. I was never a HUGE fan of Ritchie's, when it came to him I tolerated him to hear \\"DIO\\". I thought he was a competant musician but never understood why he was placed in a \\"guitar God\\" status, well, now I know don't I? The pairing of he and Candice is a magic that cannot be fully explained. The song \\"Hanging Tree\\" is so stellar I nearly shed a tear. It is written in a sort of 3rd/1st person perspective and gives you an idea about what the tree has \\"seen\\". But the way the lyrics wind throughout are BREATHTAKING! Out of the 16 tracks, 10 are AMAZING, 3 are interesting, and 3 are fluffs. If you've grown tired of headbanging bar chords look no further, that bar is closed here. Indeed, Times They Are A-Changin'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly stunning!!","review":"A few weeks ago, I heard Blackmore Night's version of \\"The Times, They are a-Changing'\\" on Tampa's wonderful, listener-supported community radio station. I was absolutely floored by the song and had to hear more of that startlingly beautiful voice. The fact that I love medieval and Renaissance music and had not heard of these folks also surprised me. Further research found that they have been big in Japan and middle Europe. Whatever. . . I immediatly bough this disk as well as \\"Shadow of the Moon\\" and have listened to nothing else since. Both the vocals and instrumentals are knock-outs!!And, as a listener of Deep Purple and Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow in the 60's and 70's, I was both surprised and pleased to hear what Ritchie is up to now. I consider it a fantastic career move and hope he stays with it forever!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not my cup of tea","review":"well I have to admit that if a band always sounds the same then it would be a very dull world. The reason I start with that is because the reason I fell in love with this group was for the medieval/olden times sound that they often create. This CD has a few songs on it that capture that old time Medieval/Minstrel sound and it is delightful. Although the rest of the album's offerings are good, there is a lot of electric guitar and a certain \\"pop\\" music sound as well. It just didn't have as many songs that made you feel you were at a Ren fair. Oh well. They are still a great band, this just won't be one of their CD's I listen to very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful","review":"The information is so informative.

It was written like one of those overbearing e-mails you get with lots of capitalized and bolded text. Though studies were referenced, sources were often not clearly or properly cited. The flow was also confusing and the book lacked specific recommendations (e.g. although there is a whole section on protein and the importance of consuming enough, there are no recommendations on what amounts of protein are appropriate). With some competent editing support, I think this book could have been much more compelling and effective. Essentially, I support the intent of the book, but I didn't find it to be effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but more advertisement type of book","review":"Interesting but more advertisement type of book.

He hasn't sacrificed any of the sharp-edged dialogue that's often spit-out-your-drink funny, but he has written a book that is ultimately about two characters changing in the small, incremental ways in which real people change. I thought it was smart and honest and psychologically true. No shiny-happy big-bang fake epiphanies here -- instead, we get the little experiences that gradually accrete and in the end push Kendra and Merv forward into more fully-realized adulthood. The best part is, these changes don't always come with the characters' complicity, or even their full recognition--which, again, feels psychologically true to me. I think it's a hell of a book, and it works on levels far subtler than some reviewers seem to recognize.Plussing as which, it's spit-out-your-drink-funny, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishing","review":"This books possesses a wonderful cumulative effect, the kind accomplished by a level of subtlety that perhaps might baffle the less erudite reader.

My advice is to check with the nearest university library near you and the read some of the principle source books in the field you are interested in; they'll have more references and moreinformation than this collection but you may need to read French or German to benefit from them.

While in the clinic she will interact with various \\"colourful patients\\" (none of whom are fully alive and fleshed-out characters but are instead cardboard cut-outs ofpsychologically-challenged archetypes.It is a shame.

If you already have used statistical software before, then not only is Stata with all its support the package to use, but this book by Hamilton should be your quickstart guide.It is very easy to read, and very logical. But probably most importantly, at the beginning of each chapter it provides example commands, along with popular parameters you might use along with those commands. Which means that if you are familiar with what kind of analysis you want, typing it into Stata is just 2 minutes away with the help of this book.My only complaint -- and it is a significant one I believe -- is that this reference doesn't do a very good job of describing the panel data commands. Granted, panel data may be a little advanced for this \\"tidy\\" thing but I think even 20-25 pgs of panel data analysis and examples would have improved the entire presentation immensely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luv the band","review":"this is an awesome cd!

The shower connects to a garden hose using a quick connect adapter. You take the adapter off the shower by pulling back on the adapter and it slides off. Then you screw it into your garden hose and slide it back on the shower. Everything works fine on the shower. No leaks and the water stream out of the shower is perfect.

Once we received the shower cabana, we were impressed with the fabric type casing that you had to inflate. It was very cute, but if you are over 5 ft. tall, you would have to dunk your head to get in! So, we had to return the shower cabana. We are still hoping to order just the shower when it comes back in-stock. The shipping was very fast.

Icarus reaches for the sun; man aspires to godhead; Adam eats of the tree of knowledge. Eddie Spinola discovers MDT-48 and makes a Faustian agreement with that post-Christian Satan that is his own dark side. Power, greed, and an insatiable need for recognition (attention) fuel his rise and inevitable fall. Classical structure assists the narrative as the voices of the Greek chorus (Melissa, his father, Van Loon, his good angel) whisper to him throughout. In his hubris, he doesn?t hear. This book is a good telling of an old tale. It?s predictable, but we can use a reminder of this sort now and then."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thriller that keeps the pages turning","review":"When I bought the book a few months back, I knew I would have a great story on my hands but I just kept on putting it aside.I finally picked up the story and loved it. The Dark Fields deals with issues such as addiction, greed, self destruction. I enjoyed the character Eddie Spinola very much. The MDT-48 was a very dangerous drug and it kept on keeping me intrigued as to what step Eddie would take next.I do recommend reading this book if you are looking for a good thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear Diary","review":"Glynn began with a fascinating idea. But his execution of it was weak.I must say that I enjoyed the story. That said, I must also say that I did not enjoy the way the story was presented. \\"The Dark Fields\\" had many thrilling moments.

I was lucky to gain an early preview of the new movie \\"Limitless\\" and I was blown away by it.I then read the book, so it could be the order in which I did it, but I found the movie to a noticeable improvement on the book.Better storyline (well-crafted by Leslie Dixon), more fleshed-out characters (de Niro!) and a far better ending (which they apparently changed during re-shoots anyway).But I did enjoy reading the book immensely, so I do recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great concept...rough execution","review":"Saw the movie trailers,was intrigued and purchased the book. The concept is fascinating and of universal interest. Who hasn't thought about what it would be like if we could use all of our brain? I give the author high marks for credibly describing the experience of an immensely powerful mind altering drug and to radically change your life in a few days. The plot has some curious flaws and a disappointing resolution. I'm hoping that the movie will expand this idea and fine tune the plot. Given my criticism of the novel, it was enjoyable, I recommend it, and look forward to reading other books by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Written for the beginning user.","review":"This book is very basic. For someone familiar with the Windows or Mac OS, much of this book can be skimmed through. The authors assume you know how to turn on a computer, load a CD, and use a mouse, but not much else. For some users, this is perfect, though I do not know if users like this would be venturing into Linux-Land. The most important point in the first half of the book is \\"WRITE DOWN THE ROOT PASSWORD; DO NOT LOOSE IT\\". That is the Golden Rule for all UNIX based OS's. Otherwise, the book's information is good. There are a few typographic errors, but nothing major. I was hoping for something a bit more advanced, but this is the only thing I could find. One very useful tidbit is you can set the Click-N-Run to save to the local drive, which for some reason (according to the book) is not on by default.

McQueen's wings are released by pulling up on his spoiler and the I feel that the mechanism is extremely flimsy and difficult to operate.

Yes, on about the 500th re-read, plot holes begin to emerge, but the combination of Wodehouseian humor, the classic British country house mystery, and chaos theory is enough to carry it through.

In my opinion, the title of Shakespeare's play best characterizes all the hubbub.

Highly recommeded for anyone who enjoyed Bull & Brust's \\"Freedom and Necessity\\", or (for very different reasons) Poul Anderson's stories of the Time Patrol.

She has fully developed her endearing style, using the very tone of her writing to advance the story. All the disparate \\"details\\" harmonize in unimaginable combinations, flung from one end to the other, united in spite of their oddity.Please note that you CANNOT glean everything this book contains in a single reading. Its nonlinear chronology guarantees that fact. Even so, the balance between the narrator's ordinary motion forward in time, his and other characters' jumping about through history, and the mind-numbing ramifications of entering the past make for the most carefully designed \\"theory\\" of time travel I have seen in science fiction.Enjoy this novel thoroughly, but be watchful for its staggering yet subtle message."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful farce -- far better than Doomsday Book","review":"The first book of Willis' I read was her Hugo and Nebula award-winning Doomsday Book, by which I was quite underwhelmed. So it was without particularly high hopes that I sat down to read To Say Nothing of the Dog, a sequel of sorts to that earlier book. To my surprise and delight, I found myself enjoying this book a great deal, largely because it was nothing at all like her earlier work. Whereas Doomsday Book had a dark tone and was set during the Black Death, To Say Nothing of the Dog is an outright farce set in the Victorian period. It possesses all the standard trimmings of the farce: improbable happenings, characters dashing about hither and yon, and a general light-hearted tone. Here's hoping that Willis sticks to comedic fare in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"On my \\"Best\\" list","review":"This book is a romp through Victorian England, with time travel and romance mixed in.

Just a delight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"Another book by Connie Willis that didn't really interest me, I didn'treally find it either engaging or amusing enough to bother too muchwith.The bishop's bird stump is something I have forgotten aboutcompletely, and didn't really care whether this motley crew ever foundit at all in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book itself is poorly printed and bound.","review":"This is the worst manufactured book I've ever seen. The pages are pulp paper, and the printing goes from edge to edge with no margins at the sides or top or bottom. I can't even read some of the words at the center of the book because they are hidden in the binding. Because the print covers the entire page, with no white space, I'm getting ink all over my fingers trying to hold the pages open.Reading a book should be an enjoyable experience. This book reeks of being poorly printed just so you'll have to buy an expensive Kindle for $400 in order to actually enjoy the story. Shame on the publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of my life-time","review":"All that praise at the back and the beginning of the book made me read the first 80 pages. Normally I would have thrown it away after 30 pages. I should have. This book is contrived and simply boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get into this","review":"I made it three chapters before I just couldn't take it any more. This was agonizing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful","review":"Connie Willis always has the ability to weave an interesting story, often with quirky bits that intrigue and delight. This is a best-ever, high on the quirky scale but deeply engrossing. The Willis imagination is in top gear in this story, which involves the time-travel theme and some of the great characters who appear in other novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful surprise","review":"I read To Say Nothing of the Dog because I have loved every one of Willis' books that I read thus far. So, I went into the book expecting to enjoy it. I was DELIGHTED, however, when I found it is set in the same world as Doomsday Book! I would recommend reading Doomsday Book first, then To Say Nothing of the Dog, because each is wonderful in its own way. Then, clear your schedule because you'll want to read them again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A satire on the Victorian Period","review":"If this book is ever made into a movie; it would have to cast John Clease in the starring role. He is perhaps the only British comedian that could carry the humor as well a Willis does in the book. Willis is able to rip apart the era though without any malice. He timing is perfect and her wit right on mark. When Verity sneaks into Ned's room at night (to discuss their mission, nothing that you couldn't read to your kids happens)he resonds, \\"What are you doing here! It's the Victorian era\\" or something like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I expected - but wonderful on its own","review":"I had a hard time getting into the start of the book because, as others have said, I was expecting science fiction. Yes, there is time travel - but for all that it doesn't follow the basic sci-fi outline at all. However, once I got into the book I thought it was hillarious. I couldn't put it down once I was half way through. Yes, the story has been done before (Oh no! We changed history!) it was the characters and the humor that made the book. Very enjoyable, very funny, well worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complex plot twists and huge laughs","review":"Ever felt you didn't quite know what was going on ? Well that's just how most of the characters in this book feel, and with good reason. Willis drops all the clues you need, but tricks you into missing them. The style is superb, hugely funny, I just couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"It took a while to get INTO this book, and in my opinion there are too many characters (many of which could be combined). It felt like the 2nd installment of a series, like the author was trying to catch me up on what happened in the first book, although I don't think that is the case. HOWEVER, about halfway through, it starts to pick up speed and becomes a really fun ride after that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book Ever","review":"A man *Ned Henry* goes back in time to the Victorian era for what he thinks is a little bed rest (he is time lagged (like jet lagged)) and gets instead a small mission which turns into a catastrophe! He meets a girl *Verity* who is also from the future. They're chasing all over for the Bishop's Bird Stump and a cat, meanwhile trying to correct all the incongruities they've caused.Incredibly funny, thoughtful page-turner. It was absolutely wonderful.If you also like serious books, and enjoy this book, I suggest you read other books by Connie Willis, and 3 Men in a Boat by Jerome K. Jerome, which is constantly referred to.Could not put this book down. Loved it SO much. Hilarious...I was laughing constantly. Pick this book up ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Willis Lite","review":"If you are coming to this book because of Willis's serious works such as Doomsday Book or Lincoln's Dreams, you are likely to be disappointed. But if a whimsical Victorian mystery is just your cup of tea, and you don't mind \\"getting\\" many of the clues long before the protagonists do, you may enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"There just isn't much to it.","review":"It's strange that so many people praise this book for its wit and its humor: it has neither. Fans of this book would probably argue that the humor is very subtle, but it's better hidden than that. I couldn't find any of it. Mostly the book is just dull and might have been quite good as a short story but the middle chapters seem to just fill space. We get to meet a lot of interesting characters, at least characters which are interesting until the reader learns that Willis is going to force him to sit through pages of tedious dialogue with these characters about pretty much nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flashes of brilliance, long stretches of cloying frustration","review":"This book does have a fairly intricate plot, and I did want to know what would happen to Ned and Verity...that said, do people really enjoy being clubbed over the head with a hundred redundant clues? One of the pleasures offered by fiction is puzzling out the situation--once you've figured out a particular aspect, it just becomes tedious to be given nudge after nudge, while the dimwitted protagonist stumbles around for another 100 pages.Willis occasionally hits the mark with her humor, but her tricks get old after a few repetitions, leading up to a climax of self-congratulatory literary allusions and treacly religious overtones. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpectedly charming!","review":"I won't lie to you. This book has its share of dragging moments, and sometimes the sheer twistedness of the complex coincidences and paradoxes made my head spin. But in the end, it was all worth it. The characters are sympathetic and fairly realistic, and Willis handles the rather tired premise of a stranger in a strange time quite deftly. Though I think the \\"comedy\\" angle is overrepresented in reviews, several scenes are unexpectedly hilarious. The convoluted and intertwined mysteries all make near-perfect sense in the end, and they're written in such a way that figuring out the solution to one won't immediately destroy the book because there's so much still to puzzle out. I strongly recommend this book to mystery buffs and fans of corkscrew-twisted plots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky and funny.","review":"Willis' To Say Nothing of the Dog is definitely worth the read. I picked this up on the recommendations of the Foglios (responsible for the Girl Genius comic, for which they credit this book as a bit of the inspiration) and quite enjoyed it. It is a well-woven narrative involving time travel and the dangers associated with it. Taking place mostly in the Victorian era, this plays up the quirkiness of the time period as seen through the eyes of a tired and skeptical historian, Ned. The supporting cast is very interesting, as is the mystery they are trying to solve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Read","review":"I got four Sci-Fi books for Christmas this year and read them all before New Years. This was easily the best of the lot. A terrific blend of comedy, detective novel, and time travel twister. I couldn't putit down"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get past the British English","review":"I am halfway through this book, and I'm not sure whether I can finish it. The rendering of British English has so many glaring mistakes that it's distracting me from focusing on the plot. The sentence structure is not quite right, some of the words are American ('gasoline'??), and the whole book just feels like watching a movie that features American actors trying to sound like English actors.Reviewers on Amazon.uk report the same problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and Accurate.","review":"They were awesome! I would definately use them again for buying used books. What a bargin, and right on the nose what I was looking for too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny romance story with a time travel twist.","review":"When I first started reading this book, I couldn't stop laughing at the things that the main character was saying and the things that were happening to him. Later as the story progressed and the character started to become more lucid, the humor was gone and the plot started to pickup.It was an interesting read and I look forward to reading another book by this author to see if it's as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent satire.","review":"Many people might not see this novel as satirical, but having studied much of 19th century literature, I certainly see that Willis' intricate and chaotic storyline, with a basis somewhere in a love story, is reminiscent of the century the characters visit. The novel is witty and historically accurate--not a common combination! Any fan of speculative fiction, 19th century literature, and great writing (as I am) will enjoy this book extremely."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sci-fi comedy of errors","review":"This book is truly a romp through the course of history, focusing on the delightfully frivolous Victorian Era. Light, witty, yet provacative in it's examination of significance. What are the forces that shape history? Does the space-time continuum balance on an ugly piece of Victorian artwork (to say nothing of the dog)? Is God in the details? Read it. And, for maximum effect, read Jerome K. Jerome's \\"Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog)\\" first. Sit back, relax, and let them both carry you along on the currents of the Thames...and the currents of history..."},{"rating":"1","title":"this time-travel mystery could not hold on to my interest","review":"Based on these reviews, most readers have loved this novel, and I can see why. It combines so many things - time travel, mystery, romance, science, and above all, humor. All those pieces appeal to me, but they never came together into a story I cared about. The people and era (England, late 1800's) never truly came alive to me, and that is the most important feature of a good time travel book to me. There was a British intellectual humor to this, and I know that all my friends who love Monty Python would love the humor here. But that's not me. I expect that most people who choose to read this novel will like it a lot. But if you look for a more character-based realism or the humor does not resonate quickly with you, this novel may fall short, like it did with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"Clever, well-written romp through time, enhanced by a little bit of romance and mystery. Everything I want in a time travel fantasy, plus some interesting information about the Victorian era. If I had a complaint, it would be that there are a few too many heavy-handed references to Three Men in a Boat, but I can forgive that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"A great read, excellent characterization in all things. Loved the relationship between Ned and the animals. Don't necessarily need to read the first one in the series to understand this one. Could easily be a stand alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the editor?","review":"This book was so repetitive that if you only read every other chapter, you get the gist of the entire book. The cat played a small part in the book, but we were told about every paw licked, fish batted and eaten, and claw placement. I was ready to kill the darn thing by the end of the book. The dog wasn't much better. The first part was (I am assuming) written as if the character was really time warped, so it made little sense. However everyone in our book club did find it an excellent book to read when you can't sleep. We all dropped off within 4-6 pages making this a mid day read with lots of caffeine."},{"rating":"2","title":"pure fun","review":"a good laugh, good charecter build up and an interesting plot. I now look at passing cats and dogs with a new eye."},{"rating":"2","title":"To say nothing of the allusions...","review":"I suppose the best way to characterize this novel is as a cross between Wodehouse and Douglas Adams.-Perhaps this makes no sense at all to the putative reader, perhaps the book itself doesn't exactly come across as a paradigm of perfect logical construction, but what fun it is to read!Also, Eng. Lit majors might want to brush up on their late Victorian poetry. A pocket Latin-English dictionary comes in handy as well for those who, like myself, took four years of Latin, but are a bit rusty on some vocab. Oh, and also a knowledge of Middle English comes in rather useful in one scene.All this aside, if you fancy Adams and/or Wodehouse and can possibly imagine a book in which the humour somehow manages to combine the two, then...READ. The book is a perfect 5 star lark.And I shan't even begin to mention the cat."},{"rating":"2","title":"not as bad as everyone says","review":"I read this fourth installment, regardless of the poor reviews as I couldn't NOT read it after reading the first three and having the 5th, the prequel, too. But I thoroughly enjoyed it and couldn't it put it down for the last third. And had exactly the same sense, that another reviewer mentions of, \\"how come there are so few pages left\\"? Except for the rushed ending, which may have been due to the fact that Hearn didn't want to add another 100 pages and perhaps was up against a deadline so couldn't go back and edit some things out, it was a wonderful book. Definitely slower than the first three, and I thought that the Kaede character especially was poorly depicted, especially being so different than she was in the earlier books. But it's still worth reading, particularly for the new characters, the children of the Otori."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tales of the Bore-tori","review":"It is amazing the contrast between this book and the first three of the series. While the first three had a spare Japanese style, this book breaks with all the strengths of the first three. The first person narration of Takeo is abandoned for boring and overly developed third person narration. It lacks any plot, instead digressing in developing boring characters, many of which bear little resemblance to the earlier books. The magical realism of the trilogy is abandoned with the development of a completely non-believable story and new over the top elements invented for the book (morphing of characters, shamanism, etc.). Rarely in other literary series has the drop off been this pronounced. It's like a bad movie sequel, where the star has been replaced with a B-list actor."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you care about these characters...","review":"Okay everybody. I'm going to tell you right now, the writing was fantastic as usual but if you care about these characters at all DON'T READ THE BOOK. Seriously. I just finished it and I'm infuriated, indignant, and honestly? Depressed. This is not an uplifting story in any way, shape, or form. I spent the entire book being really angry with previously beloved characters but expecting things would eventually end in a pleasant resolution. WRONG. You will be miserable when you finish this book. I would strongly advise you to skip it altogether and remember the characters you once loved as they were. A word to the wise, you will particularly hate Kaede. She is everything a mother shouldn't be in this book, and not much better as a wife. I'm going to have to find something to read that'll cheer me up now."},{"rating":"1","title":"CONDITION OF PRINTED BOOK IN BAD CONDITION","review":"Was totally disappointed with the quality of this book. Sent it back for a refund. Will purchase the book elsewhere as it is for a gift and the quality should be pretty good to give someone for a christmas present"},{"rating":"2","title":"different but good","review":"The 4th book is 15 years later, and considering the circumstances of this story, a different feeling is inevitable. Less of the ninja stuff (though still enough to make you smile) though still plenty of intrigue. If you liked the rest of the series, give it a chance. I found that the author introduces a new level of depth to the story by touching on more esoteric, philosophical, and humanistic subject matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"It never ends.","review":"I liked the first three books well enough. The first was the best (if implausible), the second quite enjoyable (even though it strained credibility) and the third was alright (absolutely unbelievable). My reading speed kept diminishing as the series progressed, but my true challenge was trying to finish this one, the fourth. This book is practically unreadable.Just as all the other reviewers have said, it's too convoluted and has too many characters by half (wracking your brain to remember who was who=not fun). NOTHING HAPPENS during the first 3/4 of the book. They travel here and there and talk unlikely politics. So finally the writer wraps up the whole mess in a narrative of the main character's fate.If you enjoyed the original 3 books, skip this and enjoy your memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Awful. Simply awful. First book was interesting but the series drifted downhill with each episodic release worse. In this case the author loses her way in the story with too many story lines and confusing characters with a hasty and uncompelling finish. Author only seemed to have a cursory understanding of Japan history and culture. I could barely finish the series. Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Other reviewers were too kind","review":"I agree with the other reviewers that the first 3 books were a treat. This book is terrible. The reviewers hit all the weaknesses but were too kind. No action, slow drawn out plot. Too many characters and too little chacter development. Sigh, we were so disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect little espresso spoons","review":"For some reason, these type of espresso spoons are almost impossible to find. After much looking, I came across these babies and they are perfect. They are the right size for a cappucino or espresso cup and the style is perfectly neutral to match just about any silverware collection.

I would expect to find spoons like this in a diner if they served espresso but not in a fine restaurant."},{"rating":"1","title":"rather cheap looking","review":"These are low end, low quality spoons. They've not rusted on me, but the edges and finish are a bit rough. If you need a lot, you could get by. But for a few dollars more I'd get the nicer ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"An awful piece of work","review":"This portrayl of the Dirk Greineder murder case is an awful piece of work that is riddled with errors and sheds no new information on the case. Author Rosencrance clearly did little more than watch the Court TV coverage of this case, read the local media accounts, and consult the trial transcripts. Beyond the local police chief and several jurors, none of the main participants in the case were interviewed and there is virtually no character development. The story line is disjointed, confusing and devoid of emotion and description. Some parts read like clinical police reports while other sections are trial transcripts run verbatim. Avoid this book at all costs as the errors are too numerous to list. It does not deserve a single star but there is no option for zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lazy man's way to write a crime book","review":"I like some trial coverage in my true crime books, but Rosencranz overdid it. All she did was use the trial transcripts basically verbatim. She did little research as far as I can tell. A little bit of info from the jurors and cops and that is it. I got tired of the constant repetition of what happened as she interviews every single cop, etc. who came to the crime scene. I had absolutely no feeling for who May and Dirk Greineder were as real people. No emotional connection, no nothing. If I had wanted to know about this crime from this angle I would have strictly read the newspapers.

Don't read it for the narrative. For an author who claims to want to share her love of a generation, she knows precious little about it. One would think she would have read more. The number of factual errors is astounding. Irritating. Where is Dorothy Parker? Where are the biscuits and toppings and dry sherry made so famous by the Murphy's? Although the food is mentioned time and again in the many biographies, it is nice to read the actual recipes, except for Zelda's, which she had penned herself.

Removed the air intake to the turbo, used vise grips straight on the old cable hold down bolt and turned the vise grips with a set of big channel locks 1/8 turn at a time until loose enough to remove by hand. push fit new one in, checked to see if there was continuity and repeated hand tight and the 1/8th turn with vise grips and channel locks till tight. put a cable sheath on the new cord and pull tied it to the frame in the area where the old one was.

You could read this book in one sitting. If you are a Tiger fan, a Kirk Gibson fan or maybe a Dodger fan you might have a fleeting interest in this book. However, that interest will end when you realize it presents very little meaningful information that you probably didn't know or hear already at one time. I can't imagine anyone that just has a general baseball sense really embracing this book.If you can find it at a bargain price and are a Tiger fan, there may be some value into getting it.

Its funny, the characters are endearing, and you can't hep but want to know what happened to all of them when the movie is over. Some of the gags are funnier if you are from the Bay Area but overall it is a well done Indie Comedy.

Boy was I wrong with this one. It didn't even deserve 1 star. I don't know who rated this movie or gave it more than 1 star, but it was absolutely awful! Both the acting and plot were terrible. I don't even think this was a real production. It was like someone was following the actors around with a video camera filming. Don't waste your money or your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money...homemade movie reviews must be from producer","review":"I can't believe I wasted money watching this.

Didn't see you.\\" I look into their eyes. I can't get blame them because THEY ARE TELLING THE TRUTH. They really have no consciousness of the big, bearded guy (me) in front of them -- or even New York City (where I live) maybe.I feel these people are lucky to be so carefree, so will-o'-the-wisp, so ignorant of the world outside their own worlds. No worry lines for them! Now cartoonist Heather Down has written a IGNORANCE IS BLISS reminding us that these people are the luckiest people.Now I'm a bit lucky since I discovered Ms. Down's book.

This is really a long movie.","review":"How many adventure movies of this type have heroes looking for a lost city in the jungle or a kings tomb buried under the sands of the Sahara Desert or an under water cave with riches beyond belief and when they find it, it begins to collaspe all around them and they have to flee for their lives. Well, this is another one of them and actually not a very good one of them. If I was restricted to review this movie with using only one word I would have to say \\"Boring\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"A film that should never have been made. Let me just describe the opening. 4 horsemen ride down a busy NYC street at night, attract no attention, then ride up the stairs of an art museum gala event and are stopped by just one cop. They kill him, ride into the exhibit room, no one shoots them, they break the display cases, steal some priceless artifacts, and the heroine shouts \\"Hey! That doesn't belong to you!\\", like a kid on a playground. In short, this movie sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been called \\"The Daughter of Indiana Jones: The Last Templar\\"","review":"I have to say that once again a good book is lead astray. I understand the concept of movies not being exactly like the book but this missed the mark completely in my opinion. The endearing qualities that made Tess a great heorin in the book were completely removed in the film. Making her more Indiana Jones was a bad choice. I failed to see the intrigue and suspense that the novel brought with her being a take no prisoners a$$ kicking type. I am not sure how they could have done a complete 180 with the character but to each his own. The rest of the film was mediocre at best. If you liked the book you probably won't enjoy the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did We Watch The Same Movie?","review":"Based on all of the positive reviews I read on Amazon, we rented THE LAST TEMPLAR and were thoroughly disappointed--so much so that I wondered if we had watched the same movie!I cannot fault the cast of solid actors that included Scott Foley and Victor Garber but Mira Sorvino portrayed her character like a sorority girl run amok instead of a seasoned archaeologist. And, the director actually shows a talent for staging action sequences. That said, all of this talent simply could not overcome entry-level writing and cliched, sometimes awkward plotting. At the core of this half-baked attempt to meld Indiana Jones with The DaVinci Code is the now-familiar story of the main character coming to grips with faith. As someone who believes in God, I found TEMPLAR's treatment of this theme badly mishandled and embarrassing. The film is around four hours in length and feels twice that long."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOL","review":"This is the best movie to watch; well, not really watch but instead to make-fun-of while watching. It's so bad, it's funny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It had a chance","review":"But with a cast full of B-class actors, and just reasonable acting, it's hard to make it a hit. Even Sorvino, with her Botox enhanced lip, couldn't manage to save it. I guess she's been away from the mainstream films for too long. Although the plot is just one more that rides on the success of The Da Vinci Code, it's interesting, but lost its chance with a probable limited budget. Insisting on the limited budget theory, I'm pretty sure this is the main reason for the cliché and sometimes cheesy lines. It could also have had a better pace if it hadn't been for the constant interrogations and meaningless conversations between the two main characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"First off, let me put in a disclaimer. I really like Mira Sorvino. Not only do I think she's smoking hot, but I like her as an actress as well. I liked her in good movies like 'Mighty Aphrodite', and in bad ones like 'Mimic'. And I think 'Replacement Killers' is a four-star movie, one of my all-time favorite action flicks. I was even glad to see her as a guest star on 'House' last season! Despite all of this interest, I have to admit that I couldn't even get through the first 15 minutes of this TV mini-series. Such a shame - Mira still looks fantastic, but the lame dialog and cheesy directing meant I couldn't even get past the opening action scene. What a waste..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"\\"The Last Templar\\" abounds with clichés - from the front cover and throughout the whole series of episodes it is a collection of what is the current fashion in film. Mira Sorvino as the lead character Tess Chaykin was annoying as an actor. Her hair was all over the place, she had an awful smile and did not do the role of a \\"go get 'em\\" archaeologist any justice. It was also very contrived. For example, how can an FBI agent all of a sudden jump on a plane with absolutely no preparation to follow Tess Chaykin. It is all very well to have a little bit of artistic licence but it was all taken too far in this case. No eye candy, no special effect and poor acting - a waste of time watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie of the week at best","review":"Yawn! This movie was too long and too far fetched! This low budget film would be best as a lifetime movie. Cheap and cheesy romance novel comes to mind and that can be ok but never this long!!!!!! Don't waste your money or your time.

Maybe they could have edited out eighty minutes of horrible dialog. I fell asleep so many times. Five of us watched it and all were disappointed.Please read some of the other one star ratings. I do not want to waste anymore time on this movie but just want to warn others. I am amazed some people have watched it more than once. I feel I wasted 170 minutes of my life. BTW there are no deleted scenes and also Jerusalem is no where near the coast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty awful compared to the book","review":"I really enjoyed the book and thought the movie would be a nice one to add to my collection. Boy, I was disappointed. Poor acting. The woman in the movie was arrogant and flippant - and really wasn't up to the part. There was no \\"connection\\" to the FBI guy - no charm - no electricity - and that was so well presented in the book. They altered the story in several parts and I'll say it was a budget issue because they didn't do the parts that would have cost a lot to film - the storm at sea, for example, was skimmed over and then they were rescued. At several points, I lost interest altogether and got up and walked away. All in all, it's lucky I gave the movie one star. Read the book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Templar","review":"Anyone who gave this movie a three to five star rating has an I, Q. of less than 100. Therewas absolutely nothing good about this movie including the actors performances, the direction (which was horrible), and the screenplay.

Not that you would want to pass around your stick-style test you probably spashed urine on, but this remains clean given you are not all over the place when adding the drops. I found that this test keeps the results. I have had one for 3 years in my baby book, and it still shows positive.

The shave is just fine. The problem is that, after a year, the battery wouldn't hold a charge. I'd shave once and have to recharge. Then, it got to the point where it wouldn't even hold a charge RIGHT AFTER CHARGING. I had to pull it off the charger and be ready to shave right before it was done.I figured this just needed a new battery. Problem is you can't get new batteries for this. So, I bought a second, hoping that this was just an isolated case. I mean, at this price, buying one a year really isn't saving any money over blades.It happened again. I won't be buying a third one of these.

Guess I'll buy a better one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I've owned just about every brand electric razor on the market. Braun's are great quality but grossly over priced. Norelco's don't cut close. Remington's burn your face. Panasoic provide the closest shave out of them all, but have subpar quality. I purchased this razor after a Braun I had didn't work right anymore after a year of use. The razor worked well for a month cutting as close if not closer than a blade. After that it was horrible. The razor wasn't cutting as close which is typical with Panasoic's. The solution for the system would run back in to the device housing area leaving the razor constantly wet when I would use it. To top it off when I called Panasoic they wouldn't do anything for me. Keep in mind that when my Braun broke they were happy to refund me my money after one year of purchase. Don't be cheap, buy something of better quality and be willing to sacrifice a little on the closeness of the shave by getting a better quality razor and spending a little more money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only good for ladies leg shaving","review":"I bought this for my husband with high hopes and it did not work.

However, it recently stopped charging. Now the battery is dead and it will not charge. When I opened it up, there was water inside. I haven't submerged the unit nor do I shave in the shower, it got water inside from my rinsing it under the sink."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So","review":"I was hoping to be blown away by this product based on the great reviews it had received but I was under-whelmed. Maybe other shavers simply can't measure up to Braun but again if you read the reviews you'd think this one would have been closer. I am not a burly, thick bearded man but it's nice to not have to use a razor every day. I find myself trying the electric but after three passes I usually give up and grab the razor. Sort of self-defeating. Sorry can't give this one even a silver star- I'd look to Braun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Locks up, misses spots","review":"My main issue with this shaver is that sometimes it won't start. The battery's not dead- if you turn it off and on a few times it eventually starts and then it works. Granted, I don't recall it doing this fresh out of the charger, but I'd like to be able to travel for a few days without bringing the charger along.Also, it's difficult to get some areas on my neck. I used to have a norelco with 3 rotating heads, and I don't remember having that problem.Finally, keep in mind that you're supposed to replace the detergent/filter cartridge monthly, and they're currently $12 for a 3-pack, so you've got $4 a month in consumables."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Remington!","review":"I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas, he loves it!

Great gift idea!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shaves fine but battery sucks","review":"The shaver did a good job of shaving, but its battery went low very fast (after 2 shaves of 4-5 minutes in about 4-5 days). One time the indicator showed high battery but before I finished the job it went off. What sucks most is that the shaver doesn't work while charging!!!Also, the battery will get worse after a year or two so you would have to either replace the battery or buy a new unit.Also, I didn't like shaving in the wet mode with soap/foam on my face, because the shaved hairs got stuck on my skin so I couldn't tell what parts are shaved and what parts not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Back to Sensor razor","review":"I tried it for 3 weeks with combination of dry and in shower and it just doesn't work for me.

The style is much like the soulful electronic work of Vikter Duplaix. Smooth and interesting with the little extra electronic sounds.

I recommend it to anyone who is interested in reading a first-hand account of months in a prison camp, on the death march and piecing together a life after the war. There were days when I couldn't put it down and others when I could only read short passages. The message that this man brngs to us is that prejudice in any form is wrong and dangerous. This was the first book I had read about the holocaust. Each year I take a student group to the Holocaust Museum in Houston so that they might better understand the history they learn in textbooks. I am ordering two more copies to loan to my students and others."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Soul, Mind and Heart Experience...","review":"It literally took me several months to get through this book. I study the holocuast from every aspect. Have been to the Museum in D.C. and still can't fix my mind or heart on what these people have endured. This is a heart experience. I was at the signing of this man's book and was confounded to realize after I had read it that in his eyes he looked evil in the face. I will never know how they endure these horrors of man hating man and nations hating nations. I truly believe if I could phathom this I would understand evil to this degree and God knows I don't want to understand this kind of hate. Read the book and study! I pray history never repeats itself but it does. When I looked into this man's face and then read the book my heart broke. I keep it out in the open for those around to see and hopefully they will ask. I will tell them to read it and pray.

Unimaginative, yes. I agree that the only positive with this production is its length. Retract that, the out-takes with Nathan Lane were really funny.I understand this is a TV special and all, and they couldn't throw the budget at it like they did A Muppet Christmas Carol, but good grief.

This production had promise but it never got beyond that. Even Paul Williams' music seems to be lacking without the collaborative genius of Henson.There are a few chuckles here and there--brought about mostly by the newish character of PePe the Prawn--but I'd have to guess that Henson wouldn't be proud of this effort.And what's weirdest to me is that ALL of the Muppet's voices seem to have changed--not just Kermit's, who obviously sounds different these days since he isn't being performed by Henson. Fozzie sounds different, Miss Piggy sounds different, Gonzo sounds different, Scooter sounds different...and longtime Muppet fans will know it.Just a disappointment overall and the last post-Henson Muppet production that I'll spend my money on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic live recording of an amazing group.","review":"Seeing the Dudley Manlove Quartet perform is like flipping through snapshots of all of the best parts of growing up.

Yet the U.S. government and military chose to start at the bottom of the totem pole instead of the top when attempting to mete out justice, the exact opposite approach to that at Nuremberg. Ultimately the crimes went unpunished and swept under the rug... or the United States Flag. Obviously we have a different view of justice when dealing with our own.

The useful area that will hold an upright 4-inch high object is 11-3/4\\" wide x 5\\" long by 4-1/8\\" high. In the rest of the safe, the usable height is reduced to 2-3/4\\". That is because there is a box attached to the underside of the lid that houses the locking mechanism, batteries and the on-off switch for the interior light. This box is shown in the mouse-over photo of the wide-open safe. If you use the protective floor mat, the height dimensions stated above are all reduced by 3/4 inch. If the object is not fragile, most of the 3/4 inch can be regained by compressing the floor mat when you close the lid.

Generic characters dressed up to resemble something closer to life, plodding pace, pointless events (many of them spent in fast food places), dreary dialogue. It's supposed to be about a dying ex-monk who wants to go back to his old monastery (now sunk beneath a dammed lake), but why he feels compelled to make the journey, what dying and old age are like, what this man feels or knows, his history, have all eluded this writer who makes do with \\"sensitive\\" writing.

Patricia Arquette and Jake Weber are so believable as Allison and Joe... they make the perfect married couple some times it is difficult to believe they aren't really married. The only reason I didn't give this FIVE stars is because of the writers strike, the season is kind of on the lite side. There are only 4 DVDs so you kind of feel like you were cheated on the number of episodes. BUT, there are some really cool behind the scenes footage (which I really love), and whether there are 4 or 40 DVDs this is some quality writing and acting.So, if you are a fan of Medium and you haven't already purchased this DVD set, I strongly suggest buying it. I almost didn't because of the number of episodes, but I am so glad I did. If you haven't bought any of the season, I strongly suggest you invest in this wonderfully written and executed series."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel cheated","review":"I've been telling friends how great Amazon Prime is, especially how much I enjoyed watching the show Medium for free.

There is humor, but most of all, there is heart. I read this novel as a teen, but after rereading it nearly a hundred times in the past twenty years, I find that this book is an American classic that never got the recognition like \\"Tom Sawyer\\" or \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" or \\"Lord of the Flies\\" etc, etc...However, this book transcends the teen genre, and remains a beautiful and touching slice of Americana literature...Five Stars, all the way..."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 THUMBS DOWN","review":"The advertisment for this DVD of rare film footage and photographs of Elvis during his Vegas years is not what you see on this DVD.

The characters in this book are very likable - right down to the drug dealer who befriends Myra and is there for her in her most definite time of need. The story follows the similar love triangle you may read about with the teenage or mid-20's age group - But these characters are middle age - all in their early 50's. You will find yourself talking to the characters out loud trying desperately to convince them that their thoughts are incorrect and that yes, indeed, they are lovable.

I'm not going to finish this book and it won't bother me one bit that I don't know what happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"never change","review":"I have read all of Elizabeth Berg's books and enjoyed them. However, this one depressed me. The character of Myra was pathetic! She had an education and wonderful career. It was made clear that Myra had chosen a single life by keeping men at bay. Yet the book focused on her age, looks and an unhealthy love for a dying man she knew from high school. Having Myra consider and plan a co-suicide with this cancer victim was disturbing, sending a message that a woman needs a man in order to survive. Ms. Berg, this is 2001. What happened to your positive female role models? The women survivors who do their grieving and then take control? I am so disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"sappy and not credible","review":"I really hate stories that hook the part of me that cries over sentimental muck.

But then it became a bit weird. I was disappointed in the last 1/3 when it lost the train of thought from the first section. This is the second Elizabeth Berg book I've read this summer and I expected more from her, based on other reviews and reputation. Thus, I'm disappointed.Part of my disappointment could be that I just finished an exceptional book, \\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\\" about a week ago. It was a tough act for Elizabeth Berg to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous story","review":"A simply marvelous story of a woman who doesn't think highly of her looks or character, because of what she learned growing up. Through nursing others she changes the view of herself and gains friends, probably for the first time in her life.Berg's way of telling a story is simple, understanding, and gets to the core of one's own self. The story of a visiting nurse shows how nursing used to be. The caring that went into looking after another human being, instead of get in and get out, onto the next patient. Above all it's a wonderful love story. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her books always feel real","review":"What is it about Elizabeth Berg? I read her books and feel as if I am with an old friend, one who knows me, or people I know only too well.Myra Lipinski is a self proclaimed spinster at the age of 51. We have all known girls like Myra in high school, the girl who never seems to \`belong'. No boyfriends, no group of girl friends, just there. A nice person, but one nobody ever gets to know. Myra's life changes completely when Chip Reardon, her secret high school crush, comes back home to die from a terminal illness and Myra becomes his nurse.In other hands Myra may have seemed a cold fish and some of the things that happen in the book may have seemed preposterous, but in Berg's capable hands it just works. I think it's because she writes in such a way that we see bits and pieces of ourselves (good and bad), and people we know in all of her characters. Her writing is fluid and accessible and alternating between funny and sad. A very moving and memorable story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many good books out there to waste time reading this!","review":"Not at all memorable. Formulaic in that Oprah's Book Club sort of way...martyr-like female who is a \\"better\\" person at the end of the book having learned a valuable lesson about life, love, the world or all three.

I still enjoyed it though, because Burg's fabulus voice still shines through the goppy drama"},{"rating":"2","title":"Berg Never Disappoints Me","review":"I have never been disappointed by an Elizabeth Berg novel, and this one is no exception. I wish I knew Myra Lipinsky, the main character of this novel, so I could benefit from her calm presence and medical wisdom. This book is a comfort to anyone who has ever waited with a loved one while they waited to die. Berg gets it right.And Berg's subtle spiritual messages always delight me. Never heavy-handed. Always a gentle reminder that we are not alone in this world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you appreciate your life","review":"What a beautiful book, so \\"readable\\" - the characters truly seemed like real people to me. I couldn't wait to get back to my book (had to tend to my kids) to see what happens to Myra. What real, human feelings she has. This book also shows how everyone can be different, yet each has good in them. I hugged my kids and am adoring my own life even more after I finished this book. I read it in 2 days and I'm so happy to be alive and have my own wonderful family. Please read this ... p.s.

I have read many books by Elizabeth Berg before and she has yet to dissapoint me.This book is about 51 year old nurse Myra Lipinsky, who has never married and her dog Frank is the only family she has. She is truly dedicated to her career and her patients and she has made a comfortable living for herself. The one problem is she suffers from loneliness and she dreams of having a real family.That all changes when she is assigned a new patient Chip Reardon, who happens to be an old high school friend that she had a crush on and he is dying. He teaches Myra how to open up and except love and he also shows her how much she means to the people in her life.This was a very beautiful love story and I thought it was well written. I highly recommend reading this book or any other book by Ms. Berg."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"I get goosebumps just thinking about this book. First, I should say that I'm a great fan of Elizabeth Berg, but this, to me, is her best book by miles. What a great gift to be able to make a story about death so uplifting for the reader. Ms Berg's other great gift is her ability with dialogue. From old, crotchety couples, to drug dealers, there is never a moment where their voices are anything but totally real. I have lent this book to several friends, and they unanimously enjoyed it as much as I did. It's absolutely wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This is a story about how a single woman finds love in her life. Myra is a strong woman with many people around her who care for her but she doesn't see her life as this way. Elizabeth Berg writes very well. Every single line in the book pops up at you. The story is simple and yet very true. I liked it a lot and will try Berg's other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humor, poignancy.........new understandings","review":"Myra Lipinsky is a middle-aged woman who has decided that she is okay with what her life has become, that she should be happy with the trade-offs she has made to attain the life that she is comfortable in. Her bedrock is shaken when her life as a home care nurse crosses paths with Chip Reardon, the person that she had a deep crush on in high school. As they both deal with where their lives are headed, their collision paths bring them both a new understanding and opportunity to readjust their views on living life fully. The vast company of characters the author creates gives the story both humor and poignancy. There is an earthiness and true grit that each character possesses in a unique but significant manner. From the main characters to those who revolve in and out of this tale, these qualities bring an intensity and an inner spark to his novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and stupid","review":"This book sucks. \\"Never Change\\" is about Myra Lipinski, a 51-year-old nurse who has basically lived her life in a self-imposed solitary confinement. There's nothing wrong with this woman aside from the fact that she has absolutely zero self-confidence and doesn't believe that anyone could truly like or care about her. The fact that Myra is such a weak character is one of the two main reasons why I hated this book. The other reason is because the basic plot of the story revolves around Myra caring for her former high school classmate, Chip Reardon, who has returned to town after being diagnosed with an incurable brain tumor. Chip was the guy Myra and all the other girls lusted after in high school: kind, popular, handsome, etc. The story is just so hokey and I really didn't care what happened to any of the characters. What a waste of paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Change","review":"I have thoroughly enjoyed most of Elizabeth Berg's books - up until now with the exception of 'Pull of the Moon' (not her best). After reading 'Never Change' I am reticent to try another!!!

Elizabeth, I don't think it's 'written true'. Doris"},{"rating":"1","title":"A shame to the nursing profession among other things!!","review":"I think I may be the only reviewer who did not care for this book. I found it unrealistic and unprofessional. A nurse should not be doing the things she is doing in this novel. Also, the \\"ugly duckling\\" syndrome carrying over later in life theme is something I cannot stand reading about, where someone never feels like they are pretty or worth anything. This is something that the main character, Myra, suffers from. What a way to make a reader feel bad!! I feel sorry for Elizabeth Berg if she actually felt this way in her life. But to give a character in a novel these traits is inexcusable. It just reinforces the idea amongst other vulnerable people/readers that if you were quiet when you were young then you are ugly. AND THIS IS NOT TRUE!Overall, sappy & unrealistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Berg failed to work her usual magic","review":"I enjoy the writings of Elizabeth Berg and truly enjoyed her Open House novel but Never Change was a great disappointment for me. The characters and events in this novel were so cliche-ridden and predictable that I couldn't wait to get to the end - just to be finished with it. I expected more from Berg than this. I felt that it read like a paperback romance novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from Berg's best work, and even what I would call destructive","review":"Though it is typical of Berg's sensitive, emotionally intelligent style, Never Change is disturbingly sympathetic to the \\"right to die\\" philosophy. One of the main characters is dying and asks the protagonist, his nurse who has fallen in love with him, to help him die. He isn't in unbearable pain, he just doesn't want to experience the decline of his faculties which is the result of a brain tumor. Not only does she agree, she entertains seriously the \\"romantic\\" idea of going with him, all very sympathetically portrayed by this author. It kinda made me sick. I've read about ten of Berg's books, and this was the least redeeming. I've loaned out all of Berg's books to friends, but this one is going in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS BOOK!!","review":"I literally read this in one day. I would put it down and be drawn back to it. I became an Elizabeth Berg fan with 'Open House' and will now be purchasing all of her books. This book had me laughing and crying. I truly cared about these characters and their stories. What a great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwarming and honest","review":"While I cried a few tears, this is not a sad book. The plot is that of a 51-year-old never married and socially isolated nurse, who finds love with a terminally ill patient, who is coincidentally a former classmate - the high school heart throb she could never have back when. I give this story high marks for bordering on sentimentality but remaining honest. There is also a nice balance struck between sadness and humor. I know people who are just like the nurse in this story. She is valiant but not perfect, in other words, the way humans are supposed to be. I especially liked the relationship with her potential rival, and how two mature women put their own self interest and their past behind them to focus on the needs of their ill friend. A fine lesson about love, friendship, and coming to terms with death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top 5 book on my Sustainable List","review":"I am a voracious reader on anything that could remotely fall under the sustainable topic. I was at the library and ran across this book and at first thought it is over 4 years old then add 1 year for publishing and well the info is going to be outdated. But to my shock this book was so detailed that the system about how the author automates his home for energy performance can be done even better today but using newer technologies. So it is relevant. Personally I am looking to build a super insulated ICF home. I want to understand how the thermal mass is going to effect the home so I can right size my equipment. In short the technologies to do this cost money.

Plus, I did not get any resolution from the company when I complained way before this and another review were posted."},{"rating":"2","title":"An easy reading history of Air combat tactics.","review":"Ever wonder why flying circuses of huge numbers of planes grew up in the first world war. Why did airforces forget the reasons in World war two and have to relearn the power of the big wing formation in the battle of britain? Why do modern jets fight in pairs? This book is a well written run through the broad history of air combat showing why certain tactics developed. It covers air engagements from the First World War up to Vietnam. It is written in a non-technical and non-military way which is appealing to the layman, but the strategic analysis is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"very amateurish video","review":"I hate to be the bad guy but this video deserves at best 1.5 stars.

It is a compilation of some video segments that are in home video quality. The narrator of the video even has trouble speaking. The information in the video is partial. The person who teaches fly casting doesn't cast well himself. I can go on and on with this. I know it is a free market. There is no quality control in the video making business. But there are many good videos, books, and online information out there for beginning fly fishermen.

Directions are confusing with poor illustrations or nothing at all about several key elements. The desk is disassembled and requires two people to even begin assembly. The last straw was the drawer sliders which had no explanations and took extra hour to properly mount. This product had minimal functional hardware. Most pieces were venier press wood and would not hold a screw if you had to attach it a second time. The last irritant is a return policy that holds you responsible to repackage in an as shipped condition(original packing materials). They do not refund an excessive $64.00 original ship charge.

As someone who is post charismatic and believes in spiritual reality, and as a person of science and the englightenment, this book helps make sense of the biblical world view in the modern age. And in doing so, calls us to radically live out the believe that LOVE is stronger than death and violence, and that the way of Jesus is transformational not coercive."},{"rating":"2","title":"The third book...which we are reading now","review":"This is the book where the rubber really hits the road in Wink's epic effort to help us see past the governing myth of \\"redemptive violence\\" .

I recommend these books for anyone who is or wants to be AWAKE...no matter what religion or value system they espouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I carefully reviewed the used options looking for a book that would be as minimally used as possible. I was very disappointed when I got the book beause it was marked in various ways on many pages. The description said nothing about any marks. I would definitely not have bought it had I had an indication of marking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honestly... an amazing book","review":"Reading this book, was a life-changing experience that has remained with me always. Wink leads the reader in detail, down a path of recognition and understanding, which for me, felt simply undeniable. He provides the framework and the language to unmask the subversivity we innately recognize, but feel so unable to effectively name and confront. I didn't necessarily agree with everything, but then, Wink's presentation isn't one that coerces the reader; so there's no feeling of needing to agree or disagree. The book provided a recognition --and a framework-- that has completely changed the way I think, and has thereby changed my most every action -- profoundly for the better. You'll reccognize that much of what he writes about is unabashedly rearing its head now in the US."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Vanessa Mae and Born","review":"I bought this expecting it to be similar to Vanessa Mae and Born's more upbeat works (as it was advertised in a commentary on CNN). I was disappointed. It is slow and it was hard to tell that their Doors cover is Riders On The Storm. Definitely get Vanessa Mae's The Violin Player, or Born's Bond or Shine instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good; worth buying; has some weaknesses","review":"This CD is, in my opinion, not as good as AHNplugged, but I would buy it just for their version of \\"Riders on the Storm\\". Their arrangement of \\"Riders\\" is very bluesy - the violin trills and bending of notes and the wild cello solo are great. The other pieces of the CD are not as strong as \\"Riders\\" except, certain movements of \\"Swing Shift\\" which are very moody and evocative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"Still not very good. I rarely listen to any of the songs here. I think any Posies fan who really likes this album just couldn't wait for anything new from the Posies....like someone dying of thirst. I just listened to it one last time hoping I missed something after puchasing the new Blood/Candy. It gets worse each time. Only song I like is \\"Conversations\\". Very disjointed album. \\"Could He Treat you Better\\" might be the worst song they've ever done. The 2nd half of the album is almost unlistenable. I can't believe this is the way I feel as I have every album from the Posies including Jon and Ken's solo efforts. I hope the magic comes back. PS: go pick up Jon's \\"Songs From the Year of Our Demise\\". It is fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bummer...","review":"I've been looking forward to this album for quite some time, and man, what a bummer that this is what I've been waiting for.

What's up with that? There is a lot to be said for passionate vocals, but this is overdoing it. Do we really need another Rod Stewart? Also, the songs are a bit dull, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE album of '99","review":"The best album of '99 quite frankly. This album has everything from the smooth, haunting 'a minute longer' and 'stopped to fill my car up' to the rock/metal combo of 'roll up and shine'. There is no such thing as a bad 'phonics song as this superb album proves. Kelly Jones's distinctive voice is addictive and carries each track to perfection. Having seen them live, I can assure you that they are the best band to come out of the UK for a very long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generic and boring","review":"This Bryan Adams-esque album is throughly unoriginal and uninspiring. Everything on the album has been done before. Totally undynamic and uninteresting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rod Stewart in a Welsh Accent","review":"Haing decided to stoically, 'keep their charisma a closely guarded secret,' Stereophonics have emerged for a second time with second-rate tunes. These have so far only managed to rival Travis in their banality and this reviewer recommends if you find personality at all endearing, you try never to meet any of the Stereophonics or listen to them ever. The tunes are reminiscent of sawing part of your skull off and only irritatingly not painfully tapping on the exposed grey matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring outdated rubbish","review":"Everything about these derivative pub-rockers sucks. Their slow songs are plodding and empty, and Kelly Jones' voice is horrendous. A Minute Longer, which no-one on here seems to like, is the most dull and listless piece of tripe I've ever heard. Just Looking and Is Yesterday Tomorrow Today? are at least as bad. The rock songs are also pale compared to so many other groups including the ones they model themselves on (Live, Black Crowes etc), Bartender and the Thief in particular really is nothing new. The only 2 songs here I even vaguely like are Pick a Part That's New and T-Shirt Suntan, those two are quite sprightly and pleasant. And as a tip for the future- don't try and go all arty on us with piano lead tracks like the album closer. It doesn't make you appear sophistocated or talented, just emphasises how vacuous this record is. No wonder even tourign with Live in the US has only resulted in 30,000 sales there."},{"rating":"1","title":"hit and miss...mostly miss","review":"if you can get past the grating voice of the lead singer, you might find this album mildly enjoyable. The record is very schizophrenic and doesn't really put a stamp on what it's trying to do. The band is at their best when they ease off the pedal and put some rythum into their music. There are three great songs on this album - Hurry Up and Wait, A Minute Longer and I Stopped to Fill My Car Up - that exemplify the band's strength. But anytime they try and reach beyond their capabilities, the music falls apart. Having said that, the 3 great songs, along with 4 or 5 more decent ones, are worth the money. It's not the greatest album in the world, but it's not bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Proud to be welsh","review":"OK guys and girls go out and buy this album. Infact go buy both their albums. I can say hounestly that if you love great music then you will love these three Welsh boys. I am from Cardiff and these three make me feel even more proud to be Welsh. With lots of different songs ranging from upbeat tracks to laid bake ones, these albums have everything. So stop wasting time and go to the CD store. By the way, all those people that rate this band poorly had better stay anonymous.

This music is strictly for those who like their music predictable. Have recently made the mistake of recording with Tom Jones, horribly misjudged as cool (in an ironic sort of way) in some quarters and hilariously awarded a \\"Brit\\" award for being the UKs best male artist.

At the age of 65, nobody listens anyway. But, I would like to let you know that the camouflage tarp I purchased from Amazon, 12'x16', was of very poor quality. Now, I realize this stuff is made in China, but the setting of the grommets was atrocious. One of them was half over the edge of the tarp, and had cut the continuous \\"rope \\" in half. One fell apart as I took the tarp out of the packaging. I was disappointed that there was no plastic reinforcing on the corners. There was no way this tarp would hold up to a heavy storm, so I actually cut it up and sewed it into a pup tent for my grandson.Do yourselves a favor and take a 12'x16' camo tarp out of the package and check it out.

A very inspiring book, if you are about to break some rules, in order to have some interesting memories. Partly very funny, although always with a taste of bitterness. It's a little rougher than Sugerman's 'Wonderland Avenue', but with a similar plot. Should not be mistaken as a permission for a serious drug habit, though.

So, a student could read this text but still be lost on rounds or in discussions on the topic.The text also strongly recommends giving hypertonic saline to any patient with a sodium level of < 130 \\"even if there are no symptoms\\". It defends this by stating the benefits but doesn't discuss the risks or the need for central line placement.

He is a wonderful lyricist and song writer and I'm very impressed with his work, in general.I bought this CD hoping to find more of his music, similar in style to that of Rocky and Shock Treatment. I was disappointed with this CD mainly in the fact that the songs are all jazzy, lounge sounding songs. No electric guitars or catchy, fun choruses. There doesn't seem to be the same angst and fire that was in his other works. They seemed very mellow and tame, not cutting edge, rebelious, and memorable.He does show his singing talent in this CD.

(Conversely, Young\`s \\"Well tuned Piano\\"--especially on the DVD version--is an extraordinary event.) Just Stompin\` reminds me of a Bang on a Can concert I saw where Terry Riley was featured; Riley\`s piece (with numerous drug references), which took up the second half, became total unadulterated tedium and I darn near got up to leave early. I could sense the whole audience getting listless and upon the work\`s conclusion there was a smattering of tepid applause at best and people split from their seats before the musicians even left the stage. So save your shekels on Just Stompin\`unless you buy it as some sort of investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stompin the blues (to death)","review":"This is minimalist blues by a guy noted for playing for hours.Slow 15 minute prelude, then he stomps on it hard for another coupla hours.Incredible amount of notes out of that piano.

The manga art style is very well done, to a point where it puts the comics of this country to shame. Also there are a few surprises, such as a scene with Dewback mounted Stormtroopers and a certain Sandcrawler. If youre after something original story-wise this isnt it. However the almost word for word use of the script causes the John Williams score to play in the background of your thinking. Overall a beautifully illustrated volume. Worth it for all those fans who MUST have all things Star Wars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The end is coming","review":"Book 4 was a disappointment, but this book redeemed the series. Looking forward to reading the final story."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but not good","review":"I am a scientist and usually very good at decoding complex texts, but this series is beyond my abilities. I just can't keep up with who all these many, many characters are and how they interact with whom. As a result, I have found the best way to read these books-just pick a story line (I picked Stronghand and the Eika) and skip everything except text pertaining to that storyline. Otherwise, the plot (if there is a central one, which I doubt)just sprawls and spreads, much like a coffee stain on a paper towel. In fact, I would have given this book (and the series) one star if it weren't for the originality of the Eika. Ms. Elliott deserves two stars for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, mid-level fantasy","review":"This was not worth the wait. I say that even though I enjoyed most of the other books in the Crown of Stars series, but this one is harder to like for some reason. I think Ms. Elliot is a fine author, but a weak and inconsistent one, not up with the likes of the big name female fantasists like Melanie Rawn, Elizabeth Hayden and Robin Hobb.Having said that, however, it was nice to see something in the series out again, especially since Melanie Rawn seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth. And this book has already been spammed by the Robert Stanek [or as my friends and I refer to him, Robert Stank] e-publicity machine, which means they think it is a good enough book to ride the coattails of.It's not that bad, respectable for middle of the road stuff.

Kates previous books were interesting and I could see this being a series as big as Jordans \\"Wheel of Time\\" But it seems that she has decided to try (unsuccesfully) to gather all the loose ends in this story so that she can have a finale in the next book. There is so much information in this book it was very hard to keep afloat. Sorry but this was a sad and lackluster book, hard to read and digest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!! I could not put it down!!","review":"Kate Elliott has to be one of the best authors of our time. Her characters all connected in ways that you did not imagine. Liath, willing to sacrifice herself to save the world. Sanglant willing to sacrifice himself to save his father. Stronghands struggle to save his blood brother Alain. The bond that connects each of them together as they race against time to prevent the great cataclysm that could destroy them or save them. I could just not pull my eyes from the book.

Their is a bluesy New Orleans feel to some of the tracks and other tracks have that typical modern jazz feel but again Ray puts his own innovative touch into his playing.

The book is well written and thought provoking.Yet, the appendix discussing the meaning of \\"headship\\" and submission in Biblical texts is weak and inaccurate in it's analysis of the meaning of the original languages of the New Testament.

The DVD packaging is flimsy and the plastic parts that hold the DVD in place aren't even attached to the packaging for each season. It's like it was made at home by a counterfeiter. The image quality of the DVDs are terrible!!! It's like they didn't even try to make it better.

Next, like I said there are playback issues with at least half of the disks. I don't think it is scratches, etc.. It is the way they were pressed at the factory (factory?????).

I've always liked his work and I can't blame him for the problem, after all the director saw the dailies, and surely he caught on to the fact that his lead character was unlikable. But with a lovely European love interest, nice scenery and a \\"catch a thief\\" plot I had hoped for better.(Not to forget the illusion to The 49 Steps, with the two leads handcuffed to each other.) But there's no charm in Harry Donovan, you only root for him as he's the least dispicable character. Understanding his motives and feeling his losses comes a bit late, and the beret and careless Pollock wardrobe doesn't help. If you have nothing else to do on a rainy day it's nice for the art, but don't go out of your way. As for Patric, save your time for The Journey of August King, it's wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made for TV quality","review":"Saw 'Victory' and thought it would be fun to see Irene Jacob in something else.

Jason Patric was cynical enough to have actually accepted such an offer as was made by sleazy dealers. His love for his father was so delicately displayed that it belied some of his cynicism. Having done extensive traveling I enjoyed the scenery, but being much too busy to spend time with most immature plots dwelling on excessive violence rather than story material, this film was highly recommended and I agree with every word of praise.

This is an absolutedly riviting film to watch,and it is fantastic entertainment. I have watched this picture several times, and bought it as gift for friends, because it is fun, has great action, and a beautiful woman (Irene Jacob), who is not in enough American films. Like all subjects, if you know too much about art and art restoration, it can ruin the entertainment value for you, but I think this picture could even motivate potential artists. Hollywood will never be noted for historical accuracy, because they are in the entertainment business.Watch this movie and recommend it to your friends.

The movie went almost unnoticed at the Box-Office maybe because of the leading actor J. Patric who failed to give an appealing character, however the movie is balanced by I. Jacob and R. Steiger.

The bimbo accidentally spills coffee on the hunk and before long they are in bed. And then there is the story. It panders to every taste likely to be in the theater: chase scenes, nudity, and violence for the teen males; melodrama for the weepers, and a happy and wholly unbelievable ending for the lame of brain. This film has \\"made for TV\\" written all over it.Ian Richardson makes a brief appearance as a barrister, and he must have been ashamed to take the money. Rod Serling, from the sad look of him, needed all the cash he could get.

First off, you have to have a DVD player that plays CD-R's, tipping you off that it is recorded on cheap stock. That should have been my first tip-off not to open this horrible waste of $30. I bought this because it had Christmas music, and I figured I could wire it through my surround sound and fill my home with the hollowed tunes of Christmas during my annual Christmas party. First off, the picture quality is no better than a home movie and the sound wasn't recorded in 5.1 or 2 channel sound. The sound is terrible, so don't worry about the great Christmas music feature. To add the icing to the fruitcake, there is actually a point in time, where you see a hand put more wood on this \\"Crackling Fireplace.\\" If I had to do this all over again, I might pay the 3.97 for this DVD that I paid for S/H.

The game's premise is quite interesting though: to stop a massive, mystery threat, Spidey must team up with a laundry list of his rogues gallery (Green Goblin and Doc Ock among others) and take down hordes of other baddies. While Friend or Foe starts out fun, the repetitive beat downs quickly degenerate into sheer boredom. The game looks decent enough, and the characters are well animated, and the moments of voice work are a nice touch too, but there's simply not enough here to warrant more than a rental at best, and that may be too generous. There's some fun moments here and there, but in the end, Spider-Man: Friend or Foe ends up being another quickly assembled, rushed out, licensed game that could have been better than it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb Game","review":"The characters are very cartoonish and my son hates it.

If you're a fan of Trance, and know what you're getting into by buying this album, go ahead. If not, however, do NOT fall victim to reviews that claim that this album is on the cutting edge of any genre. It just aint what it's cracked up to be in terms of innovation. It's sound is super-electric, it definately doesn't have any jagged edges. Ya Dig?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love this Book","review":"This book is totally charming.

Its great to see such a unique gift book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute Pictures, That's About It","review":"I found this book quite derivative of Jim Dratfield's Pug Shots both in look and feel. And while the pictures were well done, they don't hold a candle to Dratfield's work. The addition of the Tao-ish story didn't add very much to the overall experience. Buy Pug Shots instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barking praise for The Tao of Pug. Woof! Woof! Woof!","review":"If you love pugs, you'll love this book!

They fit well and the polarization is great for reflections (water or snow especially). Only gripe is that Amazon advertised 2 kinds with the same model number, but different prices.

I expected a Master of Kung Fu to be consistent about every body movement. The stretching exercises were incredibly sloppy and demonstrated not by Carradine but by the students, maybe Carradine can't do the exercises anymore. I would recommend Rodney Yee's \\"Yoga for Strength\\" to see the proper form for most of the stretching exercises. I'll keep looking for a Kung Fu instructional tape showing correct form. As for Carradine's Tai Chi tape to accompany the Kung Fu tape, I much prefer Terry Dunn's Tai Chi. For the simple and important reason, NO SLOPPY MOVEMENTS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This series of DVDs is the best series of travelogues I have seen and I've seen many of them. It is very comprehensive and well done. They give you just enough historical background of each city then show you both the outside and inside of about 20 of the top attractions, such as cathedrals, museums, parks and palaces. They don't waste time showing you things that you can see anywhere as some travelogues do-- you see what is unique to the city being discussed. They concentrate on the core of the city. You will feel like you really know the city when the DVD is done. This DVD was produced in the 21st century so it is a generation more up-to-date than most travelogues you see. Both the photography and the narration are excellent. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick Tour of Dublin and Paris","review":"I was disappointed with this book in that it seemed to very briefly cover some standard sights at each of the two cities. There was little depth in the coverage and a great deal of interesting information about the cities and their cultures seemed absent. I would prefer separate and much more intensive books about each of the two locations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource","review":"Especially for the beginner to intermediate aromatherapist and cosmetics maker, this book is an excellent resource. It's organized well and gives a quick description of most of the oils one would find themselves using to make potent, functional products. Lots of great recipes, though don't expect to be handed the methods for creating soaps, lotions, etc. This is more about proper usage of oils and their functions. I always have this book handy. While in no way is it a comprehensive source for all oils and all treatments, it remains one of my favorite resources for quick reference, even after several years."},{"rating":"2","title":"The wait is over","review":"It seems like it's taken forever to get this album out, but the wait was worth it. No, it's not the Cult, but Cult fans will definately appreciate it. The sounds of this album remind me a bit of the Cult's 1994 self-titled album, but also a bit of EMF, for those of you that may have actually heard their second album. This really isn't a fair comparison, however, Astbury's songs are deeper and much more musical. \\"Back on Earth\\" is an excellent beginning and gives ease to the listener who might worry that they wasted their money, and the rest of the album is no dissapointment. Now, if only I can wait long enough for the Cult's new studio album in October!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No sign of The Cult....","review":"First of all, this rating would have gotten 2 stars, but the lack of photos and lame cover bumps it down to 1. As a long-time fan of The Cult, I thought I would branch off and follow Ian Astbury's solo career, anxiously awaiting this CD, and hoping to forget \\"Holy Barbarians.\\" Oops! Unfortunately, he has derailed from the dark, poetic lyrics of such CD's as \\"Love\\" and \\"Dreamtime,\\" along with the Native American themes, and the arena-rock influence of \\"Sonic Temple\\" and \\"Ceremony.\\" If you are a fan of the early-to-mid career of The Cult, steer clear. If you are a fan of the later synth-pop sound of The Cult, the single \\"The Witch,\\" or the album \\"The Cult\\", then this CD may be for you. This CD is very synth-pop. The track \\"Metaphysical Pistol\\" is trip-hop. The last track, \\"Shambala\\" is instrumental trip-hop/ambient. Meanwhile, I will be hoping Ian and The Cult return to their roots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ian's a great singer and weak writer","review":"I LOVE Ian's voice. He can sell any song...except apparently ones he's written without Billy Duffy. I don't find this cd to be worth more than one or two pained listenings. Other than his great voice it has nothing to recommend it and it's NOWHERE near the level of his work with the Cult. Even as a 'stretch' or experiment it achieves very little. It's a musical equivalent of a vanity press release, an ego ejaculation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesomely awesome!!! Wait is awesomely a word?","review":"Another fox show cut off in its prime. This series had several actors and actress that have really made it. This series is quirky x 3, over falling water and inanimate objects that talk, wait am I giving too much away? Anyhow, it's basically a story of how everyone is trying to find themselves but they are not always where they think they will be, understand?

SIgh. On the positive side, that last show was a good one - you could even pretend that it tied up a few loose strings. You could also pretend it was a mini-series with a happy ending. Does that work? Sort of, but not really. Oh, well, I'll look forward to the \\"Pushing Daisies/Wonderfalls\\" crossover in a few weeks. And maybe I can find an orange Mold-o-rama lion somewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good show taken before it's time","review":"I know Networks are in a business but why put shows on and then cancel them after 4 episodes. I wonder about their decisions sometimes but at least DVD's are giving shows a second chance and I am thankful to get this one.I \\"Wonder\\" why shows like this don't find an audience (like Arrested Development) and the only thing I can can come up with is that most people like Safe shows that aren't too out there; that they can listen too while they are reading the paper or changing the kids diaper. Some shows however are the types that need your devoted attention. This was one of them. Perhaps it went over people's heads, I dont know but FOX could have rallied around it for at least 10 episodes.Give it a chance. It deserves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"You must buy this and watch it.","review":"The only regret you will have is that there were not more episodes to buy.

It was well worth the money. No show has made me laugh so much as such ridiculous things. Every character is so interesting and I wish we were able to see more of them. Also there is a nice bit of extras, surprising for a cancelled show. They even give you a bit of inshight on how season 3 WOULD have started.Since this is such a popular set right now, I hope FOX is upset with what a great show they let slip away. I wonder if it is a possibility for more episodes, maybe direct to DVD. I know I would buy them in an instant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fox really dropped the ball on this one....","review":"This has got to be the wittiest show in my lifetime. I was gutted when Evil Fox Network canceled this show. They never even gave it a chance. It is cleverly written, brilliantly acted, and bloody fantastic. I participated in the 'Save Wonderfalls' campaign and it is great to see all our hard work paid off. The DVD was released yesterday and I haven't been able to tear myself away from it ever since. In fact, I took the entire day off work just to watch the entire series. Okay, that is a lie. But I would recommend this series to anyone who is sharp-tongued and slightly cynical. Snarky is as snarky does."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT was the Network Thinking??","review":"Answer...they weren't! For this terrific show to have been yanked after just 4 episodes absolutely defies Reason! I never saw the show on television, but the DVD features 13 WONDERFUL episodes.

EVERYONE connected with this show should feel tremendously proud.Likewise, the opening credits and the manner that the scenes are portrayed through a ViewMaster is pure Genius!No WONDER everyone is tuning into cable and DVDs with the \\"brilliant\\" Network Execs making these kind of dumb decisions.You will never regret ordering this series - no matter how old or how young you are.

The main character (Jaye) really ruined the show for me. She's annoying, tactless, and tries so hard to pass for cute it makes her scenes almost excruciating to watch. The show's saving grace is it's supporting cast.Just to clarify- I did watch all of the episodes hoping it would get better and there were some entertaining moments, but not enough to warrant an above average rating. I think this show had too many writing and production problems and tried to focus on too select of an audience. It also felt very dated at times (while watching I got the sense that it was a mid 90's show but was surprised to see that it was made in 2004).Overall, \\"Wonderfalls\\" lacks the charm and wit of Fuller's \\"Pushing Daisies\\". I recommend purchasing the latter instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Show I never Watched on TV","review":"I Regret To Say That Seeing the Trailers on FOX For this Show Made me not Watch it.So After Watching The Show On DVD I wish the Hell I did.This Show is just great.

It's a beautiful series that was shown its entirety on satellite TV here in Britain. It got a real shot here, and nobody who has seen it can BELIEVE it was cancelled by Fox.

This show was supposed to compete with Joan of Arcadia and it couldn't.Joan Girardi is everything that Jaye Tyler couldn't be. I couldn't get passed the first episode of Wonderfalls, because Jaye was rude to everyone and used language that you would never hear Joan Girardi use. I will not waste my money on the DVD series.

I had to give this crap one star, it deserves zero in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Wonderfalls","review":"What does a network do when it has a series that is witty, well acted, and thoroughly original?The answer, in the case of Wonderfalls, is to cancel the show after four episodes, presumably to make way for yet more \\"reality\\" TV. Since only four episodes were shown, though all thirteen were made, the only way to see the best new show for years is to buy this DVD set.It is difficult to draw comparisons between this and other shows, which is a strong part of its appeal.

It had been a while since I laughed so much at a show and I watched it the following weeks as well. Then I discovered Fox had dropped the show. What were they thinking? Fox it seems, is too caught up on instant ratings. A lot of good shows need to grow their fan base. Unfortunetly, this show didn't even have time to do that. If I was over the exec. that decided to drop this show I would have had him fired! Great show, I'm buying the DVD to see the other 9 episodes that didn't air and hopefully they will be just as great!

This was one of the most creative and amusing shows I've seen on tv in a long time and I faithfully watched each aired episode despite Fox's annoying habit of continiously moving it around to different nights and time slots. It must have finally hit the genius network execs over at Fox that they could make money off releasing the dvd set - I was losing hope since they didn't seem bright enough to realize the gem of a show they had in the first place. I'm also happy to note that there really isn't a dumbing down of America like the media would like us to believe. There was a great outcry when this original show was cancelled and it was upper management who thought this program would be too \\"smart\\" for the average viewer.

Earlier episodes in the series strike the proper whimsical tone, while later episodes tend to be either too grim or too frivolous. Winning performances, intelligent dialogue, quirky cinematography and some well-placed CGI work make this series a treat for the eyes and ears, even when the plots veer off the mark. Extras are surprisingly plentiful, considering that the show was canceled after four episodes -- various creator and cast commentaries, a music video, and a special-effects featurette.

After the last episode aired I waited for a few weeks to see when the rest of the series was to air. Found out online that it had been canceled. Long story short I had to see the rest of the shows. As soon as it was released on DVD I ordered it. As of this writing I have probably watched this series about 4 times. Of all the shows that are out now (reality shows are a waste of air time to me), \\"Wonderfalls\\" would have (could have if given a chance) been one of the better shows on TV.

It's original, clever, funny, intelligent, and sweet, qualities which apparently are enough to get one canceled in this age of \\"Show me the Money of my Dead Bachelor's Apprentice's Sole Surviving Dance Idol.\\"The saga of this show's demise is strangely familiar to that of Firefly, and proves that Fox can't be trusted with decent material that isn't an overnight sensation.I won't summarize Wonderfalls; there are enough of those here which do a very good job.

Wonderfalls is unabashedly witty, and it introduces sentimentality without sinking into sappiness. As if these features of the show aren't enough to make it worthwhile, the integration of the muses is really believable--it never seems like one of the animated characters isn't really in the scene. I love the wax lion and the cow creamer!Eric & Jaye's romance is beautiful--the actors did a great job capturing the giddiness of a promising new love as well as the frustration complications can cause. The other characters' storylines were also promising.The DVDs are full of treats for the viewer. I'm not sure we need to see a TV show in widescreen--personally, I prefer full-screen, but I know a lot of people like widescreen better.

To my surprise, it was a very nice movie. As it turns out, Miley Cyrus is a pretty good actress. She is much better than what you see on the television show. The whole style of acting is much more mature but still quirky and cute. The movie was sweet, funny, had great music, and had a very nice story line about a girl getting back in touch with her roots.

I just want to add to what has already been said on this page about this book. While it looks like it is clearly written for 6 year olds and above, there are some things which would make it better written for older children and adults. The concept of the need for good people to be in hiding from an evil government may be too hard for children to handle well. Also, there is repeatedly brought up that these are legends and may not be true. That may also be too difficult for a child's mind to understand well. Otherwise the story is beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great historical book","review":"I bought the book for my granddaughter who is studying the saints. She was thrilled with it. So was her teacher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch. A disappointment.","review":"Fiona Walker has always been a wonderful, funny read, with sympathetic and believable characters. This book is an unfortunate exception--with an overly convoluted and contrived plot involving a murder that may or may not have happened, a bunch of ghosts that may or may not exist, arson (or is it) culminating in what seems to be a completely pointless death-defying midnight point to point race. Her characters have always seemed clueless in their relationships, but in this one they seem almost bizarrely so--affairs flare up, everyone declares undying love, and then it's over in six pages. Long-lost lovers reunite and squabble, reunite and squabble, over and over again until I really couldn't have cared less how it all turned out.Fiona has always been on my list of indulgent pleasures, but this one is not in her usual league."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Endless writing to nowhere. This was disappointing compared to her other works, French Relations being her best. Dragged myself through it without really caring about any of the characters... arsonist hits small, horsey town filled with dysfunctional, constantly drunk families. Plot twists and mysteries were confusing. It wasn't funny, believable, or really interesting in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am a big fan of Fiona Walker, I have read French Relations, Well Groomed, Kiss Chase and loved them. For some reason, Tongue in Cheek missed the mark. Not only is it much too long, the characters and plot are for lack of a better term muddy. You get a general sense of a person, but not really how they think, what drives them, etc. It's just a miss and in my opinion a waste of time. I would not read this book again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressive","review":"So Fiona Walker has always been a must read Author of mine. But seriously, this book was just rubbish.

The DVD is of such bad quality that I could not watch it all and returned it to the store.As the reviews below point out there is nothing Digital about this release, it is a bad transfer of a VHS copy.

Shame on them for releasing such shoddy merchandise and taking our hard earned cash for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disgrace.","review":"I agree entirely with D. O. Hanlon. This DVD should be avoided. The picture quality is abysmal; looks like it's been transferred through a grey filter.

I'm returning mine for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth watching","review":"This is one of the worst movies I ever watched. It was poorly produced, and the story is really poor. I really felt empty and stupid after having watched this movie. I was waiting (or hoping) for the movie to become more interesting, for the real story to start, and eventually the same poorly produced movie, just dragged on and on until the end. The story is almost non existent, and trying to get something out of this movie, is almost like trying to squeeze juice out of a dry orange.By the way, if you are buying this movie because you think you will see Juliette Binoche acting, forget it.

However, this book only deals with \\"The Last Emperors of Vietnam\\" in the first chapter, devoting little more than a paragraph or two for some of the Nguyen monarchs. The rest deals with the Indochina War and the political fights leading up to the intervention of America. It costs alot for a very small book and has a very misleading title.

It is a practical book. I bought along with \\"The Complete Photo Guide to Sewing\\" and \\"The new Step by Step Decorating Projects\\" both from Singer also. Although there is repeated information from one book to the next, there is also additional information in each one. For example the \\"Complete Photo...\\" includes information found on this book AND int \\"The new...Decorating Pr..\\", but it also has addional information and projects. So it worked for me as adding more info as I kept advancing from one book to the next. In the end, you will end up with your own personal techiniques (what works for one person doesn't work for the other,) or simply because you can come up with your own ideas, but nontheless all three books are good to have, especially if you own a Singer Sewing maching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound!","review":"The vinyl this album was pressed on was never that good, too much surface noise.

I'm glad I've got most of the albums so that I won't miss so many good songs. It's very frustrating as a fan that we can't get every hit, isn't that why it is a box set and not a \\"greatest hits\\" package.

This great collection illustrates the staying power that most groups could only dream of having .. I really enjoy this cd a whole lot.. The earlier material not to familiar with most of it .. either it was slighty before my time or i was just a lil guy ..

Half of the book describes the build of a drum - everyone looking at a drum for 5 minutes learns this by himself. Then, for every drum a whole page is wasted to describe how to put the head on the shell - why? the process is similar on every drum. Exactly the same happens with the description of streching the head. No info at all is given what influences the torsion of the snare wires have on the overall sound. No mention of tuning the two heads of a drum in relation to each other. In summary, this book has no value to a drummer with an experience of 3 months or more.

You have to turn the power COMPLETELY OFF to make the light stop flashing. The remote control will not turn the power completely off either (designed this way for some reason) so you have to manually go over to the unit and push the power button to make the darn thing stop flashing.I guess it's not a HUGE deal, but when you're lazy and spoiled like me and you're used to everything being controlled from a single remote - it gets annoying after a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"crap","review":"this thing is garbage, i got it and it didnt work from the get go, it opened for me 1 time, and played a movie, i just checked to see if it was working, when i went to go use it, it would not open, it is garbage! dont buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PAL problems","review":"I bought this DVD player because it supposedly played PAL DVDs as well as NTSC, and the price was right.

All of Tiger army's stuff is great. Especially the cover of the misfits - american nightmare. I have read reveiws from people that said they didnt like it, I thought it was a very good cover of it myself. To hear any misfits song done by a very talented psychobilly band is good.

Its very short, but its worth every bit you pay for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"for the fans' interest","review":"This CD is directed towards serious Tiger Army fans. It a collection of some earlier Tiger Army recordings. It is certainly not as good as the other CDs, but it is not intended to be. It is more for the interest of the fans than for those with a more casual interest in the band.If you do not have the other CDs, get those first. They show the true capabilities of Tiger Army.

Alexander plays with a big tone with lots of Dexter influence and swings very hard. The rhythm section really cooks, especially veteran pianist Harold Mabern, whose energetic and active comping gives the group a very full sound. Solos from Mabern feature left hand independence that makes you wonder how many people are sitting at the piano. The version of Bewitched in an up-temp 6/8 is burning. This album was definitely worth my money, and prompted me to go get more of Eric Alexander's records."},{"rating":"2","title":"An essential CD","review":"This is jazz at its best!

This series is truly in a league of its own. This is what TV is made to make you feel like. Friday Night Lights really make you feel as if you know every single one of the characters. The show creates an emotional tie that is like very few that I've encountered. The show has you cheering for the under dogs, laughing at the jokes, and crying at the heartache. Once you're hooked, you will make time to see every episode (even if it does happen to be on Friday nights). Fans of the show were fortunate enough to have DirecTV realize the exceptional work by all of the cast and crew to bring it onto their network in hopes of saving it. Hopefully NBC will realize what a treasure they have in their hands and nurture it like they should of from the beginning. This show is truly worth fighting for and we all will be waiting for season 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive show","review":"I started watching this series with my son because he plays football and it seemed like something I could tolerate.

Like it's sister volume of shorts ('Invasion!') this has a very high standard, with few real dips in the overall strength of the stories. As noted in an earlier review this does contain both a 'Brunner the Bounty Hunter' story, and a tale relating to the 'Von Carstein' vampires. If you are fans of either, then it should be a good buy.

WotF almost meets them. Almost. It's an unevenly paced tale of rather standard human-crosses-over-to-fantasy-land kinda story, with a few twists, but not much more than that. It's good reading if you're a Williams die hard fan and it sure beats the heaps of garbage that get published every year under the fantasy umbrella, but if you're looking for the genius spark that has ignited Otherland and kept it burning for thousands of pages, you probably won't find it here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked this book","review":"Well, I just got finished reading this book this week and I really enjoyed it. It was well written, epic, and kept me going from page to page. This is the first book from Tad Williams that I have read and I plan on exploring some of his other works now. Great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"I quite enjoyed \\"War of the Flowers\\". The descriptions of Faerie made me envision it, and even want to check the place out! Skewing off in a different direction, I'd like to see this made into a film, similar to \\"NeverEnding Story\\". With today's CGI capabilities, Faerie & its inhabitants wouldn't be difficult to bring to screen. For other delightful \\"alternate reality\\" material, read Harry Turtledove's books. \\"War of the Flowers\\" is very like Turtledove's writings. To compare Williams' \\"War of the Flowers\\" and Turtledove's \\"The Two Georges\\" is, in a nutshell, the same thing, only different. Turtledove's 1996 America, in \\"The Two Georges\\", isn't too different from Williams' Faerie in \\"War of the Flowers\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"3.5 to 4 stars for writing","review":"The War of the Flowers is an imaginative, stand-alone fantasy that is largely set in the world of the fairies. The main character, Theo, learns of the fairy world through a journal of his great-uncle. Later, he escapes from a spirit hunter sent by the Remover of Inconvenient Obstacles, a fairy bogey-man/assassin. As the book progresses, Theo discovers more about his origins and his role. Unfortunately, once these key elements are revealed, the plot then rushes towards a largely uninteresting show down, which is why this book only earns 3.5 stars (boosted to 4 for good writing), instead of 4.5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why does it take this author so long to get going?...","review":"I love Tad Williams Memory, Sorrow and Thorn, without question this trilogy is one of the greatest of all fantasy fiction work in my mind.This book however, not so much. Its not that the book was bad, but Tad just takes way way to long to get going. When I pick up something like MS&T;, and its a 2500-3000 page epic, I am willing to grant some leeway in terms of how long it takes to really get the story going.. if it takes 300 or 400 pages, to set everything up, I'm willing to invest that.Sadly, it takes Tad that long in this story to get going too, I do not lie when I say up until about page 400 of this book (its about 600 pages or so if memory serves) I could have really given a crap less if the main protagonist had lived or died.That said the book did end relatively strong, nowhere near the calibre that Tad has shown he is capable of, but certainly not a bad book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderfully fun read","review":"I must say, I was a little skeptical coming into this one. I wasn't sure if it could be written in such a way that could captivate your interest for 675 pages. But, Tad Williams has done it again.He uses so much folk lore that you are drawn into the story, allowed to live and breathe with the characters. At times, I admit, Theo Vilmos seemed stilted as his conversations were leading and forced, but this doesn't happen much.The colors that are evoked when your imagination takes over is fun, not to mention the playfulness of the whole novel despite having a somewhat darker undertone to it. Combine the two with Williams' writing and you are left with a great tale with some surprising results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodbye nobody","review":"How the mighty has fallen! After Otherland we have this lukewarmTad Williams whit a whiny, self-pitying loser who's also one of the most unlucky charachter in literature. He's called in Fairyland, where all he does is stumble and whine and make an utter fool of himself when a pixie comments on his obtuseness and slowness in ubderstanding situations. The Fairyland is a stereotype whit nothing that hasn't been seen a thousand times, and the only seemingly original idea (the Goblin Revolt) seems borrowed from Harry Potter's series. An utter disappointment. Goodnight nobody,indeed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Master!","review":"This was one of the best and most enjoyable reads I'[ve had in a long, long time. Williams is a master at what he does, and I'm only sorry this is a one volume series. I'd love for a return to the land of Fairie to see how Theo is doing several years later. I highly recommend you read this book! you on't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid story that eventually grabs you.","review":"In typical Tad Williams style, the first two hundred pages are very hard to get through. The story flows nicely, but it starts off slow. The first two hundred pages, you might as well be reading about your next door neighbor.Also typical Tad Williams, the last 600 or so pages just grab you and does not let go until you are done with the book and breathless. Whatever you think you know about faeries? Forget it. Tad has come up with his own world, own rules and made it quite... logical.Very nice read. Not his best work, but when I was done I found myself wishing it was a series. If you like fantasy, you will like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW, I CAN\\"T BELIEVE I READ THE WHOLE THING...","review":"This was painful, but after 500 pages I marched on. My reward was saying I finished the book. Williams can sure write, but there was no character I even cared about. The story is dull, long, and uneventful. Next to Outerworld this is a red headed step child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disapointed","review":"What is with writing characters that are so annoying and obnoxious? I had very hard time finsihing this book. It was by no means the worst book I've read and Tad is a clever writer but I found myself disliking the lead and his little fairy companion and it made it hard for me to give a damn.Admittedly it got better near the end but the first half of the book was so damn hard to read..why can't writers make a character likeable, I understand the whole anti-hero thing but I just do not find it appealing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dull","review":"Mr Williams can write and he has proved it, but honestly speaking this book is bad. It is not exactly ill written but that is about all that can be said for it.The story is not awful but it is neither original nor particularly interesting. Characters are not endearing, villains give no thrill whatsoever. Writing is fairly neat but it builds little tension and this book is very easy to put down.I surprised myself to think: \\"How many pages still?\\" more often than it is good for a fantasy book.Little emotion, little tension, little interest. This time Mr Williams has not worked well."},{"rating":"1","title":"how disappointing","review":"I know there is no way Tad Williams fans won't buy this book, but I would highly suggest borrowing it from the library or a friend.With such an interesting topic as fairlyland in the modern era it's difficult to believe how poor this books was. The plot was weak and extraordinarily predictable. The characters were lackluster and in general appeared as little more than watery shadows of other characters Williams had already created. It was a very uninspiring read.Williams is typically such a good author, but I guess everyone has their worst work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Plot and Weak Characters","review":"I am used to reading top notch Fantasy. I guess I am spoiled by George R.R. Martin. I didn't enjoy this book much. The plot wasn't very intricate and the characters weren't likable. Perhaps a young adult would enjoy this book more. Tad Williams has other books which seem to be better. I would skip \\"War of the Flowers\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Two hundred pages in...","review":"... and I still didn't care about anyone in this book. I put it down and haven't picked it up again.All of the characters just felt flat. We've got the struggling artist who just doesn't fit in anywhere, the fiesty sidekick, the incompetent aristocrat, a couple of mysteriously evil villains, and none of them feel real.The take on the world of fairy is interesting, but it's not enough to carry a story filled with soulless characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Granddaughter loves","review":"Bought for Christmas.

I've been doing pilates for several years and have found it difficult to find more advanced at home tapes. This was a bit of a disappointment. It is reformer exercises done on the floor without the reformer. It is like trying to row at home on the floor, without a rowing machine. Pretty pointless, and you don't really get much of a workout. I have done other pilates workouts that incorporate reformer exercises but these are done with a resistance band to simulate the reformer, which is much better. This workout does not incorporate a resistance band. I would not recommend this tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginner workout that isn't too challenging","review":"As all of the Pilates studios in my area require a large part of my rent to attend, I decided to venture out and buy a couple of Pilates DVDs instead.More than Mart Pilates is an easy, gentle workout. The exercises don't really incorporate the benefits of the reformer, and while the instructor frequently emphasizes that the aim is repetitions, not exhaustion, you might find your mind wandering off and wishing for something a bit more challenging.Having taken classes, I luckily knew of modifications to many of the exercises to make them more challenging. But, if your only access to Pilates is these DVDs, check out some (free) Pilates websites and use their modification tips. Or, simply purchase a more challenging DVD - this one fails to live up to the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really mat pilates","review":"I've done mat pilates for at least 2 years.

I'm using this as part of my regimen to rehabilitate my back. You start out resting on this for 5 minutes, then increase by a minute a day until you get to 20 - 30 minutes. This is what the instructions say, which differs from the add that says 15-20 minutes. I like that this gently stretches the spine and neck. I think it could be cheaper for what you get, it's basically just a foam piece with a fabric cover. You are supposed to relax on it, not multi-task by watching TV at the same time. The instructions also say that it's not designed to sleep on. My experience is that it's not particularly comfortable, but this is to be expected because stretching in general isn't all that comfortable. It does get more comfortable with continued use. This seems to suggest that it does make the spine more limber."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy is you're short waisted","review":"If you are shortwaisted it hurts your back and your neck, no relief here and there is no way to adjust.

Even the MC's they brought into the studio for a couple of tracks lacked the style and intensity we've come to enjoy on earlier works. Gone are the infectious groove liques and sampling that defined \\"Make Some Noise\\" and \\"Here's the Deal\\" as two of my all-time favorite albums. I can only hope they'll \\"Re-Evolve\\" back into the band they once were."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to follow instructions, but can be improved","review":"The step-by-step instructions are easy to follow.

I would say that used in conjunction with a good therapy program this book has the ability to be useful but I wouldn't recommend using it as a sole source of treatment. It has some suggestions that are just completely unrealistic (for example, removing ALL low fat, sugar free and diet foods from your home) and it seems to simplify things a lot. Admittedly, this book is probably not geared toward individuals like me who have been suffering for over 12 years and need more intensive treatment. Worth a look? Yes. There are many sections that helped me come to some important realizations so I would hate to discount this book entirely. However, I don't recommend that you use this while forgoing visits with a qualified counselor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imagination in its purest form","review":"This is a video for children - boys and girls from age 2 up to..... It's made in New Zeeland and has only children dressing up as different characters in the 10 different chapters. There is no talking only singing by fe/male singers. It starts with child/ren coming into a room finding a dress up box, opens it up and puts a piece of clothing on over their regular clothes. As the first item goes on, will the viewer suddenly be transported into this imaginary world, that can either be on a beach with pirates, in the bushes with spiders and butterflies, a meeting with zoombies, frankenstein and dracula, or even into the computer. The face painting on the children is fabulous. My daughter who is now 3,5 years old, has been getting it from the library since she was about 2 years old. Now is she able to watch it at home.

When we got it and put it together for our 5 year old for christmas, we were so disappointed but not as much as he was and still is. It is hard to pedal and we can't get it to pedal easier. It is a waste of money and we won't buy anything made by this company again, ever. We were reluctant to buy from the internet because of all the shipping and etc and now we are doubly sorry.

I could not find any indication that this go-kart has been in fact produced by Kettler. Neither on the box nor in the product insert nor on any other part is the name Kettler mentioned as manufacturer. It is produced in Thailand. The quality of this go-kart is very poor. The seat construction is a catastrophe. For me the most annoying thing is that our 3 year old son cannot use it since the go-kart is far to big for a 3 year old child. And our son is above average height. In other words the age recommendation which is given by the manufacturer and Amazon is not correct. I strongly discourage people to buy this item.

Four of the \\"original\\" members are still in the band (those in the band at the peak of thier popularity in the mid seventies).On this album, PFM plays songs from their 30 year career. As others have noted, the songs from their early days are great and the band still plays them with a lot of energy and innovation. Starting in the eighties, PFM changed direction, and the later material is not very good.The first disc is the better of the two, since it consists mostly of the older material. There are a few very good tracks on the second CD.A much better album to get would be 10 ANNI LIVE. This is a 4 CD boxset taken from concert tours from the seventies. It is absolutely fantastic.

The organization of chapters and sections within chapters do not carry the reader through a logical progression of the topic.As someone else said, the author attempts to write like a scientist which just results in a confusing book that does not give the reader a clear message or understanding of the topic.

The book covers a wide range of topics from the value of business intellligence (BI) to the issues of data quality and information compliance. Additionally, the book includes a quick reference guide at the end of the book which is an executive summary of the topics presented and at the end of many chapters includes a section titled \\"To Learn More\\" which provides links and references to further explore the topic.I am an IT professional familiar with BI, charged with designing and implementing a BI stretgy for my organization.

Lodge does a wonderful job of lighting up the things that we do know about James and adding some conjecture. His rendering of the opening night of \\"Guy Domville\\"--James's flop of a play--is both comic and tragic, and would itself be worth the price of the book. Unlike Colm Toibin's \\"The Master\\" (another fictionalized biography of James), Lodge doesn't succumb to saccharine or sentimental devices to close the book, but remains sharp from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Novel about An Interesting Novelist","review":"\\"Author, Author\\" is a well researched and entertaining novel about the novelist, Henry James. Its a must read for James'fans. Interestingly, his writings are remembered, studied and reprinted while more popular novels of his time ('best sellers') have been forgotten.( There is a lesson in that fact somewhere!) Beginning and ending with the deathbed scene of James the novel focuses on his later years and his time in England, and especially with his relationship with Constance Fenimore Woolson and George DuMaurier. At the book's end, author Lodge, specifies what details he has made up. I found this book to be a page turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Praise and a question","review":"An excellent book: perceptive, passionate, meticulous, and intelligent. Lodge accompanies his subject wisely, sympathetically, but never indulgently. He's especially good at showing how literature can never transform itself into a performance art, and what makes the theatre a precursor to the book, an implacable mechanism. The novel is an entire education in taste, literacy, fashion, and the essentials of fiction.Lodge's account of literary friendships and of the curse of Envy is spot-on. James himself would have blanched at its accuracy.I have a question. The UK edition (paperback) is printed in 8-pt type, virtually unreadable to those over 24, which is surprising, since people under 24 don't read books. And especially novels about dead white American-Victorian Anglophiles. So how about it? Is there any edition, anywhere, printed in something bigger than 9 points?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strictly for fans of Henry James","review":"I'm not a fan of Henry James. I didn't make it past Page 83 of this book, so my judgment isn't worth much. But if you admire James as a writer and would like to know about him as a man -- a cold fish if there ever was one -- this book may be just right for you. It's even written in a slighlty plummy style, reminiscene of James's writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still makes me laugh and remember.......","review":"I think series six is really the last phase of That 70's Show which keeps the gang together.

This is a great foundational DVD. It provides a great warm-up rotine and an analysis and presentation of the postures of the form. Also, there is a section that analyses the most basic and repeated movements in the form and how they relate to self-defense. This gives the practioner a sense of what each posture in the form is inteneded to be doing as one practices the form. It would take a beginner quite a while to become proficient in just this foundational stuff, but by the time one did become proficient at it, one's Tai Chi practice could easily move into more advanced stuff without running into set-backs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A reference video, not for the beginner","review":"This is really more an encyclopedia article than a learning video. Note also this video comes from a fighting art viewpoint; no relieve-stress-on-the-beach scenes here. As reference it goes into MUCH detail, but for beginners this is too tedious a place to start. All the moves are shown from about the same angle; new learners usually need more help than that and will find this video frustrating in that respect. If you already know the form, are looking for more historical background or are coming from another martial art you will find a lot of data. So it all depends on your goals - to learn the form look elsewhere, this is way overpriced. But if you already know the form and are looking for details, you may find it interesting.

First off, the key to having a smooth installation is to clean the windows AND the frame. I made the mistake on the first side of not cleaning the frame, which caused dirt and debris to slide into the film and eventually caused the film to slip off. The solution to this error was to use painting tape (blue one) temporarily. Second, watch a youtube video or two on installation of window film. This will really help in understanding the basics. Third, purchase the Gila kit with squeegee, you can't install this without it. Finally, be patient.This is a great product if installed correctly.

Ended up havingto first repair and repaint the frames before applying the film. Just a fewflakes that settle on the adhesive side of the film near the edges will makeit impossible for the film to properly attach.This is made a bit harder also because of the curl in the product as itcomes of the roll.When removing the adhesive film, do not let the product touch itself.Where it does, the adhesive film is damaged.All in all, not as easy a product to work with in non-sterile situationsand when alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"Don't waste your money.

The \\"Gila Complete Application Kit\\" cost $8.48 while selling on amazon.com for $17.88. Shipping costs would have been $7.81 and $7.37 respectively. The total purchase price at Lowe's was $40.77 versus the $67.57 at amazon.com, if we are to naively assume that only one instance of shipping charges would be incurred.

Never was this more clear than when I reached the end of the CD and heard the track, \\"Let Him Fly,\\" a cover of the song originally recorded by the wonderful Patty Griffin.

So let me tell you-- don't waste your money! I tried to give it a fair chance, but alas, you can't like a cd that has only 3 good songs out of 13. Most of the songs are just plain boring and they just don't stand out. There are a couple songs that would give country a bad name \\"Goodbye Earl\\" and \\"Sin Wagon\\", moms don't let your 7 year olds listen to these songs! And someone was VERY right! The lead singer Natalie Maines sounds like she strained a few vocal chords doing this album. I was thoroughy unimpressed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one!!!!!","review":"I am \\"very disappointed\\" with the new album of \\"FLY\\" by the Dixie Chicks. The music is very \\"odd\\" compared to their first Mega Hit album. I don't care for \\"any\\" of the songs and would return the CD if I could. My advise - don't buy it...your not going to missing a thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointed","review":"I loved \\"Wide Open Spaces.\\" Every song on that album was terrific. I was expecting something great again. \\"Fly\\" was not up to my expectations. I listened to the whole album hoping to find a good song. The first track was great, but everything else was bad!!! Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good CD","review":"I was truly disapointed with this CD. It was terrible. Only about one song is worth listening to. The Dixie Chicks dont really use much feeling, and the CD is way to over rated. Its kind of sick how over rated this Cd is. If you want a CD , completely opposite, buy SHeDaIsy: The Whole SHEbang. Those girls can sing alot better than Dixie Chicks. The CD is a big waste of money, you'll really regret buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down","review":"This album contains a few good tracks, like Ready to Run, but all in all it was a big disappointment. Wide Open Spaces was a much better album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flying High","review":"The Dixie Chicks' \\"Fly\\" is an awesome CD. Natalie Maines is the star attraction of this band, with her awesome, rich vocals. Sisters Emily Robison and Martie Seidel play banjo and fiddle, respectively, and together, these three Chicks make beautiful music.The songs on \\"Fly\\" run the gamut from funny (\\"Hole in My Head,\\" \\"Good-bye Earl,\\" the oh-so-controversial single about a woman who offs her abusive husband) to heart-wrenching (the beautiful, subtle \\"Let Him Fly,\\" \\"Cold Day in July\\") to sweet (\\"Cowboy Take Me Away\\"). As I've said, Maines has a powerful voice, and she utilizes it to its fullest. The vocals flow out of your stereo and into your ears, and you can't help but sing along."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment!","review":"I am a fan of the Dixie Chicks and I absoultely loved Wide Open Spaces, but this album is a true disappointment. I still had Wide Open Spaces in my car CD player until I purchsed Fly, and guess what???? I have now put Fly in its little plastic case with all my other CD's (stored away) and have put Wide Open Spaces back in my car. I was expecting so much more form this album and I am very disappointed! These songs are not catchy, not entertaining, and some are actually a bit offensive to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoping for a little more...","review":"After Wide Open Spaces, I expected a little more. I love the Dixie Chicks but what were they thinking! The singing isn't the problem...the music and lyrics are. I don't understand why people don't stick to what made them."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down","review":"I never really paid much attention to the Dixie Chicks music until I heard \\"Ready to Run.\\" I really loved this song and bought the Runaway Bride soundtrack because I liked the song so much. I decided to buy their Wide Open Spaces CD and I really liked it, so I was excited when I heard they were coming out with a new CD. Well I purchased the new CD and WOW, was I disappointed. Another listener wrote in and said that if you like \\"Ready to Run\\" save your money and just purchase the single. I have to agree with that listener, \\"Ready to Run\\" is the only good song on the whole CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to snuff","review":"I have enjoyed the \\"radio\\" play of the Dixie Chicks...but their albulms leave something to be desired. Their latest effort is no exception. Sure there a few good songs...but for the most part...you will only like this albulm if you are just getting out of a relationship...its depressing. Its a shame to see such musical talent wasted on mediocre songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better luck next time....","review":"This album was nothing like the first. The first was far better. I think Natalie (the lead singer) should step down and let Marty or Emily sing, she would be better off for it. In this CD she sounds like she is trying to prove something, by screaming and hitting high notes and hanging on to those hard to reach notes. I found only 3 or 4 songs that I could bear to listen to. Natalie needs to give the other two a chance. My suggestion would be to NOT buy this one. It wasn't worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty awesome....for country music","review":"Most of you who are debating whether or not to get this album, or their previous album for that matter are probably thinking...\\"well I don't know, I'm not a fan of country music and the majority of the people writing these reviews are from southern states\\". Well here's a surprise for you.....I'm from Hawaii, where there ISN'T a country music scene, and I absolutely love the album and the artists. I had the privilege of seeing the Dixie Chicks live at Lilith Fair and I was completely floored. They were just so incredible and fun! While they are country artists, they're so different from the traditional ones I've been exposed to, in that they are so fresh, cool, and fun. They seriously are just amazing. So if you're having doubts, take it from a non-country listener: they are worth taking a chance on....you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good as the first one","review":"I really liked (loved) Wide open spaces. And this CD is just as good. The Dixie Chicks have such an original sound, and unlike Shania Twain (who I like also) they opted not to do cross over country, just country-country. This CD rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chicks stat true to country","review":"With \\"Fly\\" the Dixie Chicks return with an album as good or better than their smash \\"Wide Open Spaces.\\" Music is clean, exciting, and honestly moving. For all their glitz and glamour the Chicks stick to traditional country sounds with plenty of fiddle and twang. Two excellent ballads(\\"Cowboy Take Me Away,\\" and \\"Cold Day in July\\") and the swingin' \\"Hello Mr. Heartache\\" highlight the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"chicks deluxe","review":"I'm a rock&roll guy and i love this cd, great follow up. This cd is better than the superb WOS. My favorites songs are : If i fall... - cold day in july (as good as joy lynn white'version) - goodbye earl - sin wagon - some day you gotta dance - hole in my head. etc....keep on rockin' chicksps : If you like \\"hello mr heartache\\" make sur check out the cd by honky tonker MIKE HENDERSON"},{"rating":"2","title":"I came home stuck it in the CD player and listened!","review":"Wowe! Girls you are awesome. Ready to Run rocks! I love the harmony in it! GoodBye Earl is really funny and Cowboy is great. I can't wait to learn all the words. Keep it coming chicks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I hear that you mention 4-H in one of your songs. True?","review":"My name is Dennis Elliott. I just heard that 4-H is mentioned in one of your new songs. I work in the State 4-H Office at The Ohio State University and I am interested in knowing what the song has to say about 4-H.Will someone please tell me?"},{"rating":"2","title":"What an Awesome CD","review":"From the opening notes of Ready to Run to the heart tugging final strains of Let Him Fly, you will not find a more complete country western/country rock offering, this albumn alone has brought me back in to the country music fold. The harmonys, song writing and musicianship are outstanding. These ladies are to be commended, it's no wonder they cleaned up at the CMA's, and yes the Chick's most certainly do ROCK, keep up the awesome work Chick's, you have a fan for life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"spirit, spunk, and a little heart","review":"This is a fun, playful mix of songs, but they didn't forget to put their hearts in it, either. Love to hear Natalie belt out those in your face tunes, like Sin Wagon, but there are a few soft ones in there, as well. I love every song on this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice album","review":"This album is more overproduced than Wide Open Spaces, and sometimes is better. Ready To Run - creative song 2. If I Fall You're Going Down With Me - not so good. 3. Cowboy Take Me Away - very good ballad. 4. Cold Day In July - not as good as track 3. 5. Goodbye Earl - cool story. 6. Hello Mr. Heartache - copy of \\"Tonight the Heartache's On Me\\" from Wide open Spaces. 7. Don't Waste Your Heart - good. 8. Sin Wagon - nice bluegrass song. 9. Without You - best ballad on the album.10. Some Days You Gotta Dance - great up tempo. 11. Hole In My Head - almost a rock song. 12. Heartbreak Town - nice ballad. 14. Let Him Fly - good, but very short."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Liked It","review":"People try to compare this album to Wide Open Spaces so much. I would like to say that you can not compare the sophmore album of the Dixie Chicks to their first. This record is more racey, more upbeat, and just plainly said better. I liked the music and I like the Chicks. The only thing that I didn't quite like was the lyrics of \\"Goodbye Earl\\" and \\"Hole In My Head.\\" Premeditated murder is not a good topic to sing about even if you do not believe in it and \\"Hole...\\" just repeats a few words over and over, but hey there is a few complaints in every cd. The cd will make you dance, cry, and sing all at the same time: a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality songs and music","review":"This is a quality album full of great songs that cover a spectrum of topics, from \\"Cowboy Take Me Away\\" to \\"Goodbye Earl,\\" and sophisticated music production. The music fits the songs really well. I don't usually pay close attention to the music, but I couldn't help noticing how polished the music was. The producers really did a superb job on this album. Natalie's voice is much more controlled on this album - able to be passionate and powerful as well as sensitive and soft at the same time. It's also a relief to hear more of Emily and Martie on this album. I was beginning to think they were nothing more than backup singers. The Dixie Chicks have themselves one fine album here."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it?","review":"The recording quality is horrible. The songs remain the same. The first CD was far superior. A complete waste of money and time. They're better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw talent","review":"I don't have this CD yet, but I heard the Chicks play many of the cuts at Lilith Fair in Indianapolis last August just before the release. Not being a country fan and not then familiar with the group, I wasn't expecting much. What I saw and heard from those three little women blew me away! They had everyone on their feet in no time flat. Not only was their performance highly polished musically and visually, but they made it look easy and had fun doing it. These are truly consummate musical artists, with no need for electronic gimmicks to make them sound good. What Natalie can do with her voice and Emily and Martie can do on the fiddle and banjo, as well as sing, are the products of pure, raw talent. I'll never forget it. Sign me up, Chicks..."},{"rating":"2","title":"No country please!","review":"For the longest time I hated, I mean really hated country! Until a very good friend of mine introduced it to me. I thought I was going to hate it but, the very first song she played me was Goodbye Earl and after that I just fell in love with the Dixie Chicks. I love the raw vocals of their lead singer and how they play their own instruments. I must admit the ballads, especially Cowboy take me away and You were mine off of wide open spaces are my favorite but, all their songs are great. You can really tell that a part of them goes into every song. So for anyone who thought they hated country I suggest trying on the Dixie Chicks for size and you'll be pleasently surprised!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great album","review":"I was never into country but after listening to the first three songs on this cd over an over again (my carpool loved them) I was hooked. This cd has caused me to look more into country. Even my friends who don't listen to country that much bought it too. It has many great songs and I recommend it to anyone. There are a few songs that I don't like but the majority of the cd is wonderful. Some may think that Dixie chicks may not know how to dress (I like their clothes) but they sure can sing and play awesome music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grows On You Like a Cute Blonde Fungus","review":"There's so much I absolutely love about this album. Far more diverse, upbeat and fun to listen to then their first albm, FLY is a gorgeous album. A lot of fun and spunk throughout. Their writing more of their own songs now, and it cleary made the difference here. The songs have a lot of layered meaning to them, and reveal new things with multiple listens, but they don't forget to have fun in the process. \\"Hello Mr. Heartache\\", is a great twanger, and \\"Goodbye Earl\\" is the best song about killing a partner since Johnny Cash's \\"Delia\\". The Dixie Chicks are the real deal, and it's nice to see how much success they've gotten from this album. I've listened to it off and on about 20 times so far, and am still not sick of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way Above Average","review":"It's really refreshing to hear some artistry in popular music. I hold a Master's Degree in music, and I have often annoyed my friends by being (too)critical of pop music. Thanks to the Dixie Chicks and their producers for something I can enjoy that's not over 30 years old. As far as \\"Good Bye Earl,\\" it's fun! Why does it need to be politically correct!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy","review":"I realize that when you pay $.01 for an item that it wouldn't be in the greatest condition but I didn't realize it wouldn't even be playable. There isn't ONE song on the whole CD that can be played. Wasn't even worth selling for a $.01 let alone the S&H that I had to pay to get it to me. Ridiculous!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The next step...","review":"This follow up to the wildly successful debut WIDE OPEN SPACES has much more energy than its predecessor. The Chicks seem much more eager to give it their all and their styles seem to gel much better than on their first effort.While this CD has the energy/consistency their debut lacked, this time some of the material leaves them hanging. \\"Cowboy Take Me Away\\" and \\"Sin Wagon\\" are the strongest tracks, with their rendition of \\"Let Him Fly\\" coming in a close second. (Although Patty Griffin's original is much more raw)The rest of the songs seem a bit repetitive and pre-fab, and while \\"Goobbye Earl\\" has shock value and a catchy chorus, it's not really anywhere near as substantial as it could be.A step in the right direction, but still not 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than stellar follow-up!","review":"The Chicks are still looking good and the stories on the songs are interesting, but the music left me wanting. Wide Open Spaces was a knockout (like the chicks!) but this new effort makes me think that perhaps the gals need to be less headstrong and more open to advice on their next CD. Will probably still buy the next CD when it comes out but will be hoping for somthing better. In the meantime, the Chicks hit the top of the chart this week so maybe it is just me!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best CD EVER!","review":"This is by far the best CD I haver ever owned(right next to \\"Wide Open Spaces\\"). If you don't have it , get it soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't expect this to happen!!","review":"When I heard that the Dixie Chicks were releasing a new album, I thought that there was absolutely no way that they could put out a better CD than Wide Open Spaces. Well, I was wrong. This is some great music, and I'm sure I'll like it a lot more as the songs grow on me. For potential buyers: don't expect this to be Wide Open Spaces Part 2. It's a different feel from their first album, but the new tracks show much of the group's evolution as musicians and songwriters. To Natalie, Martie, and Emily: Thank you so much!!! Y'all are awesome!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE THIS CD!","review":"WIDE OPEN SPACES WAS TERRIFIC, BUT THIS CD IS GROSSLY OVER-RATED. IT IS A WASTE OF DEAD PRESIDENTS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They are just not that good.","review":"Maybe it is because I am not a huge country fan. This music has crossed over to hit radio and I just don't hear it. It isn't GREAT country music. It is so-so country music. There are better artists and better albums. This is country-music lite, for people who can't handle the taste of the real thing and want something bland..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fly,Fly,Away. PLEASE!","review":"They stink.

Like Garth, Montgomery Gentry, or Hank."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Reason I Don't Like The Dixie Chicks C.D.'s","review":"Sorry for the Dixie Chicks. I very much disagree thattheir songs are good. I just think that their songs are notpop songs wich I like in opinion. And when I listen to theirsongs I don't have the feeling to dance or sing a long with the song. That's because I don't enjoy the songs. Usually Iwould love to sing a long with the song when I enjoy thesong I am listening to. EXAMPLE: I love to sing-a-long withAvril Lavigne's songs because I like it. Sorry very,very,much for the Dixie Chicks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time... or MONEY","review":"How long will we suffer through bands like this? Why do the record companies have to decide for us what is and is NOT good music?This isn't about \\"country\\" or \\"rock\\". This is about having your art fed to you by people who want your money!Wake up. Don't buy. People who claim to like this record (or ANY Dixie Chicks album for that matter) simply don't listen to the music. Please spend some time and try to find real musicians out there.Go grab a Sam Bush record if you want some true bluegrass.Buy some Doc Watson, Willie Nelson, or James McMurtry.The stuff these \\"girls\\" put out is pure garbage.Nice skimpy clothes though and I have to say I've been drawn to their magazine covers! Whoooo hot. Not that it has ANYTHING to do with musical ability. What a shame that they can make money on this at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"This band really stinks!","review":"The vocals are like fingernails on chalkboards!The band really needs to find a new day job.Country music they are not.

Natalie's voice changed somewhat but still grabs my attention and doesn't let go until the end. Y'all are the BEST! I loved Cowboy Take Me Away, Let Him Fly and all of the other songs.

I didn't think the Chicks could top their previous effort, \\"Wide Open Spaces.\\" How can you top perfection, after all? But after listening to \\"Fly\\" a couple times, I will say this: it is every single bit as good as \\"Spaces,\\" if not better. Where else can you get a genuine country hoe-down atmosphere, a gutsy larynx-ripping belter of a lead singer, along with flame-fingered picking and a sassy sensibility? Not many places. But sure as heck one of those places is right here, on \\"Fly.\\" For anyone who (even remotely) enjoyed \\"Wide Open Spaces\\" and all those country-lovers who have yet to discover these Chicks (where have YOU been?), snap this one up. It is solid country gold. You won't be disappointed. Anyone want to make bets that they can't do it a third time around? I'll take that bet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite as good as Wide Open Spaces, but very, very, close","review":"The Chicks have done it again! They are some of the most talented girls that I have heard come out of Nashville in a while. I like everything that I hear on the album so far with the exception of \\"Goodbye Earl\\" and \\"Sin Wagon\\". I found both to be in very bad taste. I was disappointed because all of the rest of their songs are so clean. \\"Goodbye Earl\\" seems to be very sick-minded to me. All in all, the Chicks are rapidly becoming one of my favorite groups. I can't wait to see them in concert! I wish them luck in the music world."},{"rating":"2","title":"WAY GOOD!","review":"These talented girls really mix it up on this CD.

Yeah, sure there are a few catchy tunes like COWBOY TAKE ME AWAY and SIN WAGON, but for the most part it sounds like songs put together at the last minute to fulfill a contract.

Recently I had been hearing from my friends how great \\"Fly\\" was and once heard \\"Goodbye Earl\\" on the otherwise dull Grammys lat February, I had to run out and get the CD.I do not regret that move.\\"Ready to Run\\" is a great opening to this CD. \\"Cowboy Take Me Away\\" is a ballad that Martie co-wrote and \\"Goodbye Earl\\" is funny as hell. \\"Hole in my Head\\" and \\"Sin Wagon\\" are atypical country songs that appeal to fans of pop as well. \\"Without You\\" is just plain beautiful. I can't find anything wrong with \\"Fly\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"More raw and from the heart than \\"Wide Open Spaces\\"","review":"I couldn't believe there could be an album better than \\"Wide Open Spaces\\", but the Dixie Chicks proved me wrong.

But my friend had the CD and when I came over to her house, we listened to it and I loved it even more! I made her come with me to buy it that day. Towards the end, the songs get a little slower, but I think that it's better that way because it unwinds. I'm not normally a country fan-I really just like Tim McGraw and the Dixie Chicks. I'm more into Christina Aguilera, LFO, etc. But I loved this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest album ever","review":"This is my favourite. There is no song I don't like on this album.

And I can honestly say that the only time I've stopped playing it was when my husband told me that our neighbors might kill us if I played it one more time. The best tracks are \\"If I Fall...\\" \\"Cowboy Take Me Away\\" \\"Cold Day in July\\" \\"Without YOu\\" and \\"Heartbreak Town\\". The album rocks, a perfect blend of Natalie Maines' strong soulful voice, Emily Robison and Martie Seidel providing great harmony and fiery musical solos, and heartfelt -- and often funny -- lyrics. There are a couple songs that I don't love, but that's all right, too. You can't please everyone all the time. I was reluctant to buy this CD because I wouldn't typically describe myself as a \\"country fan.\\" But the Chicks make Country a style and not a category. They're fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites!","review":"This is a great cd! There is a great variety in the songs and you will want to play it over and over!

The singing and playing excels, but the material falls short. The \\"Earl\\" track is downright offensive and the country equivalent of Eminem; it trivializes spousal abuse. If the tables were turned, and it was three men conspiring to murder an abusive wife, there'd be a huge, and appropriate, public outcry. These women have a lot to learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alicia'a Thoughts on \\"Fly\\" by the Dixie Chicks","review":"I think this c.d. has a lot of good songs on it and some are kind of too fast and peppy and need to be turned down a notch. The songs that i like are well actually kind of depressing. They are slow, but they have a nice beat. Some examples of these are \\"Without You\\", Cold Day in July\\", and \\"When You Were Mine\\". The fast songs are good for when you are in the modd for them. They are very upbeat and happy. A couple examples of these are \\"Wide Open Spaces\\", There's Your Trouble\\", and \\"Ready to Run\\". So I like most of the songs and sometimes the fast ones. I guess i like the slow songs more because you can listen to them longer and they have a pretty melody. So overall I would definetly recommend this c.d. to anybody.I give it tqo thumbs up, or 4 stars, whichever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Too Good","review":"I didn't like this album. \\"Cold Day in July\\" was a beautiful, smooth and fairly tight ballad when done by Suzy Bogguss, now it's grating and messy. If you want soulful, sincere Country without too much twang, Suzy Bogguss, Nanci Griffith and Mary Chapin Carpenter are the way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the quality I thought it would be","review":"Half the album is below average, the other half of the songs are average with only one standout (Cowboy). The mix is not good sonically. The lead vocal starts to grate after a few listens. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dull and twangy followup","review":"If you like ready to run, save yourself some money and buy the single, because the rest of this CD is blah! Sample that Earl song, where they half sing-half talk, if you like that country \\"roots\\" sound, then you might like this, but if you expected something like their first CD, which I really liked, then you will be sorely dissappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not anywhere near their potential.","review":"I just listened to the new CD. It won't even make it to my truck's CD case. I'll just listen to their Wide Open Spaces CD and see if anything they write next hits the radio. I don't think any of the FLY CD songs are good enough for the radio. Also they are really bent on telling everyone they can do whatever they want to: Sure, that's true, but they won't have any fans promoting an attitude like the comments on the insert in the CD. I predict the Dixie Chicks are going to fade away very soon. Sorry for the bad news."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was not impressed with their singing.","review":"I can't stand the Dixie Chicks.All their songs sound alike to me, with only the words being different. I appreciate you all giving people like me a chance to review their C D . You certainly saved me some money, because i work a lot and dont get a chance to keep up with the latest recordings, so sometimes i will buy music without having heard it just because it is popular and everyone is raving about it. So thanks again for allowing me to review the C D. before buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell short of my expectations","review":"I liked the Dixie Chick's video \\"Ready to Run\\" the title cut on this album, and given its sales success, thought I'd give \\"Fly\\" a try. Unfortunately, this one is going straight to the garage sale. There are two good cuts -- \\"Run\\" and \\"Cowboy Take Me Away\\" -- which, coincidently, are the Chicks' two most recent videos. The rest of the album is whine-y. It isn't that the Chicks aren't capable of nice harmonizing, it's that the material on \\"Fly\\" doesn't show that off. A more capable producer, and maybe less rush to put out an album, might have avoided that. The Chicks sound great on \\"Rolly Poly\\" on \\"Ride with Bob,\\" the new CD by \\"Asleep at the Wheel\\" so they can hit the mark with ease. Hopefully, they will next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this album.","review":"It has fun, smart and overall great songwriting and Natalie has some of the best vocals in music. Personal favorite: Sin Wagon. Sometimes you just need to feel like putting on some funky boots and doing a little hell-raising. Also, Cowboy Take Me Away, Some Days You Gotta Dance, ... ok pretty much everything on this album rocks. I know 10 years from now I'll still listen to this music, and that is more than I can say for pretty much every major \\"artist\\" of the last 5 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean, clear country with a touch of bluegrass.","review":"Dixie Chiks managed to make a collection of fast ditties that are clean and clear.

I went to see them in concert with Tim McGraw and I couldn't have been more pleased! On the new cd \\"Fly\\" the song \\"Cowboy Take Me Away\\" is the sweetest song ever! It makes me want a cowboy to take me away!I really like the whole cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dixie Chicks Rock!","review":"Sophomore albums usually come with a little letdown, because in most cases the first album is so good it can't be duplicated. Duplication definitely isn't the case with FLY and FLY is the best album to debut this year. The Dixie Chicks brought life back into country music with their wild ways and they work so well together. One quote from their tour manager sums it up. \\"They are SUCH girls. They are their audience. They like to shop, do makeup together...it's like a f---in' slumber party on the bus. I'll go on and they've got their pajamas and their blankets and some girlie movie going--it's the cutest thing.\\" About \\"Goodbye Earl\\"...that is such a funny song. And the instrumentation in \\"Sin Wagon\\" is amazing. :) Emily rocks with that banjo. Go get FLY, I promise you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"check out patty griffin!!","review":"if you like \\"let him fly\\" the last track on this album, make sure you check out the 2 cds by the woman who wrote it, Patty Griffin.The chicks followed up their amazing \\"Wide Open Spaces\\" with another outstanding cd. Critics are usually hard on so-called sophmore projects, but even if the critics don't like this cd, the fans will. The chicks mix country and rock with emotion and humor. it's a winning, human combination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dixie Chicks \\"Fly\\" is awesome!!!","review":"I bought the cd the day it came out and haven't been able to stop listening to it. There is not one song on it I don't like. My favorites are \\"Goodbye Earl\\" and \\"Cold Day in July\\".

Light on character development.But, good actors doing a craftsman-like job.However, the Tango release is currently the worsttransfer that I own. Technically, the black levelwas incorrectly set when making the transfer. Thisresults in \\"noise\\" and \\"pixelation\\" of anything dark.Think of night scenes and dark blue uniforms, etc.You can also see the automatic gain control \\"pump\\"when scenes shift from bright to dark. Also, theMPEG compression is poor resulting in pixelationof suddenly moving objects in static scenes.I wouldn't buy it unless you need to see the prequelto \\"Zulu\\". Nowhere near the impact and emotionalinvolvement of \\"Zulu\\", one of the great films."},{"rating":"2","title":"TANGO listens !!","review":"Hi guys. I am the Director of Sales for TANGO Ent.We are very pleased with our releases of these 2 outstanding Action films, WILD GEESE & ZULU DAWN.Trust us, we would have loved to have access to a Widescreen version of ZULU DAWN. I have ben informed that our owners searched far & wide for a widescreen version that was PRESENTABLE for the many fans out there.Unfortunately, that was not available to us. Believe me, we tried.Having said that, TANGO appreciates the support from all of the fans out there. That passionate support tells us we did good, just by releasing it the way we could.Sit back, enjoy one of the greatest action films of it's time, and be aware that if a VIEWABLE version in widescreen is made available, we will try and get it.But viewing it any way, is better than none isn't it?

The original film is 2.35:1; the DVD is 16:9 letter boxed (not anamorphic)so about a third of the film is missing and it is clearly obvious in quite a few scenes. The quality of the transfer itself, while not awful, is not particularly good either."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you liked the movie but didn't like the transfer","review":"Many of the reviewers of this DVD like the movie but are critical of the transfer. It is terrible, and my rating is for the transfer, not the movie. There is a solution if you have a region free DVD player: Go to Amazon.fr and order the French release, titled \\"L'Ultime Attaque.\\" Just turn off the French dubbed version and watch the origianal English. This transfer is pristine with an aspect ratio of 2.35.1. Compared to it, the version offered by Amazon.com is shabby, indeed, and the French transfer is like watching a different movie. Remember, the French version is region 2, so you need a region free player, and shipping makes \\"L'Ultime Attaque\\" a bit pricey. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Train Wreck DVD","review":"This is one of my favorite movies of all time and I've been waiting ever since the invention of DVD for it to appear.

When I saw that the DVD was going to be released I jumped with joy and I had to keep myself from running to the mailbox (like the dork that I am)when it arrived.So you can imagine my disappointment at the lack of a widescreen version the p*ss-poor extras and worse, the godawful sound and atrocious coloring.

It is not gory, twisted or filled with sex. Instead you get the straight forward story of Crusoe, who misses his family and stays faithful to his wife even though he has not seen her in six years. The show takes liberties with the classic novel, however they are usually not harmful to the overall story. Philip Winchester is excellent as Crusoe and Tongal Arnold Chirisa is fabulous as Friday. They complement each other well. Also appearing in the series to excellent effect are Sean Bean and Sam Neil. The show had only twelve episodes, however they are certainly worth the cost of the DVDs if you enjoy action, intrigue and adventure. I recommend you buy it now and see if you agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really nice show","review":"I probably would have rated it 4.5 stars but no real way to do such. I watch alot of tv and was skeptical and curious about this show. Bottomline, they pulled it off brilliantly.

That helped. Also, once you get over the ridiculous aspects -- he's still wearing clothes from his ship 6 years later and they look new -- the stories themselves were not so bad.

The loading is not that long, but it is annoying. The graphics are O.K. not spectacular. The Blue's Clues theme held my three year old's attention initially, but then he proceeded to use me for a jungle gym and I did the rest of the playing...until I got tired of the constant reloads.

The instructions in the manual are very basic, but when actually playing the game you can't go on just those few tips. It is hard to navigate your way around the playing screen, you seem to go in circles and never really make progress. It was terrible, and my child was very frustrated and disappointed. It isn't hard because of difficulty level. It's hard because you can't seem to figure out how to play it correctly and it takes SOOO much time between EVERY screen. Save your money!

Considering the amount of time this game was delayed for release I was very disappointed in the quality. It's a miserable, patched job... There are about 4 levels and most of the game-playing is waiting for the data to load so that you can move around the level. The special skidoo games in the game lack complexity and offer minimal learing skills. Steve is poorly animated, and I cringe everytime I hear Mailbox's voice. The last part of the game doesn't involve the player at all, but treats the viewer to a poor imitation of the movie that the game is based on.

These 2 songs at least play with the original songs and make something new. Something Different.

The back is well-vented and the racquet side provides good feel with just the right amount of tackiness (with an Ektelon Vision II grip).

Contrary to the jealous, whining remarks of Jungian analysts such as Tommy Kirsch and Andy Samuels, Richard Noll has succeeded where others have failed. All ofthe new material from archives that Noll has discovered rounds out our image of C.G. Jug the man. Everyone with an interest in Jung should read this book. It is not a hatchet-job, as others have claimed, but a full protrait of an interesting figure in our culture. Noll is respectful as well as critical of Jung. An excellent piece of scholarship by any standard, a high standard which Jungian authors (particularly Jungian analysts) continue to fail to meet due to their lack of formal education in things such as history, science, and even psychology. Jungian analysts know a theory, and that's all. Noll has shown them that there is a man behind the myth of Jung, and that Jung is not such a god after all. Bravo, Richard Noll!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Information Misused","review":"Richard Noll, a clinical psychologist, has shown that his title is no guarantee for the quality of his work.His book is full of interesting information on C. G. Jung and at the same time of his own inability to use this information.To give some examples, a psychologist should know:- what a pagan is, that it is related to a limited Christian understanding of the world, not necessarily that of Jung's- that Jung's 'belief' was not necessarily in the historic Jesus that Noll himself seems to believe in- that new ideas do not come about without a vision; not even to Jung- that our unconsciousness is what governs our life, if we like it or notThe book does raise a question:What has Jung done to Richard Noll to get this kind of aggressive treatment?This question could also be put in the following way:What is happening in Richard Noll's unconsciousness to create this aggression?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining debunk","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Great fun! While it seems quite in keeping with what I know about Jung it's hard to judge when there don't appear to be other books on Jung that aren't written by cult members. I've read about a dozen books debunking Freud and showing what an arrogant, megalomaniac, immoral, unscientific charlatan he was. It makes sense that Jung had similar traits.The picture that emerges of Freud is mostly consistent and well established. However I can't locate any objective books on Jung. To my mind reading a biography or psychological analysis on someone like Freud or Jung that is written by one of their followers is a tedious waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"why not \\"Gnostic Gangster\\"? or \\"Alchemical Alien\\"?","review":"The manipulative title just kills any pretense of scholarship. More to the point: A) if Jung was creating a new Mithraic church, how come he was advocating poligamy, since Mithraism required chastity?( forgot that one..eh?..Dr. Noll? ) B) Where are the Mithraeums ( the temples of Mithra? ) Know any one, Noll? ( Dont answer \\"the analysts office\\"...u r supposed to be fair..remember..a scholar..right?) C) If so many catholic priests are jungian analysts, does it mean that Richard Noll is smarter than John Paul II? or perhaps John Paul II is...oh ..no ...no...noooooooo....*thump* ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two can't keep a secret when one is dead","review":"Noll spends half his time setting Jung up as a paper tiger and the other half knocking him down. When the author can't find anything more to write about Jung, he writes about Jung's patients instead, extrapolating a grandiose scheme for world domination from the smallest of evidence. If these patients were truly mentally ill, how can their perceptions be trusted. And if they weren't ill why would they enter into therapy with someone like Noll's Jung? Noll states at the end of the book that he had found no evidence that Jung was ever a Nazi, but if that's the case, why even bring the point up. I found the book very disappointing, not so much for Noll's praising Jung with the faintest of damns, but for failing to deliver the goods--a secret life worthy of the name."},{"rating":"1","title":"much fascinating detail but accuracy is doubtful","review":"I suppose the Jungians need a shake-up from time to time; too bad this author is biased.

But reading this so-called book you only will learn that Dr. Jung was charlatan, mystic, adulterer, anti-semite,fascist and so on.Most of the book, for some mysterious reason, known perhaps to Mr. Noll himself,devoted to american patients of Dr.Jung.

In fact the only faithful are the born-again christians, which in countless sites in the internet shower praise on him, but on them Noll's so-called scholarly research is wasted, since they have always hated Jung anyway. So Noll is in pretty bad company, and I dont think that the adulatory churchlady lecture circuit was what he was after, but fittingly that serves him well \\".. oh...professor Noll ...tell us...was that Jung..linked to..u know..to..well..the...hhmm..Devil? ..\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Fry's best","review":"I have just recently begun reading Christopher Fry's dramatic works and was stunned!

Once again, Maillard drops you straight into the time period, with the media, clothing, and speech mannerisms accurately portrayed.In this book, Dupre has come down from the mania that ended \\"Morgantown,\\" and he has stayed down. Dupre remains in a state of depression throughout the whole novel. His friends remain loyal, because of past experiences, but he is a bitter, self-loathing person in this novel.

Nothing I know of modern day sounds anything like these guys. The lead singer, I think his name is Carey Mercer, has a vocal range that has to be heard as he goes all over the place throughout most of the songs. You would think such vocal masturbation would detract from the music, but it only helps the manic energy of the record. Not all of the songs have bounce-off-the-walls intensity though, as some songs are rather slow and oddly pretty. Not a \\"classic\\" record by any means, but a very good one all the same. There are no real obvious standouts, maybe with the exception of \\"The Oscillator's Hum\\", but this is a record worth listening to, if only to make you wonder what direction music will go in next.

The controls are easy, and I really like that you can adjust the tone of the audible alarm along a range of sounds from a low tone to a high pitched beep, so you won't get used to it or to find the pitch that works best for you. The bed shaker really works -- I have it under an extra thick mattress and it still shakes the whole bed! You might want the optional extension for it if you want to get the clock totally out of reach so you/your child can't easily hit the snooze button. The snooze feature can be set for a time interval from 1 to 10 minutes.

I have been late to work and classes due to sleeping through the alarm or turning it off in my sleep. With the sonic boom alarm clock, I don't even need the sound to wake up. The vibration wakes me up right away and the snooze button on the sweetheart version is a little tough to find in the half-asleep stage so I have to be awake to snooze it or turn it off. It is a bit lightweight but for me it serves its purpose. The vibration apparatus just plugs into the alarm clock (leaving the option of using it or not), and it has a pretty decent sized cord (well, maybe 3-4 ft). The beeping option is possible to be a range of different pitches and volumes to fit your needs, including very loud and high pitched.

The vibrater is great because of the long wire. The rainbow colored numbers will get your your friends wanting it too! It lights up the night. The light is kind of bright, so if you use a night light the alarm clock will probably be used as the night light. But if you're used to a dark room, your room is going to be a bit brighter than usual.

However, within just a few weeks, the vibrating disc stopped working completely. Shortly thereafter, I apparently trained myself to sleep through the alarm at its loudest and the flashing lights.I bought my son, who is also a heavy sleeper, the same clock in a different shape. He experienced the same issues with his model. The disc stopped vibrating after a very short while and he grew accustomed to the lights and sounds very quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really nothing sonic about it....","review":"I don't know why this says that it's so loud...it really isn't. I'm kind of disappointed. I bought it for a friend who is a deep sleeper, and was hoping to wake the dead with the sound, but the alarm my husband bought at Wal Mart for $9.99 is about 3x louder. I think the only reason someone would want this is for the bed shaker attachment...but definitely not the alarm tone...it's annoying...but not too loud.

I emailed customer service twice and never heard from them. I finally found a phone number for them and called.

But it's not necessarily gentle on skin that's felt the side effects of Differin, Tazorac, etc. The only cleanser I've found that works for that is Nude Skincare Cleansing Wash.4.

Stone Crop Gel Wash even though I was skeptical with it's lack of suds. That was in January 2011. It's Aug 2011 now and I've only had one zit in that eight months. I know it's because I switched to this more gentle cleanser. I changed nothing else in my skin care routine or diet.After eight months, and daily use, the 4 oz bottle is just now getting low enough for me to reorder.*Note, I use eye make-up remover before the Gel Wash (it will not remove eye make up)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for everyone!","review":"I love using Stone Crop during the initial cleanse during a facial (I am an Esthetician).

And for good reason; although J B Hutto and His Hawks weren't regulars at the Checkerboard, they did have a gig at the nearby Turner's Blue Lounge back in the '60s. This is good, straight-up, old-fashioned Chicago slide-guitar blues, nothing fancy, with many tunes about women and alcohol (Rory Gallagher's great track \\"Too Much Alcohol\\", found on his Irish Tour CD, is taken from a J D Hutto track). On this CD, you get a bonus with Sunnyland Slim playing organ. J B Hutto is long gone, but the music lives on; recommended for knowledgeable blues fans. Real juke-joint stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chicago bar blues from 1966","review":"This album feels like time travel to a Chicago blues bar from the late 60s.

I know I am in the minority when not rating this 5 stars but this is a very good but flawed album. Sam was a terrific singer and guitarist and this album of what were mostly covers shows how he put his own personality in all the tracks. A few places the rhythm gets a bit clinky and on My Love Will Never Die, Sam's vocal goes a bit over-the-top and sounds shrill. Sam's rendition of Sweet Home Chicago, which he learned from Roosevelt Sykes, likely is the source recording for this Robert Johnson number ending up as the overplayed blues tune that it is now. But do not blame Sam for that as his version is first-rate. Other highpoints include his remake of his own All Your Love and I Don't want No Woman.

Magic Sam was the first and best of the modern Chicago West Side blues shredders. Although his vocal stylings are a throwback to his delta roots, this album is all about the guitar. Magic Sam is THE link between classic blues like Muddy Waters and John Lee Hooker, and modern bluesmen like Melvin Taylor, Robert Cray, Eric Clapton, and Stevie Ray Vaughan. While this re-release covers no new territory (it's the identical track listing as the original release), the sound quality is significantly improved. Of course, sound quality is not a huge issue on a dirty electric blues album such as this. If you already own the album, this upgrade may not be necessary, but if you don't have this album yet, GET IT NOW!

No packaging whatsoever, no instructions at all, nothing that would indicate that this is really the product described here.That's not just unacceptable, it's borderline criminal.

Well organized and presented. Provides a decent breadth of vocabulary as well. All that said, the focus is on 1-word definitions and concise presentation which often leaves out the nuances of usage of grammar or meaning of vocabulary. All in all, well worth the $10!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good \\"review\\"","review":"I used this book in my Italian III class in college.

The book is straightforward. THere are no cute cartoons, etc. here. Just verbs and worksheets. I even do the work on notebook paper, so I can go back and do the sheets again. After just completing one page of drills, I have learned a lot. She only introduces one skill at a time, so it is not overwhelming. And the added benefit is learning, of course, the meaning of the verbs. I would even suggest this book for teachers of Italian because of the way the book is set up."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Resource Delivers","review":"This book has accelerated my learning (and retention) with the Pimsleur system.

I will never regret purchasing it. This book does exactly as it says. It teaches you all the verbs tenses in depth and is very easy to understand. The exercises are great. They give you plenty of practice without feeling tedious. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I found many errors in the answer key, especially in the final review. So, if you buy this book, keep an eye out for those errors and trust your instincts based on what you have learned. As long as you have studied well, they will not throw you off. Other than that I would recommend this book to anyone looking to master Italian. You won't regret it either. Since completing this book, as well as a couple others, I have begun to introduce the language to my children. Already native Spanish speakers, they are catching on fairly quick. Hopefully, the language will not be lost to us again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cord Cutters: This isn't why you cut the cord","review":"Wow, this is so incredibly cliche...and boring.

I had just purchased item a week ago and it advertised as lifetime warranty when I purchased it for $300.00. service is very bad. owner of Hill's Mills & Mixers did not help my situation didn't give me a new mill.

That is not the problem. Unfortunately, the one I received has a defective switch. You have to flip the switch several times for it to come on. In order to get it fixed, I am having to send the grinder back to WonderMill at my expense and then send them an additional $20.00 to return it to me when it's fixed. All in all, I am having to add about $45 to the cost of this grinder. That brings the cost to over $300, a price I would have not ever considered paying for this grinder. I could understand this more so if I had had the grinder for a long time, but that is not the case. I buy many things on line and from time to time, there will be a problem but I have never had any other company require payment for them to return the product to me after they have fixed it when it was defective from the beginning.

I was so pleased with it, I was smiling the whole time I put it through its paces!It is NOT at all loud. That is major for me, because I don't tolerate very loud noises well. And it mills the flour super fast! I ground soft white wheat and then I made my bread. Oh my goodness! I am a long time bread maker. I have made the bread for my family for over 20 years, so I know bread. But this bread, is super delicious!

Also, I assure you I followed all the directions to properly operate the machine - so I don't think it is user error on my part.Update: I was going to go through the process of contacting the manufacturer, but amazingly it now works again! It wouldn't start for all of December, then when I tried it again in February (expecting nothing, really), lo and behold it works again. I don't know what happened or why. Anyway, I wanted to let others know about this turn of events so as to not prejudice anyone against this machine unneccessarily. So I'd update the stars to four if I were allowed. Not five because I didn't like that it stopped in December, but it works now, so I forgive it :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"great mill","review":"I had been using a top end hand mill and while the flour this unit produces isn't really any different it certainly is 100% easier. It used to take me 30 minutes (and some sweat) to set up and grind 4 cups of grain into flour, now it is more like 4 minutes with 3 of them being setting up the mill. Very easy to clean and about as loud as a shop vac until the grain gets poured in then it quiets right down while grinding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I had a friend who recommended this mill.

I like most was kind of worried about Criminal Minds without Jason Gideon (writing him out could have been done a bit better. I personally think the events of the Season 2 Finale were enough to make anyone quit their job). I admit the episodes leading up to Joe Mantegna's appearance seemed to be just biding their time until a new guy stepped in but I like his character. The Season Finale is awesome as if the two-parter in which a team member gets shot. It seems as if the 1st Season was to have you qualify the BAU Crew, the 2nd was to show you that they are all human characters with the same worries, love and flaws as you and I and the 3rd, is to show that profiling doesn't solve everything and sometimes it goes wrong. I particularly liked how the end of the Season Opener leaves you in doubt about whether the suspect arrested was really the Un-Sub or not.

An incredible collection of material laid out in categorical chapters. Graham lays this often quoted collection out without prejudice and although he questions the Indian participant's accounts due to their lack of perception of exact time and spatial realities, he presents it all the same. What is quite fascinating are the virtual raw letters of Benteen to William Goldin. The letters show Benteen's bitter side particularly toward Custer and demonstrates that Reno was also not held highly on his list, if anyone was. Also, has Godfrey's great history of the battle and the book even includes challenging letters from Grahams critics to his personal responses. A great book for those that want to know all from multiple perspectives of the participants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still holds true","review":"New isn't always better.

Good idea, bad game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragons Are Horrific","review":"First of all, as you can tell by the cover, this is not a game for children. It is a terrifying adventure that chronicles the bloodthirsty nature of fire-blowing, flesh-munching reptilian beasts solely out for the destruction of mankind.Also it teaches multiplication tables and first level French.I can only recommend this for children over 19.

We use the recurring line: \\"No Bertie' that's dirty Bertie!\\" on a regular basis in our family. The illustrations are very high quality and have inherent humor and consistency, with small recurring characters between pages. Bertie is naughty without being bad, and funnily disgusting. We have other books David Roberts has written and illustrated and find him a great children's author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"I purchased this book because it was a bargain book (only $5.99) and I thought it might have a lesson for my daughter about not eating or touching yucky things. For me, I think some of the references (picking \\"boogers\\" and \\"eating boogers\\") and illustrations (Bertie and the cat \\"peeing\\" in the flower bed) are inappropriate. The book basically gives kids new ideas. When I was finished reading the book to my daughter, she proceeded to stick her finger in her nose and say \\"Look mom!\\" I would have returned the book but my daughter ripped one of the pages shortly after we read it. I also thought about donating it to the library but would have to do so anonymously because I wouldn't want my name associated with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful written book!","review":"This is an excellent book. I recommend it to anyone who likes books ealing with Indians or family. It is heart wrenching to think that a father could abandon his family, but if not this story would not have been as good.

This time I got through. I can't say I understoodit all. I think I understood some of it. Maybe that's the mostI can hope for. If you like easy reads, you probably won'tlike this book.

GR is our new Bible, and Pynchon's a zany Moses in America.A hilarious book if you get all the jokes, but even an idiot can laugh at the \\"candy chapter,\\" in which our hero is force-fed disgusting British toffees.

It is every bit as pretentious and boring as I feared. Mind-numbingly boring, in fact. I think this kind of book is only enjoyed by people who like to feel they are privy to a literary higher ground the rest of us don't inhabit and couldn't possibly understand. The story takes place in London in WWII, and the premise is that every time a certain American soldier has an sexual conquest, the Germans send a bomb to that very spot.

Should I have tried harder to understand, to enjoy it? But \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\" -or \\"Rainbow's Gravity\\"? (I won't even bother to check the name)- does not deserve such a feeling, because there is nothing to understand, less nothing to enjoy. I've been carrying it for two weeks, I've started it many times and have reached only page 85. I don't care about the characters (do they have names?), I am not involved in the plot (suposing there is a plot). This piece of arrogant nonsense does not deserve a book review, simply because it is not a book - supposing that a book must be something more than several hundred printed pages and paperback cover.

Where are timeless themes, the affective characterizations? The book's a little like Finnegan's Wake -- too obscure, too 'over the top.' Excuse me, but the book doesn't make integral sense. This long tome is more a collection of random sentences and rambling paragraphs too often concluded with three (let's be honest) fatuous, trailing dots. No, GR is not literature -- it's more like a going out of business sale -- it's everything PLUS the kitchen sink. And beware: one needs a companion book to understand it 'fully'.

Pynchon writes liberal, paranoid diatribes against any and all institutions, especially conservative ones. Pynchon certainly possesses the skills of a writer, but he lacks the discipline and creative drive of an artist. His wandering narrative style is meaningless - comparisons to works by Joyce are absurd. The further you delve into Pynchon's work to seek out deeper meaning the closer you come to realizing that there is no meaning - just variously colored blotches and stains, pasted together for shock effect. If you would like to try something intelligent that reads along similar lines, try Philip Dick, an under-appreciated 20th century American writer who possessed talent and vision superior to anything Pynchon could approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't get into it","review":"That's all.I read Pynchon's \\"Inherent Vice\\" with relish (I lived in LA near the time frame of that book and I'm also a noir fan). So I thought I'd give Gravity's Rainbow a try because of the hype. I got about 45 pages into it before I gave up. I just didn't get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"At First Confusing, But Then Pure Genius Awaits!","review":"If you aren't familiar with Pynchon,this may seem like James Joyce to you at the beginning...but stay with it, and you will see the mind of the genius within, and then everything will make sense, I promise! One of the funniest, most thought provoking books I've read in a very long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gravity's Rainbow","review":"I first read this book while in the Navy, and over the years when thoughts of the book surfaced like descriptions of the cables tethering the barrage balloons, and yhe meeting by the bridge and the stream -- somewhere towards the end.. but after just finishing Gravity's Rainbow this spring/summer, one thing that cannot be said is that this not a work for the ages. Top-shelf story and prose, all the way like, let's say, as a Bach cantata can be 'heard in many ways and still be fresh and so can this story. I can't find the proper words to say-- beauty certainly,a way of perceiving terrible beauties and light. Marvy and his 'band' chasing Slothrop is worth reading the book alone and you find it all believable then.Now going to read 'Against the Day' and hope for more. Oh boy!btw.. Pups to the cover painting from 'ATD': 'Nose Diving on the City'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow","review":"The book, as reviewers have noted, is almot unreadable, obscure, complex in stucture. It is important in the development, or decay, of the history of literature. I read on until early in the second part where there occurs the most revolting, obscene, and unnecessary chapter of anh book I know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"A dense book, with the writer throwing a lot of stuff in. Presumably meant to be a literary fancy pants type of thing, but to me, that just made it incredibly dull and a slog to get anywhere near through much of it.Definitely not entertaining in the way Robert Anton Wilson is, for example."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paranoia wore me out.","review":"I don't think a whole book can be written on paranoia alone. I really don't believe in it at all, personally. The best insights that Pynchon offers in this book come in short and direct commentaries offered by the narrator in about a dozen various pages of the book. \\"Is it any wonder the world's gone insane, what with information come to be the only real medium of exchange these days?\\" \\"I thought it was cigarettes.\\" \\"Some day it will all be done with machines. Information machines.... You are the wave of the future.\\" Pynchon obviously reads a lot. WWII makes a lot more sense to this 25 year old after reading Gravity's Rainbow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just About Perfect","review":"This detailed, beautifully written post-modern black comedy polarizes readers in the same way Ulysses does -- except Gravity's Rainbow is probably more accessible and rewarding for most audiences. If reading a book quickly and for fast entertainment is your approach, then its accumulation of characters, themes, and history probably won't find purchase in your imagination. My first reading took half a year -- reading little else -- and while I can't claim 100% understanding of all its references, it's hard to deny that it's an amazing treat for serious readers.It's hard to imagine a modern reader would pass up the opportunity to read this for the first, or even a second time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book Ever","review":"I read about 30-40 books a year of all genres and this is by far the worst book I have ever read. It is the rambling of some intellectual who is just trying to impress you with obscure references or shock you with descriptions of degenerate acts. I forced myself (and it wasn't easy) to finish but it was torture. Don't waste a second of your time with even starting to try and read this paperweight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gravity's Rainbow","review":"If you find Andy Warhol deep and interesting, you will probabily find Thomas Pychon so. I can think of better uses of canvas and paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incoherent.","review":"The book is written in a train-of-thought style that keeps steering you away from the plot. The tangents Pynchon goes off on are not essential in the least. I'm convinced this book could be an interesting 100 page novel if all that excess verbage were excised."},{"rating":"1","title":"AS FAR FETCHED AS WATCHING PAINT DRIES","review":"I'm sorry, I gave this book my ALL, since I am an independent bookseller,in my lifetime I've read many many MANY books,and this one was IMPOSSIBLE. It reminded me of James Joyce's babble, I couldn't keep my attention on it because of the babbling style of Jame's Joyce, but PLEASE do not DARE compare this nonsensical drivel the majestic prose of Dan DeLillo or my favorite author, David Foster Wallace. \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\" was a waste of my time, and I would NOT recommend this dreck to ANYONE!I would rather learn Mandarin Chinese."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusion's Dumpster","review":"I lived in Germany a few years ago and found this book in a train station. Someone had just walked off and left it. After about ten pages, realizing that Pynchon was an intellectual rip-off artist, I secured it a trash can where no one could find it. I like to think I protect the public from pollution."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Absolute Waste of Precious Trees","review":"I truly feel sorry for Pynchon, knowing that writing this atrocity of a novel probably cost him many months of life. By all means, if you want to read it, get it from the library as I strongly advise against laying out cold cash for this mockery. Does anyone really care that a man's sexual episodes predict German V rockets falling on England? Is it really important to World Literature that a man dreams he is being sucked down a toilet surrounded by crap and toilet paper and can even smell which race the crap came from? The so-called Intellectuals who praise this claptrap are the same Great Thinkers that believe Ulysses by James Joyce is the best novel of all time. I would rather read the worse writing of de Balzac than waste one more second perusing either of these novels. Both these \\"novels\\" are truly \\"sound and fury .... signifying nothing.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Elitist snobs will love it","review":"I agree with the 1 star people. As a member of IEEE, I get the monthly magazine Spectrum and in one issue, some scientists gave a list of their favorite books. I had read most of them, but one scientist/engineer recommended Gravity's Rainbow. So I tried reading it. Got half-way through, enormously boring, put it down for awhile. I just finished reading Neal Stephenson's Crytonomicon, which was compared to GR, so I thought I would try GR again. So now I am 3/4 through and am determined to finish it this time. But it is one boring book. I think Pynchon is trying to pull the wool over people's eyes, especially the elitist snobs, and apparently it is working. Reminds me of John Coltrane's Ascension album, which for the entire album sounds like the band is warming up but never gets to play, but the elitist snobs just adore it. But I think Coltrane was making fun of them too."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolute garbage","review":"Maybe it's entertaining if you take huge quantities of lsd, otherwise it's a nightmare. Pynchon forces offensive, sexist, nonsensical free-associations at the reader for hundreds of pages. As an author he comes over like a sad juvenile craving attention. It might have been different and unique in the 70's, but there are better examples of this kind of writing available now. All I wanted a well-written, cool story (sort of sci-fi/literature), unique characters, good setting and thought this might be the book, boy was I wrong. You suffer reading this \\"book\\", but that doesn't make it worthwhile. Miss this one. Repeat - miss this one. It is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disaster","review":"I've tried three times to read this book...the farthest I've gotten is about 20 pages. As I read, my mind drifts to other things. This book is boring and overwritten. The English language is best written blunt, direct, to-the-point, in clear simple language. To sum it up: it is too much work to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"784 pages of nonsense","review":"I read 100 pages and was unable to discover any story or interesting character to enable me to continue reading. Pynchon use lots of big words to show off, but does not produce anything gripping enough for me to want to continue reading. I cannot summarize the story, because I couldnt find one."},{"rating":"2","title":"20th Century Masterpiece","review":"This is arguably Pynchon's best work, and that is saying a lot. Yes, this book is long, and yes, it is chalenging. But it is also packed full of wit and insight, and it is a joy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunningly incomprehensible","review":"Thomas Pynchon has duped the entire literary world with this 800 page assortment of random words and phrases that at times come together in complete thoughts, most likely unintentionally. I can honestly say that I looked at each word, but I came away with no sense of having read a book here. My best assessment of this book's success is that there are a good handful of insecure literati-types who convinced themselves that any book too confusing to understand must be brilliant.The only reason I can give to read this book is to able to say that you have read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just read it","review":"Do you speak and read English fluently? If you do there is no reason you cannot read this book. It is a dense, intense novel which can be read if you are willing to sit down and read the thing with attention.Too often we want Steven King easy in our novels. Hunker down and pay attention to the amazing, hypnotic prose of America's greatest living writer.You may need to read this more than once; but once you get it, great rewards will becoming your way in terms of satisfaction.As Pynchon was once quoted as being quoted: \\"Why should everything be easy?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Life-changing","review":"Read it once, twice, three times. Devote a life to its study, for the story, the themes, and the literary style. My favorite book of all I've ever read. It's so much more than the story, that to tell you what it's *about* would be a misleading exercise. Except maybe to say it's about erotic paranoia, life in the zone, and the horrors of British candy"},{"rating":"2","title":"...","review":"Like driving when you're .... You don't know where you're going or remember why you're going there. Don't even try to understand what's happening. Turn analytical off. Open your mind and let the sentences flow in.

And all of the 5 star ratings are the people that laughed at the joke......or maybe I really am stupid..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boy does it suck!","review":"So I decided to buy and read this book because of some book reviews that compared Neal Stephenson, of Cryptonomicon fame, to Thomas Pynchon. This was a huge mistake because as far as I can tell there is no comparison, Stephenson can write and Pynchon can't, he just masterbates into a typewriter and manages to peddle the results to an obviously credulous sector of the publishing industry who are desperate to be included in the ranks of some group of modern literati or other. Non-linear narrative is fine, but quite frankly Willam S. Burroughs did it better in Naked Lunch, interesting ideas are fine, but quite frankly they don't carry a book unless there is some framework around them, something like a plot and some decent characterization. If you want something that will blow your mind a lot further than Pynchon will then get Naked Lunch, or Phillip K. Dick's , The Transmogrification of Timothy Archer, A Scanner Darkly or Radio Free Albemuth and avoid Pynchon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read, though a challenge","review":"Fans of Pynchon already know that this is one of his most difficult works, even if they haven't read it yet. I definitely do not recommend introducing yourself to Pynchon with this book, but once you've cut your teeth on his other works, you don't want to pass this one up. Come prepared for a long ride through a confused landscape; relax and accept the confusion and everything comes out alright in the end, I promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to love, easy to hate","review":"You could hate this book! Loan it, borrow it and see how you like it before you consider buying a copy.Someone said, \\"To achieve the impossible, it is necessary to attempt the absurd\\". GR is a book that almost constantly attempts the absurd... Many times the result seems to be a horrible mess, but there is still so much beauty, humor, horror etc. to be found in the passages of greater coherence. And it helps (for me, anyways) that the allusions and references I could appreciate (mostly those about science and history) were made with some understanding, rather than just being thrown in in an ignorant fashion for 'good' literary measure.I am very happy that somebody mentioned 'Radio Free Albemuth' by P.K.Dick. If you can tolerate sci-fi and would like a similar level of 'weirdness', but prefer a cleaner, more personal (alas, less colorful) voice, you'll find it a much better read."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Only Read One Trans-Genre, WWII, Science-Fact-tion, Literary Heavyweight, Conspiracy-Thriller this Year...","review":"This is an excerpt from a review originally published at www.unronic.blogpsot.comMost of the story takes place in Germany just after World War II. It is based on the historically accurate chase for V2 rocket materials by the Allies dividing up Germany into the pieces that would herald the Cold War. Throughout, this novel is steeped in actual, documented historical facts and quotes, with the amazing fictional side story of a Monty Python style version of James Bond flick. Gratuitous sex, wild parties, deep conspiracies, science fact that seems way more like science fiction, deep, twisted psychology, and a crumbling hero all add up to keep readers drooling for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"The literary equivalent of hurling buckets of paint at a canvas","review":"Rarely is pretentious drivel so profoundly trite. Perfectly exemplifies the great post-modern con. A chaotic assemblage of random terms to which meaning is later ascribed, so much like a certain nostradomus.There are two principle types of literay work:1. That which is to be read. and of course2. That which is to be carted about, the title clearly visible, with a look of supreme smugness upon the owner's face.Gravity's Rainbow is quite obviously a work of the latter category.You see, I've come to the think of myself as something of an amateur post-modern poet; here is an example of my work:Ball, Kite, wolf, sky, space, heart, moon, expand, window, flowing, profound, pompous, gravity's rainbow.You see i'm quite the literary genius, somebody give me an award!!!What you fools fail to realize is that the post-modern style is simply a tool enabling those of simple mind to veil their lack of true artistry behind absurdity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive Trash","review":"An entire novel centered on the unrealistic, flimsy idea that a man getting erections will attract missiles? Some missiles may be heat seaking but the temperature of blood found in the groin during erections is no longer near the degree it takes to attract heat seaking weaponry. Get your facts right, Pynchon. A scientist you ain't. As for the books social commentary on a whole, I can say this: I have not read the book, but I watched the film, and to be blunt, I've seen better film on teeth. Pick up a classic Steven King novel like IT instead of this pretentious crud."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hateful experience, 0 stars if that was allowed.","review":"After reading over one hundred fifty pages, all I could believe was the story set during WWII, but I wasn't sure. The location was England, but I wasn't sure. I finally threw it against a wall in disgust. I've been told the nominating committee (made up mostly of book reviewers) nominated this for the Pulitzer Prize as best fiction. The awards committee (mostly book editors) rejected it as an unreadable piece of crap. I agree with the editors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Novels are more than Context and Reference","review":"I read this incredibly convoluted, interesting piece of bricolage, and enjoyed the play of color and symbolism, but there is just not enough order within the novel to make the departures from order seem meaningful or contrasting. There is not enough true play or dynamism, just talk.A lot is also made of Pynchon importing scientific and engineering discussions into the realm of aesthetics; however, he does not make them poetic. Colorful, perhaps, and layered with bias, but not poetic.I don't require a linear narrative, but Pynchon's structure falls short of meaningful parallelism and degenerates into never-ending allusions and references.I want more from a \\"novel\\" than a convoluted, surprisingly static set of dialectic pointers. No one said it was easy to write a great Postmodern novel, so we shouldn't be too surprised to see Pynchon fail with Gravity's Rainbow.ARS"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy handed tripe that academics love","review":"Here we go again, another book that only a tenured professor can love. There isn't a single fully developed non-wooden character here. The humor is so heavy handed that the jokes all fall like a ton of bricks.

Something like an encyclopedic guide for the second half of the twentieth century - at least that's what the inner flap on my edition says. This is not an \\"easy\\" book. It's extremely long, and probably more complex - Pynchon fills every page with new characters, new settings, new ideas - than anything else I've ever read. A description of the \\"plot\\" will hardly suffice. There's one up above here at Amazon, if you're interested. Scenes ranging from the tender and profound to the ridiculous and disgusting come and go with abandon, rendered in prose that is often inventive and beautiful. The book never answers the questions it brings up about technology and mortality, but perhaps that's its appeal. It's an ambiguous text that each reader can find his/her own insights into. If you have time on your hands and a little reading ambition, this is one novel that's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"It took me about 14 days, stretched out over 2 months, to finish this deliberately stylized assault on the perception, but it was worth it.

Try not to let the mammath attack to the senses slow you down any, even when you feel like putting the book under the bed and swearing you'll never touch it again; force yourself anyways to reach the vivid, truly haunting last scene. The main characters are wickedly drawn, even lost as they are beneath Pynchon's amazingly labryinthine narration. I have no idea what this story was about, and I doubt too many people will, but that should never stop a reader from enjoying a good literary ride. Or in this case, a wild car chase in the dark...

This novel exemplifies everything about his genius. It is easy for the typical reader with a \\"literary\\" background to be scared off by some of the technical, scientific, or mathematical imagery which Pynchon uses frequently, but to be scared off would mean missing the incredible story of Franz Pokler, the Nabokovian turns of phrase, the final secret of rocket 00000, which hits so viscerally after six hundred pages of foreshadowing that you want to throw up."},{"rating":"1","title":"A magnificently written yet excruciatingly tedious book","review":"It's been said that there are two reasons to read literature:1. For the enjoyment of reading2. To say that you have read literatureIf you fall into the latter, then this book is for you. If you happen to fall into the first category, then there are a multitude of books other than Gravity's Rainbow which are more worthwhile to read. Throughout the majority of this novel, I found my attention wandering as I sludged my way through Pynchon's sublime yet mind numbingly unfathomable prose. To be fair, I wouldn't call Gravity's Rainbow a bad book. It is simply a chore rather than a joy to read. If you are interested in Pynchon I strongly recommend The Crying of Lot 49 or V over this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Since when does not liking a book you like equal idiocy?","review":"I DID read all of this novel and I DID understand it and it was a shameful, sad spectacle. The characters (and, hey, a novel is supposed to have them) were more wooden than mannequins. The story, when finally discovered, sounds like a bad LSD flashback and a very silly one to boot. No one denies Pynchon's intelligence. I do not deny the intelligence of the unabomber either. I just think what he wrote was tripe (Like what Pynchon writes).I thought this novel was a complete waste of my time and it amazes me to hear so many praise what I think was paranoid and resembles silly cult literature. My father had a book back in the fifties sponsored by an extreme right wing group that was equally paranoid and absurd. The whole tone of that bizarre publication resembles the tone of Gravity's Rainbow. But at least the fifties book had some unintentional humor in it. Pynchon couldn't write anything funny if his life depended upon it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another language","review":"I tried numerous times to tackle this brilliant book in English, but failed because I was too uptight not understanding everything.

I was truly hoping for something inspired with a voice and point of view. The prose requires a significant effort on the readers part.

Overall, these pieces of literature paint a vibrant picture of religious life during this fascinating epoch in history and they convey something of the richness that the multiform belief systems of the Mediterranean world had to offer.

So I accepted, graciously.Anyway, the video isn't bad, but the color is a little faded compared to the American DVD. And the sound isn't bad, except in a couple spots where the sound effects are louder than the dialogue. This is a different soundmix than the American DVD. My only major complaint is that the print transferred was played a little too quickly, meaning the 88-minute-print runs in 85 minutes.

The pictures are beautiful, and the food looks wonderful, but the cookbook doesn't hold up. The recipes will call for ingredients that are not in the ingredient lists, and you have to know how to cook to use it...for instance, it will tell you to use 3 slices of ginger, but won't tell you to peel the ginger first. Elsewhere, it says to \\"bring to a simmer and simmer\\" when it means bring to a boil and simmer. We tried 3 recipes, all of which bombed--2 of them were too spicy to eat, and I love spicy food. This is a horrible cookbook. I can't figure out why Donna Hay is such a popular cookbook author.

I plugged them in and the sound quality is excellent, it is awesome stereo sound, and even though it's not meant to, you can receive calls in stereo using the headset. The phone reacts as if you are on speaker, so you will need to have the phone fairly close by. The best part is, I didn't have to wait for shipping. Whether this product lists TREO as one of the compatible products I wouldn't know. I figured for $10 I couldn't lose because it has an adapter included so that you can also use the headphones as a stand alone product, or use the adapter with any other headphones you wish. If you want some awesome headphones, try the IPAQ headphones.

Since they are solid plastic (not rubberized), they aren't very comfortable to wear for long periods of time.They also aren't very reliable. When inside my jacket pocket, while sitting on the train, the jack can come loose from the socket on the bottom of the treo 650, which causes either channel of audio to be lost completely, or causes the music to skip around."},{"rating":"1","title":"crappy sound and unreliable","review":"If you plan to sit perfectly still while listening to music and don't mind lousy sound quality, this unit is for you.

(Though I don't know where that might be as of yet.)After about 1 week, one of the earpieces properly functions only intermittently.

This is a movie that fits in with some of the best gangster movies of American Cinema in the 1940's and 50's. The characters are interesting in a compelling way although the main character starts off on the wrong foot for most audiences. There is a crime that is planned and executed in suspenseful and interesting detail. There are the real bad guys that are pretty unappealing (compared to our \\"good\\" bad guys with their humane and humorous qualities). Plots within the plot keeps us off balance and helps intensify the suspense. The ending may not be the one we'd like but it is an impressive ending nonetheless.I've seen a number of highly rated movies that left me under-whelmed with appreciation.

And, as a bonus, these examples apply towards the social sciences so you can see how everything fits in with a topic you're actually interested in (let's face it, few are interested in math).I had already taken a statistics course in high school, so my stats class last year was pretty much a review for me.

In fact, this book is targetted at people who have TRIED to trade using one or another simple system and have failed to see those astronomical profits materialize. So he teaches an approach to building simple, robust, thoughtful systems which can be used on many markets. This is like having a really good coach walk you through the elements of any complex task, explaining each element, why it is important, and how it fits in with the others. If you like the approach that Elder and Murphy use in developing trading systems and want to learn more about the nuts and bolts of putting such a system together, this is the book you want. Do not buy this book as your FIRST book--read Elder's book and Murphy's books first, think about them, then get this one. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional book on an important topic!!","review":"Without money management and an appreciation for model testing, it is impossible to evaluate and trade a market timing system. Professional traders are aware of these prerequisites but part time traders are often ill-prepared. For most lay traders this approach is the boring component of trading, but for professionals, it's implementation is essential. Mr. Stridsman has accomplished what few others have attempted to do in simple to understand language. As a veteran of the markets, he is certainly respected and knowledgeable. I recommend this book heartily. The strengths are apparent upon a cursory review and the benefits derived are immeasureable. The book should be a primary component of any one's trading library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doubt","review":"I'm asking why the authors of this kind of book (Trading systems that work, The ultimate trading system, Winning Trading Systems, How to make 1.000.000$ in one year with Futures and so on.)they are not living in some beautiful islands of the Pacific with the broker who sends them checks every day. Why they need to write books? for their \\"infinite goodness\\"? , I don't think.The sad truth is they do BIG BIG money selling the books and not following their system trading.Bye.P.S.

There are several example trading systems that implement commonly used system features, and these systems are analyzed and commented on. But this is far from a blueprint--the methods used are too rough to actually use as defined, and the descriptions are very confusing in many places. Included TradeStation code is a bit easier than most to understand, but that's not saying much.

There were errors and inaccuracies in it, and it's logic was somewhat asystematic and protracted. However, it was worth the fight and I learnt things that I have not found elsewhere (at least yet).I would not use the book as an automatic formula for how to design trading systems. However, its overall approach was a good one and I will probably use several of the principles in it to design my own systems. Of course this book is now out of date, and the markets have evolved considerably. Computers are also much more powerful and the speed with which one can assess the effects of changing each parameter are also a lot better.It was a frustrating read in many ways but worth the effort none-the-less."},{"rating":"1","title":"This indie horror movie is not that good, regrettable purchase","review":"WARNING: This Review Contains Spoilers.

Great product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiny and evil","review":"Like most of reviews, I agree- these are tiny and socks aren't even socks just tubes with no stretch to them. My daughter is 6mo and 19lbs, they barely make it around the wrist and the few times I put them on her she tried getting them in her mouth(rattle description is useless since you simply can never hear it!) and she gets really mad when she can't get them so she just ends up flailing her hands and hitting herself and getting really upset. I hate these things :( First bad thing from Amazon ever purchased though"},{"rating":"1","title":"Your little one doesn't need these","review":"With our first child, I bought these so our baby could have some stimulation when he was young. These are more entertainment for adults because the baby didn't really notice them because he had to wave his wrist directly in front of his eyes, which happens like once in a blue moon. Then you get paranoid that the little animals will fall off and land in your kids mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Son is not interested","review":"I gave it to him when he was 1 month.... he did not even notice it. Tried again every month. Finally he noticed it when he was 4 months and was annoyed by it. At six months, he rips it out and throws it away. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but useless.","review":"These bugs are very cute. You can display them somewhere, so your baby can look on them. My 3,5m baby likes to look on them when on his hands, but just few second when and after putting on. And note, they DO NOT rattle almost at all!!! If you put two pennies in your sock and shake it, it would make more noise then this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't fit","review":"I bought this in October 2012 & was hoping for the set with black & white stripes, but received the set with green & yellow (first product picture). I got these when my son was 4.5 months old as that seemed to be when he was really noticing his feet & grabbing them & I thought this would be perfect. Unfortunately nothing fit, the wrist bands were too small & the socks went on okay but weren't elastic & just fell off. [However I should note my son's a big boy & weighed around 15 pounds at the time] Only 2 of the 4 bugs rattle & it was a very quiet rattle at that. I ended up returning the set.We also received theInfantino Foot Rattlesas a shower gift & these still snuggly fit him (at that time) & stayed on much better, both booties rattle but again it's quiet. I believe the infantino ones are only sized up to 3 months but they are a nice stretchy material.

Like other Lamaze toys, these were made with very high quality. The issue is that they aren't all that interesting.

If I had it to do over, I wouldn't purchase these again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound and wrong material for feet","review":"Out of the 4 rattles only 2 are rattles and the other 2 are just stuffed bugs. The rattlers are not noisy enought. My daughter doesn't even hear them herself while she moves her arms.The other issue is that the socks are not elastic enough and too big for ther feet. Just as she starts to move they will come off.My daughter was 4 month old when i bought this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very cute but no interest","review":"My baby has no interest on the wrist rattles or the foot finders. The wrist rattle band isn't that long, so your baby will not get to enjoy the rattle for a long time..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands down one of the \\"must haves\\" for baby","review":"My son is 5 months old and simply LOVES these rattles. Just a tip, wear the socks OVER TOP of their normal socks/jumpers to help them stay on better. My little guy always plays with his feet when he sits in his bumbo seat which is what prompted me to purchase these. The wrist rattles are a treat and I almost wish they'd sell a wrist rattle \\"teether\\" because he certainly likes to nibble at the crinkle fabric. The fabric patterns are alluring and eye catching for baby and the rattle is loud enough to hold attention but subtle enough to not be obnoxious.With a few girlfriends expecting babies very soon, I just found a new favorite staple to toss in their baby gift baskets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would be 5 stars if they were only bigger!","review":"I got these for my son when he was 6 months old. He discovered his feet closer to 4 months old, and I wish I'd gotten them at that time because his feet are already too chunky for these socks. I can ALMOST get it on his foot, enough so he can play with it. And he does like them a lot! But really these socks would be better if they were in a stretchy material so they'd fit more foot sizes. Also the wrist rattles will BARELY close around my baby's wrist - and it takes some fanagling even for that.I'd recommend this for babies 3-5 months of age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but ...","review":"These are very nicely made and well designed, but the rattle is nearly inaudible, frankly, a dud because of this flaw.

When I got this gun I was so happy. Despite the darts stick for about two sec.and then they fall. Still it is a very good gun if you want to buy it go ahead. There is nothing wrong with it. It also has good aim but better if you attach a scope (sold separately)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brought it back to the store within 15 mins","review":"The darts became jammed in the gun, and it would not shoot. They do not tell you that the \\"glow in the dark\\" effect is done by wrapping paper around the darts, this did not last more than a few mins and the paper came off the darts. Very poor product in my opinion. I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, save yourself twenty dollars and .don't buy this.","review":"The only case where this gun might have SOME usefullness is if your indoors and it's pitch black. Even then a better blaster would be the nightfinder. The range on this gun is about 10', and it is accurate umtil about 5'. Not to mention when you are playing at night. Everyone can tell where you are because the glow in the dark darts in the Firefly give away your location."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell apart too quickly","review":"I purchased this gun to shoot family members and co-workers with. It fell apart after 15 or 20 uses. The \\"ammo\\" doesn't stay loaded and half of them pop out the gun every time now. I understand that this is just cheap plastic crap but I was hoping it would last longer than just a few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun but light doesn't work","review":"Fun nerf toy but don't by it for the glow/light effect. The darts aren't glow in the dart, the paper stickers that you wrap around are (these fall off and don't hold the light very well). Also the flash of light that is supposed to happen at the pull of the trigger is unreliable at best. Still a fun toy but not for those features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work out of the box","review":"I bought this for my 8 year old for Christmas. After putting the batteries in, it simply didn't work, in that it couldn't even fire a single dart. Obviously a huge disappointment. If it doesn't work out of the box, there is clearly something wrong with the manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money!","review":"This product is terrible, the range is next to nothing and so is the accuracy. Also the dart holders constantly release the darts which decreases the minimal range. You can get much better nerf guns for a lot less money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Firefly REV-8 review ACKWARD","review":"I got this toy for christmas and im 13 i got it when i was twelve i found it was very awkward and very big i thought that it should have been smaller and the darts are very hard to find i ended up using the dart tag darts the ones with the velcro and found they were to long for the barrel i trimmed them with some scissors and that did but after about a week it wouldnt shoot the darts any more like i loaded up 8 darts all made sure they were fitting cocked and fired nothing happened just the noise you get when you fire a nerf gun without a bullet also the cocking mechanism is hard to pull back and it might hurt a childs hand after pulling it back so much i got a blister as i said its very large and wierd shaped it is very large for an average 8-9 year old. i would not reccomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"shoot for far away fun","review":"my nephews are having a blast, shooting all the way upstairs to hit their hiding mom!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh its ok","review":"Awkward to shoot and very awkward to cock, but it doesn't jam up like many other nerf products.

Wish I would have gone another direction when getting something for my son."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks much cooler than it is.","review":"I purchased this Nerf N-Strike Firefly Rev-8 for my son's Nerfday. He is 9. He thinks the gun looks very cool. As others have mentioned the \\"glow in the dark\\" feature is in the form of stickers, which don't stick really well the day you install them, I don't expect the to last long. Also the range on this gun is not very good. It usually fires a dart about 15 feet, occasionally the dart will go 25 feet. My son has about a dozen Nerf guns, and most of them shoot 25+ feet consistently. If it was my choice I would (and did) buy the Maverick for $8. It also has a barrel (with 6 darts), so you don't have to reload after every shot. The Maverick is a bit smaller, and it doesn't have the lights that this one does. The Maverick shoots much farther than this gun, more consistently. Also the Maverick doesn't require batteries.If you want a gun that looks cool this one is good. If you want to have fun playing with the gun there are many better choices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift!","review":"I bought two of these for my 9 and 6 year old nephews, and it was a huge hit. You should buy replacement darts at the same time as the gun, as the darts tend to get lost and damaged from rough play. Also, you use the eight or so it comes with quickly and should have more on you to re-load so you don't have to stop playing and pick them up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun but darts sometimes fall out","review":"I like the glow in the dark concept and the shooting mechanism, but sometimes the darts fall out. Overall a fun toy to play with though."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY ONE FOR YOURSELF AND ONE FOR THE KIDS","review":"I bought FOUR of these. I've got three nephews from 11-13, and it's been quite a lot of fun to capture-the-flag during the weekend.Accuracy is not the best, but that's darts your shooting, not bullets.The length is very good.The size is larger than in the pictures. It's not a hand-gun, more like a riffle the size of a grown person's arm.The glow-in-the-dark tracers are a NICE feature. There is a inside light by the barrel that charges the darts with light,not a lamp, but a flash when your fire. That's pretty nice.It comes with \\"post-its\\" that glow in the dark to stick to the darts, but they're not necessary (the dart's tip glows too). Plus, it damages accuracy and distance.Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The maverick's big brother","review":"The firefly is better than the maverick in terms of ammo capacity. The glow dart's paper does let it shot to it's full potential. The flash it makes when the light is on gives you away. The stock holds 8 extra darts. It can't really do rapid fire as well. Easy to use, and accurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOOO","review":"yo i heard this gun was off the heezy... yall best be buying this one...nerf rules and this gun is awesome. i cant wait till i get it.. ill be kicking everyone in my neighborhoods butt!!! nerf guns arent just for kids they are for everyone.. they should use nerf guns for military training!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Insanely bad","review":"This gun is horible. I have found that it does get 30\\" like mentioned on the box. But that's only without the sticker. This gun is extremely inaccurate after ten or fifteen feet the dart goes soaring down to the ground. It is extemely bulky and hard to use if you attach a strap to it. So there's no way to srap it or holster it on to you when you change to a sidearm. And the guy that said this is like an assault rifle is just wrong. Assault rifles are %99 of the time fully automatic(machine guns). A nerf gun like this is the rapid fire twnety. Often the gun jams and this is horrible in the heat of a large scale nerf war.If you put any sonic darts in they will go speeding out of control and your last shot will be a horrible disaster. Overal I think throwing nerf darts is more effective than using this gun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome gun!","review":"This is a great nerf gun! The range is good, and the space in the back for eight extra darts is fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great, but. . .","review":"this is a great gun. It shoots super far, infact this would be the perfect gun ifit was not for the trigger. The trigger is realy hard to pull.You have to pull it all the way back to get it to shoot. Other than that the gun works great.The light is awsome!!! Just like a firefly. The glow darts do glow but i use plain suction dartsinstead, they work and shoot better. The grip is a little feels a little funny but. . .I do like that it holds 8 darts instead of 6 like the mavrick and i also like how it hasextra slots to put darts in.

This new album, Red Dog Tracks, at it's best, is downright erotic, but the covers are unnecessary as are the instrumental and reprise of Keep Your Hat On Jenny at the end.It seems a little slicker than the last one too, maybe because they're on a major label now.So, there are about 7 or 8 great new songs that make the purchase worth it, but if you're like me, you'll be programming around some of the filler.Buy it, but just know that their second CD, The Trouble With Humans, had no filler and better songs, so pick that one up too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible sound!","review":"I was very excited to receive this cd as I am a DJ and my show is blues based.

Unfortunately, I didn't notice any noticeable results. I even had a friend take a picture of me before and after 1, 2 and 3 months to see if I could see a difference. I didn't. A friend of mine who does facial exercises told me to get a copy of another book on facial exercises called Facercise. I did the same thing here. I took before and after pictures at 1,2 and three month intervals. I was excited when I could see a change in one month. I actually had several people tell me I looked different after 2 months. That's all I needed. I can feel my muscles burn when I do Facercise. I didn't get that feeling at all when I used this book. Sometimes you have to try different things to get the results you expect.

That's exactly what it is... connected vignettes. Observations of the lives that make up Miguel Street, a street in Port of Spain, Trinidad. It is all set down and seen through the eyes of a young, fatherless boy.It is written with such a clear eye that it seems autobiographical, and here on Miguel Street we see the germ or the kernel of many of the characters that Naipaul would develop further in his excellent book \\"A House For Mr. Biswas\\" which he published two years after this one.As others have mentioned, the language, the idioms, the vernacular here are priceless... 1940's Trinidad bursts into view.I give it 4.5 stars.

To add to the insult, there were photocopies of the CD album covers, which, when combined with the caption, spanned four pages. Any true Bjork fan surely owns all the albums and having photocopies of the album covers is such a filler.To top it all off, a load of crud was yanked from the internet (including a very outdated survey) and thrown at the end of this book.I was expecting so much more.Bjork is amazing, talented, insightful, and beautiful.

I wassurprised that it was written as a story and that Jack's struggles couldhave been my own. The advice in the book isn't just 'nice to have', thereare tools that let you apply it every day.

OK, I get it and I'll sit through it I have nothing against conservation, great idea. But this show is just depressing, the writing is awful, and most of the photography is boring.I'll sum it up... whales and dolphins are dull, and you are killing them...I found thisIMAX: Deep Sea (Single-Disc Blu-ray 3D/Blu-ray Combo)to be far superior, oh yeah-you'll get your message in this too ,but it's an easy pill to swallow compared to the drudgery of Dolphins and Whales..."},{"rating":"1","title":"find a different one.....","review":"We couldnt even watch it, it hurt the eyes too much.

This is a good documentary style DVD that gives you a feel for the man, the times and what influenced his music. Interviews with friends, colleagues and other artists give you a good feel for what he is about. If you like his music and want to know more about the most difficult person to ever interview this is well worth while."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOU IS GOOD","review":"I just watched this video and it totally rocks! It covers his whole life, from his Pickwick songwritting days, his factory days with Andy Warhol, his amazing Velvet Underground days, and his solo work up to present day. This video has a whole bunch of intelligent people (David Bowie, Jim Carrol, Sonic Youth members, Suzanne Vega, and lots more!) who talk about thier strong feelings for Lou's music and Lou himself. An added treat is interviews with Velvet Underground members John Cale and Maureen Tucker. A really amazing video for an amazing man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lou the Artist","review":"This PBS video makes the case that Lou Reed is not just a guy who makes thrilling rock music. He is an Artist (with a capitol A) in the great modernist tradition who experiments with his life in order to test the limits.

For example, the author suggests choosing an undesirable behavior (in his example, forgetting to turn off the lights when leaving a room) and then spending extended amounts of time practicing the *undesirable* behavior (more not less, he calls it) each time the child does it. This will supposedly cause the child to think about this unpleasant training the next time he turns on a light switch. Then there is the technique of placing tally marks on a child's arm with a ballpoint pen each time she performs an undesirable behavior and then requiring her to say a nursery rhyme (Hickory Dickory Dock was the example in the book) up to 20 times for each mark on her arm. These stratgeies are supposed to teach a child to willingly submit to parental authority. Seriously??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not heavy enough","review":"I bought 2 of these for a 30 06.

It is the least structurally sound Lego set I have ever built. Granted Lego was limited in what they could do because they were copying an existing design, but that is no excuse for the problems I had.First, attaching the cockpit area caused the lower wing to fall apart multiple times. Once I finally got that attached (after about 20 minutes) I built the upper wing and had to attach that one to. For the next 2 hours I sat there rebuilding the lower wing, cockpit and upper wing to get it attached right. Like I said, EXTREMELY frustrating. It took close to 4 hours to build when it should not have taken more than 2.After it was all built I think it looks great sitting on a shelf, where it will collect dust because if I dusted it, it would fall apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wings too heavy","review":"I own a variety of LEGO sets and they hold together very well. This kit is an exception. The wings on this model do not stay together once built according to the instructions. They require constant checking.

Evidently it must be for display on a shelf only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great with one big exception","review":"I purchased this over other cheaper options on various websites thinking it would be a versatile option to tap the line output of my iPod. If you're simply using this with headphones, it works fantastic and I don't believe you'll have the issues I'm having. On the other hand, if you use it with a cable much larger than the white earbuds there's one unfortunate oversight by whoever engineered this product that renders it useless and potentially hazardous to your iPod. First of all it's bulky and relatively heavy, and there's no locking mechanism, so it fits loosely in the iPod interface and it tends to fall out easily and frequently when picking up my iPod. My biggest concern is that it appears to be bending my iPod's interface while connected, which will in turn bend the PCB inside of the iPod and can drastically reduce the life of an iPod as it will eventually cause connections to come loose."},{"rating":"2","title":"PocketDock Line Out USB and iPhone 3G","review":"I was unsure if this product would do what I wanted with an iPhone 3G and I'm happy to confirm that it works for me. I had been using aCassette Adapterin the headphone jack and a2 Port USB Car Cigarette Lighter Adapterwhich was a pain to plug in every time I get in/out my car. This lets me plug one device into my iPhone 3G to charge it and run audio though my car stereo.When you plug the adapter into an iPhone or iPhone 3G the phone alerts you that the antennas in the phone may cause audio interference. I've experienced this interference but it also happened with the headphone jack.This product could be a 5 star product by switching to a mini usb plug and if possible not trigger the interference alert on iPhones and provide physical buttons for previous track, play/pause track, and next track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for iPhone 3GS","review":"I am sure this works great for ipods, but it does not work for the new iPhone 3GS. I hooked it up to my home stereo and no sound. After I jiggled the connection for a bit it worked, but who wants to do that each time. Also, the plug will not attach to the iPhone if you have a protective case because the plug it too fat. Of course your charger plug works fine because it is thinner. Now I need to find out if the mini will work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Be Perfect","review":"I have two older Sendstation Docks and they have a little extender neck that makes it reach into an ipod or phone that is in a case--this one doesn't have this little extender so it will not reach into the plug with a case making it useless to me as I'm not taking the case off every time.

Well the product works and very well. However it is VERY flimsy, especially when you plug it into the bottom of an iPod. I was afraid it would damage my iPod because it wiggles and is just very unstable. It never hurt anything, but it did just fall apart. There are three pieces that make this device up, the front and back covers (which are held together by two little points of glue and plastics) and the rest of the insides are just one piece. I tried to put it back together with little success. I was so disappointed with this. If only the casing was more solid it would be wonderful and worth five solid stars.

I'm a straight man and if there is one thing I don't like is when homosexuals make straight movies and slide their agenda to normalize their way of life into the world. I mean what was the real purpose of the main character saying \\"I'd rather a man stick his d*** in my mouth rather than in my woman\\". One of the most sickening lines that I've heard in a movie and also one of the worst! It had no relevance to the movie we already knew how crazy he was.

Good story with education, careers, family, friendships and love relationships found on planet with male human looking aliens. And with the right amount of sex thrown in to make it a good and entertaining SCI FI short story set in Florida. Like the author's writing style. Very simple and straight to point. Feels as though she's talking directly to you or actually telling you the story. Downloaded author's first book, The Bonus, computerized version, a longer contemporary book with same writing style. Also with same focus on education, careers, families, relationships. Postive book with none of the stuff that makes the news everyday and then winds up in books as entertainment. Still waitnig for the updated paperback version that I think should be out sometime in July. Another good one from author about real people and believable relationships!"},{"rating":"2","title":"extensive bibliography with considered annotations","review":"This carefully annotated work from an archaeological perspective complements and well surpasses other work such as that of the historian Fingerhut. The discussion of individual texts is even-handed, and the compilers do not unfairly push their point of view (though it shows through). This two-volume work is well organized and easy to use.While this relatively specialized book might be a bit pricey for public libraries, it is an important corrective to the fantasy about pre-Columbian contacts that is on most public library's shelves. For the academic library with any pretense to serious coverage of New World archaeology, it is a must."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for level one HS German","review":"I was very disappointed with the number of cards and the lack of articles (m, f, n) and formation of plurals.The cards may be good for a very basic level of High School German but not beyond that.

It's as if the author didn't read through the manuscript a second time-- the narrative is just totally incoherent, and the dialogue is terrible. It's fevered and overwrought, and while such a tone jives with my memories of my first homosexual l-u-v in high school, there is no ironic distance between the author and narrator, and I was left with the suspicion that Vilmure must be as silly and self-dramatizing as his protagonist.

I don't think she gets the recognition she deserves. This is one of her earlier efforts, so it has some minor shortcomings (the pace gets a little frenetic at times and the focus on the details of the castle seem unecessary). However, the plot is intricate, character development is excellent and I found myself really caring what happens to them. I would probably give this 4.5 stars, but I rounded up...The book has finally been reprinted and apparently somewhat revised. This is fine, but the price for the new version seem rather high. Luckily, I was able to find a used copy of this older version at a much more reasonable price. Hopefully the new version will eventually come out in a mass paperback version, which may help create a wider audience for her talents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Martha Wells continues to be the best fantasy writer out there. It's too bad this book is no longer in print - not just because it is such an amazing book, but because I won't let anyone borrow mine for fear they lose it and I could never find another one. The book describes Thomas, the perfect action hero. A great fighter, brave... Although this type of hero is found in almost every book, only Martha Wells can get the reader to truly like him and admire his abilities. Also Kade, one of the better female heroines in any book, helps set the stage for witty dialogue and well fought battles with the fay. This book also sets up \\"The Death of a Necromancer\\" which is also worth reading. If you can find a copy of this for an affordable price, buy it immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing.","review":"Finally, a orginal fantasy that combines excellent story, great characters, and a wonderful world that isnt over done.

My experience is that they simply don't last - I am averaging less than 6 hours of use per motor and I am very careful not to overheat the motor or slam it in and out of forward and reverse. Ultimately you start to see them as a day to day running cost and something you cannot rely on.

The bolts are not in a separate bag - they are actually in the bars. You have to unscrew them and then put the pieces together. It was hard to see the bolts at first but after that we were good to go. This stand is very affordable and stable enough that we do not worry about our six year old using his keyboard.

It has a more straight ahead sound at a very high level of musicianship. Very few guitarists are able to negotiate soloing through Coltrane \\"Giant Steps\\" style chord changes evident in \\"Aeleron\\". Scofield does this with ease like bread and butter. Except for the light overdriven (juicy) sound of his Gibson 335 guitar, which I prefer over his current instrument, this is a no frills bebop CD laden with the classic Scofield signature. You know its him right away. There are a lot of notes being played, but they are quality notes. Hal Galper doesn't play around on this one either. Highly recommended listening for jazz guitar fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Scofield plays straight-ahead","review":"\\"Rough House\\" features John Scofield playing straight-ahead jazz guitar with a rhythm section. The album has five Scofield originals and one song by pianist Hal Galper. Even though it was recorded in 1978, the sound is pretty good and doesn't have a 70's sound. Many of Scofield's recent discs have some sort of gimmick (or if it's a good disc, an enhancement) about them. This makes \\"Rough House\\" so refreshing. Scofield tears into the uptempo title track in the same spirit Wes Montgomery tears into \\"Airegin\\" on \\"The Incredible Jazz Guitar\\".

When my item \\"shipped\\" it had a tracking number, so I was excited by the fact that I knew when it would arrive. Then I was confused, because instead of a book I received an envelope with a shipping confirmation. I then contacted \\"mpharris1979\\" and hypothesized that maybe there were two shipments due to forgetting to ship the confirmation page and this just happened to arrive first. In reply I was given a staunch, \\"No, they were mailed together.\\" I had to file a claim with Amazon just to be refunded. Thankfully that tracking number is part of a barcode full of information such as shipping date and weight of package.

Otis has influenced every major Blues artist playing guitar since the 60's. This is easily one of his best listening Cd's with the performance and selection of songs here. He is one of the VERY few who are still alive from the 50's cutting edge consisting of Otis,Freddie King,Magic Sam,Luther Allison,Buddy Guy and Eddy Clearwater of the West Side Chicago sound. He is in Japan here where some of his best performances have been recorded. He is scheduled to go back to Japan to tour in May 2001. Hopefully someone will have the foresight to record him on audio and video. I rank this CD in my Top Ten of alltime Blues CD's. Its a must for any lover of the blues!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Draighneain","review":"I purchased Winifred Horan's solo debut album 'Just One Wish' after hearing tracks on AccuRadio and listening to the album 'tasters' on Amazon.com.

The song with Sancho is, he rips it up tight, but the Sancha ruins the song.

The one issue I had was that you had to watch that you didn't flush it, and with him jumping off the seat it fell in once or twice.

Each \\"myth\\" they cite, they are linguistically correct to eschew. But frankly, the book is dull.

Daniels performance on this particular CD is as good, if not better,than the previous two. As a male singer myself, I know that singing in my falsetto (high unatural countertenor range) allows more vocal control. Because of this, Daniels is able to express the music more freely than most women. The romantic melodies of Shubert, Beethoven, and Vaughn Williams allow Daniels to truly bring the music to life. His line is excellent, his expression is excellent, and his diction, especially the German, is very good (French could use a bit of work).

I was very disappointed and have requested a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enlightening and Quick Read","review":"\\"Advent Of The Savior\\" is a short introduction to the Infancy Narratives of Sts. Matthew and Luke. It is divided into separate sections for each Evangelist. After the introductions, each division begins with a selection from the Gospel followed by commentary. The organization is to go through the narratives of Matthew in sequence, followed by the narratives of Luke. The commentaries provide interesting background material and citations to related Old and New Testament texts.The excellent job that Author Stephen J. Binz does in drawing parallels to other parts of the Bible is enlightening. One example is the comparison of the three days during which Jesus was lost with the three days that he spent in the tomb.With only sixty-four pages, this is not a thorough study. It serves well as a guide for a short study of the Infancy Narratives. It is an enlightening and quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short but good","review":"This was a much better book than I originally expected it to be. The author, a Roman Catholic priest, introduces and explains the infancy narratives contained in the gospels of Matthew and Luke, observing especially the foreshadowing of these events in the Old Testament and the foreshadowing within the infancy narratives themselves of the coming death, burial, and resurrection of Christ. There are some very insightful comments on all of these passages to be found in this book. It's a very short read; it took me only two sessions of reading to finish completely. It's definitely worth checking out to get your mind and heart oriented toward the coming of Christ during the Nativity fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Actually Works!","review":"I had a hard time believing you could make a cup of coffee with this little thing, but it actually works. All you have to do is fill the built in filter with coffee, drop it into a mug filled with water, microwave for a minute or so and then stir the filter around until the coffee is as strong as you want it. It works.Now, to be honest, you can make a pot of coffee with an instant coffee maker in the time it takes to make one cup with the FitzAll. However, when you just need one or when you're somewhere (for example at work) and don't have access to a coffee maker this little beauty does the trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Performance nowhere near expectations","review":"Not sure what the other positive reviewers consider good or strong coffee, or what procedures they used. I tried this device several times, and see the problem as basically not having the coffee grounds getting sufficiently wet during brewing. The tight plastic mesh allows very little water to get into the device during microwaving, and thus very little coffee gets actually brewed. The emptied coffee grounds come out partly dry after \\"brewing\\". I tried different heating times, and also pre-wetting the coffee - messy and impractical. Fortunately not too much money spent on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little coffee filter for work","review":"My favorite coffee is French Press style. I like the small grains of coffee that are suspended in the coffee; I think it has a great mouth feel. This one-cup coffee filter allows a little of the smaller grounds to come through, nicely replicating the flavor and feel profile of French Press. If you don't like that then I would recommend using a courser-grind.I totally fill the basket with coffee, put it into my cup filled with cold water, and then microwave it. I determined the amount of time it takes to heat my water to about 200F. I put it in the microwave for that amount of time and each time it comes out great."},{"rating":"1","title":"this thing is a joke!","review":"hard to use and get a decent cup of coffee, messy to fill, just an overall waste of money. sent it to the Goodwill!"},{"rating":"2","title":"coffemaker","review":"excellent way to use up old coffee instead of buying instant price is fair for amount of use it will get"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Micro Bust\\" but freakin sweet","review":"Let me start off and say, these bust are limited edition ! only 2500 in the world.

It was a blue screen with the words \\"Region Code\\" written in the upper left corner. Movie Mars was the company that sold me the DVD. They are located in North Carolina and so am I. I wondered why they sent me a DVD that only plays on equipment in the Far East. They did let me return the DVD and they did refund the price of the DVD, but didn't offer the option of replacing it with a working version. I got to pay for shipping and handling BOTH WAYS, and they ignored my request for a refund on that. So for six bucks, I got exactly nothing except aggravation. I looked up Movie Mars and sure enough, they get tons of complaints about selling pirated DVDs (I'm not claiming that, but others do, and why would they be selling non-American coded DVDs otherwise?) lousy customer service, overly cheap mailers, etc. Movie Mars is a shady operation and I sure won't be buying from them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT MOVIE - DVD DOES NOT WORK","review":"I loved the movie when I went to see it back when.

A movie as good as this should at least be available on anamorphic DVD or better yet, BluRay. Because the current DVD is not anamorphic, it does not play properly on today's widescreen, HDTV's.

However the reason I rate it 4 stars and not 5 is because once again Eve Marie Saint wrecks a movie. She did the same in \\"Grand Prix\\".I find her the most irritating actress alongside Kim Bassinger. She always looks out place.Why Leon Uris even included a character such as hers is beyond me. Kitty is so foreign to the story of Exodus top begin with.

Stay away until proper treatment of this movie is accorded to it. 3 stars for the movie; 0 Stars for the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opportunity Wasted","review":"The film is excellent. However, MGM failed to give it a transfer worthy of the product. Technically, the film appears washed out with poor color. The sound is inferior. They used Dolby Surround when it should have 5.1 Dolby Digital. The intermission was cut out. There are no chapter lists or an insert. Kind of like a Goodtimes DVD.If you want to see a fairly good rendition of this film, check out the laserdisc. It is complete with intermission. It was manufactured prior to DD 5.1.Hopefully, it will be reissued in a better edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful by today's standards","review":"I just watched this film tonight on TCM. It is terrible. Cinematography mediocre, even Paul Newman's acting is as bad as I've ever seen, and Trumbo's script and dialogue may be worse (if possible) than Spartacus.Now I now why the \\"new Hollywood\\" rennaisance took place. After watching this turkey, Hal Ashby, Bonnie & Clyde, and Chinatown look like works of genius.Oh boy, time can be brutal, and in the case of \\"Exodus\\" - we may have to come up with a new word.Totally over-rated - if you value your time (life is short)- go elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful and a total waste of time","review":"I saw this movie and I hated it.

This film was playing and we went to see it. She liked the soundtrack so much that I bought it for her as a gift. This was in 1961 or 1962. We enjoyed the movie then and enjoyed it more this time because of the memories. The fact that we are older and seem to understand a little more about the world also enhanced the experience. Buy it, you will like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exodus","review":"Compelling movie in light of recent news. The birth of Israel in the late 40's is still the cause of much conflict in the middle east. I recommend that a individual watch this movie with his heart and not solely on it's performance by the actors. There was a way of making movies back then that is not seen today. No CGI in this,just location scenes. A very watchable movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality video transfer","review":"I was disappointed with the quality of the video transfer. I'm not sure if the images started to get better half-way into the film, or my eyes just adjusted to the pixel problems. My son watched the first 15 minutes then he couldn't take the poor quality of the video and he gave up."},{"rating":"2","title":"At the top of its genre","review":"This film is from a fascinating novel by Leon Uris.. It was as good as the mass media got in 1960-61. The scenery is gorgeous, the music is exciting and the young Paul Newman is gorgeous AND exciting! The film raises some interesitng questions: What happened to the desire of the original Israelis to live in harmony with their Arab neighbors? It's worthwhile to examine what time has wrought. A bird's eye view of antisemitism is offered in the dialog of several characters: the American woman (Eva Marie Saint) and the British officer (Peter Lawford), for example. Today we expect more sex, more blood, more dirty words, but for it's time, Exodus told the story well. Perhaps realism isn't all it's cracked up to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love the movie, hate the DVD","review":"I want to second, no third, whatever, what everyone else has said here. I don't think I ever saw a movie treated this shamefully. There are a couple of reviewers here who don't like the film - I love it. It's deeply schmaltzy, probably not a perfect historical record, certainly a propaganda piece for American Zionists, but in the end the movie works.What doesn't work is this DVD. I also thought my copy was damaged. There's really no excuse. Don't buy it.

Come to find out, that the gears ( located underneath the blade ) are made out of plastic and the wore out. So if you need this slicer for cutting bread like I do, it's no good.Now I'm on the search for a slicer that has gears out of metal, but it seems like there is none. I've contacted Deni and Waring and their gears are made out of plastic as well.

In short, I felt taken by getting this CD - sloppy charts poorly recorded by guys well past their prime and who barely had real credentials. They do have cool names - like \\"Little Brother Montgomery...\\" and when you read up the players in the sleeve it says stuff like they sometimes \\"sat in\\" with King Oliver! - come on...that's nothing like being a regular with King Oliver.

But for those living through this time with open eyes, at least you'll get some laughs from Hightower's humor, some more info about what's going on in the world (the chapter on Wal*mart is particularly shocking), and some ideas about what to do about it. The thing I liked best about this book is that it is fundamentally optimistic in tone, and not whiney. Yes, things are screwed up, but as this author and, for another good example, Amy Goodman in \\"The Exception to the Rulers\\" lays out, grassroots organization does have the power to effect real change in the world.

And Hightower writes without screaming on the page, either -- how about that? Although Hightower's progressive leanings are on full display here, with some obvious targets, \\"Thieves In High Places\\" offers a constructive section of things people of all stripes can do to get involved with the process. Whether you agree with his facts or not, Hightower's a real proponent of getting off one's duff, or even just getting off the fence. Some readers will find Hightower a perfect example of Ambrose Bierce's definition of an optimist: \\"a proponent of the doctrine that black is white.\\" His approach is to remind the reader that it's always darkest before the dawn.

The author subscribes to one-sided, conspiratorial views on events in the Middle East.

The author also ignores the refusal by most Arab world to recognize the right of Israel to exist. The author refuses to admit that it is the Arabs' militant, intolerant attitude towards Israel that is at least partially responsible for the continuation of this conflict and not the other way around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why pay for Arab propaganda when you can get it for free?","review":"I am sick and tired to read recycled Arab propaganda that has nothing to do with reality.

The pages of this book clearly show this and prove to us why the Palestinians are doing so bad in the PR game.Aside from the obvious bias attitude of the author (she is married to an anti-Israel writer) this book is simply revisionist history, in which the true story is not good enough to tell their children, so they decide to rewrite it to their liking.

The characters are rich, quirky, and interesting and the tone a unique blend of funny and supernaturally disturbing. King's version is astoundingly poor, making all manner of classic mistakes of vastly overexplaining the blackstory,ludicruously undermining its suspense, drawing its characters far too broadly, failing to achieve the minimal level of craft in the balance and shaping of the story, and a number of other mistakes and bad habits that are trademarks of lesser King efforts. If you watch this, I think you owe it to yourself to watch Von Trier's original version afterward. The latter is so indecently, immodestly superior it amounts to a well-deserved kick in the shins to the producers of this tediously and embarassingly lesser work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kingdom Hospital 5 Stars","review":"I love this movie my husband got it for me on DvD & I just love it.Stephen King always has the best movies.

It also said that it's sort of a precursor to the plots Doctor Who fans come to expect of the series now, & that was true as well. I really liked it. William Hartnell isn't my favorite Doctor, but he was still quite good in his role & without him, we wouldn't have any of the others. The story was good as well.

But after that, it became an excellent story. I enjoyed, partly for the thrilling story, and partly for how it shone the spotlight on Ian and Barbara, and they did well. The cliffhangers had be wondering what would happen next. I was also amazed at the suprisingly adult scene when the trapper Vasor tried to rape Barbara during Episode 4. This story had you in it, whether it was Ian and Barbara strggling to find the key before they are killed by the living jungle, or when their rope bridge breaks and they are trapped on a ledge with some unthawing monsters. The best story in the Hartnell era"},{"rating":"1","title":"A time travelling mess!","review":"The Keys of Marinus is a good example of what can go wrong with a new series. Doctor Who was in its infancy, it's first year to be exact. The Keys of Marinus dealt with a series of stories within the story. The Doctor and his companions arrive on Marinus and find they can only leave if they help the keeper of a powerful artifact recover a number of keys that can activate it. The problem is the keys are scattered throughout the planet. The four are given travel watches that transport them to each of the keys locations and thus adventure ensues. The problem is the adventures are boring for the most part. Keys of Marinus us only for the diehard fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grimly dull","review":"My first regret is that I have to give this book a single star. This book has been republished several times. I first saw it in a university library as a Bicentennial reprint. It appears to have been written by a local battle enthusiast who has no talent at all for history. It is so dull that a supreme effort will be required to grind throught it. It's treatment is spotty and in large portions of the book simply confusing. I think it has been around so long because for some reason there are, unlike with Saratoga, Trenton, or Yorktown, no real battle studies of Monmouth. One of the reasons the battle is reduced to stories about Molly Pitcher or of Washington losing his control of himself with Charles Lee is the lack of such studies. This book unfortunately does nothing to fill the gap.

He is the most talented fantasy illustrator of his generation, no one else comes close. His work easily qualitfies as Fine Art. His draftsmanship is so good it seems beyond human, like Michaelangelo. His sense of drama is so assured, each image is like something out of a classic movie or great legend. But everyone falls all over themselves praising Frazetta. This is the third book of his work, and is more for hardcore fans and collectors. Icon and Legacy contain his most famous works, but I love this one for the insights it gives into his techniques, and for the many sensitive and exquisite watercolor nudes he gave his wife on birthdays and anniversaries.

Most movies give you a set up to get you started at the beginning. I never quite identified with Igor who wanted to be an evil scientist and had no choice from the beginning because of the hump on his back.It is just OK in that the characters are cute and it's speedy pace is aimed at keeping kids entertained, but it isn't smart with kid appropriate adult humor like Toy Story. My husband and I tried to watch it to the end but couldn't make it. My 8 year old daughter fell asleep but made the effort to finish it later. Her review was it was \\"It was O.K.

Like Shrek, it has enough humor for adults, and it's kind of cool to hear some of the familiar voices not normally used in animated features.

It is not suitable for children of any age. We walked out of the theatre, but I wish we would have done so sooner. I think we must have been in shock that ANYONE thinks it is okay to market this as a kids movie. From the 'Axe Murderer Brainwash' scene, to the cleavage shots, to the suicidal bunny, to talk of blowing heads off, it was horrible all the way around! And when Eva turns evil my two kids were both terrified! My daughter had nightmares and had to sleep in my bed!Horrible horrible horrible movie!

I found nothing funny or entertaining about it. While the animation may have been well done to some degree, the plot, characters and actions in the film are scary, and not in the good sense of the word either. I purchased the DVD expecting greatness (which is found in successfully animated films such as Monsters, Inc., The Incredibles, and Toy Story, etc.) gave it the benefit of the doubt while I squirmed in my seat, but halfway through; bored and disgusted, I just threw it in the trash. The movie is pathetic and fails miserably as entertainment. I could find no redeeming features. I couldn't even bring myself to give the DVD away (free) to anyone I knew! It would be too painful and I would make no friends in doing so. Don't bother buying it.

'Igor' is really for old horror buffs, but it tried to play both sides of the field. It's too adult for kids and not dark enough for adults.The animation is very good and looks more than a little inspired by 'The Nightmare Before Christmas'. The voice work isn't bad, but the film doesn't have enough inspired characters to keep the momentum going. Most of the comic relief comes from an immortal rabbit who wants to die!Overall I think if you like old horror films and animated films you'll like 'Igor', but it will not keep the little ones interested. The DVD has an excellent transfer, but not a lot of extras. There is an alternate beginning that is interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really a good kids movie, or entertaining enough for adults","review":"I was very dissappointed by this movie. Granted I knew it wasn't a blockbuster, but the whole story was flawed. The main character's companion bunny spends the entire movie depressed and trying to kill himself, but he's been genetically modified to be unkillable. So he goes through various means of trying to commit suicide and keeps living, which makes him unhappy-er. Great for kids, huh? Then the whole premise of creating things to blackmail the world to pay their town was pretty adult concept. I didn't find a whole lot of humor in the story either. I really didn't want to have my little kids (5 & 8) watching a movie where one of the characters is depressed and tries to kill himself, but after starting the movie was in an awkward situation as kids love movies. They seemed to take it stride, but I was cringing. I would not bother with this one~!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty Parody of Horror","review":"This movie would be most appreciated by older viewers primarily because of the witty parodies of old school horror movies.

A great light hearted and very unique story obviously inspired from the age old Frankenstien tales but nothing like them at the same time. Adults will have no problems laughing through this with the kids. Simply another great movie somehow overlooked until it's under 10bucks. I've seen and bought all the pixars, dreamwrks, and blueskies too, and IGOR shines with just as much passion as them, (more than some of the so-called big films (like the 3rd,4th installments)in my opinion anyways), but hey what do i know.

It was so bad that I turned it off after 15 minutes. We love Nightmare Before Christmas, but this movie is nothing like it.

I have no idea how this movie is only rated PG."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOL hilarious!","review":"I want to give it 5 Stars because the screenplay is SO funny but I don't care for the animation - reminiscent of Nightmare Before Xmas.It's like this movie was MADE for the dry genius wit of Steve Buscemi. He just SHINES in this. (He's a rabbit.)I believe they cut the ending too short. Sweet little last joke but instead of kind of fading out so we could enjoy it, the filmmakers just cut it short and went to new song and the credits.A good premise and a nice family film.

I understand how non-muslims and Americans feel aboutIslam because I am an American and was once christian. I have readthis book many times. My friends from Arabia have even found this bookuseful. As a white American woman converted to Islam I struggle veryday for acceptance and understanding from a very narrow minded societythat views Islam as backward and barbaric. If more would pick up thisbook or the Koran, then maybe they would have a better understandingof Islam and mulsims.

Carol Anway courageously ventured deep into her suffering heart, and as a scholar, her duty to enlighten the reader took priority. Accusing this great author and researcher in doing Islamic propaganda is as ridiculous as the infamous Crusades. In contrary she has been a Christian educator, and scholar with a book and Masters Degree to back it up. This book is a product of a great and lengthy research with extensive surveys and testimonies from women who walked the path. My heart goes to her and other parents like her who can enjoy and value the happiness of close ones more than their own. Thank you for your gift of this book to all of us Mrs. Anway.

Pride and Prejudice FAR outweighs this one.First of all, the music in this movie we found to be barely tolerable.Secondly, In my opinion, the foul language could have been left out of this movie. Making it a bit more family friendly. Thirdly, We did watch it till the end, but it was a drudgery.I have read the book and will say that they perhaps did the best they could at putting this book on screen as it would be a difficult screen play to write. But some liberties were taken in the movie that I didn't like.Overall, it was a waste of time and money.On the other hand, Pride and Prejudice,Persuasion, and Jane Austen's Emma are excellent movies on which to spend your valuable time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great English Movie","review":"I thought Vanity Fair was a baudry and cheap movie that lasted to long.

Also it felt so disjointed from start to end. I truly purchased it cause the review says\\"Adapted for the screen by Andrew Davies, who did the honors for the phenomenally successful Pride and Prejudice\\" however it does not compare at all with the quality of Pride and Prejudice.It was so boring and disgusting, you are better off without watching it, you wouldn't miss a thing. DO NOT BOTHER BUYING IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vulgar!!","review":"Vulgar is the only word that completely describes this film. I have never been so sickend by a period movie.

Don't bother!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good show","review":"This is truly a great period piece and very well done. Beautiful costuming, scenery, and acting. A great pleasure to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Adaptation of the Novel","review":"Vanity Fair is one of my favorite Victorian novels. This video is well adapted and well acted. It is slightly marred by the instrumental music, which not only seems later than early 19th century, but cacophonous. Rebecca Sharp was supposed to have been an excellent amateur pianist and singer, an important part of her charm. However, most of her vocals sound like husky, breathy 1940s cafe music."},{"rating":"1","title":"could not get through 1st episode","review":"I tried to watch this series, but could not get past the first episode. I found the acting to be quite contrived (that is the point in the novel) but I could not get past the shallow characters. Maybe fans of the novel would fare better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible version","review":"What can I say? Being a great fan of BBC and A&E period dramas, after buying Vanity Fair, I was truly dissapointed. I don't know who was in charge of the casting, but I think it was all the out of work actors thrown together and an ugly bunch you couldn't relate to. The music score was totally innapropiate. I found it to be more of a second rate B movie and would highly recommend that nobody purchase this disastrous production. But on the BBC's behalf I have to recommend as a must for your collection Berkley Square, The Mayor of Casterbridge, Wives & Daughters and Tess of D'Urbervilles. Now these are first class movies, brilliantly cast and excellent performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing to no end","review":"I have never read this book, but bought it based on other movies I enjoyed that BBC has done. If you like Charles Dickens, you might enjoy this, but if you are looking for anything lighthearted or romantic you will be disappointed. Nothing like Pride and Prejudice or Wives and Daughters which I enjoyed very much. Although I am sure that this is a literary masterpiece, it is depressing (as many literary masterpieces are). This is not an all around bad movie, just a bad match for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Not Sit Through This","review":"I was excited to sit down and watch this, but sadly could not get through more than a couple episodes. Natasha Little is a great Becky Sharp, and the costumes are lovely, but the adaptation is performed as a melodrama, exaggerating everything-- especially everything disgusting. Most of the characters are disgusting, so most of the time viewing the show was unpleasant. The music was a bit melodramatic as well. I hope I never have to listen to it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get your classic fill. Quite enjoyable.","review":"Pretty good rendition of the classic. Dobbin is superb, and many actors are wonderful in this series.Beware of absolutely stinky music. Couldn't be worse, really.

It is funny, and real, and ridiculous, and shows all different and varying sides of humans and their quirky natures, from the silly to the tragic.

I recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, well-adapted Victorian drama","review":"This is a well-made adaptation of Thackeray's Victorian drama - sumptious sets and costumes, good acting, high production values. This was produced and written by the people behind Pride & Prejudice - and while I enjoyed this - it certainly does not compare to P&P. Natasha Little is splendid as Becky Sharp though I was disappointed that the actress who played Amelia Sedley wasn't \\"pretty enough\\" and the film's plot does tend to \\"jump around\\" a bit. If you're looking for a more satisfying, enjoyable Victorian drama, check out \\"Middlemarch\\" (starring Rufus Sewell and Juliet Aubrey) or \\"Great Expectations\\" (starring Ioan Gruffud) instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technically the worst dvd I have ever watched","review":"I can not give an accurate criticism of this adaptation of Vanity Fair because I have only watched the first 25 minutes of the movie. I stopped watching and began writing this review because I wanted to warn people that the picture quality contained on this dvd is worse than bad. My 36 inch television showed so many video artifacts that it became distracting. I can accept the fact that it is only available in pan & scan, what I can not accept is picture quality so bad and un-even that it looks as if it were dubbed from an old vhs tape. The people at A&E really need to take a close look at how they master their dvd releases. I have also purchased Pride and Prejudice from them and I can tell you that, while it is one of my favorite productions, the dvd quality is sub-par (but nowhere near as bad as Vanity Fair). If you buy this release expecting dvd quality sound and picture, you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad day when I tried it on","review":"Twas Smaller then this model.

I heard one full track and that was 'The Search Begins'. That was all I needed to hear. Considering it is 12 minutes long, I heard quite a bit and loved every minute of it!In my opinion, James Horner's music is most known for immediately catching your attention during a film. His expression of the emotion of the moment or display of raw beauty is displayed so dominantly within a film that one, at least I, would want to hear it again. But lately, within the past few years, his music seemed to be losing its touch. Its power. Troy was a disappointment, save for 'Remember'. Flightplan was tasteless. The Forgotten was pretty good but a bit cliche...sounded more like The Ring or something rather than James Horner. Now he's back!According to the rest of these reviews, the rest of the CD must be worth it also, so I am definitely planning on getting this CD at some point in the future. James Horner is back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I think I saw this movie","review":"As far as movies go, The Missing was not even on par with such cowboy vs. indians classics as let's say, Rugrats Go Wild.

However, this album really lacks when it comes to good material. There really isn't one song that stands out, nothing worth playing over and over. The entire album is pretty much \\"blowing flowers out of your [rear end]\\" types of songs. The title cut, \\"Pictures\\" is about a guy that likes to take pictures of his family and looks forward to taking more. It sounds like something an 8 year old wrote. Rather than wasting 15 bucks on this cd, get a Pat Green or Brad Paisley cd, they are much more worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the real Marnie","review":"Movie was alright but would have been better with the original Marnie (Kimberly J.

However, over time, I have come to really enjoy this video. Sara Paxton plays a good Marnie along with doing the part of the younger Splendora Cromwell. Judith Hoag is back again as the mother, and she has more of a role this time.

Just having \\"Rollin' and Tumblin'(Part 1)\\" is worth the price of the CD alone. Another outstanding song is \\"I Just Keep Loving Her\\". Walter also plays guitar on this CD, a fact that surprises some people. His guitar work isn't in the same league as a T-Bone Walker, Jimmy Rogers or Muddy Waters, but it shows another side of his talent. For folks looking for their first Little Walter CD, this is not for them - go for one of the \\"Best of\\" Chess titles instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far From The Best Of Little Walter","review":"This album is far from the best of Little Walter. These songs were recorded during his pre-amplification days. J.B. Lenoir is perhaps the single most over-rated Blues musician in history, thus I dread hearing his performances on this album. If you're interested in finding out what's so great about Little Walter, buy a Muddy Waters Chess Records compilation and/or \\"Confessin' The Blues\\", a wonderful Little Walter cd. \\"Rollin' & Tumblin'\\" saves this album from being a total bore, as it is some of the most emotive, amazing, sensational, post-World War II Blues in existence!"},{"rating":"1","title":"unbelievable","review":"Like the New York Times review says, this is just unbelievable. Gurganus' writing is episodically thrilling, but the best bits are strewn like chunks through the text, and the characters are ridiculously drawn (I ask you: a cipher called HARVEY MIMS?). I felt excluded and patronised, and I have to be honest: I didn't finish it. It seemed like too much of a long haul for a story and characters I cared little about."},{"rating":"1","title":"SIMPLY DISAPPOINTING","review":"For years, I couldn't wait to have another Gurganus work in myhandsafter reading his two most brilliant books (OLDEST LIVING CONFEDERATE WIDOW TELLS ALL and WHITE PEOPLE). The very first day PLAYS WELL WITH OTHERS came out, I bought it and returned the book 4 days later after reading the first few chapters. Very disappointing. Not one single sentence caught my attention and strangely the style of writing is entirely different from his earlier works. As a gay man, I thought I'd simply adore this story dealing with gay men in NYC, etc but it turned out to be increcibly boring (same old sh--) and too dated. Nothing refreshing or enlightening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult and laborous reading","review":"I have to admit - this is my first Allan Gurganus book - and if it were his first - I wouldn't bother with his next. However, his first novel gathered such good reviews - it makes me curious to go buy the \\"CONFEDERATE\\" novel and see if it's as difficult and laborous a read as PLAYS WELL WITH OTHERS. I myself am tired of all the gay novels telling me how pretty everyone was, how sexy they were, and how much piggy sex was had during the late 70's and early 80's - and now all doomed and dead! What about the average gay guy who lived and died in Indianpolis - yeah - Indianpolis isn't that exciting - but it might make a better story than three boring people in New York who only think of themselves. Mr. Gurganus has left me cold and bored with his new book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a letdown!","review":"I was really excited that a new novel had been written by the author of OLDEST LIVING CONFEDERATE WIDOW. Maybe I anticipated too much, but no way does this book live up to its predecessor. WIDOW brought me into the world of the American South and helped me to understand so much of the experiences of the people who lived through the Civil War and of the mind set of their descendents. PLAYS WELL talked about the New York art scene of the 1980's, but I always felt like Gurganus was treating me like an outsider who could never really understand what it was like. There were some amazingly touching scenes (such as when the narrator first notices his friend's telltale \\"spot\\") that serve to remind us of the level of writing Gurganus is capable of achieving, but those moments are way too few for me to recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, not quite perfect","review":"I read this book at the recommendation of a friend, and I now recommend it to many of MY friends. It's artfully crafted, deeply touching, and thoroughly moving.One caveat: Don't be to quick to judge when you start this book. After the opening salvo, the story hangs a bit while the characters get going. Also, the dialogue is at times a bit \\"precious\\" and too full of self-absorbed banter. This is, I'm sure, quite intentional. I just wish it didn't tax my patience.Overall, a book that will touch the deepest parts of you and will stand up to repeated readings."},{"rating":"1","title":"thin","review":"We bought 4 of these glasses a while back because we loved the design. They are really pretty and bottom heavy so they won't tip, however they taper as they get to the top. Because of this they are so very thin on top that they chip extremely easily. It's hard to wash them and dry them and also I found I had to be very careful when putting them back into the cabinet so that you don't knock it into a shelf.

I saw the Raymond Leppard version of this opera on the stage in San Francisco many years ago. It was a satifying drama set to music. I listen to this performance about every 4 months because this version is one of my favorite operas.I have seen and heard more \\"authentic\\", more complete versions performed and for me the story soon gets lost in the longer versions.The Leppard version also has a fine cast.

And the little teeny sound you get from the turntable is enough to make you cry. There is some good to this product. The cd and cassette sounds are great!!!

My wife and I were impressed with the NSF certification and the HACCP guidelines the thermometer was to follow. However, I have no idea how it can pass such guidelines with any confidence, as the unit we received has the label cocked just shy of 10 degrees counter-clockwise, making the degree reading off by about 3-4 degrees of temperature.The unit is a solid steel unit with no ability to adjust anything. However, if you thought this was to be one of the more precise units, you will be sorely mistaken. Even if I put up with the wildly crooked label, I can't calibrate it for the actual temperature, so I'm left not knowing if the unit came calibrated and the factory had to twist the label, or if the unit would be calibrated if only the label was straightened.It's made in China by a French company. Maybe that says it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not accurate, display rotates, no customer service","review":"After wondering why it showed a few degrees under 32F in our fridge but nothing froze, I put a second digital thermometer in there and discovered it was reading about 8F too low.

The concert is in a church, and it looks like what you'd expect from a local church film of a concert. The attempt at being a professional production is rather lame. You're watching Russ Taft sing on stage and all of a sudden a grainy film of him from 10-15 years ago singing the same song is spliced into the number. Fortunately, I can get a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Outstanding Album","review":"This is an outstanding album, classic Chicago Blues at its finest. If you were allowed to have only one blues album, Blues Hit Big Town would fill the bill. Wells voice had not yet acquired the deep, gravelly quality of his mature recordings, but his youthful tenor adds to the album's charm. I purchased this CD after hearing one cut played on a local radio station. I'm writing this review while listening to the cuts. I still haven't heard the alternate takes, but I'm completely taken with the magic of this CD. Totally satisfied. Now that I've listened to all the tracks, it is interesting to note that, on the last cut, an alternate take of Blues Hit Big Town, Well's voice sounds more like what we are accustomed to hearing on his later recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Vaudeville Resource!","review":"What a spectacular book!

Slide presents beautifully written articles on hundreds of topics, individuals and locations -- and with a wealth of footnotes and resource lists. There's even a small but exquisite selection of photos. I've been researching vaudeville for years, and I learned more from this one book than any five others on the subject.

The piano solo in Doll of the Bride is intense and gorgeous, and the alto solo epitomizes passionate, take-no-prisoners, go-for-it-all playing. (It gives me chills almost every time I hear it, and I've being listening to this album for years.) The other two tracks are effortless to listen to, and almost impossible to forget. Particularly superb is the bass solo in Island Birdie.

Don't buy it if you are looking for nice flowery, stale synopsises of NIRVANA, PEARL JAM, and all the bands that made their name on major labels. If you want a detailed description of the birth and evolution of DIY punk rock in the pacific northwest that this is the book for you. Don't get me wrong, there is plenty of interesting info on all of your favorite Seattle bands, but there are also bands that you've only heard mentioned in passing and some you've never heard of at all. This is the real Seattle, the whole scene, not just the bands that made \\"grunge\\" and punk commercially viable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great descriptive account of the scene","review":"I'm confused about reviews that claim it's \\"not about the grundge scene (sic)\\" because the book is not supposed to be ABOUT grunge. However, the book does cover many to most of the local bands during the early 90s and of course references the ones that \\"made it,\\" although you'll do better elsewhere for material on Nirvana, Mudhoney, etc. But the book is chock full of material on a huge number of bands--perhaps too many, because some of them fly by pretty quickly. Not much cultural analysis, but plenty of little insights about individuals, venues, etc. The book is strongest post-1975, especially post-1985."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an accurate account of the Seattle Music Scene","review":"While there is plenty of interesting info on many Seattle bands, this book does NOT accurately document the real Seattle music scene. As an active full-time musician in the Seattle-area music scene for over 20 years, this book tends to reflect the attitude of the ROCKET magazine, a now defunct Seattle-area music periodical, which selectively covered only a tiny fraction which turned out to be more-or-less favorite bands of the staff.I would NOT recommend this book if you are interested what actually went on in the Seattle music scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bit disapointing...","review":"I admit, I bought this book for the art & posters. in that regard it is a bit disapointing: the art is all printed in the margins in black and white. The reproductions look like xerox copies -- granted, that is how a lot of the orignal art looked and how it was originally reproduced, but the pictures are so small and grainy, you need a lot of imagination to enjoy them. I was very bummed. Especially since I was looking specifically for art & posters by Art Chantry. If that is what you are looking for, this aint it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An okay book but NOT about the Grundge scene.","review":"This book is okay if you want to learn about Seattle history. Me?

Many laptops don't go this high. I bought this to go with a laptop. My new Toshiba laptop only goes up to 1280x800. I had to back my laptop video down to 1024x768 to show the task bar. And, of course, everything is larger and there is less on the screen than if it was running at 1400x900. It appears many higher end desktop pc video cards have 1400x900 as a resolution selection. I'm mildly disappointed but I probably would have bought it anyway. An excellent value for the money.

The power adapter is very small, being maybe 5\\" by 1.5\\" by 1.5\\" (rough estimate, don't take my word) and it is very light. That being said, the cords are plentiful in length and there shouldn't be a problem with distance from the wall (although it is not one of the longest cords.) It's been about a month and so far the cord has functioned perfectly: it charges fast, it's portable, and it is light.

In weeks, the plastic covering began to separate from where it connected to the plug and just a short while later the wires under their second coating of plastic became exposed, shocking me when I tried to pull it out of the socket. Further, although technology experts at my school assured me this was the same type as what I had before after reading the description posted online, it is definitely not the same strength and I watched my battery which used to last well over 1.5 hours get to the point where it would hardly last me 40 minutes--not something I wanted for my computer-heavy classes.

We bought the replacement adapter and that worked fine for just over a month, but then the same problems started happening again. Of course it's past the 30 day mark so it's too late to return it now. I would recommend looking for a universal power adapter with a sturdy hard plastic tip instead of this one. It may cost more in the short term, but it's cheaper than buying a new AC adapter every 2 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE","review":"I wish I had paid attention to these reviews before I purchased this product!!

Like most fans of this period I looked forward to this new version. Bah humbug. Ray Winstone seemed to be auditioning for a gangster movie and there were too many inaccuracies.The original Six Wives series (a very early Masterpiece Theatre production, I think) with Keith Michell is much better.For historical accuracy the Starkey version is very interesting and gives a better view of both the characters and their time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I feel somewhat disgusted that I lent two evenings of my life to watching this terrible film. Although it appeared on PBS's Masterpiece Theater, I wouldn't call this a masterpiece by anyone's definintion.I am a history buff, but not a historian, and yet I spent most of this movie picking it apart as it was inaccurate on too many things to list.I could have probably overlooked the inaccuracies if it had at least been well acted or interesting, but it was neither. The acting was mediocre, Ray Winstone seemed to be channeling Tony Soprano for his bizarre portrayal of Henry the VIII. Helena Bonham Carter phoned in her performance of Anne Boleyn.I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I would recommend instead that you get Starkey's closer to historically accurate and far more interesting \\"Six Wives of Henry the VIII\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"so so and very historically inaccurate","review":"I was really looking forward to this since I loved the Six Wives one with Keith Michell.

I should have read the customer reviews listed before I clicked \\"buy\\". While the costumes and locations are shot beautifully, the dialogue is insipid and the history is flat out wrong. Misinformation abounds. I would encourage the Henry VIII enthusiast to spend a little extra money and buy the BBC mini series from the 1970's instead.Between the bodice ripping and over wrought emotion on display I expected Susan Lucci to make an appearance. Streaked mascara and all. My advice - skip it. \\"All My Children\\" is cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the rest","review":"I love the old England castle shows and this one with Ray Winstone is so captivating. He is perfect for King Henry VIII."},{"rating":"1","title":"A ghastly mistake","review":"I have little to add to the other reviewers, who categorize this production's inadequacies most effectively. I merely want to emphasize the abysmal casting and mis-casting; take one example -- Emilia Fox was fine in \\"The Pianist.\\" She just doesn't belong here. And as for Winstone? Well, Henry VIII had his vulgar side but he was profoundly concerned with the stature and dignity of his office and was not inclined to let his guard down in public. He was every inch a king, not every inch the bouncer down the pub.Fortunately, relief is at hand in the form of the 1969 BBC 6-parter which towers over this travesty and manages to get pretty much all of the details right. That legendary production is a miracle of fine writing, careful thought, superb acting, and judicious casting (Bernard Hepton was born to play Cranmer, and don't forget Basil Dignam as the awful Gardiner). It's as fresh and vivid as the day it was released!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Henry Soprano","review":"Ray Winstone is very good in the recent King Arthur film, where playing a side-thug to history is fine. But in the title role of this film, his all-to-20th Century thug acting left something to be desired. In fact, the producers admitted to the very flaw of this film as their intention, to make Henry VIII a modern day gangster. Tony Soprano as King of England.Part two, which features Henry in his later years, is much better than part one, but all in all, I still felt this was far too modern an approach to history.My main gripe about this was its lack of historical \\"feel\\" and \\"style\\".

In this one, our hero is in Wales and Shropshire, which we Brother Cadfael fans remember fondly. Once again we have a crackling good story, very well told, with sharp characters, even those who have minor parts. There are fictional and actual historical persons involved, and it's so seamlessly done that you can't really tell the difference.

This one, however, ranks as my favorite of the three. In this book, Justin visits Wales in an effort to find the stolen ransom that had been earmarked to aid in the release of King Richard. She kept me guessing till the end and she also introduced a couple of new characters, Molly and Bennet who I immediately responded to and hope to find again in the next book. The relationship between Justin and his father continues to develop very interesting new twists and Claudine makes another appearance which -though brief- has me eager for the next book as well. If you like mysteries or if you like history- this book is a fun adventure into both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story","review":"This writer manages to absorb the reader in the historical period and brings to light kings, queens and those who serve them as well as the social history. In addition she tells a fast paced and complex tale, full of action and characters that ring true across eight hundred years. She hasn't been bogged down by the conventional wisdom about the time and its people (Richard - good, John - bad) instead we see them as the complex and often confounded people that they were. She shows us the struggle across the Welsh marches, the beauty of Wales and the strength of its people.She has given us a protagonist with a wonderful mixture of strengths and failings. Justin de Quincey is maturing nicely in this series. I'm looking forward to reading more about his exploits."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthwhile sequel","review":"I am very impressed by all of Ms. Penmans' books that I have read. The sheer amount of historical research that goes into them is mind boggling. Dragon's Lair is the third installment in her mystery series. I think my favorite is still The Queen's Man; however, Dragon's Lair is a worthy contender.Justin de Quincy is yet again sent off on a mission on behalf of the legendary Eleanor of Aquitaine who is the ruling monarch of the English, Aquitaine and Normandy empires while her son Richard the Lionheart is in an Austrian dungeon due to being captured on his way home from the Crusades.Part of the ransom has gone missing in the deep forests of Wales. Eleanor sends Justin to investigate and return the ransome if at all possible.In typical Penman mystery fashion there are a number of twists and turns so it's not easy to guess what is on the next page.I highly recommend it for people who like mysteries or books based upon the early ages of the English empire."},{"rating":"1","title":"De los Angeles is lovable, but the rest . . . uh oh","review":"This 1960 EMI recording finds the wonderful de los Angeles as appealing as ever, but she didn't have the colorature for Violetta, only the pathos and vulnerability. Serafin was old and tired by this time, and his conducting is lackluster and often slack. The thankfully forgotten tenor, Carlo del Monte, blares away in mindless fashion half the time, and the elder Germont, Mario Sereni, is as faceless and dull as he was in Callas's legendary Lisbon Traviata.I'm giving it straight not to criticize those reviewers who clearly love this set and ignore its flaws, but to let newcomers know what they have in store. I love de los Angeles as much as anyone, but a diamond can fall in the mud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"My 9 month old daughter is bored with this already.

It's wonderfully interactive, having three different sound options to choose from, as well as full of color and texture. The little flowers light up with soft glowing lights and the chimes sound like little tinkling wind chimes on a sunny, summery day. The music it plays isn't annoying and the I especially enjoy the \\"If You're Happy and You Know It\\" song because it's interactive: my daughter can clap her hands when the music stops and when she touches another flower, the second verse starts. It also has the option of playing each flower as a note, so my daughter can play it like a wind chime. Very cute! I would definitely recommend this toy to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good read","review":"This was a very good story to read.

And I liked the design of it as well. With a cool name like \\"Bullit\\", it's got to be halfway decent, right?Well, it worked fairly well at first. It definitely fulfilled my wish of not lighting the object that it was focused on too brightly, although it had a shorter \\"light life\\" each evening than my other solar lamps. But then we had a good rain and my buddy the Bullit doesn't appear to be waterproof. It continues to work, but there is so much moisture in it that it condenses on the top of the plastic cover over the solar panel during the day.

If you look on the nutrition labeling on the back, it shows that you must consume 10 tablets to equal 112% of the RDA (Recommended daily allowance = 80 mg/day). This works out to 9 mg of vitamin C per pill!!! So, to equal 500mg as the front label indicates, it actually takes 56 tablets -- not 1 tablet !!! I believe the 500mg stated on the front label may actually represent the weight of each tablet (consisting of compressed Indian Gooseberry) but not the weight of vitamin C. If you want to take 500mg of vitamin C daily, this bottle of 200 tablets will last a whopping 4 days !!! A month supply, therefore, will cost about $170.00. What a rip off!!

I ordered the cradle and the discription says it comes with a data cable. That is BS, it does not. It conmes with a power supply, which by the way includes all the international voltage adapters which I have no use for and which just add cost. It DOES NOT come with a data cable. It requires that you use the data cable that came with the Treo. That means I have to remove the cable from the cradle and from the neat wire bundle I use and then use it seperatly for my notook. OK, so I will just buy an additional data cable however this product is:1. Misleading as it does not have a data cable I need2. Wasteful as many of us have no need for the included voltage adaptors for places most of us will never use a 650."},{"rating":"2","title":"Docking Cradle","review":"The docking cradle should be an included item with the phone.

I leave mine charging most of the time that I'm in the office, and with it in the cradle, I can easily grab it if the phone rings-not as easy with it plugged in.I returned my first cradle after a month, thinking I had just drawn the unlucky dud. My second one conked out after a few months. Same symptom for both- would not reliably synch. Usually I can get it to work if I jiggle everything just so, but it is quickly getting to the point where that doesnt work EVER.I have a third party cradle coming in the mail.

It's already in the trash...I'm not even bothering to return it.I just don't understand product designers. They obviously don't use the products themselves, or they would never make them so badly. This doesn't have any weight to it, despite the fact that the connector is a very snug fit. This means that docking or undocking the Treo is always a 2-handed operation...which is simply inexcusable.Also, the sync capability works about half the time. I've even switched out cables. It's just garbage. Don't buy it. I just bought the Seidio Innodock instead. It's also a 2-handed job (hate that), and the sync button is so small and takes so much pressure to depress that even THAT is a 2-handed operation. But at least it syncs when you hit it.VERY SAD.

It's simple clean lines was a vast improvement over the cable clutter caused by the basic chaging and sync cables. For power users, the extra battery charger is a must. With a seperate spare battery, you can keep battery power at the ready at all times.Having said that, it is just a shame that this item is considered an add-on accessory despite the highend base price of the Treo 650. It seems Palm is getting away from cradles on all their units. Furthermore, the list price for the cradle is high for what it is. Luckily Amazon is selling for 2/3 of the price.All-in-all this is a very useful accessory if you can overcome the annoyance of paying extra for something that should have been included in the original package."},{"rating":"2","title":"No problems","review":"I thought the price Amazon was ofering this at was crazy ($25): at the same time, the Palm store wanted $50 for the same thing.

Yes it will charge another battery while the phone is in the cradle, but it just doesn't sync right. I could never get the thing to Sync and was resorting to the incredibly slow bluetooth syncing option until I just gave up on my cradle and started using just the cable.

Very detailed with light up eyes, but not really made to be played with, but to display. I found no reason to re-paint this with chrome paint, as many other reviewers or buyers may insist on doing. I found the existing paint job really acceptable, with some battle-damaged areas for realism. The only MINOR complaints are when the figure holds the gun, it tends to be a little too heavy for the arm, and it swings downward a bit and cannot be locked or clicked in the upper range. But, not really too big of a deal. The light up eyes are a nice feature, but only lit for about 10 seconds, then goes out. Would rather have it click on and off manually. Again, not a big deal.

Not so now!I am disappointed with Grisham. Why throw away the good will he has built over the years? People are still reading this book out of habit of picking up the latest Grisham, but it is nowhere as good a read as his previous books. The length is disappointing too for the price. The story is stale and the book certainly does not deserve to be on the best seller lists. This one is purely commercial folks! Coming right at Christmas Time too! Just a very average book that would have gone unnoticed had it been written by another less well known author.If you love the original Grisham, Skipping Christmas then, is a book to skip altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this Christmas tale!","review":"Skipping Christmas is a disappointing, boring book, and that's a lot to say from a fan of John Grisham. Its tone is grinchy, and what might have been funny comes off as simply a little dumb. The sarcastic, cynical tone is not balanced by any sense of redemption; even the gift given at the end of the story is not enough. Blair proves herself to be a selfish, thoughtless child, and the way the neighborhood comes to the family's rescue on Christmas Eve is unconvincing; Luther Krank is no match for George Bailey.

They decide to go on a Carribean Cruise instead of spending money on things they will never have use for. The problem is, the Kranks live in a neighborhood that is obsessed with christmas, and the Kranks are getting more trouble,for skipping Christmas, than they thought.

When I finished reading this book I told everyone what an excellent holiday movie it would make. I'm so glad that is finally happening! Although, I'm not going to jump the gun on that... I know that I often hope that books I've read will be adapted to the screen and I end up hating the movie because they never seem to do the book justice.

I should have skipped , \\"Skipping Christmas\\". This was certainly not his best venture. I almost wonder if he even wrote it! By its pure brevity I knew there wouldn't be much there as far as plot, but thought it might be inspiring like, \\"The Christmas Box\\" of past years. It was so predictable and sterotypical. It might just make it as a script for a Chevy Chase movie--the part when Mr. Krank falls off the roof-- oh, wait a minute ,that's already been done! I almost wonder why he wasted his time on this. Surely he doesn't need the money and I wouldn't waste yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time.","review":"I usually enjoy his books, but I was disappointed with this one.

I would have preferred a different ending, rather than a traditional Christmas one that we find in \\"It's a wonderful Life\\" and \\"A Christmas Story\\". Maybe it would be considered black humor, then, but hey, why not go out on a limb and try something new?I've read a few of John's books, great page turners, false drama created by not telling us who the \\"evil\\" person behind the story is. And then in one chapter, the person is exposed, and whammo, its over. Nonetheless, I enjoyed those books and that's what counts!This one, however, was just too stereotypical, predictable, and after a while downright tiresome. I really enjoyed the first half of the book because it exposes the mass consumerism rampant during the holidays, something we all should reflect upon.I say, read the first half, until their daughter calls from Florida, and then toss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diminishing Returns","review":"While the first third of this book is reasonably engaging, the story begins to repeat itself. The book grows redundant. The same point is made again and again. Things are said over and over. Buy the book for more.Boredom is an art; absolute boredom is an achievement. I hereby tip my hat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts with a bang ends with a whimper","review":"The book is very interesting it takes a glaring look at the commercial and pagan holiday. Luther chooses to not take part in this for financial reasons, but unfortunately his wife is not as strong as he is. In the end they succumbed the all of the pressure, harassment and ridicule of the neighbors; fearing to upset their inconsiderate daughter. It is sad that everyone was willing to lie to her, but unwilling to respect Luther (his wife included). The audio book moved well, but the ending seems to have been written by a different author."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've ever read","review":"Grisham should be ashamed of this book, which is complete drivel. I couldn't stand any of the characters, ESPECIALLY the protagonists. Whiny, spoiled housewife and narcissistic, spineless, rude accountant - what's not to like there??? By the middle of the book, I was actually looking forward to their trip being ruined! Completely unbelievable scenarios and dialogue throughout (what planet do these people live on??), capped with an utterly ridiculous ending. (We're supposed to consider Luther a hero because he gave away something that he wasn't going to use anyway?? Um, o.k.) What a waste of time and money - like something from a middle school creative writing class."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love John Grisham, but...","review":"This is far below his best work. Gisham is in his element writing about lawyers. A Painted House, while given great reviews, wasn't nearly as good as his gripping legal suspense novels.

Buy any other Grisham book, but don't buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain not good","review":"I normally enjoy John Grisham's books, but I really didn't like this one at all. I'm actually surprised to see so many people liked it. The book seemed more like a sad attempt at a screenplay for the next beloved Christmas film (along the lines of National Lampoon's Christmas), but everything was so cliched and easy-to-see-coming that it would make a terrible movie. Plus, everyone cared way too much that the \\"Kranks\\" (please!) were skipping Christmas, to the point of not even being fun-fiction-believable. I would recommend skipping this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Novel I've Read","review":"Someone call Clive Cussler and tell him this piece of amateurish drivel supplanted _Inca Gold_ as the worst novel I've read.

Sadly, this novel is to good writing what any Jim Carrey performance is to good acting; that is to say, not remotely related."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obviously a screenplay","review":"I listened to the unabridged version of this book as an audible.com download...what a disappointment. I don't expect Great Literature from Mr. Grisham, but this was one of the worst books I've ever read. It reads like it is intended as a screenplay, starring Chevy Chase or Leslie Nielsen.

I finished it in 3 hrs. Luther is such a tan BAH-MUMBUG' in this book until the one fateful call from his daughter, that makes his wife spin into action on Christmas Eve to get the Christmas spirit going, in a not so cheerfull house. With the help of their neighbors and the community, they are able to pull it off with out a hitch. My only question for this book is. Did they get the tree back to the rightful owners, before they returned and did his wife and family find out about it???

Fortunately it was short and an easy read so I was able to finish it in a couple of days. I read the book a few days after Christmas and it just reminded me of all the craziness of the holidays which by then I had conveniently forgotten. The prevailing of the Christmas spirit at the end of the story was certainly not enough to justify the long \\"adventure\\" leading up to it.

I can see Raymond Barone from the TV sitcom playing the part of Luther Krank. He's supposed to be such a serious, dollar counting, sly man but his antics will crack you up. Nora's tanning bed scene made me laugh and I will always think of this book whenever I see a \\"Frosty\\" decorating anyone's yard!!!I recommend everyone to read this cute, little book of modern day Christmas.

The rest of the book did not live up to the first chapter.Having read some of Grisham's exciting writing,I am having trouble with the notion that this is one of his books. His other books have main characters who are strong individuals. The Krank's, on the other hand are wishy-washy, afraid of their neighbors, terrified of disapproval by others. The theme of the book-that Christmas has become an expensive chore instead of a delight-certainly has merit. Luther Krank's decision to \\"skip\\" Christmas (meaning skip all the usual preparations) and go on a cruise instead seems innovative and I cheered him. But the rest of the book is spend with Luther and Nora abolutely COWERING in fear over what their neighbors say and do.Very frustrating silly book. Anyone want to buy mine?Lynn Badler"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get me to the used bookstore pronto!","review":"My family has a great, dry, sarcastic sense of humor, but we found this CD to be incredibly boring and a waste of 4 hours. We didn't care about the characters, understand where Grisham was going with the story, or feel at all satisfied by the ending. A basic problem is this: Why would the neighbors care if you decided to skip Christmas? Mine wouldn't. And why would a couple not be able to explain to their grown daughter their change of holiday plans? We will go back to true classics, such as A Christmas Story and A Christmas Carol. No wonder the film adaptation of this clunker tanked at the box office."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light, Formulaic, Predictable","review":"This book seems like something Grisham whipped together in a week to release just before the Christmas season last year. Granted it worked out wonderfully for him, another #1 bestseller, but this is a short one-day read, nothing groundbreaking.Grisham fans will likely pick this one up, but what you get for what you pay is a tragedy.

Thank goodness it wasn't a lengthy volume; I might have had to change my commitment to finish every book I start. I didn't find the characters to be real people; I can't believe anyone would act as they did.

Everybody was so mean to each other or envious. The Krank marriage was a bore. Their lives were so mundane. I especially hated the stressful times the Kranks had as they were preparing for their daughter's arrival.

The two together have me laughing hysterically. I really liked Luther and Nora and can imagine them being my next door neighbor. They were two people that had done the Christmas thing year after year and wanted something different. Everyone wants that, but this year it backfired. Everything was so classic, the office party, the calendar and fruitcake sales, the shopping, the food and the tree. Luther handled it all so well. However, when it all boils down, Christmas is all about family, friends and holiday cheer. Totally enjoyable book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"Skipping Christmas is well-written and has a few amusing moments. Nevertheless, I was disappointed in the book.A more obnoxious group of characters I never hope to meet, with the possible exception of Luther himself. (His daughter and her boyfriend are nice, but they only appear at the very end of the story). Nora is totally disgusting. How could any man stay married to her?

The characters are hollow and unpleasant with very little to say. There seems to be very little Christmas spirit and far too much oneupmanship. But the most upsetting part of this sad tale is the totally dysfunctional relationship the Kranks have with their absent daughter. If my relationship with my grown children were as empty as the Kranks is with their daughter,Blair, I guess I too would see the \\"charm\\" that some of the other reviewers have referred to.

Sorry, I normally am easily amused, but if this was supposed to be humorous I certainly didn't laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Fun!","review":"This book is such fun. It is not typically Grisham but rather a satirical,easy read. Poking fun at the commercialism of Christmas, the author brings out thoughts and feelings we have all had around the holidays. With classic comedic satire, Grisham points out how we have let the trappings of the holiday overide the true meaning of this most important Christian celebration. This is the perfect time of year to read this novel. By January or February, I am ready to read something light and humorous. And of course, the true meaning of Christmas always prevails.

As a person of color I am more than double fed up with people thinking that it's just a-ok to look down on people like me. Luther Krank after all he went through to regain his Christmas spirit, still proved himself to be a narrow minded bigot in the end.

This was funny and I couldn't wait to get back home,from my Christmas shopping sprees, to pick it back up again. I didn't want it to come to an end. I dare anyone to read this and not be just a little bit tempted to do the same thing that Luther wanted to do. I'm still considering it myself for next year. Don't hesitate to buy this one and get an extra one to give as a present. It's good for many laughs and the story wraps up well. Just a little Christmas humor there.Grisham may want to consider writing comedy for a while. I read somewhere that odds are this one will be a made-for-televison movie by next year. Merry Christmas readers!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A new low for Grisham","review":"Trite, predictable characters. Predictable plot. Sugar-sweet ending. Just a waste of time and money.I should add that I really like Grisham as a writer, despite the sometimes formulaic approach. He's readable and entertaining. This one stinks, though. He should be embarrassed to publish this under his own name."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poorly written book!!","review":"I am very dissapointed. I loved other John Grisham's books but this time he really missed the mark.I was taken aback by the author's tendency to stereoyping characters, making some sterotypical expectations about their daughter's Peruvian boyfriend.The characters are shallow and hypocritical.Not worth the money I paid for it nor the time spent reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip the book--","review":"i'm shocked that so many people enjoyed this book. I found it poorly written, predictable and redundent. If you are considering reading this book spend some time reading the people who gave it only one star. They seem to have a clear handle on why it's not worth your time reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A painfully predictable screenplay","review":"As if we needed any further proof that Grisham's a hack, he took a break from writing formulaic legal thrillers to grind out this thinly-veiled screenplay in which a caricatured pair of middled-aged empty-nesters decide to beg out of Christmas. Hilarity ensues with painful predictability."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Look at Christmas in America","review":"Luther Krank, the modern day Scrooge hero of this story, is my kind of guy!!! His views on the hassels, commercialism and superficiality of the American Christmas experience match mine in many ways, and his idea to skip the whole thing is an excellent one. Unfortunately, as Krank discovers, it isn't quite that easy. Also, in the end, he finds that, despite all the aggravations, there is some merit in the real Christmas spirit.This little book is very entertaining even though a bit exaggerated--particularly at the end. I am concerned, however, how it will be adapted to the big screen. It could turn out well, or it could end up being another goofy movie with a crazy, over the top ending. We will know that shortly."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unsmiling, grim little tale","review":"A Grisham fan, I looked forward to a different style of novel from him. What I found was an interesting premise but a really mean story. I found the characters hypocritical - those who were \\"in the spirit\\" demanded conformity from all and terrorized those who didn't. Without missing too much, I skipped a chunk of the story in the middle and read the ridiculous ending. Unfortunately, it was as slapstick as any \\"Christmas Vacation\\" movie and as unbelievable. The only skipping I would recommend is this book altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't imagine?!?","review":"I can't imagine why anyone would find this story worth reading. Throughout the book I continually anticipated something that never came about. By the end of the story I felt let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Grisham can tell a tale even if it is ripped out of Dr Suess and then made into an even badder movie .. so good for tale telling and not so good for repetitious weak plotting"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, fast read when you need some humor","review":"This book was a great read. It was fast and funny. It's different from other Grisham books as it is not about lawyers. It's great how all the characters are over the top and how their situation gets worse as Christmas approaches. This book is a definite recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo for diversity","review":"As a novelist I found Mr. Grisham to, once again, be capable of telling a story very well without being confined to his original successes! His versatility is exceptional - all those wonderful legal stories, then A Painted House and now \\"Skipping Christmas\\", this funny story that touches so many corners of our heart. I marveled at the wonder of actually laughing with a Grisham book! It surely will be a light-hearted Christmas movie in the near future. Bravo for his diversity, his ability to change courses and still show great writing abilities and for proving that a writer can change venues and still be true to his art!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny and Light","review":"I read this for our Book Club, but I had read it a couple years ago when it first came out. I think the second time I read it, I found it funnier than the first time. It is a rather silly story line, but I think that is the point. Has the commercialization of Christmas gone a bit too far? I felt like I lived on this street and the street was on a sitcom. I thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was...a light read that in the in the end expressed what the spirit of Christmas SHOULD be about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Yes, this book was well written, however it can hardly be called a novel. It is more of just a longer short story with a very simple plot. This novel is also very short providing only a day or two of reading. All in all this book is definatly not worth all the money. I would reccomend buying another book to fill your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable","review":"This is not one of his serious mysteries, but a fun one about a couple who decides to skip all the hoopla of Christmas because their daughter isn't going to be home for it this year. They decided that they would use the money for a trip instead. They run into all sorts of censorship and problems from their neighbors and everyone over the deal. It is quite entertaining. Buy the book if you want something that is light to read and leaves you smiling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anna's Favorite Christmas Book","review":"Skipping Christmas is a funny and short book about Nora and Luther, an older couple. When their daughter goes off to South America with the Peace Corps, Luther wonders how much money they spend on Christmas. He crunchers numbers for days and finally comes up with a huge amount. He decides that this year, they will skip all the Christmas festivities and go on a cruise instead. Luther believes this is a full proof plan because it will only be himself and Nora home for Christmas, and the will miss all the crowds, stress, and putting up the dreaded Frosty on the top of the roof. He picks a wonderful cruise that sounds like paridase. He and Nora go to the tanning salon and both get nice tans in the middle of the winter. Will their plan work? Read the book to find out! I know you will love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Christmas Book!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Its something I would definitely recommend to read right before Christmas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of fun and quite a bit of heart...","review":"I'll admit right off I am not much of a John Grisham fan, but I thought this book was laugh-out-loud funny. The whole time I was reading it, I thought that it would make a great movie. Unfortunately, they ruined that. Oh well... I highly recommend this book to anyone who believes that Christmas is more than just decorations; that it is primarily about family and friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, fun holiday reading","review":"What a great, amusing holiday read about Christmas...I chuckled out loud at Luther's over the top neighbors and you really begin to think about how ridiculous the whole Christmas frenzy has become. Wouldn't it be gret to skip the whole season and hassle? Great read...definitely recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a pleasant christmas story","review":"Let me begin by saying that I grew tired of John Grisham's legal thrillers some time ago so I approached this book with skepticism. I was delightfully surprised by this book - with the most pleasing blend of comedy, drama, and yes - even real emotion. The book is a short read and one that I will reread every year.The story focuses on a married couple whose daughter has left them on their own for Christmas. Vowing to buck the tradition and ignore the holiday the couple face the hostilities of those around them who see participating in Christmas as a civic responsibility. Several twists bring the story to a place where the heart is warmed, the belly can revel in a hearty guffaw, and where the meaning of Christmas, for this family, is (re) discovered.This is not great literature nor Dickens, but it is a light-hearted Christmas story well worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"We're All Human","review":"I hate to do this, because I'm a huge Grisham fan, but this book is a bore. The only reason I finished it is because it was short, and I was trying to kill time on a flight. This wasn't because it's not a \\"classic\\" Grisham tale - I enjoyed \\"A Painted House\\" - but rather it just seemed uninspired.You never feel a connection with the two main characters, Luther and Nora, so when the story starts what I suppose is intended to be its climax, you just don't care. After finishing this book, I felt like I had just watched a bad sitcom Christmas special. I'm a huge Grisham fan, and would have given a mediocre book my full support, but this was just dull. Oh well, we're all human, and this is definitely the exception to an otherwise great collection of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry, I really tried","review":"While the premise was great, I ended up putting the book down in disgust. I genuinely enjoyed the concept, two people vetoing the commercialism, opting instead to enjoy a holiday vacation. Great idea right? Wrong. I found that the characters suffered from a lack of spine. Why would anyone hide behind curtains and doors to escape from carolers? Escaping to the basement to avoid yet another round of neighbors persons trying to get donations, when a simple no would suffice. The final straw for me was when Carol, the main characters wife, forgoes all her plans to appease a daughter who is quickly flying back to the states after a month. Discussing this among my friends we agreed unanimously that we would have told the daughter to enjoy her stay in the house, we are going on a cruise. Sorry Mr. Grisham. I've enjoyed many of your books, and will continue to look for your titles, but can't in good faith put this on my shelf. I will be skipping this title for Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quick Christmas read.","review":"John Grisham has been one of my favorite author's over the years. The story of this book is something that a lot of people would want to do. Skip ChristmasLuther and Nora are a typical family. Taking a lot of time to celebrate Christmas and later regretting it. Luther at times in this book seem to get a little bit out of hand with the whole idea of skipping chrismas.Overall the best parts of the book were the Frosty parts and of couse I loved the last 50 or so pages of the book.This was a good quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham Attempts Sitcom & Fails","review":"It's rare that I don't finish a book that I've bought, but this was one of those. After it got to a point of total non-believability, much like a ridiculous sitcom in which the characters dig their own holes, I slammed the book shut and gave it to someone else. There are too many real stories, with characters and plot development and great writing, waiting in my library. This could have been a snappy, tautly-written commentary on misplaced values, but instead it was a draggy story of predictable (but not very realistic) human behavior. It was hard to like a single character or care what happened to any of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham meets Dickens meets... Don't skip this!","review":"John Grisham's \\"Skipping Christmas\\" shows he is more than an author of legal thrillers. As a fan of \\"The Pelican Brief,\\" I wondered if he could pull off a Christmas book. He has pulled it off.\\"Skipping Christmas\\" is not Charles Dickens. Still, he grabs at the reader to consider the important of Christmas, and jabs at the superficiality of the typical Christmas protocols.Never disregarding the true values of Christmas, Grisham wields his pen through a terrific tale of parody and fiction, so close to the reality many of us face durinf the holiday season.So, as you rush out to the mall to buy the sausage sampler for your Uncle Lou, dropping by the hardware store for some outlet multipliers for your tree lights, pick up a copy of \\"Skipping Christmas.\\"I fully recommend \\"Skipping Christmas.\\"Anthony Trendl"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Boring, Boring","review":"If this message saves just one person from reading this book, then I know I have done my job. What a waste of time. It has a truly predictable plot and \\"seen that, done that\\" story line. It is almost as if John Grisham was going for the make a few million when turned into yet another cheesy holiday movie plot. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK...PLEASE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"This book is so horrible, it's hard to believe that John Grisham could have written it. The storyline is unbelievablyimplausible and very poorly written. Someone decides to take a cruise over the Christmas holidays and not decorate; hmmmmmmm. This is a reason for the Spanish Inquisition. The entire neighborhood is up in arms; yep, it happens every Christmas, doesn't it? I really like Grisham's other books but this one is just plain stupid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disappointment","review":"I was so disappointed in this book. I saved it until closer to Christmas, wanting to read a holiday book. But this book does NOT feel like a holiday book at all. I couldn't find anything to like about any of the characters. Everyone in this book spends FAR too much time worrying about what everyone else does and what everyone else thinks of them. Grow up and stop worrying about that garbage!It was also very predictible. I just kept waiting and wondering which little hitch would cancel the cruise plans. And the way it was done was ridiculous -- if your daughter is old and mature enough to got to another country AND be engaged, she's old enough to handle the fact that her parents (GASP!) made plans without her. The idea that she could never find out that they had planned to skip Christmas and go on a cruise was ridiculous. Aren't parents allowed to have lives away from their grown children?Skip this one! Maybe Grisham should stick to lawyers?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I reading the same book?","review":"I suspect that Grisham needed a few extra bucks for Christmas spending as this newly published attempt at fiction appears to be a rush job. SKIPPING CHRISTMAS is unworthy of his writing talents. Obviously it will reach the top of the 10 Best, but it arrives there only because of his prior books.My conclusion? A total waste of time.Bah humbug!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Christmas spirit?","review":"In \\"Skipping Christmas\\" Grisham is totally unrealistic about how any normal person or community might react because one couple decide to go on a cruise. The reaction of the community was, I thought, very mean spirited and totally lacking in the true meaning of Christmas. To not advise their daughter of their plans is also totally unrealistic. While this was a mildly pleasant \\"read\\" I found it predictable and drawn-out. Though a short book, I found myself wanting the author to get to the point. Even the ending does not make you feel that it is a community of which you would want to be a part. Skip \\"Skipping Christmas\\" and reread Barbara Robinson's, \\"The Best Christmas Pageant Ever\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Is Steve Martin available??","review":"A quick, hilarious read that screams MOVIE. Steve Martin would be perfect as Luther."},{"rating":"1","title":"less than average","review":"since i have read all of grishams other books, i felt obligated to read this one. i am glad that it wasn;t too long because it seemed less than average in terms of grishams typical style. i think that he has a knack for writing, but i think he is better in writing the suspenseful type of books rather than the non suspenseful types...this is a pleasant enough story but nothing to write home about or tell others about...(although i guess that is what i am doing?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bah-humbug!","review":"This book shows the worst side of people. Even the protagonists were not admirable in any way. A truly boring and odious story. I forced myself to keep reading it because I thought Grisham might have some redeeming message to send to the reader. Alas, it was a terrible read right up to the last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work","review":"This short novel started out extremely slow. It was difficult to get into but I plugged along anyway knowing Grisham would give me a great ending. He took a long time setting up the story for the ending, which was the only thing I truly enjoyed. I'm glad I read this story, however, Grisham should stick to what he knows best - the law and the courtroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Fun","review":"Get the fire satrted, throw a few chestnuts on and read this little novella next to it. It's fun, fast and gets you into the Christmas spirit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham's Weakest Book","review":"This is my far John Grisham's weakest book. He is one of my favorite authors, so I was quite disappointed when I finished reading Skipping Christmas. Although it is a short novel, I took my time finishing it because it just wasn't a page turner as nearly all Grisham's books are. The book's greatest downfall comes from its complete focus on the negitive aspects of Christmas. It certainly did not put me in the Christmas spirit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip Skipping Christmas","review":"Garbage. Pure and simple.Poorly written. Lousy plot. Cynical curmudgeon decides he and the wife will skip Christmas, going on a cruise instead. He considers his neighbors are dolts or scam artists-- including the fire department. Then the daughter, doing volunteer work in South America, decides to come home for Christmas-- with her new husband. Daughter springs this on curmudgeon and wife on Christmas Eve. There will be no skipping Christmas this year! They must make a traditional Christmas for her, even though the whole world is closed for business. The neighbors come to the rescue, ala \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\". And curmudgeon re-discovers the meaning of Christmas. Garbage!Don't waste your money.If you want a really good book, read \\"Peace Like a River\\" by Leif Enger. Though it is not a Christmas book persay, it has a Christmas scene in it that will genuinely spark your spirit. You will enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is racist.","review":"Although the first half of the book was easy and pleasant enough to hold my attention, the second half was horrible. I just finished the book and I have a raging headache. The plot arche is bad enough, the the racist sub-plot just made the whole thing intolerable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this book","review":"What started as a lighthearted and thought provoking account of the commercialism of the Christmas season, ended with a too tidy wrapping addressed to \\"Hollywood - make me an offer.\\" Grisham's sudden entry of the Peruvian boyfriend and the concerns of the Kranks is simply too strange and distracting for this holiday plot, no matter how supposedly sarcastic its intent. Skip this waste of talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Christmas read","review":"A must read for the season.

If you have read Grisham's novels and have been hooked by the story lines but distracted by the virulently racist characters you'll appreciate this warning.Don't get cozy with the Kranks.The reader is informed, halfway through the book, that the Kranks don't want their daughter to marry a man with dark skin. Its impossible to care about what happens to these two from then on.Skip Skipping Christmas. Or stop reading at page 112 and dream up your own ending. Its a fun book up to chapter 13."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-hum","review":"This book was mildly amusing. I'll spare you the details; I'm sure you've seen the commercials for \\"Christmas with the Kranks.\\" That commercial tells it all without even reading the book. This is one time when the movie will actually be better than the book.I would not recommend this book because it is not very entertaining and certainly not thought-provoking. But it's okay if you've been assigned to read a Christmas book for school or a book club.My first John Grisham book in a long time, and I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Study in Modern Insanity","review":"To all of you scholars out there, or to even just the curious, read 1984 by George Orwell before you read this book (and just for kicks, read some of Plato's Republic, too) and get an eye-opener about where our society just might be heading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops!

Something wet and sticky under your shoe. Somebody's dog has been out.Well, that's what this book amounts to. Sniff, sniff.Annoying characters. Extreme cheese with a worse stench. Once the daughter called home, I wrapped it up in a plastic bag and threw it in the trash. Couldn't stand the smell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I expected another John Grisham mystery. Instead I found a predictable and ridiculous short story whose sole purpose seems to be to generate holiday related sales."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Easy but Pleasant Read","review":"As John Grisham is one of my favorite authors, and a friend had reccomended Skipping Christmas to me, I decided to spend a few hours reading this skinny novel. I was told that it was \\"hilarious\\", and even though it was September and nowhere near Christmas, I decided that I could use a light book to break me from the heavy reading I'd been doing.I wouldn't really describe the beginning of the book as hilarious, but it did describe how Christmas has gotten entirely out-of-control. However, near the middle to the end of the book, I found myself cracking up after every sentence. If you're looking for a light and funny read, Skipping Christmas is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puzzled","review":"As someone who hates the commercial aspect of Christmas, I was delighted to read Skipping Christmas, and was actually rooting for the Kranks to get out of town as fast as possible.

I loved all his other books and am hoping for more of the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skipping Christmas","review":"The book I read was Skipping Christmas by John Grisham. I thought that this was a great book. It is about a couple that decides to skip all the chaos of Christmas and use the extra 4,000 dollars that they usually use on gifts, food, ect. And go on a cruise to the Island Princess. They decided to do this because their daughter, Claire, went to take an extra class on an Indian village. This way, she would not know about it. They got a surprise though, when Claire called to say that her and her new fiancé would be coming home for Christmas dinner. I would only recommend this book to an older age group because it is a little advanced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and heartwarming a christmas classic","review":"I really enjoyed this book from start to finish. It shows how the holiday season is way to much comercialized. It is very funny and it's very heartwarming.

A christmas classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skipping Christmas","review":"This book is best skipped! What a disappointment.

I am frustrated as I do not see any story or any point to the whole book. I mean the plot is absurd, ending predictable from the very first page and characters are way too out of reality.Disappionted and I am wondering if I am going to ever get a legal fiction out of Grisham!Thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas According To Outsider","review":"I am a non-Christian and lived North America for five years.I don't think Skipping Christmas is a funny story but agree that this is a classic. John Grisham has skillfully depicted the world in a manner that an outsider will observe Chrismas in North America. You can see the picture better when you keep the decent distance from it. This season in North America, Chirstmas spirit is so immense everywhere that I do not surprise even some insiders plan to skip it. We are living in an era of global economy where too many 'different' people are breathing and living close by. Skipping Chrismas is a classic becasue it was written in 2001 and published after Sept 11. This book is probably showing us a clue to think about what is like those terrorists' feeling - why they hate America.I am a Buddist and I enjoyed Chrismas North America very much - as a visitor."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Grisham!","review":"Grisham writes about comical misadventures, ironic twists of Christmas-y fate, full of spilled eggnogs and fruitcakes, beadknobs and broomsticks, along with playful banter, lightly wrapped in festive mayhem.

I wouldn't be suprized to see this made into a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and not at all funny.","review":"I agree with all the other one or two star reviews of this \\"Holiday\\" story. Mr. Grisham should donate his profits (including my few dollars) to the Salvation Army. Many things were irritating about this book. One of the things that stood out to me was the fact that main characters were running to a tanning booth before their cruise - but on the other hand the father was afraid that his daughter's Peruvian boyfriend was dark skinned. It was OK that he was a doctor! What garbage! Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This was a ridiculous tale made worse by the splash of racism thrown in for....added holiday cheer, perhaps?I hated every page of this story.

I really cannot think of a redeeming feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and well written","review":"I think this book is very well written.The author writes about a family who skips christmas because their daughter leaves for college.Its very well written and easy to read. Anyone that likes christmas can relate to this book.Its funny because it show the krank family's consequences of them skipping christmas and shows true reality of what people go through on the occasion.For example spending a large amounts of money on food like fruitcakes and spending lots of time decorating christmas lights.This story is also very suspensful because you want to know what will happen next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired","review":"The mix of an unoriginal storyline and uninteresting characters resulting in a less than enjoyable read. Not one of Grisham's best works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not like Grisham and may become a classic Christmas story","review":"I have read all of Grisham's novels -- even before he was famous. I saw a different dimension of this author when I read A PAINTED HOUSE. SKIPPING CHRISTMAS is another novel that doesn't seem to have been written by Grisham.First, SKIPPING CHRISTMAS is hilarious. I caught myself laughing aloud. I didn't think Grisham had much of a sense of humor, but this book shows it. Second, the characters are vividly written. The reader will witness quick but coherent character development. The characters seem too real. I am willing to bet Grisham based the personalities on people he has known.This is a charming short story. In hundred years, people will continue to read it and laugh. It surely will become a Christmas Classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, quick satire","review":"Skipping Christmas can be divided into two parts. The first is spent building the anticipation of what a wonderful idea it would be to skip Christmas. All the insanity of the holiday season is exposed, making you feel tired just thinking about it, and relieved for the characters who are going to be able to avoid it. However, a plot element that was fairly easy to see coming occurs and derails their plans, which makes the second part of the book. Though predictable, this second part is quite funny. If you ever thought skipping Christmas might be a good idea, or if you just don't enjoy the holiday season, then this is a good read. If you love everything about the holidays, then skip the book. You wouldn't get it, anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"fabulous little book","review":"This book was very comical, and reminded me of some christmases past with my own family. I would definetely recomend reading it. Although, the story is kinda slow in coming to the plot, it is an easy read. Not much mystery involved however. Being that its a John Grisham novel I sort of expected it to pack a bit of a punch in that category. Some of the scenerios that Mr. Krank went through actually made me laugh out loud. In all its a very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"You probably shouldn't skip this one.","review":"Christmas time means many things to many people, even Jewish people. Grishim manages to capture the frantic, craziness of the holiday season on this thin little book that one can read in one night, providing they are all through with their Christmas shopping -- UGH!Definitely, pick this one up next time you're out spending way too much money on everyone except yourself. Drop the few bucks $$$ and splurge on a little literary enjoyment just for little ole YOU! I think you're in for a treat.Reading a short book is such a great diversion during Christmas time, and you'll be tempted to do what the main couple do in the story.Oh yesssss........once you see how they plan on skipping Christmas, you'll plan your escape as well.Happy Holidays!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick enjoyable read","review":"I really enjoyed this book. You understood where each character was coming from, lessons were learned, and the ending was great. Take it on a holiday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book, although too short for the price.","review":"Loved it, because many a Christmas I have felt the same way, it's just too much hazzle and I get stuck with all the work. But when it finally arrives and everyone is enjoying themselves then it seems worth it (almost). But I'd still like one Christmas away from home, maybe not the Carribean but Vienna or Germany, where I could be waited on and just enjoy the whole experience. So I really empathized with the couple in the book and loved the wit of the whole story. Of course, I always love Grisham's books. I only gave it 4 stars because it's such a short read for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun & thought provoking","review":"Well, it will not replace A Christmas Carol or A Wounderful Life but it should be made into a movie.

Being a fan of Grisham's legal thrillers, I was pleasantly surprised at his ability to tell a different type of story. The book is a quick read, fun, and extremely enjoyable. The storyline incorporates lots of light humor while really making a point about the frenetic holiday season. Recommended to readers who enjoy light humor and fun, but don't look for a lengthy legal plot from Skipping Christmas. To borrow a line from CNN's movie critic Paul Clinton regarding a recent movie, 'The literary version of a Happy Meal -- tasty and filling, not particularly nutritious, but generally pleasing for all.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely NOT worth a buy","review":"A good storyline, as can be expected from John Grisham, but Skipping Christmas definitely lacks the substance of most of his previous works. It's an easy read as the book is quite short. Worth borrowing a copy but not something you'll go back to if it's on your bookshelf. Skipping Christmas has the feel of a last-minute push by a publisher to \\"get one in the aisles\\" before the holiday shopping rush. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skipping This Christmas Book","review":"I have always enjoyed reading John Grisham and had no reason to think otherwise until I read this book.

I found the character development good but the story itself lacked depth and the ending was all too predictable. A disappointment for all Grisham fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book.","review":"was into when the book started . About 4/5 of the way into it the character takes a turn. Becomes a pusssy cat.

Very enjoyable. This is not typical John Grisham writing. The book shows it is clearly the time for giving, with not necesarily expecting anything in return."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG WASTE OF TIME","review":"I couldn't get into this book. I liked Bleachers, A Painted House, Runaway Jury, King of Torts, and the Pelican Brief by Grisham but I just didn't care for this one. It's not like his other books at all. It tells of a story of a family who wants to skip Christmas but why? CHRISTMAS is the time to spend with family not poke fun or make light of it. This book wasn't what it was cracked up to be and the story was dumb. Didn't care for it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointing","review":"I love all of the John Grisham books that I have read. This one though is full of characters that it's very hard to like. I don't indentify with them and don't want to. Go buy a painted house and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A quick read is this book's only saving grace.","review":"A couple of hours of my life that I will never regain. A potentially cute Christmas farce that falls flat and is poorly executed. The characters suffer from severe one dimensionality and Grisham's concept of character development seems to involve nothing more than a number of sentences of which punctuation is the only common element. Perhaps most disappointing is the racist undertone near the end of the book, where quite a bit of attention is paid to the skin color of a central character.If you were interested in reading a well written book with a similar concept of a husband interested in living outside the norms of society, you might try Nick Hornby's \\"How To Be Good.\\" At least he makes an effort at literature and is not merely killing trees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want to be depressed for Christmas? Read this book","review":"Yes, Virginia, it does end happily, sort of, but Skipping Christmas is smug, cynical, repetative and derivative, all wrapped up in one easy to wrap package, just like a lump of coal.The characters aren't particularly sympathetic--they aren't even truly awful like Scrooge--they just sort of whine and complain.Some of the points are good, but we already knew that, and the pseudo-redemption at the last is too little, too late. Skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good premise but too extreme and very inaccurate","review":"My husband and I \\"skipped Christmas\\" once by going to Australia and would like to do it again but not to the extreme that Grisham did. You can buy the calendars & friut cakes and put your frosty on the roof and still skip all the other hassles. The biggest problem I had with his book was his research mistakes. Just like his last book, he either decided to do no research or didn't care about being accurate. There is no ship called \\"Island\\" Princess but I'll let that one go. But Princess (and many other lines) does not have any 10 day voyage that stops in Jamaica and the Cayman Islands, those are all 7 day trips. And the biggest blunder - cruise insurance does NOT pay if you change your mind! Many people found this out after 9/11. You have to have a valid (insured) reason to cancel your trip. So his multiple remarks about not having bought insurance wouldn't have made a bit of difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it and Live It!","review":"I have a friend named Jimmy who acted just like the main character in this book. I think anyone who reads this will be able to relate to the subtle intertwined storyline. Captivating pictures allow you to sit and stare for hours.

Maybe the end of this book does that, but the majority of the book is just plain boring. So they decide to skip Christmas. Fine. But it just drags on, and on.Best to just skip the time it takes to read this book and go for a walk in the woods and think about what Christmas means to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Should Stick to Law Novels","review":"This is a horrible, horrible book. It might sound like a lighthearted, fun book to read over the holidays...but it isn't.The basic premise of the story is about one couple that decides to \\"skip christmas\\" and not buy presents or hold the usual festivities. Instead they are going on a cruise. The book is basically abou tthem struggling to not \\"do\\" christmas and how others treat them because of it. Sample: \\"I think she might break,\\" he thought. \\"I had better keep her away from the mall today.\\" (regarding his wife)So, they spend the whole book doing this, and at the end, it's all a waste. Their daughter comes home with her fiance and only tells them on christmas eve about how excited she is to show her boy how christmas is done in the US: parties, decorations, etc. So they end up blowing all of their money on getting it together. If it sounds good, it isn't. Trust me, do not buy this book. If you are otherwise a fan of John Grisham, this may make you hate him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I have read all year.","review":"My friends said to read this book... So I did, and TBH, I have to categorize it as \\"the worst book I have read all year\\" (and trust me - I read a lot). I am *so* glad I didn't buy this or I would have been furious.The characters are flat, insipid, and uninspiring. The plot is unbelievable and as another reviewer stated, is tailored for a made-for-tv movie, the ending is just plain moronic and to top it off, there's even a little racism for good measure.Thoroughly disappointing. Save your time and your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Xmas Read","review":"Grisham does a humorous and touching novel with a what if\\"We skipped Xmas this year\\".

With Tim Allen. Still really enjoyed it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All the wrong reasons","review":"What a terrible Christmas book! Everyone is motivated by all the wrong reasons and no one changes. Everyone is hateful to the Kranks and they are hateful in return. They skip Christmas to save money. They then have Christmas to help their daughter catch a husband. People on their street decorate grimly--not out of a sense of celebration but rather one of duty. When Krank breaks step they don't throw off the shackles, but urge him to get back in step. One of his neighbors calls the cops on him. Charitable people doing good works are seen as con men. The Boy Scout leader gouges him when he has to buy a tree at the last minute. He and his wife seem to be engaged in a war. I feel like I've been ripped off. Thanks John! What a \\"nice\\" Christmas message!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm planning a cruise for Christmas 2002","review":"I must agree wholeheartedly with the reviewer from Durhan, NC - 1 star. I found this book put me in a horrible mood and at times I just had to quit reading due to the level of negative energy between every character! I found the whole neighborhood and the whole Christmas thing so over the top !!! I would have told my daughter, \\"sorry honey we have made other plans.......\\" No tough decision there. If you want a good Grisham read - read \\"The Partner\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I very much enjoyed A Painted House and had high expectations for this book as well. It was childish, from the character names to the inane plot (?). I would have liked to contact Mr. Grisham, but found through his web-site, that that is not possible. I would, in all probability, invest in a sequel to A Painted House, but will steer clear of any \\"holiday specials\\", The Grinch has a much higher rating in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is only 1 reason to read this book","review":"I have read all of John Grisham's books. That is the only reason I would give anyone else to read this one. Luckily it was short and a very easy read.I did not find it entertaining, fun, interesting, or anything else. In fact, I was going to buy it for a friend who is a Grisham fan. Was is the operative word.I have not given up on Grisham, I will read his next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the publishing costs","review":"I have read all of Grisham's books and liked them all (although I thought Painted House was only 'okay'). I found his latest to be offensive (is everyone in this town christian?) and ridiculously unrealistic (why would so many people care?). The ending, obviously, was predictable. Altogether, I would not give it one star; I found it very boring and only read it because my book group picked it. Grisham: Give me a break; go back to the genre you were meant to write in."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"I didn't want to give this book even one star. The only reason it is a best seller is Grisham's powerful name. This story is boring and trite. I should have put it down after I finished the second chapter and it went nowhere. Shame on Grisham, who is a very talented writer, for publishing such pap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable story for the Holidays","review":"This book is light reading, very enjoyable and good for some laughs. It highlights the competition of neighbors trying to \\"out do\\" each other in their holiday festivities, how every organization comes alive for their annual collection and, in all, how commercial the season of Christmas has become. The end has a twist and in it, reveals the true meaning of Christmas present under all the decorations, festivities and commercialism. I would recommend this book - I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless...","review":"There's nothing going for this book. The Kranks live in a strange parallel universe where there's absolutely no tolerance for anything but mass consumerism. There's almost a hint of satire, but it's hard to tell if it's deliberate - in the end, the Kranks are back where they started, without any real development."},{"rating":"1","title":"An author by any other name...","review":"The only reason this horribly written, dull and pointless story was published is because of John Grisham's name. I like him as an author, but this book (CD, in my case) is unbelievably bad. Even after listening for four torturous hours, I'm not sure what the point of the story is --- skip Christmas because it's too commercial, or don't skip it because of tradition. Just bad, bad, bad, all the way around."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Christmas Classic","review":"Skipping Christmas is a delightful novel that will make you laugh out loud! The book on cd is even more funny because you can hear the inflection that the Author intended. It is a book that I listen to every December, to enhance my Holiday Spirit. The movie which is based on this book - Christmas With the Kranks - was very well done, but is still not as funny as listening to the book on cd! A great buy that gives back to me every year I listen to it! Definitely a Classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise! Surprise!","review":"I hesitated for several days before picking up the book, but was hooked from the first page. I loved the main character's gutsy decision to \\"skip Christmas\\" this year. The reaction of the neighbors, the whole block, the folks at work and his wife were great fun to read. I enjoyed the book immensely and even felt moisture in my eyes by the last page. And I am one cynical woman! I plan to buy for my sister for her birthday."},{"rating":"2","title":"If Christmas is a frustrating time for you...","review":"If Christmas is a frustrating time for you, then you will really enjoy this book. I've always been frustrated by the commercialization of Christmas, as well as the expectations that I decorate my house, send a card to everyone I've ever met, etc. I found this book to be hilarious, and if you're like me, you will too. I wasn't thrilled by the \\"surprise\\" (which is given away in many of the reviews below), which is why I subtracted one star from my rating. Sure, it's not a classic Grisham legal thriller, but it was a fun diversion, a quick read, and left me smiling during another frustrating Christmas season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skipping Christmas","review":"Absolutely wonderful!! My husband and son and I traveled from New Mexico to Grand Juction, Colo. for New Years and read this book aloud. Half of it on the way up and the other half on the way back. We found ourselves actually laughing out loud! The typical culdesac where everyone is into everyone elses business. Yea, for Luther, for trying to do something different,and trying to stick to it, for himself and his wife for their 1st Christmas together without their daughter. And thank goodness for all those neighbors that like to stick their noses in each other's business!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Skipping Christmas","review":"Very Entertainting! If you're looking for a good laugh this book will do it for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Skip this book!","review":"A friend of mine read this book to me over the phone, a chapter at a time. It is the perfect book to read aloud, and it doesn't even have to be Christmastime to enjoy it. I thought the book was so funny and sweet. This is a total change of pace from Grisham's usual books, but who says that can't be a good thing?The characters are charming, and the twists and turns of trying to skip Christmas keep you guessing. A cute, light-hearted read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy read in one day","review":"I love John Grisham and to read something that hasn't to do with lawyers from him is fine. This book is very easy to read. I read it in one day, couldn't put it down. Yes, the neighbors are a little annoying, the characters overly dramatic. But isn't it an author's right to do whatever he/she wants with his/her characters? If you don't like this book, don't read it. But I find some people very unrighteously calling this book a bore. It is fun. And I am sure that somewhere in this country, probably on one of the coasts, this is almost like in the book. I have seen some of it.... but after all, it is a book, a fiction! And a GOOD one."},{"rating":"2","title":"compulsively readable","review":"'Skipping Christmas' provides the experience of reading a very good novel without actually knowing it. Its length and ease make it the book I turned to for quite some time when I had nothing to read or wanted some inspiration, in 2002, and as a result I read it numerous times in the first half of last year. Although different from the typical Grisham, I believe his mark is stamped all over it, and it has confirmed that it is the author who I appreciate, and not just the genre, to a greater extent than 'A Painted House'. This christmas tale is written with great perspicacity, and although it largely focuses on the negatives of christmas, is heart-warming nonetheless.Luther is not scrooge, in my opinion, but the book does highlight how christmas loses its appeal when the youngest grow up, but paradoxically how this appeal is able to prevail despite this.Very addictive and enjoyable, and I might just go and read it now..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down.","review":"I'm not a real big book reader, but this one was small and was by a well known author so I thought I'd get it to have something to read while riding on vacation. I couldn't put it down. It was soooo funny. I read the whole thing on my trip back from Florida to SC. I'm sure the normal readers of the author were a little surpised and taken back by this different setting. But Iabsolutely loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bah, Humbug!","review":"Unoriginal, formulaic, its a quick holiday read that isn't the worst I've ever seen, but it's certainly not the best. I disliked the characters from the opening chapter and never felt they ever rose above one dimension. As a minority, I was horrified at the shallowness of the characters when they fervently hoped their daughter's friend \\"wasn't dark.\\" What? Good news. Later it was determined he \\"wasn't dark at all, in fact he was lighter than they were!\\" What a relief. And what dreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skipping this one","review":"This book is intended to be funny and touching. Instead, it is lackluster and maudlin. Don't skip Christmas but do skip this book.(I'm sorry I had to give it even one star but my review was accepted with no stars.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"HoHum","review":"This was an \\"okay\\" book. A quick read, very predictable, very contrived for the holiday season. I would skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money.","review":"This book is awful. I have read each Grisham novel and he has hit the bottom hard. It is apparent that Grisham and the publishers know that many people will rush out and buy his new books based on his reputation--so why put in any effort anymore. I will no longer buy his books based on his reputation, I will wait for him to put in a good effort. The price for this novelette equates to stealing."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"what was grisham thinking? this book is at best mildly amusing. surely we have all thought of skipping christmas at one time or another; how could such an accomplished author have written such a shallow version of the idea? he doesn't need the money, i am sure.so, i am left with wondering, what on earth was the purpose of this book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I only read this one in the bookstore....","review":"In response to another reviewer asking if this book was as insipid and screamingly obvious as it appeared, YES, it is. With the big movie coming out, I picked the book up out of curiousity and read it cover to cover. Boy, did it READ like a movie too, and I could see the ending walking up Hemlock Street. The only other Grisham I've read was \\"A Painted House,\\" which seems immensely more entertaining, plausable, interesting when compared to this piece of detritus. If you're looking for a book that panders to the materialistic suburbanite crowd, and you can't get into the books that Oprah and The Today Show tell you to read, this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull - with a splash of racism","review":"I found the story predictable - a made-for-TV-movie script - except for the slightly disturbing ending. The Kranks are worried that their daughter is marrying a Peruvian, though their worries are slightly mitigated by the fact that he did his training in London. And, when they meet him, they're relieved to find out \\"he isn't dark at all!\\" Phew! Grisham doesn't put this in as a comment on the Kranks but as a genuine aspect of their happy ending. Hmmm... food for thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"A FUN READ","review":"I got this book for my birthday. It's not heavy reading but it's a fun distraction from the holidays. I really laughed out loud to how the neighbors gave Luthur The grief about not puting up a frosty on his house. This book will apeal to the small inner Grinch that appears inside all of us during all the holiday hoopla."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christmas Comical","review":"John Grisham's latest book is a humorous story about a couple who decides that they are going to attempt to \\"skip Christmas.\\" It is very comical in a soap-opera kind of way as it moves through the days of December and the mishaps that encounter them. It is a quick read (one or two sittings) and is successful in delivering the Christmas spirit. This would be a great read if you want to read over the holiday but haven't a lot of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK ...","review":"I bought this book as a nice, little surprise for my wife at Christmas. \\"What a nice little picture on the cover,\\" I said to myself when I bought it. \\"She's always liked Grisham novels\\", I said to myself as I wrapped it in gold foil paper. \\"This will be so funny, I can't wait,\\" as she opened it.DAMN! What a piece of...! This \\"book\\"... so badly, I'm still mopping the floor. This is without a doubt the worst book I have ever read. I cannot believe it ever got published, and millions of us bought a copy.If Grisham is even interested in redeeming himself in the public eye, he should donate every penny from the sales of this book to a worthy cause."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skipping pages...","review":"A big Grisham fan, I was terribly disappointed with this book. It was redundant and I could not finish it. I bought it with such joy and anticipation because I completely loved A Painted House (I want a sequal to that)and expected another beautifully written novel that was not centered on law. Every page seemed to be a chore to read. I pick it up still in hopes that eventually the story will go somewhere, but I am more than 3/4 finished with it and still am not interested. If you want a good Grisham novel, read A Painted House. That was one I could not put down- it was a \\"call in sick to work\\" kind of book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why didn't Grisham use a pseudonym?","review":"Other than to boost sales, I don't feel that Mr. Grisham should be proud of this one. About half way through this brief book, I just wanted it to be over. If you want either a fun or an uplifting Christmas novel, look elsewhere"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why??","review":"I just want to know why on earth John Grisham has started to write bull like this. The Brethren was his last good novel. He should go back the legal thrillers that made him a famous comtemporary writer. Now he is just using his name to sell the crap that he writes. Personally, I want to old John Grisham back."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNDERCURRENTS OF A MIDDLE AGE CRISIS?","review":"FROM READING PREVIOUS REVIEWS AND LISTENING TO A FRIEND'S RAVING ABOUT THIS BOOK, I THOUGHT I'D GIVE IT A TRY. WHAT I FOUND TO BE AN INTERESTING PROPOSITION TURNED OUT TO BE A DISHEARTENING MISADVENTURE. WHILE MR. GRISHAM HAS MOST DEFINITELY ADDRESSED THE MATERIALISTIC SOCIETY IN WHICH WE LIVE, HE HAS ALSO MADE SOME INTERESTING UNDERLYING POINTS, CHIEF OF WHICH, IS THE ESCAPISM THAT WE ALL WANT ON OCCASION, TO PURSUE A DREAM OF A DIFFERENT SORT.I PERSONALLY WAS SADDENED THAT LUTHER'S DREAM DIDN'T GET REALIZED. I ALSO THOUGHT IT QUITE TRAGIC THAT HIS WIFE COULD NOT SEE THE STATE OF DESPERATION THAT HE WAS IN. I DIDN'T FIND MUCH HUMOR IN THIS BOOK. BUT, I DO APPRECIATE THE SELFLESSNESS THAT LUTHER DISPLAYED IN THE END.I CANNOT HELP BUT WONDER IF MR. GRISHAM HAS HIT THE NAIL PERFECTLY ON THE HEAD WITH ALL OF THE UNDERCURRING THEMES. IT JUST SADDENS ME THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD THINK THIS BOOK HUMOROUS."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Quick Happy Read","review":"Never skip Christmas, it could happen as the book,you should never risk it.Having lived in suburbia in the sixtys and again in the mid 80's I had to laugh aloud. I see the one upmanship still happens,of course,that is the basis of the story. A great little story,it assures me that our decision to live rural was a very good one. I did feel this was far off Grisham's usual.I had to wonder if his name was there but he was not the 100 percent Author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining","review":"I received this as a gift and I am NOT a Grisham fan but I truly enjoyed this book. It was written in the spirit of Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic: modern American \\"Christmas Carol\\"","review":"This charming little book will really strike a chord with many modern Americans who feel slightly oppressed by keeping up with the neighbors, and with all the hectic social obligations piled into the holiday season. The story's plot is classic comedy, made all the more delightful by the recognizable characters who populate the distinctly American \\"any-town\\" in which it is set. The American values that come through in the end are truly heartwarming, destining this to become a classic holiday tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic for the Whole Family!","review":"I liked this book so much that I had to tell my husband about it. He doesnt have time to read so I review the books I read to him. Usually he doesnt really seem interested but he actually was laughing when I was telling him about Luther.I have 3 teenagers and I plan to read this book to them while school is out for xmas break. I think it will make for a very nice family time nightly and something for them to look forward to in the future. With a family that runs every which way most of the time, some enjoyable family time with something they all can enjoy should be nice for a change. I will probably have some resistence to the idea at first but after they get introduced to the Kranks Im sure they will anticipate the time together to finish the book! Hope I have given others an idea for a diff way to spend some quality time with family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tacky, Predictable, Unbelievable.","review":"Subject says it all.... I found myself rolling my eyes through the entire book and saying, \\"Give me a break.\\" Almost stopped reading it because of how ridiculous and yet predictable it was. I was hoping the end might redeem it, but it didn't even come close.INSTEAD OF \\"SKIPPING CHRISTMAS\\", try SKIPPING THIS BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this Book","review":"Absolutely horrible. Every single character is barely fleshed out, the writing is no more than adequate, and the plot could come straight from a Lifetime movie. However, what really kills this book is the preposterous ending. After an incredible amount of animosity builds up between Krank and his neighbors, all is forgiven and forgotten in the last few pages. People are trying to get him arrested, and, a few pages later, they are helping him, or receiving gifts from him. Are you kidding? I would never forgive neighbors who treated me that way. Yeah, yeah, it is just a book. But, to defy reality this severely is a crime. I think this book took longer to read then to write."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising start","review":"But as book progressed it became a typical primary school read. Am an avid John Grisham reader.This is one I would not recommend.Man this one could have gone so many fantastic places. It fizzled out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly","review":"Pure fluff, although well-written since it's by Grisham. I light read for the holidays that I found to be pretty predictable. A few funny moments but all in all, reminded me of a Family Channel movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something?","review":"Either Grisham's satire, parody and ironic wit went over my head...or this book was as insipid and screamingly obvious as it appeared. Duh! Stick to thrillers, John. This would have been more appropriate for the yearly Christmas letter sent to your family and friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Grisham-Skipping Christmas","review":"I thought the book was a very \\"hard\\" read. It was not one of John Grisham's better books."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Triumph Of Peer Pressure And Deception","review":"I enjoy many of Mr. Grisham's books. They're fun escapism. But excluding the touching ending, \\"Skipping Christmas\\" brings neighborhood peer pressure and rampant consumption to the front and center. The author takes pains in ridiculing the heaping amounts of guilt, familial bickering and work involved for people who participate in Christmas. The only ones who seem to get a \\"Get Out Of Jail Free\\" card are individuals that are not Christians. Everybody else is expected to tow the line. The Krank's neighborhood is like a Yuletide version of \\"The Stepford Wives,\\" but instead of just the women, practically everybody is an automaton. Ultimately, the book, intentionally or not, praises holiday conformity and family deception. Bah, humbug!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Get It","review":"I've read two very different books by John Grisham and I have to say, I don't get his appeal. Skipping Christmas has a decent premise: fed up with the expense and consumerism of Christmas, a couple decides to skip the celebrations and instead go on a Caribbean cruise. The news doesn't sit well with the neighbors, who for some reason feel they have a say in their decision.As I said, the idea is not bad, but the writing is so mediocre (and in occasions, worse than mediocre) that the novel never engages the reader. The end is better than the rest of the book, and it manages to be moving, but even though this novel is only 277 pages, it feels very, very long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed it's mark","review":"I was instantly [pulled] into the book when I sat down to read it. However, the more I read the more it seemed predictable, and at the same time lost it's way. I was hoping for a better ending, but instead got exactly what I thought would happen. It seemed Mr. Grisham couldn't think of any other way to end it, or forgot where he was originally headed with this book. It could have made such an impression on people if he had stuck with his idea, but instead he bent to what our culture deems normal....putting the Frosty up on the roof..God forbid we do anything else by our own free will. Too Bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or your money on this book!","review":"This Grisham Christmas fairy tale was a big disappointment. The story of Nora and Luther Krank's (could he choose better names for his characters?) decision to \\"skip Christmas\\" was a slow read from beginning to end. Travel plans, nasty, controlling neighbors and a pollyanna ending was laughable. This book would never have been published in the first place had it not been written by Grisham. He should stick to the type of writing he does best. Christmas \\"fairy tales\\" are NOT Grisham's strength!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skipping this book","review":"There was hardly anything that I liked about this book. All the characters are annoying, predictable and NOT FUNNY.I particularly disliked the racist references about Enrique (Blair's boyfriend from Peru).Most of all the story is booooring and simplistic.Do not waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-conformists beware!","review":"As one who is attempting to simplify my own holiday celebrations, I was hoping for a tale that thumbed its nose at the rampant commercialism encountered this time of year. There was some of that, but mostly I was rewarded with a very strong conformist message. \\"Don't be a free thinker...don't make your own choices...just follow the herd and do what everyone else does\\". If you don't want to participate in Christmas, that's fine, just look out for your neighbors and so-called friends. If I had to live anywhere near that street, I would high-tail it to the country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny. Waste of time. Distasteful. Boring. Awful.","review":"If the Kranks really did what they set out to do and skip Christmas, that would have been a good story. The end.Instead, they end up having to scramble to try & make Christmas \\"happen\\" for their daughter unexpectedly coming home. In other words - a typical stressful material holiday, instead of a celebration of friends, family, or even, gasp! Christ's birth. I agree - if you don't want to celebrate Christ's birth, if you don't want presents and holiday decorations and family time - skip it. Why torture yourself?It would have been a good story if they did this. Instead, the plot deteriorated into a very stupid, ridiculous and unrealistic dash to the finish line of \\"making Christmas happen.\\"A completely unsatisfying and unfunny read. Threw it away so others wouldn't have the displeasure of reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed I spent the time","review":"I always believe if you take the time to read, make it worthwhile. Something to tickle the kanoodle at least. This book was just a waste. It would be fun for a 12 year old. It was just downright silly. I expected more from Mr. Grisham. I am willing to bet that one of his kids either wrote it or gave him the story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decency forbids me to relate how I really feel.....","review":"I hate to give a bad review, but I am bound by honesty to say that this is the worst, most frustrating book I've read in quite some time. I picked it up, humbug that I am, thinking \\"Finally, someone who understands that Christmas is a lot of commercial nonsense\\" I was disappointed to find that the characters (including the main characters) were a perfect stereotype of everything I hate about America. Bear in mind that this review is based on partial knowledge. I didn't read the whole book, as I became so angry with the characters' stupidity around chapter fifteen that I hurled the book across the room. I picked it up later and read the last few pages. The story resolves nicely, and, for some, the tension before the release might prove an effective literary tool, but, as I said, I despised everything about these chracters and could bear no more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great story!!","review":"This great story made me laugh a lot! (I also experienced all the emotions reading this story.) I have read every Grisham book and this by far is his best work. I don't remember enjoying a short story as much as this one.A lot of people enjoy giving John Grisham a hard time because he's been so successful. Do your self a favor and read this story you will enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"sentimental drivel","review":"This was too silly for grade school reading group. I couldn't believe Grishman was the author (at least not a grownup Grisham). Did he write this as a pre-teen. Stereotypical goody-goody characters and stupid people doing stupid things. Ugh.. I think I'll celebrate Christmas and skip Grisham!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's wrong with our society?","review":"I'm not sure how anyone could give this book a good rating. I was annoyed thoughout the entire book and wondered how any reader could think the behavior of the neighbors and friends (and many times the wife) was appropriate and acceptable. The message tells me that if you don't do what your friends and neighbors want you to do...especially when it comes to Christmas...they will treat you with hatred and disdane until they can bring you around to their way of thinking. If the majority of our society truly believes that taking a break from the madness of Christmas is this atrocious of an idea, I'm very worried about the direction we are heading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gag!","review":"If you've got money to waste, treat yourself to something else. Grisham should be ashamed of charging for this subliterate drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recommend Skipping \\"Skipping Christmas\\"","review":"Some hack writer has taken over John Grisham's body and wrote this junk to make a quick buck. Don't pay for this book. It has a great premise - the protaganists are \\"skipping Christmas\\" and travelling instead. How will their friends and neighbors handle it? But then the characters began behaving in ways that made little logical sense and the story becomes very repetitive and it just didn't go anywhere. It's just boring and implausible and disrespectful of the reader. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip This Book","review":"Annoying story, annoying characters, annoying waste of money.Skipping this book would have been a better move........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racist gag ruins otherwise light farce","review":"My enjoyment in this book was ruined by Mr. Grisham's use of a racist gag. Without \\"spoiling\\" for others a book now quite spoiled for me, I will simply say this: Mr. Grisham's \\"happy ending\\" included the fact that a certain character turned out not to have \\"dark skin,\\" to the dear, sweet Kranks' \\"relief.\\" Appalling. I cannot think why Mr. Grisham chose to endow his protagonists with this openly racist attitude. It had nothing to do with the story or its theme. I hope that in future Mr. Grisham will refrain from including gratuitous racist gags in his books. He and his publisher should also keep in mind that people of color read -- and purchase -- books, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"Personally I thought this book was awful. I am a huge fan of John Grisham and I did't think this was even close to being as good as his others. The entire plot line is in the title and the end was extremely predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip the book, watch the movie.","review":"I thought the movie was better than the book. While the movie had funny scenes, the book was kinda dry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun!","review":"I see that so many reviewers disliked this book. It is just a quick read that was laugh out loud funny. Of course it is not Grisham's usual genre- but it is a cute story that really put me in the mood for the holidays.It was funny- the descriptions of upscale stationary \\"boutiques\\" and nosy neigbors are caricatures, but very funny ones. Grisham captured modern America quite well. He satirizes the cost and lack of meaning in too many Christmasses, realy making the reader think (while laughing).The happy ending was truly heart warming not at all contrived. Yes it does seem a little like a tv movie (W/Chevy Chase) especially when Luther finds himself hanging from the roof by Christmas lights, but you need a few of those moveis every year- they make Christmas waht it is. I am glad that I ignored the negativity and read this. It was fast- two sittings and very enjoyable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Christmas Carol","review":"This is a Christmas story in the same vein as Dickens' Christmas Carol; in fact, the comparisons are quite striking. We have a Scrooge/Krank who decides that there is little value to the traditional Christmas celebration replete with extra expense and frivolous celebration. We have Marley's ghost/the daughter who \\"visits\\" the main character and reminds him of the reason for the season. We have a rallying of good will from friends, neighbors, and strangers that brings the novel to its happy conclusion that sometimes the best holidays are ones that herald the unexpected and still retain familiar elements. I liked the book. It is leisure reading, but so was Dickens. Lighten up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If it didn't have the words \\"John Grisham\\" on the cover...","review":"I have really enjoyed all Grisham's other books, including the out-of-character \\"Painted House\\", but if this book had not been written by an already very sucessful writer, it would never have been published. What is meant to be subtle is boring and what is meant to be indentifiable and comforting is painfully predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Grisham's best, but an OK read","review":"There is no mystery in this book. What I liked about it was the fact that I could relate to it. I'm sure a lot of you out there would have liked to skip Christmas at some time. I know that I would. The expense, hassle, and everything that goes with it can get you down. I've always heard that people get depressed at Christmas. I am sure the reason for the depression is because they took a look at their checkbook balance. We all seem to over spend, I know that I do, but I tell myself every year that Christmas comes but once a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true modern Christmas classic","review":"This book was delightful. Great light reading and trust me you won't be able to put it down. It makes the reader think \\"what if\\". If the world around you gets used of you doing one thing and you decide to change; in someways you have messed up a part of their world as well. That's what I loved about this story. All the years I just wanted to skip all the aspects and commericalism of Christmas and totally forgetting the real true meaning of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok for an airplane book","review":"This book works if you need something to read on a plane trip from Florida to Ohio. It held my interest to an extent. However, I got the feeling he knocked this one off in about the time it takes to type it. It takes about 3 minutes to figure out his daughter is coming home for Christmas. Wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzz. . .","review":"I fell asleep in the express line on page 11. Needless to say, I passed on buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Easy Light Read","review":"I read this book in the space of a day spent flying home after Thanksgiving. It was pleasant and certainly amusing, with a few truly funny scenes. A great book if you want a nice diversion for a little while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow start, perfect finish. Good movie material","review":"I found this book a little slow to get into but I am a Christian who celebrates a religious Christmas and some of it was wearing a little thin by midbook. The end was what I saw comming, but it was even better. I could see Chevy Chase or Dan Akroyd and Bette Midler in this as a perfect holiday film. This is an excellent gift to the scrooge in your family.Only point in the book that was oddly very inaccurate (shame on someone) is that Methodists do not call their ministers \\"Father\\" as the Krank's do in this book. Roman Catholics and high church Episcopalians, but not Methodists as far as I ever heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do yourself a favor and SKIP this book!","review":"This book was boring and a waste of time. I only finished it because it was so short. The majority of the book deals with a family and their days before Christmas - nothing unusual or exciting. The ending was a little better than the majority of the book. If you must read because it is by Grisham, do not waste your money and get if from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING AND PREDICTABLE!!!","review":"Okay, so I have never read a Grisham book before this. And I assure you, I will not be reading another one. I understand that this is different from the type of things he usually writes. But I can't imagine how anything could be any better. Predictable comes to mind. Dull, another. Not too mention, what kind of writing style is that? It reads like a bad timeline. This happened, then this.The tale of a family whose daughter is away. So, they decide no Christmas this year. Their neighbors get made and try everything to change their minds. I understand this will be a movie. I can see that, but take my advice and wait for that. The book just isn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skipping this book....","review":"...would have been a good idea. I got this book to read on a trip when I \\"skipped Christmas\\". I thought it was an approprate read AND I (usually) love Grisham books.I did not enjoy this book at all. It was nothing like his other books. I kept waiting for the twist, but it never came.I was disappointed that I actually paid full price for this book and did not wait for it to come out in paperback or borrow from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip It","review":"Unrealistic, materialistic, we-are-all-the-same neighbors (must have plastic snowman on roof! big brother is watching you!), boring plot, peer pressure for the middle-aged ending. What a waste of perfectly good paper. There is absolutely nothing in this book to make you glad you read it. I know I'm sorry I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skipping Christmas","review":"What a way to start off the Holiday Season! I laughed till I cried!! Luther, the main character, is now my husband's hero. We do not put colorful lights on the outside of our home, just greens. But this year we will be putting Frosty on the roof, in honor of Luther and what happens when you skip Christmas. This is by far the best holiday book I have ever read! It's a quick read, one long afternoon. And it started our Christmas season on the right foot for a change!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple Reading","review":"I bought the book, not knowing what John Grisham has written in the past, but rather looking for some light-hearted reading; you know, something between Reader's Digest and Taliban.The Krank family's (well, Luther's) desire to pass on the hub-bub of the holiday season has surprisingly more effect on everyone than the Krank's.Skipping Christmas offered the silly, upbeat, quick reading I was looking for. It is a simple story and one that most everyone will relate to. Once the book is shared with friends and family, we will use the characters and scenes to describe our own friends, neighbors and co-workers. A must-be-made-for-TV-movie book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very convincing","review":"In my opinion, most of the charactars and situations were not believable. Nora Krank is too nasty to Luther to have you believe they have a happy marriage. Personally, if I were Luther and she treated me the way she treats him,, I would visit a lawyer rather than take her on a Cruise. The premise is great, but the story was dissapointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great story, full of Christmas spirit.","review":"When Blair Krank leaves home for a year in Peru, her parents realise that Christmas just won't be the same this year. Luther Krank, a tax accountant, calculates that last year Christmas cost them $6,100 and decides that this year the Kranks should skip the Christmas festivities altogether and take a Caribbean cruise instead.With the cruise booked and word out that they won't be celebrating this year, the Krank's begin to prepare for their departure on 25 December but what they aren't prepared for is the reaction of their friends and neighbours who are determined that they won't skip Christmas that easily. But, when 'disaster' strikes the neighbours all pull together and show that they really are full of the Christmas spirit.This short novel is a quick and funny read which made me want to put on the Christmas songs and decorate the tree. I would recommend it to anyone whether you love Christmas or can think of nothing better than skipping Christmas yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skipping Christmas","review":"Laughing out loud at the situation the main character gets himself into, I found myself identifying with his disdain of the commercialism of the holidays, yet lacking the courage to do anything about it as he tries to do. I couldn't put it down. To be perfectly honest, (and perhaps blasphemous) I tend not to read Grisham's works knowing they are likely to be made into movies in short order. Now I may actually forge ahead and read his next novel before it makes it to celluloid. Total chuckles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Add it to your Holiday Collection","review":"Every Christmas I read one book with a Holiday theme. This year I chose Grisham's little ornament of a book, and I am glad I did. It has all of the necessary ingredients: humor, love, gratitude, all stirred in with likeable \\"Grisham\\" characters. Invest a few hours of your time, and you will get the same feeling you got the first time you read, and understood, Dicken's holiday classic. Well, not quite but almost! Merry Christmas to all the Grisham fans out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great short story","review":"I wanted to read this book just because the title was intriguing alone. I've had thoughts of what it would be like to skip Christmas instead of going through all of the things we all do - year after year. Grisham's writing style had me laughing out loud several times. It almost brought me to tears too. I read the book over the course of a few short plane flights and probably could've read the whole thing in a few uninterrupted hours. I wish it was longer - only because I enjoyed it so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Holiday Fun","review":"When a person wants some easy holiday reading, this is the book!I read this last November and can't wait to read it again! I have recommended it to all of my friends as a way to start the holiday season. Nothing too heavy, but a nice story. Great if you're short on time, but like a bit of a comical story with an uplifting ending!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting to the mind","review":"Personally, I thought the concept of the book would be a light hearted boost to the holiday season. However, I found Grisham to be continuing his downward spiral in his profession. The story took one pathetic turn after another leaving you with the feeling that \\"the main characters\\" were not the crazy ones, but the rest of the world was. I don't believe human nature to be as shallow as Grisham seems to make us feel. If a new author on the scene had tried to push this book past a publisher, he would have had a dumpster full of rejection notices. But of course, the Grisham name sells books even as he continues to crank them out faster than hollywood can make the next movie. Once a huge fan because of his research and detail, now very leary of picking up the next \\"new\\" Grisham \\"tragedy\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proving the power of a brand","review":"Grisham is a strong brand, nicely demonstrated by the fact that hundreds of thousands of suckers, myself included, rushed to buy this thin story hoping for another Grisham pageturner.Do we keep the faith and buy \\"The Summons\\" after this deeply disappointing offering??"},{"rating":"1","title":"hmm..not so much...","review":"thought it would be a great novel, since grisham is amazing, but wound up falling asleep w/in the first 20 pgs. woke up, gave it a second chance, thinking it would be a cute little book, but just got irritated the more i read. sorry. i love john grisham, but this is one i wouldn't recommend, esp. if you've read his other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skipping Christmas","review":"This is a pretty good book. Really enjoy John Grisham. One of my favorite authors. I have alot of his books, this is my first one on Kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun quick Christmas read","review":"I like Grisham' s style and have read most of his books. His descriptions of things have a familiar feel and make the setting inviting. There is always a redeeming equality to his yarns and that is true here also. The ending is rather abrupt, but tender and leaves a good feeling appropriate for the season.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skipping Christmas","review":"I loved this book. I laughed out loud on the bus while reading it, and many other people around me said they loved the book, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"A great book to read running up to Christmas (or at any time). Easy to read and an unusual story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh My G-D! its Horrible!","review":"When you finish reading all you can think about is why the author didn't skip chapter 3-18 and go straight to the end. the \\"heart\\" of the book is so boring and predictable you will not believe you actually spent your time on it. Such a dissapiontment. maybe grisham should stick to the law books.the story just develops nowhere. an absalout waste of time if you ask me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute, enjoyable, mindless entertainment","review":"Not your typical Grisham novel, but a very CUTE story. Funny and endearing and it'd never happen in real life this way, which is why we read anyway, isn't it ... to escape real life for a little while!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful read to escape the holiday stress!","review":"I have read all of John Grisham's books and have enjoyed his writing, though I had grown tired of the \\"lawyer theme.\\" A Painted House was a nice change; but this one brings out what I think is a rare talent -- writing humor. I laughed out loud through this whole book. My husband kept sticking his head in the room to say, \\"I must ask Grisham to write more books like this!\\" It was a delightful weekend read and one that restored my spirit and still has me chuckling as I think about all the predicaments Luther created for himself. It is funny and heartwarming and strikes close to the truth of many of the traditions we have all established. When things get too frantic this season, take a few minutes to pick up this book and laugh long and loud!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skipping Christmas","review":"This book was very disappointing - very boring. The story line was weak. I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"skipping christmas","review":"This is about an empty nest couple who decide to opt out of the Christmas commerciality that has consumed this holiday: no gifts, no lights, no tree, no parties, etc. I like the idea. However, the amount of hostility they receive from their neighbors and friends seems unrealistic. Reading this was frustrating, and at times, boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant Grisham read","review":"I read this book over two days, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was very charming and quite funny. Classic \\"how fast can gossip sweep through the neighborhood\\" and it reminds me of my town. Be sure to pick this one up. It will surely put you in the holiday spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skipping Christmas","review":"Don't let the holidays season pass by without first reading this delightful story by Grisham. Entertaining characters and a realistic portrayal of how materialism has overcome Christmas. The Krank family will take you on a hilarious adventure from a different perspective that will keep you turning the pages until the very end."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"With his newer books, John Grisham seems to be revealing more of himself. Granted he's still writing fiction, but somehow you feel that he's sharing more of his thoughts as he goes through different phases in his life. I love this book because it is feel-good, and the characters are so vividly described that I had to keep pausing throughout the book to imagine what each neighbor is like. The book is also funny, and it's an easy read. It's a great Christmas gift. I'm eagerly awaiting Grisham's next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip Skipping Christmas","review":"An uninteresting, bigoted, rich and superficial couple has the first interesting idea of their lives and this book follows their complete inability to recognize it or follow-through. I was apalled with these characters, and actually read through the entire book hoping to find out that Grisham had somehow addressed their inexcusable traits--No luck.The premise is interesting--a couple wants to forego the commercialism of christmas. If only the people were anywhere near as interesting as that idea. Its almost as if without shopping and hobnobbing they don't have anything left to do.From its gross portrayal of a 'middle-class' family who barely blinks at wasting thousands of dollars on something they'll never use, to a mother and father whose racism shows brightly on Christmas Eve, this book deserves only one place on your Christmas morning--in the fire."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't help but be touched by this one!!!!!!!!!","review":"We've all been fed up with the hustle and bustle of the holiday season at one time or another. This book shows that feeling this way isn't necesarily a bad feeling but it's not what the holidays are all about. The lead character is Luther Krank, a man totally mad that he is going through another boring, debt-filled Christmas. He thinks if he ignores the holiday completely and goes on a cruise instead that it will pass un-noticed. He learns through trials and tribulations that money and crowds and last minute shopping are not at all what Christmas is about. Rather, friendship and family makes our lives worthwhile!! A treasure of a book that i'd highly reccommend to all and I will probably find myself reading every year at this time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"I couldn't help suspecting that there was an underlying mean-spiritedness about this short novel. The characters evoke not a single emotion and the overall feeling is flat. There are better stories about Christmas, both happy and sad. Skipping Christmas isn't one I'll read again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty sad....","review":"This book would play out better on the movie screen. The sadness of the story could be laughable on the screen, but on paper, it becomes a drag. Don't bother reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely shallow","review":"Big waste of money and time. Most shallow treatment of a good idea I've seen in a long time. When I was about three-fourths of the way through, I found myself wondering if maybe he knocked it out in about 2 or 3 days. Research pretty much nonexistent. No way this would've ever been published if he wasn't John Grisham. I found several implausibilities and at least one inconsistency that must have been an oversight on Grisham's part. It also contained a few typos, something you wouldn't expect to see in publishing at this level. Seems even the publisher just threw it out there as an afterthought. I want a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I know that John Grisham is a very thoughtful writer, and I have enjoyed reading all his previous books. This one intrigued me because one of the reviewers indicated that the couple who decide to skip Christmas finally discover the true meaning of the holiday in the end. Don't make the mistake I made... there is precious little that this couple discovers about anything in the end! There is no character development anywhere. In \\"The Testament\\" Grisham gave us a taste of someone who truly goes through a transformation, and I was hoping there would be something of that sort in \\"Skipping Christmas.\\" No such luck, this book's tone throughout is nasty and demeaning, which some people could call sarcastic, but when that's all you have, it's really not worth reading it--the last 2-3 pages did nothing to redeem the rest of the story. Sorry, John, but you can do, and have done, so much better elsewhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A cheery stocking stuffer","review":"Here's a light entertainment that can be quickly read and enjoyed in two or three sittings, perhaps while you defiantly sip egg nog. By now, you've probably heard about the plot. A couple astonishs and angers their friends when they declare that they are skipping all the shopping, decorating and other chores associated with Christmas. The narrative is not as well written or plotted as Grisham's better known and deservedly more appreciated suspense novels. Yet it's a clever story, with some homespun insight into how neighborhood pride can run amok. The humor is more situational than witty, occasionally relying on slapstick. But the ending wraps it all up into a pleasant enough package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I picked up this book after hearing that it's going to be made into a movie but had no idea what to expect. The only other Grisham book I have read is \\"Bleachers,\\" so I was anticipating a drama-filled story....Instead I was plesantly surprised to find a light-hearted tale with a great message about love, family, friends, neighbors, traditions and surprises. I laughed out loud several times and could personally relate to several of the characters. This is a great book to read now with the holiday season moving quickly upon us. I can imagine myself reading it again in the middle of the summer when I'm looking to beat the heat and have a good laugh.If you are in search of a quick read that will make your inner holiday spirit chuckle then I recommend this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Grisham doesn't live up to his name","review":"The whole idea of the novel was a good one considering it was John Grisham. I liked the novel as it took off but also got a bit lagging and boring. The book was also one of the big hits in the literature industry but as more and more people read the book, they figure out what it's really about. Luther and Nora Krank, the parents who decide to skip Christmas, love and sacrifice their trip for their daughter Blair. I think that Blair is on of the characters that I enjoyed because she seemed to changed the novel and give it a big kick about the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been a magazine short story","review":"If your looking for a typical Grisham novel, think twice before buying this one. The story is very dull, not much depth. The story would have been cute as a 5 page short story in a magazine. I read it, hoping it would get better but it remained dull and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Reading Skipping Christmas is like waiting for a really bad joke teller to stumble through to the punch line when you already know what the punch line is. The book is filled with flat characters, moronic dialog and a plot so painfully obvious it would have a tough time passing muster for a sitcom. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grisham has good idea...","review":"I think that John Grisham has a wonderful idea for this story. Christmas has become a major pain, well for me anyway. I'm really not trying to be a \\"Scrooge\\", but as a single parent, the pressure seems overwhelming.I digress. This book is great for a light, humorous look at a different sort of Christmas. Luther Krank had a great idea, but it was ruined by both his wife and daughter. It's a delightful read. Merry Christmas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Pre-Christmas Gift","review":"My mother in law gave this as a gift to everyone before the holidays & I loved it.

It's a great reminder that the holdiays make us all a little crazed!b"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Good","review":"I am amazed at all the good reviews here about this book. I am a fan of John Grisham and have enjoyed all his books, but this one was a major dissappointment. I can't believe he wrote it.It's not that I object to a subject other that the law,(\\"A Painted House\\" was most enjoyable). The subject of this book, skipping the holidays & doing something else, sounded interesting and I had high hopes when I started reading, but Grisham's heart was obviously not in it.Skip \\"Skipping Christmas\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"It would make a cute movie, too","review":"Yes, it was a very light and easy read, but it was enjoyable and funny, too. We read it on the drive back from California. We also decided it would make a cute movie with Steve Martin at Luther."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Uncommon Christmas Story","review":"Skipping Christmas is an entertaining look at the strain of the holiday season. Like A Painted House, it is a deviation from John Grisham's usual law-only plots. Skipping Christmas is a quick, light read. Many will be able to relate to Luther's frustration with the over-materialistic, non-stop hecticness that comes with Christmas.In Skipping Christmas, Luther convinces his wife Nora that with their only daughter away for the year that they should simply skip Christmas, take a year off from the chaos. The couple does not realize what an unpopular decision this will be. Friends and neighbors react with everything from quiet chagrin to out and out distain. The story has a few surprising plot twists, some entertaining, some frustrating with a nice storybook-type ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the usual Grisham, but I love it!","review":"Something different from John Grisham and I love it! I am not sure if it was the author's intention, but I see that he wanted to deliver subtle hints of a bigger lesson in an exaggerated and hilarious story of a couple trying to escape Christmas altogether, and their neighbors who frowned on their idea. The Kranks were almost successful in avoiding anything Christmas - lights and decor, gifts, parties, all the commercialism associated with it. In the end though, everyone showed that no matter what, the goodness of the human spirit will always surface.Who does not want a stress-free Christmas anyway? I believe it's a choice. Go with the flow, or be the one to set it. One need not go to Scroogey extremes. Preparations and celebrations are fine, but we should not lose focus on the true reason for the season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too funny!","review":"You will want to stay away from the coffee while reading this one----it will come out of your nose! In fact, I rented the audio book for a trip (I had already read the book) and almost had to pull over to the side of the road for laughing so hard. Don't wait until December to read this----it's funny all year 'round."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did your \\"A Painted House\\" school boy write this one?","review":"Trying to offset the agony of a huge, pre-Christmas airport line, I purchased this book in an airport bookstore at full price. At over ten-cents a page, I was determined to savor every word of this book. Unfortunately, this short story of near magazine thickness was one dimensional, predictable, and flat-out disappointing. Worse yet, I finished it before reaching the ticket counter! I felt taken having purchased this book. John, if you care anymore and are reading these reviews, please do us all a favor and spend some time on your next one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip It","review":"This story starts out hokey, remains hokey and ends hokey. In our modern world, neighbors don't even know each other's names, let alone care about whether or not they decorate their houses for Christmas or decide to take a trip to the islands. I know this book was intended to be fun, but it never even made me smile. I just thought it was stupid and a waste of time. From the reviews of the movie that just came out based on this book \\"Christmas with the Kranks,\\" the movie is just as bad as the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diversity?","review":"I was completely offended when I read this book. I guess there isn't anyone of the Jewish or Muslim faith in the author's neighborhood. I won't even expand on the \\"dark skin\\" comment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this really Grisham?!?","review":"It is my opinion that this book was not written by John Grisham. It is a trite, sappy, story-book style Christmas tale, which is of little interest, especially if one doesn't care much about the holiday. I read it to the end thinking that perhaps there would be a twist, or a surprise plot. Instead, all I found was a childish, happy Christmas story ending.Don't buy this book expecting Grisham quality or style, or you will be sadly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable Holiday/Hollywood Drivel","review":"If you're looking for a predictable schmaltzy holiday tale with a \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" ending -- then this is for you. However if you want more from a book than a movie-of-the-week story that telegraphs the ending from about p. 10, then I'd suggest skipping \\"Skipping Christmas\\". After \\"A Painted House\\" I had high hopes for Grisham's new direction in his fiction. This, however, is a sad back-slide -- one wonders if it even would have been published if it didn't have such a \\"bankable\\" name on the cover. This read more like a movie script than a novel -- and unfortunately, I can see Hollywood probably casting it already."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasure to read; great gift","review":"A nice funny little book, great for a gift. I enjoyed reading it, although the end was a little much.."},{"rating":"2","title":"FIVE THUMBS UP","review":"The audio version of this book was great. Well read and funny. A humorus Christmas story that captures human nature. Would make a good Christmas season TV movie. Great set-ups and finishes. Good, clean, wholesome entertainment. Recommend CD for audio."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good seasonal piece","review":"I bought this when it first came out, after realizing I hadn't actually read a new Christmas story since grade school. I'm not sure what I expected, but the book is entertaining and the characters are fairly amusing. I'm not a fan of Grisham's more well-known works, but if they aren't your preferred reading material, don't compare those with this book. This story will (hopefully) never be a holiday TV cartoon, but it's worth offering to everyone in the family for at least one read-through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skipping Christmas","review":"Imagine if someone decided not to celebrate Christmas. That's right no tree, no decorations, no presents. Of course, millions either don't celebrate Christmas or do so in a non-materialistic fashion every year. But, what a concept. No Christmas lighting. Wouldn't the neighborhood go crazy. Of course, relatively few people cloak their homes in garish holiday excess. But what about all the parties. Someone would have to be a real scrooge to fail to provide gifts and engage in robust drinking with one's office-mates for Christmas. Of course, few businesses still sponsor a holiday party and even fewer provide alcohol or gift-giving opportunities.Grisham relies on the broadest and most simple-minded holiday sterotypes to serve up a simple-minded and broad message. Nearly as meaningful and authentic as a mall Santa."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip This","review":"I had to read this for a book group. The first part of the book brought up many issues such as non-conformity, group think, commercialism of the holiday....but the second half fell totally apart and there they were, right back in the thick of it, and very happy that their future son in law wasn't too dark. It read like a screen play, and read like the author had to write it. Im sorry he did, and Im sorry I had to read it.By the way, if he is really going to skip Christmas, why not go the week or two before? Thats when the craziness is the worst. A story of spending Christmas on a cruise ship could actually have been a very interesting one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Put This on Your Christmas Gift List","review":"I loved Skipping Christmas and have added this book to my list of books I give as holiday gifts: The Christmas Box by Richard Paul Evans and The Gravel Drive by Kirk Martin. Thanks to John Grisham for an extra special book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous!","review":"I thought this book was ridiculous and hardly worthy of one of my favorite authors. It is barely more than a glorified short story. I really enjoyed A Painted House, which was a departure from the usual, and was looking forward to something perhaps similar. What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"dish brush","review":"I'm so happy to have found these on Amazon. I used to get these at the grocery store, but they quit carrying them. All they have are large ones with long handles. These are exactly the right size for scrubbing the dishes before they go into the dishwasher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I read the first book in this series, and rather enjoyed dipping into an era not commonly written about. I read The Concubine's Tatoo, and really can't recommend it, or the series now. Part of the pleasure of reading historical mysteries is that willing suspension of disbelief that takes one deep into another era. This series doesn't have that, for me. I really can't believe there would have been a couple like this in Tokugawa Japan, so my attention wanders. And, I regret to say, Reiko is getting on my nerves after only two or three books. I really wanted to like this series, but it eludes me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The fourth entry in the Sosakan Sano Ichiro series is set in 1690 Tokyo. From the opening scene of Sano's arranged marriage to the denouement, this outing leaves a flat aftertaste. Sano's bride, Hirata, has a penchant for investigation and she sets out to find the murderer of Harume, the pregnant favorite of the ruling Shogun. Sadly, the relationship between Sano and Reiko reads like a bad romance novel, complete with fiery tempers, illogical misunderstandings, and the requisite revealing of the killer. T his outing should come with a strong warning for those readers who do not like graphic sex in their mysteries.Rowland appears to have done her research, but unfortunately used it all in this book. Perhaps because of her concentration on the history, she paid less attention to developing her characters because they remain cardboard-flat and the dialogue overly dramatic.This was a disappointing entry in an otherwise enjoyable series."},{"rating":"1","title":"As Painful as Being Slashed with a Samurai's Sword","review":"I picked up this book because the idea of a mystery set in 17th century Japan sounded intriguing but reading it became a dreadful ordeal. Despite the veneer of historical accuracy the language and dialogue used is ridiculously modern. Sano, the novel's samurai detective follows his 'hunches'. Did anyone use the word hunch in 17th century Japan. The book just felt false to me. I felt like I was putting on the cloak of Japan during this period instead of really being immersed in it. A mystery novel like \\"The Fig Eater's by Jody Shield's truly made me feel like I was existing in the historical period she was writing about. Now if we could get Rowland's plotting together with Shield's feel for history we could get an outstanding mystery novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely So-so","review":"This story and the others by the same author appeal to the lowest common denominator. There is virtually no historical basis for the characterization of the protaganists and antagonists and the plotting is tepid at best. If you are stuck on an airplane from Tokyo to the U.S. and can't sleep this ought to do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and Unexpected","review":"I was at the libary browsing for the latest Laurie R. King books (O Jerusalem and A Darker Place). I could only find A Darker Place, I was disappointed, so I decided to keep browsing. Then, I found The Concubine's Tattoo. I found the plot teaser interesting, so I got it. I found it wonderful. I was more interested in the relationship between Reiko and Sano, was at times I found was funny. The mystery was interesting too, but I did find some of it uninteresting. Such as the Shogun's real sexual preference and the Miyagi family kinsmen's sexual behavior. But that's the top of what I don't like, but I did I most of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"dreadful book","review":"I can't say it better than Ms. Siosan or Ms. Donihue; but this book was dreadful. Poorly written, trite dialog. It had an interesting idea, but was poor in the execution. If this is her best (as some of her fans indicate), the others should definitely be avoided."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laura, Please Tone Down the Sex","review":"I found this series by accident a few months ago and I am thoroughly enjoying the books. The well-researched picture of ancient Japan is fascinating, and the mysteries are quite good. Things tend to get a bit melodramatic at times, but if I want a deep literary work I'll read that instead. These books are for enjoyment. My only complaint thus far is the amount of sex, porn really, that Laura includes. Way too much, bordering at times on disgusting. I'm not making a distinction between gay or straight here; we are over the top on both. A little goes a long way, and what is left to the imagination can be so much more exotic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting genre and play of characters . .","review":"The cover was the first thing that caught me about the book. When I started to read, it reminded me of a Japanese detective TV series called \\"Abarenbo Shogun\\". Sano Ichiro is very much like the main character in that series, and I rather like his character. As this is my first book by Ms. Rowland, I was taken by the addition of his fiancee Reiko. She's unlike anything that came out of the Tokugawa Era. All in all, character flow was nice, storyline was very familiar, and I would definitely read more from her in the future. I only wish she worked on things from a deeper detective aspect. There are times when she loses the original feel for it. It gets a little lost at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zuni anthropology","review":"This work is an academic yet accessible review of the history of interaction between the Zuni Pueblo near Gallup, NM, and anglo anthropologists in the late 19th and early 20th Century. It is an engaging read that will be of interest to anyone facinated with Native American athropology, especially of the pueblo tribes.The issues discussed still resonate in Zuni, and the stories are still being told in the ongoing discussions of the Zunis amoung themselves as they live the tension of maintaining their unique culture, language and religion in the midst of anglo dominance."},{"rating":"2","title":"COMIN CORRECT","review":"PERFECT ALBUM,STRAIGHT UP.SAW 25 TA LIFE BEFORE BUT NOT THIS BAND...DAMN!LOVE THIS CD FROM TRACK1 TO TRACK 11.CANT STAND MOST OF THE BANDS TODAY THATS WHY IM STILL LISTENING TO THOSE OLD SCHOOL HC BANDS THAT I GREW UP JAMMIN TO FROM CRO-MAGS TO BANE TO CHAMPION ETC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Zzzzz....zzzz....Yeah, yeah.

This book was written by D.&B. Weiss who also wrote Good Witch, Bad Witch which I didn't like that much either. If they want the books to be consistently good they should get one good writer.

It does help if you want to relearn math from scratch with progressive difficulty. It does not however help to prepare you specifically for the math questions encountered on the GRE. The practice questions in the book do a poor job of emulating GRE math questions which are not straight forward. I did every practice question in the book over three months and raised my quantitative score marginally. I studied a math review from a major test prep company and saw a much more appreciable gain using their specific advice. Using this book ended up being a tremendous waste of my financial resources and time.
