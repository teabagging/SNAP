I continued to re-introduce it to her over a couple days and she just had no interest. I tried an organic toothpaste she likes on the \\"toothbrush\\" which helped her chew it for a minute; however, even with guidance, the bristles did not wrap around teeth/gums in order to work properly.

She didn't shove it into her throat and gag, she held it by the little handle and gnawed on that thing like her life depended on it.

It was too floppy for me to use to brush his teeth.A few months later, I bought a regular toothbrush at a grocery store- \\"My first toothbrush\\" made by Colgate, that was $2.49. Basically a small, short-handled, soft toothbrush, that was aged 0-2 years. We started brushing his teeth at bedtime, and he loved that he got to use a brush just like ours. I think \\"training\\" toothbrushes are basically an unnecessary product, as even a young child can tolerate having a real toothbrush as long as they have supervision, and may like using that as a teether as well.

Dickey does a fine job of mixing action with stream of consciousness thoughts from his 1st person narrator. The narrator is a former Army Ranger who also had become enmeshed in Muslim religion and radicalism while fighting for the Muslims in Bosnia. He has a unique perspective on the war against terror, and his former relationships make him a key weapon of the US side. After 9/11, he departs his quaint Kansas life and returns to the battlefront.

I would have stopped reading this book, but as always, I have high hopes and thought it would get better soon, but alas, it didn't. Lottie and Everett seemed out of place and what happened between them was too much of a coincidence and Rosie wasn't a good lead character. If you want to read a book about the Chicago World's Fair, then I suggest \\"Exploring the Chicago World's Fair, 1893\\" which is apart of the American Sisters series.

Also, I can't unclasp this bra with one hand for nothing; it's impossible. Not to mention when you unclasp it, it doesn't do a very good job of staying under your breast while your feeding. You can't wear nursing pads with these bras because they are see through; even through some shirts. I bought a 42DDD and it fits my breasts good, but it's tight around my back so I had to buy extenders for it. I also bought a 46DDD and it fits much better, but still not what I expected. They also ride high on my back. I'm very disappointed with these bras; I just don't have the money to spend another $60 on more so I'm stuck with them.

Some of the finer and basic points such as body and pedal position, weight transfer, climbing and crash survival still apply but the more complicated techniques do not. Also, though the illustrations are good at conveying subject matter, the entire text of the book is handwritten script, is incessant with the groin jokes, and features a bit of profanity. At the end of the day, it's cheap, a quick read, and has some good basic pointers, but it's outdated and strives a bit too much to be a comic strip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mountain Bike!","review":"In 2008, maybe a little dated as far as things like 'clip-in' pedals, but content and technique is spot on, and very humorous.

My initial reaction was to the sound quality. When comparing this item to my Panasonic 2 line 900 mhz spread spectrum phone, I noticed that the sound quality was noticeably worse.My second reaction was to the inability to use both handsets simultaneously. I feel that if a cordless system has two handsets, they should both be able to talk on one line at the same time. Plus, there is no feature to transfer the address book from one phone to another.Overall, this phone is very slick looking, and might work for someone who is satisfied with only 10 minutes of answering machine recording time and doesn't mind mediocre sound quality.

It is an attempt to keep pace with changing times by changing the message of the Faith. I find it theologically and philosophically untenable. I would prefer to believe nothing (atheism)rather than adhere to a system created or changed by men/women (\\"objective truth\\" is lost, which leads to subjective truth, which leads to nothing with eternal structure and intrinsic value upon which one can stake his/her life). \\"A New Kind Of Christian\\" is truly a work well acquainted with Post Modern culture, as it is indeed the result of Post Modern thinking. \\"A New Kind Of Christian\\" posits a belief system that will provide little succor for those in the midst of personal trial.

It is remarkable to me that a man like this can espouse such new-age gnosticism and people gobble it up as if it's the newest flavor of ice cream!When did Christians stop using their heads? When did they stop viewing the Bible as the authoritative Word of God? The situation couldn't be more sad and McLaren, for all of his assumed humility and piety, is sadly misinformed about God, His Word and His redemption."},{"rating":"2","title":"Navigating the storm...","review":"I appreciated McLaren's story/argument in this book. I think all of us will need to navigate the stormy waters of transition between the modern and postmodern worlds. McLaren's travel-tips-for-the-journey are provocative and challenging. He sides neither completely with the conservatives (who don't see the whole biblical picture) nor with the liberals (who have a tough time explaining why the bible is even needed for life). Instead he charts a new course of struggle with faith, discipleship, and contemporary culture. A great read!!!If you want more scholarly stuff that undergirds his theological re-workings... read books by John H. Yoder, Stanley Hauerwas, James McClendon, and C.S. Lewis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Analogy...no substance","review":"The author bases his argument(s) on analogies, which though good, are no foundation for solid belief. The philosophy espoused by this book, if embraced by Christians universally, would have key doctrines changing back and forth every week and no foundation (which he's opposed to).McLaren by living vicariously through humble Neo reveals an arrogance that is unparalleled. Neo knows everything. Neo has all the answers. Neo and his brilliance are the substitute for scripture.Not all of Neo's dissatisfaction w/the church is unwarranted or wrong, but it seems like just another emergent book which shows the problems of the church and seeks to lead the church down a path of nothingness to which eventually it would dissolve in to being a just nice place where everyone gets along by ignoring truth and the authority of scripture."},{"rating":"1","title":"written like a dime-store novel","review":"Just had to post: the style in which this is written, by the author's own admission, is not very good.

I was given A New Kind Of Christian by one of my best friends and at first wasn't interested at all. However after the first three chapters I was hooked. The topics that he discusses are the exactly the same things I was feeling, but didn't know how to articulate. It helped me to realize why I sometimes I felt that I did not agree with or relate to my church, family or teaching's that I was brought up with. I realized that it is not that they are wrong or I am wrong just that we see things differently and that is okay. I think an important thing to remember is that Modernity is not the disease and Postmodernism is not the cure. However we do need to adapt our style of evangelism and can use the \\"modern\\" way of doing things for both helps and an avenue to see our mistakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled.","review":"McLaren may write what a lot of your ears are itching to hear but he does not write truth. He seeks to take the foundation of God's Word and replace it with sifting sand. There will be nothing of McLaren's that stands when the rain comes. He twists Scripture and misinterprets it to say what he is trying to say. I challenge you, if you do read it. Read it with God's Word right next to you and find out for yourself.

The only difference between Mclaren's Emergent Christianity and continental liberal Christianity is that he uses the latest graduate school words like \\"post-modernism\\" and \\"deconstruction.\\" The book is primarily written to create \\"new kinds\\" of evangelicals and perhaps there are some good ideas within Emergent methodology for evangelical churches. However, if this book is an accurate representation of Emergent Theology, then it looks like the english writer G.K. Chesterson was right:\\"These are the days when the Christian is expected to praise every creed except his own.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"This is obviously a polarizing book.

The only value we can see in this sort of humanist spirituality belief system is in observing with sadness how some people's version of what they choose Christianity to be on their terms they're comfortable with is so culturally driven. Just a little familiarity with mainline methodist moralist Wendell Berry mixed with catholic philosopher Walker Percy will show how heavily reliant is Neoism on Geoism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creative but Superficial","review":"The book contains a creative and interesting discourse between a burnout minister and his postmodern Christian teacher friend. I don't know what's happened to the 'modern' churches in America, but the concepts Brian McLaren expounds in the book aren't new at all. Christians have always been called to \\"act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with God.\\" (Micah 6:8) A lot of the issues discussed in this book have been much more thorougly explained and illustrated in books about the kingdom community by such renowned Christian authors as John Stott and Howard Sydner first published in the 1980's.

This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world.4)You, dear children, are from God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world. 5)They are from the world and therefore speak from the viewpoint of the world, and the world listens to them. 6)We are from God, and whoever knows God listens to us; but whoever is not from God does not listen to us.

What it is is redistribution of wealth by a benevolent and all-knowing Government elite, like Reich himself, say, and is nothing more than warmed over Marxism. He's also running for Governor of Massachusetts, and if successful will help the Democratic legislature continue to tax the residents back into misery of the Mike Dukakis years, driving businesses and jobs away with his Nanny State philosophy, while doling out tax dollars to favored and connected groups.Like I said, warmed over Marxism from a Clintonite who already has his pile of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slim, overpriced book with tired, predictable ideas","review":"I enjoy watching Robert Reich spar with Steve Moore on CNBC's Kudlow & Company. Although I typically agree with Kudlow, Reich's perspective offers balance to the sometimes overly exuberant Kudlow/Moore supply-side axis. Robert Reich is a fairly sensible leftist - he was an architect of NAFTA after all - and some of his ideas are interesting (abolishing corporate income tax, establishing wage insurance for those displaced by globalization), but you will not find them in this book. I'LL BE SHORT is a glorified pamphlet for Reich's failed bid for the Massachusetts governorship, and it is stocked with standard, boring, and predictable left-liberal policies. Reich is credited for being the first major candidate for any office to advocate gay marriage equality, and for that he should be credited. But in retrospect, nothing in this book is visionary; it is a boring read, thin, and ultimately not worth your $10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it could have been.","review":"The thing that sucks about this DVD is how it's cut, I mean it will cut off right in the middle of the song.

I love Mariah a lot and I admire her for her voice singing live, that's why I don't understand why she doesn't sings Fantasy and Honey live. One of my fave songs is Whenever you call and the editor(Sanaa Hamri) practically killed it by pieces and put all the chattering of the people from 'around the world' in it, the same with Hopelessly devoted to you, my all and I'll be there. I think mariah looks very good with most of hairstyles, but with that kind of Afro she seems to be 4 a.m. and awaked by surprise. I think the only one guilty here is the editor and the only song saved from him is \\"I still believe\\" the rest is all damaged. And one last thing:Why only two bonus videos on vhs?

I think for someone who is supposed to be as great as Carey and then put out such a low quality production...Here is what could have been improved: Mariah should have shown more cities that she has been to. It would be better if more songs were added and if there was more commentary about how should went about writing those songs, a kinda of behind the scenes in writing the music type of thing. Also, there should be some effort to make the music last longer than a few times, because this music gets boring to listen to rather quickly since it is the same thing. Maybe that's why they call it popular music rather than classical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariah Live","review":"Around The World is a somewhat messy collection of live appearances made by Mariah. Not to say the video isnt good, but it would have been nice to see a full concert, instead of performances from around the world. It would be nice to have the Rainbow Tour on VHS/DVD. Anyway, she sings a lot of her hits here, and there is also some bonus videos on the VHS, Butterfly and Breakdown, which are worth the price of this video alone. However once again DVD gets more extras, with extra videos for the two I listed, and as well My All and The Roof. Anyway this is a nice collection of live performances, but Mariah we are waiting for one of your tours to be released on video!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality DVD","review":"This DVD needs some fine-tuning. I wish Mariah would have added a different grouping of songs and titled it differently.

I thought that she could never have proved this more then with her greatest hits album, but I was wrong. This video proves it even more. She's shallow, unattractive, boring and without even one talented bone in her whole body. I wish someone would clue her in that each and every word of a song doesn't have to be demonstrative of how high pitched she is or how much range her over-produced voice has.

I think perhaps it was intended to serve as an introductory manual for people who don't know how to read data books.If you're thinking of using this tool in a classroom setting, please don't.

The magic of \\"Uncle\\" is that Sport has the unique lyrical ability to wallow in the misery that is the human condition and still keep a twinkle in his eye. The music is at once rooted in the traditional and wildly experimental, which adds a certain playfulness to album. The liner notes state the album was recorded to make something his nephew would have enjoyed, and there are a fair amount of lighter tracks, but Sport is at his best when his life is at its worst, and his heartbreak has produced a truly moving collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"asian movie","review":"if you are intrigued by asian culture and history, you will find this interesting. very elaborate sets and historical perspective"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite good","review":"The other reviews are quite accurate and helpful.

The only complaint that I have and the reason why I am giving it four stars is that the menu is not very intuitive and it is fairly slow in response to user input. For example my previous dvr unit was recording all the time so that you could hit the pause button on any channel you were watching and it would freeze the show for you, this toshiba requires you to hit the time slip button and then wait for about fifteen seconds while it starts to record.

Other revewiers describe it as a fan noise, which it may well be, but it sort of sounds like the refrigerator when the compressor kicks on, only not quite as loud. It makes the sound even when the unit is turned off (as long as it is plugged in). It might not be so bad if it only made the noise when it was in use, because the TV sound mostly masks it at moderate volume. But it is still very audible when watching TV at low volume or when flipping between channels. Most importantly, when the TV is off, it is terribly annoying.

The dual handsets make talking around the house simple and easy, and with the extra charging cradle, both my phones are always charged. The look is professional, and the glowing orange screen gives it a nice snazzy look. I love the way each handset is light and has its own 'speaker' mode.Overall, this Uniden phone system is great, and it hasn't let me down since I bought it several months ago.

So I got the Uniden TRU5885-2 only to find out that it didn't do wait my current phones do - intercom, from handset to handset or to base. Just a page/call transfer feature. I found out how handy intercom was with my 2.4Ghz phone, when you're in back yard and the other is in the house, you don't have to yell out the window to talk, just intercom with the phones. Also it didn't have a \\"line in use\\" light/led, so you didn' know if someone is having a conversation before picking up and dialing...really annoying there. Other then that, which I deemed very important; I'm spoiled now yes, but for the price of these phones, not worth it. I'll look around more and/or wait to see if other models come out with all the cool features one might require in a $200 phone without going to a multi-line system."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Am Not Impressed","review":"I have owned this phone for about 14 months and I was never very satisfied with the voice quakity or the range.

Thank you Uniden for a real excellent product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well with exceptional clarity, nice features...","review":"First off, the looks of this phone are very attractive, and that is what lured me to it in the first place. After I bought it, it was charging and I read some good and bad reviews about it, and had my reservations. Well, this phone has very good clarity and sound, with the speakerphone just a bit on touchy side, but for being in a handset I cannot complain. Had an hour long converstation on the speakerphone toady and did not have any problems except some low sound at times, but that is somewhat normal. I give it 4 stars because the range is not what you would think, if you DID NOT know any better. There are so many different variables as to why or why not this phone will work great/bad for you it's insane. So, buy it, try it, and if you don't like it; TAKE IT BACK."},{"rating":"1","title":"One time's a lemon. Three times is a bad design.","review":"I bought this unit to replace a beautiful but dying Siemens expandable phone system. While most of the features work as advertised, my big complaint is with the handsets not answering an incoming call when you pick them up. I may be overly critical, but this is a function I generally expect from my telephones, especially ones costing this much. This inability to connect with an incoming signal has been a reoccuring problem with the first system and two replacement ones. We also get quite a bit of static that I suspect is interference with my wireless network even though the 5.8 ghz technology is suppose to avoid this problemWe also have a problem with people calling and getting a fax signal even though we don't have a fax machine. This is probably a phone company problem but at this point I'm not willing to give Uniden the benefit of the doubt.I'll be returning this system and trying the Vtech i5871."},{"rating":"1","title":"The speakerphone on the base did not work","review":"I was very happy to get this 5.8GHz uniden phone.

This compilation is a mixture of easy pop tunes of eighties with elements of dance music, that sometimes makes you want to dance. All songs are in normal radio versions. I enjoy listening Samantha Fox's songs when I was younger, so I bought this CD recently, although I have all his albums on LPs. But they are mostly damaged because they were frequently played on my record-player so the tune is in bad quality. So, fans of music of eighties, let's make up your minds and buy this record.

I think it's not worth the money because you can find all the same information online just if you do a random search of nursing careers. The descriptions are not detailed enough to really tell you anything. Also the book includes several 'interviews' with nurses in various fields described in the book. I was not impressed, it looked to me like the nurses had a lot of time to edit their answers and none of the interviews actually said anything that would be useful. Again, it would be better to just search online for this information.

The alarm just wouldn't stop ringing(by the way, the bells don't serve too much pupose, as they're only there to shock you), even after I removed one battery; needless to say the shocking feature never worked again. Great idea, bad assembly; not a good combination. Although it is very likely that this was a one time thing, and I happened to be the consumer with the rotten luck, I kind of doubt it; seeing as how the product did have a pretty cheap feel to it.

The characters were wooden and predictable, the book plot-driven only.As for sizzle and sensuality, more like fizzle and not even foreplay!The hero tries valiantly to like her, but Pen is not a nice person a lot of the time. The trust between them hardly builds enough to convince us they are falling in love, and the ending of the novel really falls completely flat.I know it is supposed to be part of a series, but I am most definitely not swept away by this novel enough to care about Lady Pen, let alone the first or the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was very pleasantly surprised by this book","review":"I actually groaned when I realized the historical setting for this book -- not my usual choice. But, since I was ready for something different, I dived in. I'm very glad I did.Feather has created a thoroughly convincing setting, ripe with historical detail and enough actual fact to make the reader buy the whole without difficulty. Owen is a thoroughly fascinating hero -- so deliciously yummy! And tortured, too. Pen is a complex character, a woman dealing with a great deal of pain and understandable resentment. Only Owen is able to break through that to the warm woman she once was. Political intrigue, dangerous alliances, spies and plots, and a conniving set of in-laws mix with the romance to yield a truly engrossing book.While Feather isn't my favorite author, I do like her for something different.

It has been an often ignored facet of literature and history because scholars tend to want to see their heroes remain, as they might see it, unsullied. However, considering the works of the greats such as Marlowe and Shakespeare, it is difficult to ignore their homosexual leanings. Smith does more than just uncloset poets and dramatists of the Renaissance, though. He rebuilds the cultural, social, and political climate and breaks the world of Renaissance homosexuality down into 6 distinct myths or stories that embody the various forms that homosexuality took and the ideas associated with each form. The book dropped jaws when first published and remains more than a viable source for Renaissance study and Queer Theory; it is the best book of its kind to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful","review":"My partner and I read this book together.

While it contains lots of useful information, it is basically a rehash of Courage, and there's little point in a partner reading both books. The author is a survivor, and the tone of this book reflects it. For example, in writing of her partner's departure, she alludes to her growth, sense of loss, etc. following the separation, but says little of her partner's thinking, feelings or experience. She also fails to properly prepare partners for the misdirected anger and other hurtful behavior.A partner would be much better served by Ken Graber's Ghosts in the Bedroom, followed by a reading of Courage to Heal (if only to learn what the survivor is probably being told). Incidentally, Graber's book is listed in the back of Allies in Healing, but the description hardly does the book justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disputing Hypocrisy in Action","review":"I just finished reading Allies in Healing. I feel it is an excellent book for both partners and survivors. So when I read the review Hypocrisy in Action I thought it was about a different book! The whole book is about the partner NOT giving in to the survivors every demand and taking care of their own needs, in addition to being supportive.He stated he just broke up with his girlfriend. I'd say she's better off without such an angry, closed minded partner, who wasn't capable of being a true partner at all!Don't let that review influence you!

But after finding a wonderful Forum the book was recommended to me (us) and I immediately ordered it. It has answered so many questions for both myself and my husband.

Clarity and precise writing are the words I would use to describe this book. Dr. Bogle clearly discusses the basic practices of Islam, along with the different groups that spawned from the teachings of the Prophet Mohammed.

Putting money into a passbook savings account will at least return close to the rate of inflation so that over the long haul you'll get back something close to what you put in.

Within a few months, the replacement for that wheel and the other wheel broke, both pivots for the locking levers on the handle sheared off, and the cooling fan worked itself loose and began eating at the housing.This compressor DOES NOT work on most 15 amp circuits; it just hums and sounds as if it's about to burn up. I comes from the factory with a low pressure setting. So if you're using a framing gun, it doesn't kick back on in time to have continuous nailing. There are adjustment screws for this inside the switch box, but that should not be necessary.Overall, I think Makita should go back to the drawing board on this one or risk losing many long-time customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Continued disaster shipments","review":"After all the previous review complaints for YEARS here about damaged boxes and bent items, you would have thought someone would take a look into this.

I laughed, cried, and sighed as read about one of the most extraordinary people of this century, Princess Diana. It is told in an honest, upbeat way. Kudos to Andrew Morton for doing such a wonderful job. I read the orignal book prior to the Princess' death, and enjoyed this one much better. Adding the transcription of the tapes Diana herself \\"wrote\\" was an ingenuis idea. I enjoyed the childhood photographs, too. Truely the best autobiography of the decade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another vile attempt to make money off of Diana.","review":"In the past I have read many of this authors books, this one however, struck me as rather vulgar. It was published with one thought in mind...the make $$$$$, just the thing Diana detested.If Diana wanted the masses to know it was a firstperson account, she would have told Mr. Morton to do so. I was also very disturbed by the books contents & it's timing.Diana is made out to be this whinning,petty & mentally unbalanced woman bent on revenaging Charles for his lack of fidelity.This is not the Diana I loved....I will always treasure the time she put on this Earth and cherish all her wonderful qualities. I too, was rather depressed after reading this tome."},{"rating":"2","title":"This IS Diana's Book","review":"This book is probably the foremost and authoritative book on who the real and true Diana, Princess of Wales was. Just as Candle in the Wind is her song, this IS Diana's book.I give this book 5 stars because this is historically accurate biographical information told by the woman that was behind it from the beginning, Diana. This is a classic biography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frightfully awful book darling!","review":"Picked up a copy of this book thingy while I was waiting for my Concorde flight the other day (Bruce and Demi were late, as usual). Poor Di really had a hard time with this Morton chappie, what with the bulimia and the suicide attempts just to avoid the publishing deadlines. Still, it does include some wizard photos of lovely Dodi, and the cover matches my Prada handbag and Gucci phone perfectly! Don't forget to wear your seatbelts, darlings! Those concrete pillars are such a nuisance, aren't they? Mwah!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fulfilling, if one-sided, biography","review":"This book lays bare Diana's marriage difficulties with Charles. One is left with the question--why did they ever marry? (It's obvious from the book that Charles never stopped loving Camilla). One bright spot of this book is how Morton shows Diana's growing social awareness--she really comes into her own in this arena. Her devotion to one AIDS patient is particularly revealing. The one shortcoming of this book is that the victim bit is really played out; it is obvious on several occasions (particularly in her relations with the royal family) that you are only hearing one side of the story. But otherwise, this book is well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a review of the interview at the beginning of the book","review":"If you read the beginning interview in Diana's words you really don't need to read the book. All Andrew Morton does is rewrite the interview in his words so that it is book length and he added a couple of chapters at the end about the accident that came from the news media. I found it to be depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice thine pocket testament","review":"The book is small and lightweight. Perfect for a purse or pocket.

It is the clearest presentation of moral realism I can find and effectively presents a Thomistic ethics against versions of hedonism, stoicism, and other systems. The system here begins with fundamental questions on the good, happiness, man's last end, etc. and proceeds to applied ethics. Primary sources are strategically quoted but not overdone to the point of burdening the undergraduate.One drawback however is that students find the many scholastic distinctions, important as they are, to be difficult. Hence if this is intended to be a classroom text, the teacher ought to be prepared to give slow patient explanations.I highly recommend this work."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE Look for another book!","review":"This book isn't worth your time or money.

Try to find 'comments' and you are directed to a page that has the word 'comments' on it but explains nothing regarding adding COMMENTS to your code. Most of his examples don't even work outside his tiny environment - I couldn't make any of them work in my Excel code. Forget troubleshooting your code!

But this show immediately captured my attention and has held it (at this writing I have finished the first season and the first two shows of the second).JOA is a worthy watch on many levels.

It was very good then and I was disappointed it was cancelled after just two seasons. The second season was better than the first. The show was getting better over time. After I recently watched the two seasons on DVD, I like the show even better. I consider Joan of Arcadia to be one of my all-time top ten television shows -- and that dates back to the 1960's.I am very impressed with the acting skills of the main character, Amber Tamblyn. I am surprised she is not one of the big stars today.What I really enjoyed about the season 2 DVD was the special feature of a script reading. First time I had ever seen that done.

The actual mixing wasn't as flawless as I've heard from him before, but over all it's one of the better trance cds i've heard, and the dark trance cd I just really like. I wouldn't even call it dark.

He has some banging tracks but a majority of them just bangs a bit and then slows down. Nothing memorable. Except for Gouryella Ligaya which got so much hype but it's really not that great.

Acosta plays the REAL progressive trance sound that is popular in the best clubs in Ibiza, the UK and the best clubs in the US. Awesome epic tracklists with really new songs, and no cheese.

I just bought it and can't stop listening to it. It's pure trance all the way through, a few vocals here and there but not enough to make it sound cheesy, just perfect.The beats and the pace are constant. I have other Acosta's records and this one is just as good!But, here is my little complaint, and the same as everyone. Someone dropped the ball sound-wise with this. You hear lots of hiss during play of both cds, on some tracks more than others. I know these mixes are made from vinyl, but so are the majority of the ones I have on cd and they don't have the amount of noise & hiss that this cd has.I mean, you can concentrate on the music, but if your ears are picky you will notice it. It's not THAT bad to stop you from buying this set. Go and get it for the good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mixes, Crappy sound!","review":"George Acosta is a great DJ and these mixes are very good but the cd sound is horrible.

I own a Roland RD-700SX and a Yamaha C7. This M-Audio keyboard has the worst action I've ever played on, very plasticky keys, very unresponsive, very unpleasant to play. The modulation wheel was not responsive at times. The sustain pedal didn't respond well with the keyboard either, but works just fine with my other keyboard. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is serious about the quality of the instrument they're playing.

If you are computer wiz, know how to configure audio file and look for better price on full size keyboard, then this is the one for you, otherwise, do not buy it, because the keyboard doesn't play sound, you must use your computer to output each key's sound, and there are no any detailed instructions in the start menu how to configure the audio sound and export sound files, and online technical support also lack of step by step instructions, to reach a live customer support is impossible.

Called the help number written on the back of the instruction manuel and spent forever waiting on hold then after following the guy on the line's instructions to set up the midi the darn thing still wouldn't play a darn note. Eventually we just gave up and sent the thing back and got a refund. Instead we bought the CasioCDP100 love it and wished we'd done that earlier.

It is surprising to find that a British journalist has allowed himself to be so captivated by Croatian nationalism that he is willing to gloss over the horrors of the concentration camps of the WW II Croatian state and the war crimes of the current one. After reading the book one cannot but feel that Tanner has produced a propaganda-piece for the Tudjman adminstration."},{"rating":"1","title":"complete garbage","review":"The more appropriate title for the history of Croatia could have been \\"Croatia: A Nation Which Knows No Shame\\". I got this book expecting a more level and unbiased approach, what I got instead was \\"Serbs this, Serbs that\\" garbage. Yet the mass murder of WWII barely gets mentioned even though those events affected both sides during the break-up of Yugoslavia, more so than any other event prior to or after.This book could've been written by the former Croatian president Franjo Tudjman while he was still alive as he was an amateur \\"historian\\" too. The recent verdict in Hague just confirmed how \\"innocent\\" Croatia was in the whole mess of break-up of Yugoslavia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the bloody stains of Jasenovac?","review":"Many leaving reviews for this book are taking time and space to re-write history. It would be humorous if it weren't so sad that grandiose national insecurity complex of Croatia. Always the victim to the Serbs. To clarify a quick matter, no gun was put to the head of Croatia at the conclusion of WWI to join up with Serbia as a kingdom of Serbs, Croats & Slovenes. This was a willful act of their intellegencia, but, as history shows us, it was not backed by their masses influenced by their hate filled demagogues. This was the conception of Yugoslavia.Perhaps I missed the chapter dedicated to the slaughter of thousands upon thousands of Serbs, Jews & Gypsies at the Aushwitz of the Balkans, Jasenovac, during WWII. When books depict the Croatians as accepting their history of lust for blood, then that book will be worth 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book in English on the history of Croatia","review":"This thoughtful and well written book presents Croatian history without the usual Serbian propaganda. Perhaps Aleksa Djilas (see previous review) could write an additional chapter and include the assorted Serbian fairy tales about \\"what the Croats are really like\\". Djilas' famous father made a career out of living in Serbia and bugging Serbia's ruling mafia. The younger Djilas, on the other hand, lives at Harvard and strives to please the same psychotic criminals his father antagonized. Considering the crimes of Serbia over the past decade, this interesting approach to dealing with one's oedipal problems might be a good subject for Tanner's next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that needed to be written","review":"The author provides a warts and all portrait that nonetheless conveys her great respect and admiration for her subject. The catalog of performances is encyclopedic, but is useful in placing certain live recordings in context for his early career development. I was lucky to have heard him in most of his leading roles at the Met during the late 60s and 1970s. Reading how singers experienced sharing the stage with him, confirmed that I was not alone in feeling that this was an artist who always went out on a limb with the emotional intensity he invested in his roles.

I am still eagerly awaiting the publication date for this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for people with not so good programming background!","review":"As far as the downloaded copies of this book go, it is very similar in style to Eckel's Thinking in C++ (TIC). Although Eckel's style is good, the only thing I have against it is the poor choice of examples. Most examples look artificial and sometimes I have had to spend more time understanding the example than the programming concept which it exemplifies. Maybe I am asking too much, but compared to examples in K & R and Stroustrup examples in TIC and TIJ are really poor quality. But then, examples in Arnold & Gosling aren't any good too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proof that Programmers can't write","review":"I used this book for a Java course. Although the book covers all aspects of Java in great detail, it was one of the most poorly written computer books I've ever read (and I've been a programmer for 20 years). In Eckel's description of applets and the AWT, not one picture or illustration was shown. In addition, he uses large blocks of code to show an example of the use of certain Java features, which often means you have to read two pages of code listings to get to the example. In addition, he refers to features of Java in some chapters that he hasn't discussed, and tells you it will be covered later. As a final point, he keeps telling you to read the API documentation for more detail. If you have to read the API for more information, what's the point in reading his book! Do yourself a favor and get another Java book; you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even speaking Java let alone Thinking it!","review":"This book is confusing and long winded.

No beginner could ever understand the first chapters. He starts with the most complicated C++ concepts and then moves to the code. You don't see a program until the 5th chapter. No creativity (all in black and white, NO color). The only good chapter is the chapter on buttons,text boxes, etc. If I didn't already know C++ I would have been completely clueless. Do not try to use as a teaching textbook; this book is for reference only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and bloated treatise","review":"I was forced to buy this book for a college course I'm taking on Java. The book is long winded in the extreme at more than 1,000 pages (not a good thing). The writing style is chatty to the point of sounding like the entire thing was done by dictation.Lots of unhelpful comparisons are provided along the way to Smalltalk, C++, and even FORTRAN. Lots of long dull example programs aren't even worth skimming. A typical example shows every possible combination of scalar type promotion. Not dull enough? Well how about the one which exercises every single operator on every single scalar type.

I saw this book first on the author'swebsite, and after printing out more than 100 pages of the book, I decided to purchase it. I think this is a good book with lots of well-explained tricky conceipts in Java. Some of those ideas are really subtle, and you have to fully digest them to appreciate. There are two minor weak points of this book: 1) Inner class: The discussion is really fuzzy and confusing. 2) index is lousy, almost an afterthought.I still use this book as a reference from time to time. However, due to the lack of good index, it's harder to use than other Java books such as thinking in Java. I'll give this book 3.5 stars, and still would recommand this book to beginner Java programmers with experience in C/C++."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book for learning Java","review":"I started reading this book in an earlier electronic iteration, and soon determined to buy it when published.

Many were bad, Many were good. I decided it's worth the risk. It's not really a bad book, but definetly not a good one, either. It's very difficult to read, the examples are the worst possible, perhaps, to illustrate the ideas presented. After reading almost half the book I gave up, and I'm going to buy another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Java book I've read thus far...","review":"Eckel's book sets out to do what a lot of introductory books don't even attempt: to provide you with a mental framework so that you can approach programming problems with confidence. Yes, there is some overlap from chapter to chapter, but not too much. If you've read other introductory Java books, trust me...this one goes deeper, has better examples, and has better prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Bruce Eckel wrote one my favorite book - \\"Thinking in C++\\". The book was succinct and explained the concepts very well. Making the leap to Java I decided to pick up \\"Thinking in Java\\". I suppose if I knew nothing about programming and had all the time in the world I would have had gotten more out of it. However if you know C, and especially C++, pick up Java in the Nutshell (3rd Ed). Java in Nutshell is a lot faster to go through and you will get more out of it than this book.Besides being long winded it is also tries to be a comprehensive \\"bible\\" for Java. The problem is that the sections on swing don't have the depth to tackle real world projects. So you will end up picking up books on specific Java systems anyway.Java is changing fast and by the time you get through this there will be two new versions out there. Read Java in a Nutshell and you will be ready to go in less than half the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well written book and comprehensive introduction to Java.","review":"Bruce Eckel obviously knows OOP well and presents his expertise in a thoughtful manner.

Ben Kingsley did a nice job with what he had but this movie is ill-conceived. There are lots of shots of machinery, train engines and molten steel set to Shostakovich's music. The integration of black and white with color did not help. This is only for the really hard-core Shostakovich fan and then don't expect many insights. I want my 2 1/2 hours back !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great film but a terrible dvd","review":"The image quality of this dvd is so bad that even the VHS copy I taped years ago from Dutch television is much better.

After several years of use, we need to replace the locking mechanism. I figure it's a good time to get a new door.The door doesn't have airtight seals. I don't know of any that do. Tight seals would be difficult for a cat to operate and would interfer with the door's closing action. A rubber flap can have less air gap, but then you lose the locking capability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for indoor use","review":"Nice door for indoor use. The small size is larger than several other brands we looked at, with the U-shaped door providing more space than half-circle styles. I appreciate the 4-way lock. It doesn't seal well, so I wouldn't use it as a single flap on an outside door.

Out of the dozens of USB drives that I've purchased, Sandisk drives have always worked on a variety of different hardware platforms without a problem. With one exception - one drive died shortly after first use. It was covered by Sandisk warranty but dealing with their repair/support/RMA system was a nightmare. It took 5 e-mail exchanges through their automated system requiring useless (and repeated) diagnostics & unnecessary \\"hoops\\" before they believed me that the drive was dead.

I tried it on today and even though I can't actually put it to use I have enough experience to know that the designers of this nursing wrap thought of EVERYTHING! Because of some changes in the last few years, going into another room to nurse isn't always going to be an option for me. I am SO SO SO glad that I have a nursing wrap that can do the job this time. I'm ordering a 2nd for back-up!!PS I know some people believe that I should have the right to nurse in public anywhere I want without a cover. Besides not being comfortable with it myself, I think that if it makes others uncomfortable then it is selfish and rude. Be considerate of those around you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!!!","review":"I was looking for certain info about this product and couldn't find. So at the end I purchased the product and I thought it would be like a poncho, big and covering my back. Yes covering my back because I don't wear breastfeeding shirts all the time and I hate my back being exposed. Anyways, it does not cover the back but I guess all breastfeeding covers don't. This is my third cover buying and by far the best. It is vey large and hard for my daughter to lift it up. She is an active baby while breastfeeding. Even though the back is exposed it is what it is and this is still an excellent product!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Wish I'd had one with my first baby. Such a useful item for a nursing mom...sure beats a blanket. Plus, I love the cute fabric!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I love this nursing cover. I tried another one without the wire support around the neck area and found it very cumbersome and frustrating. This one provides ample coverage and is easy to put on.

I also love the stylish prints that are available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cover up","review":"This is a great nursing cover. It is longer then several others I have and has a great discrete pocket for putting breast shields or nursing pads.

It was great! The cover is better than just using a blanket because the strap ensures that it can't fall off and expose you to the public. The open neck was essential for me, as I had to ensure a proper latch-on. It rolls up nicely to store in my diaper bag-- I always have it with me so that I can nurse anywhere without worrying about exposing myself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"can't see my baby","review":"I put this product on baby registry because the ability to see my baby while nursing seemed very attractive. This was one of the most expensive privacy blankets on the market. I am disappointed that it is not very easy to use, especially with a baby who does not latch on too well and is fussy. If your baby goes to the breast easily, this may not be a problem, but so far, I have been unable to use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review- Kensington Print in particular","review":"I wanted to point out a couple things I didn't realize about the Kensington print in particular for others who are ordering and picking a color/print. First, it is much lighter than some of the other options which really helps when you're nursing and it's hot outside- my friends who have the solid color ones say that their babies are much warmer (it gets a little warmer under there, obviously, with less air flow) and seem uncomfortable compared to my little guy who seems relatively cool and happy. Second, and this is the main thing, my baby loves seeing the print on the underside of the cover while he's nursing! He loves the contrast between the light background and the blue and green vines which are visible even from the underside. Added bonus! Finally, I've gotten several compliments on the pattern- one woman even stopped me and asked where she could get the material because she liked it so much she wanted to make a dress out of it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty and effective","review":"This nursing cover did the job quite nicely. It folds down small, so easy to keep in a diaper bag. Easy to pull over your head while holding a baby, and keeps things covered up well. I like the chateau endive color, was cool and springy. I also liked how the cotners were terry cloth. I think they keep the cover weighted slightly so it doesnt blow in the breeze. And its also convenient for wiping spit up if you dont have a burp cloth handy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for modesty. Lady likes that.","review":"For me, when the baby is hungry (sometimes screamingly so)... it's time to feed the baby. So I disagree with putting modesty in front of a full baby belly, but this product does help to cover up the fact that you're feeding a baby. Or the boobies, whatever.Has a stiff bit around the top so she can see baby. The cover does not limply cover baby.I am clearly not the \\"best\\" person to be writing this review as I have mixed feelings on the legitimacy of the existence of the product as it is something that must be scrambled for before we can feed the baby which occasionally causes a prolonging of her discomfort and those who must be subjected to her discomfort.Please just feed the baby so she will stop crying... and be happy like babies should be. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nursing Must Have","review":"This is the second Bebe au Lait cover I've purchased because I can't live without it (I'm nursing baby no. 3). Not only does it come in cute colors but the coverage is excellent. I never have to worry about flashing and it's easy to help your baby latch on with the peekaboo top. Also, as baby gets older they like to kick off or pull off other covers, but not so with this one! Life saving product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most useful baby item, never leave home without it!","review":"I used this cover daily for the first year of my baby's life (and beyond) and will do the same for my second. It's lightweight but opaque. You can see the baby while he is nursing and nurse discreetly. People usually think it's a cover to keep lights out when the baby's sleeping, and sometimes make the mistake of peeking in your cover to \\"see the cute baby sleeping in there\\". This cover got tons of use. I wish I had two of them, for when I used the towel to wipe the baby's mess and it went into the laundry. It's the one thing I buy for my friends when they are having a new baby and the one thing I consider my most valuable baby item - second to diapers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"So happy I got this cover!

I was awkward and shy, lacked coordination, and not confident in nursing -while having lots of visitors. This lifesaver has enabled me to nurse publicly without flashing anyone - maintaining decorum and privacy. It is a wonderful invention and it has made me feel much more liberated about being able to nurse anywhere with anyone around. I used this in very hot weather also, the material is nice and light, not too hot and very portable. I plan to buy this for all new future moms I know!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Discreet, Functional and Pretty","review":"Another item I wished I had with my first child!

This is a fabulous purchase and really sets you up for breastfeeding success."},{"rating":"2","title":"much better than a blanket!","review":"Great product! The neck strap keeps the fabric covering you while keeping your hands free. The inside pocket is great for storing your breast pad. The only thing I would change is I would like there to be a little more fabric on the sides. I'm petite and I sometimes have a hard time keeping both sides of me covered while I'm nursing. I would definetly recommend this product to any nursing mom!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have Nursing Cover for Breastfeeding Moms!","review":"I never write reviews but I was so pleased with this product I decided to write this. I tried many different nursing covers and my little girl was trying to rip the cover off in public because she loves to look around and she didnt like it covering her face it was very distracting and uncomfortable to nurse. This cover made all the differnce, now I can get a good latch without having to remove my hand to lift the top of the cover to look in. My baby girl can look up at me and still has an aerial view she no longer tries to pull the cover off and its light and breathable so goo for warm weather. The fabric is light and soft. I also throught it on my baby while she naps. The gorgeous patterns are an added bonus I own the nursing cover in 3 patterns. Great to give for baby showers. For me its worth the price, which is not much more than other nursing covers that are not nearly as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Cover Up","review":"This is such a nice, easy to use product! I use to to nurse my daughter in public and love that I can still see her while being covered up. It's so much easier than using a blanket.

It has a little pocket inside where I stick my breast pads while feeding her."},{"rating":"2","title":"great gift for nursing moms","review":"This is a great gift for new moms.

It's not see through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pretty","review":"Very pretty and easy to use. I also love that the \\"collar\\" area has a structured portion so that the cover doesnt lie flat on your chest. it allows for better ventilation for the baby as well as gives you a \\"view\\" of baby while nursing. I guess my only wish is that is came with a little carrying bag or something. That is just me really searching for a way to make this more perfect though. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good nursing cover","review":"I bought this for my 7 month old baby and he is squirmy and wiggly at tihs age so he continuously pushes back the cover.

It's material is not super heavy so your baby won't sweat to death.

She was squirming and unhappy in my previous cover and wanted to get out but this keeps my tatas adequately covered even when baby takes an occasional peek. And whatever we are doing under the covers, singing , clapping , playing with food , stays undercover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This is the first product review that I have ever submitted, as I felt the need to describe this product and it's lack of adequacy. First of all, this product is highly over-priced. At over $30, you are essentially paying triple the cost of a $5 piece of material, insufficient boning support (needed to be able to see your baby without holding the neck area up yourself), and a small buckle. If you plan to use this product with a newborn (which means that you need both hands to latch the baby), you'd better either develop x-ray vision to see through the material or learn to latch without any visual assistance, because the neck support WILL NOT stay up on it's own. Better to safe yourself the money and hassle of returing, and either use a blanket/towel or make your own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very handy","review":"So handy to have. I didn't want anything with loud patterns and this is perfect, very pretty. Works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"really good yet has a minus","review":"it is definitely a great product.wide enough to cover well and the opening on the top makes it a whole lot easier. however it doesnt always stay standing up and falls down which actually makes it not as modest as i would like it to be.but all in all - still a good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Nursing cover","review":"I love this nursing cover and feel very comfortable nursing in public with it. I chose the Papillon because I thought it's harder to see when it gets dirty and won't have to worry about the cloth being translucent while I BF in the sunlight. It works really well for me and I don't go out without it, but the baby gets really hot and uncomfortable towards the end of the feeding. I also need to wear clothes that opens in the front because it has no back and if I had to pull my top up, people can see my bare side and back. I'm fine with that since the baby gets hot enough without the back, I would it would be even hotter if the baby is covered all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"love but wish it had a back for more privacy","review":"I love this, so pretty,so soft, so lightweight and airy. I can even just hold my baby in it on a sunny hot day to keepthe sun off of her and she isnt sweating because of the cool material and i can look down at her. I love it for nursing too but I think it would just be better if it was more like a shaw, with the rigid neckline since sometimes i feel worried my side will be exposed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and high quality","review":"The design is really pretty and the quality of the cover is great! My only complaint is that it is a bit difficult to position the baby in a discrete way. But once the baby is in place, it is very convenient and you can look at the baby from the top. It makes a great shade from the sun too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is the best nursing cover I have seen and tried. I had bought 2 others and returned them. It offers the most coverage, and gives you the ability to position the baby, switch positions, and have a view of the baby. The only issue I have with it is that it is ALOT of material and it's very loose, so when the baby is active, he can pull it, and while getting the baby to latch on, sometimes the material is in his face, and it's difficult to find an 'extra' hand to move it off. I recommend tucking it under the back/bottom of the baby so that the material is more taut. Overall, it is the only nursing cover that works for me, I am large breasted, and my baby is very active, and has latching difficulties. Also, he loves the pattern, especially when it's sunny out, he loves looking at the black and white design, it creates a very cool effect when underneath it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great wrap","review":"This is great, so glad I spent the money. You definitely need the kind that you can see the baby without holding the fabric. I had a cheaper one before that you had to hold the wrap to and it was impossible to get the baby latched on comfortably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent purchase","review":"Could not recommend this more for nursing mothers. I have nursed just about everywhere using this cover up and most people don't even know I'm nursing because of the trendy print. It just kind of looks like a shirt. Fabric is large enough to nurse babies well to a year. Definitely a must have for nursing mamas"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cover","review":"It is a great cover, but my little one always falls asleep so much sooner under the cover. I only use it when there isn't a room I can go into. I love it, but my little one doesn't eat as much when I use it because it is heavy and dark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Coverage and Gorgeous fabric","review":"What a wonderful, simple product. I felt so comfortable nursing my little baby in public, the coverage is fantastic. There are product out there that are complicated, too small, etc. This is perfect and the fabrics are so beautiful, it is hard to choose! I have seen quite a few in person and there is no wrong choice. It folds up tiny so it is always there when you need it, great cover!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliable Hootie Hider","review":"I have two types of BF-ing tents, but I almost only use this one because the fabric is wider and less heavy.Amongst my new mother friends, this is the only hootie hider (as one calls it) that they use.All told, it covers as needed, folds down nicely, and allows for easy baby viewing.With any BF-tent one should be aware of the following:~active, grabby baby (or as one lady calls it \\"Two cats fighting under a blanket\\")~it doesn't cover your back, so if you're out, always wear a loose fitting, front opening top/sweater of some sort so you're not all exposed on one side~THE WIND!I also like the fact that when I'm at some one else's house and baby falls asleep, he can have some dimmer lighting (less stim) under the tent. I can either keep him on his side or shift him up to my chest too.All told, a nice item to have and one that ladies I know who DIDN'T buy one wish they did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This cover-up is pretty and easy to use. It's large enough to keep me covered while BF'ing, and the opening up top is perfect for me to keep an eye on my son. It also has two small pockets that I've used to wipe off his mouth when he's done eating. It folds up small so that it fits perfectly in my diaper bag. I love it so much I ordered a second one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Purchased for gift","review":"Purchased for a shower gift. I compared with same product in retail shops and this was less expensive. I would definitely purchase other baby/mother items from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for nursing on the go","review":"As a first time mom just getting used to nursing in public, this cover has been great. It's super easy to use and folds nicely into my son's diaper bag. I like that I am able to maintain eye contact with my son while maintaining my privacy. It does get a little warm under there, however, though the fabric doesn't appear terribly thick at first glance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cover","review":"I purchased this when I was nursing my second child. I wish I had it for my first! It's large and covers not only little babies, but bigger ones. It is a quality made cover, not that thin material that flies away with a slight breeze, but it is breathable for the little one. The shaped neck at the top make it easy to peek in, the neck stap adjusts easily,and the cover keeps you had modesty in mind. My sister barrowed it when nursing her third child and said the same thing, she wishes she had it for child 1 & 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Cover Lover...","review":"Skip it. I cannot speak for all babies, but I would test out a homemade prototype before buying a nursing cover...my daughter was always shucking it off due to our excessive body heat. Collar sometimes worked, and sometimes didn't. Somehow it brought more attention to a breastfeeding session as opposed to just 1977ing it. Keep the deal natural and sweet by not purchasing this cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't find it useful..here is why...","review":"I tried using it at home and didn't at all find it to be covering me appropriately...It doesn't give u any coverage in the back. If u r wearing a shirt, ur back is completely visible and also it gives u coverage only to one side. The worst part is, it doesn't give good visibility to ur child b/c it bends at a wierd angle and blocks visibility to ur child...somehow it was very annoying to use it. I returned the item after trying to use it twice at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"I found a better option","review":"I am a BFing mother of two, and I like to be very private in public when BFing. I bought the Hooter Hider to use while in public, however it was more work than helpful. It wasn't very easy to put on while navigating a hungry baby. Also, my baby would pull the fabric away, and I was either exposed on the side or completly in the front. The wind in the park also blew the cover; it was hard to hold the baby and hold the hooter hider in the wind. Also, I had a hard time propping my baby up in public so that both of us could be comfortable while BFing. Finally, I bought the Covillow! It addressed all these issues. I can BF in public while my front, back, and sides are covered. I don't have to worry about my baby pulling the fabric or wind exposing me. And, we both can rest easy as he lays on the pillow to BF! Awesome. I can finally BF in public and be relaxed at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Someone got me one of these as shower gift. Totatlly worthless.

After my first attempt with a blanket was clumsy and awkward I felt even less confident. This cover has completely changed me. I don't even give it a second though because it covers me so well and can't fall off. It's also a nice print (I got black and white). I recommend it to everyone I know who is going to be breast feeding. For me, it meant more freedom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional & Modern!","review":"I was very nervous about nursing in public and this nursing cover really helps out. Its much cooler than a blanket and it covers me and the baby enough to be comfortable. The wire around the top really helps to view your baby continuously. I would just suggest you try to use it at home once in a while so your baby will get used to it and not have a fit when he/she is in public with this cover over him. Plus, you'll get so many compliments on how nice and modern it is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful product!","review":"Thanks to this nursing cover I have been able to nurse in many different situations while staying completely relaxed and in tune with my baby. When you're out and about, it's nice to be able to create your own little space to nurse in peace without worrying about showing off parts of your body you don't want to! I definitely recommend this nursing cover for breastfeeding moms everywhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for discrete nursing in public","review":"I have been using this nursing wrap for 9 months and I love it! The only complaint I have is that the fabric is not as soft as I like. But the print is beautiful and it works really well for discrete nursing in public. I use it all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I own several Bebe Au Lait cover ups and like them","review":"I nursed my first daughter until she was 19 months old and I'm now nursing my 6 month old daughter. These cover ups are nice unless you dry them. They're the right size if you wash them on warm and air dry them. I made the mistake of drying the first one I purchased and wasn't able to use it anymore because it was just too small. I also like the corner terry cloth pouches for wiping milk off of my baby's face if needed when they're done nursing. I really like the pattern choices Bebe has. I only gave it 4 stars because of the shrinking that occurs when drying them. Otherwise, it's a great cover up for a newborn to almost 2 year old."},{"rating":"2","title":"For anyone hoping to grasp the roots of modern conservatism","review":"Matthew Arnold, a British poet and critic, wrote on the importance of culture in this work. He defined culture, famously, as \\"sweetness and light\\" - implying that culture represented everything good, everything not barbaric. The work is most important for the way it forwards the notion of an \\"organic\\" society - that is, a society that evolves slowly, that grows into maturity, that does not strive for sudden \\"advances\\" led by experts working all at once to implement great change. For anyone wondering about the relationship between modern conservatism and classical Liberalism, this is a decent place to start. \\"I am a Liberal,\\" Arnold writes in the introduction, \\"yet I am a Liberal tempered by experience, reflection, and renouncement, and I am, above all, a believer in culture.\\" If you wish to take an intellectual journey from Burke to Bork, Arnold must make up one leg of your trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Note for the fashion con-science","review":"This edition is preferable to the gimmicky version published by Yale, where the original text is lost beneath the imposition of leftist ideologues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Politically Correct Yalies","review":"Trendy revisionist garbage as to be expected from the Yale imprimature.

While the idea behind it is interesting, most of the book isn't. Many of the reviews are poorly written and don't offer a clear explanation for why the writer dislikes the particular album they have chosen. As with any exercise like this, some of the discs in the book deserve to be here, i.e. Trout Mask Replica (ugh), Rumours, Kick out the Jams, The Doors. BUT c'mon people, Pet Sounds? Blood on the Tracks and (GASP!), OK Computer?? These are GREAT albums. Oh well, I guess that's the point, right? At any rate, it may have been easier to take had the reviewers presented thier argument a little better. The appendix with the contributors own top 10 lists was cool though. Skip the purchase, get it from your public library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing the point","review":"This author (editor?) tends to review the book based upon stereotypes generated from the albums present day status (which I think they were trying to avoid?), rather than actually listening to the album. Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon was not a drug induced coma, but a leap forward in music technology/production and lyrical creativity. That is just one conflict I have with the authors. While they are amusing and I got a few laughs, at times they do not even talk about the album (Rumours?) but rather rant about nothing. Most of the albums they choose to review are not great for just lyrics, but the COHERENT organization of sound. Put, aside any misconcepts, I dare anyone to match the bass on Sgt. Pepper, the hammond organ on Dark Side of the Moon, or the arrangments on Pet Sounds, all of which put music technology where it is and raised the bar of music/lyrical awareness. Do not buy is book, it is a weak attempt at music journalism and will insult its readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Note to Professors: Don't Even Think About It","review":"This book was the basis of a English class I took as a college freshman a couple years back. Perhaps I would have appreciated it more if I was more familiar with the music that was reviewed by the author and his peers. But for a class focusing on discussing rhetoric, ethos, pathos, etc. in selected writings, I wanted to gouge my eyes out. Book was written in such a condesencing, egotistical fashion that I find it hard to believe that the reviewers are considered so distinguished in their field. So to any professors out there who are considering this for their classes, suggest it for enjoyment or optional reading, not required text. Your students will thank you.The only good thing I can say about this book is that I got a fair price for it at buy-back time at the end of the semester."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Crap","review":"There is nothing so loathsome in the world of rock criticism as the writer who fancies himself or herself the gatekeeper of a particular aesthetic. As the wannabe voice of \\"indie credibility,\\" Jim DeRogatis is the very paragon of this stifling sensibility, in which music and musicians are subjected to a litmus test of political correctness and anti-establishment manners. It got to the point in the Nineties that the byword of indie-rock might as well have been \\"nothing fails like success,\\" because popular appeal was the kiss of death with this alienated clique. Now DeRogatis has rounded up a crew of third-generation rock critics who vent their secret resentment at having missed most of what was good about rock music. To have these second-rate thinkers attempting to deflate the works of such artists as the Doors, the Beatles and Captain Beefheart is tantamount to trying to level the Taj Mahal by lobbing spoonfuls of oatmeal at it. Get a life, kiddies."},{"rating":"1","title":"As Pretentious as Some of The Records It Slams","review":"What a waste of space. Is there a point to this?

The time to get outraged by what is at heart an adolescent stunt -- \\"Your favorite band sucks!\\" -- is very much past its sell-by date. While remaining a far superior writer and critic to his Chicagoland buddy Greg Kot (who's finally moved on from Mekons Toady-in-Chief to Wilco's court jester), DeRogatis is fast becoming this decade's Jimmy Guterman; \\"Bore Your Idols\\" is redolent of nothing so much as Guterman's execrable \\"Worst Rock & Roll Records of All Time.\\" Can't wait for DeR.'s next weighty tome, due in -- what? -- six months? \\"Milk it\\" indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst crap i have ever read","review":"This is the worst book i have ever had to read.

He does this every time he gets the chance, and if you wanna know why, well, just find yourself a pic of Mr. DeRogatis, and then take a look at any pic of Jim Morrison. DeRogatis even had the nerve to once refer to the late Doors singer's \\"fat\\" visage during his final days in Paris. Mr. Derogatis, even at the very end, Morrison was *skinny* next to you. Why not finally admit that your problem with Morrison isn't his music, but instead envy of his looks and his talent?

The problem with this book is that (barring a couple of exceptions) the writing is so damn bad, it obscures the point. If you're going to say you hate something, you'd better give some insightful, defensible statements to that end, and there is precious little of that here. It's like you learn in your first college writing course: you can start from any thesis statement you want, but if you base your paper on poor logic, cliches, and general banality, you not only fail in the exercise but are certain to lose the reader a few paragraphs in. Which is what nearly all of these essays do. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak in all senses of the term","review":"A fine title but the book just doesn't live up to its own hype. The reviews are lazy and self indulgent with perhaps the worst offender being the dialogue between two writers dissing the Doors.

The writers showing they are just as trapped in their own petty bourgeoise mythology as those they attempt to topple. The book seems another example of the sort of limpid navel grazing twaddle that mistakes itself for daring...this sort of thing makes one long for rigor, or Lenin even.(There is however one important exception, the demolition of U2 which while not exactly a tough target is done with the wit and verve sadly lacking in about every other whimper in this book.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Hey, stop enjoying that music! Don't you know it sucks?\\"","review":"Chicago's worst critic, Jim DeRogatis, is a terrible writer as well as a malevolent reviewer. This book proves that for a national audience. Critics are a valuable resource, but they lose their importance when they take more pleasure in gunning down art that was made sincerely than they do in honestly evaluating it, for better or for worse. I think it's pretty funny that a guy who hates on U2, Rolling Stones, Madonna and more earns only an average score of 2 stars from Amazon reviewers and hasn't cracked the Top 200,000 in (rock of) ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hooey","review":"Older rock critics NEVER liked The Best of the Doors, Dark Side of the Moon, Ram, and Sgt.

Baker's writing is clear yet poetic and her books very distant from the usual rehashed vampire tales (bad vampire/good vampire/unhappy vampire). Her vampires are fresh and interesting and their unlives and experiences draw you deep into their stories. The relationship between Ardeth and Rozokov is highly erotic, interesting, and never laughable.

Twila was the ONLY likeable one in the entire bunch - in the entire show!! Ironically, it was only the two openly lesbian members of the jury (whom I despised) who had the guts to vote for the best in the final two! I hated, hated, hated this season.

I am afraid to use the other one as it has the same product code (some kind of batch id) on the unit. Sandisk's customer support promises to replace the defective one but won't replace the other as it still 'works'. I tried to persuade them (two customer support reps at two different times) to replace both of them so prevent future hassel but they did not agree. When I purchased this unit, I was lured by the gloss and glitter surrounding this model and the name of SANDISK, and paid a premium over other similar products on the market. Considering the large number of defective units (the customer service reps recognize it) they should parhaps have gracefully recalled the defective batches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product and company","review":"The product didn't last even four months before it failed.

It just stops working--not only for that machine, but for all machines. I make daily backups but I still lost several documents the two times it failed. Customer service has replaced it, but I just can't trust the thing anymore--they won't let me exchange it for any other Sandisk product. Flash memory is not supposed to be this touchy.

I was very happy with it for a few brief months. Then during a critical moment (no backup of the data) it died. USB device not recognized error. Their support website is useless. It tells you to hack the registry in windows and reboot. Think about it, you use it on multiple PCs so if the device isn't recognized on more than 1 PC, probably not the PC's fault for a device that doesn't need drivers on XP...Besides the little blue light on the drive won't stay on (flickers a little when inserted). Likely a hardware problem. I guess I could ask for another, but from the comments here, why bother? I'll probably try and break it open and see if I can pull the data out some way.

Admittedly I have used it for more than a year now but initially when I started using it I thought the case could last much longer. The metal case looks really nice, and the painted words do not even scratch off even though I carry it on my key ring. But that's the last good thing I'd say about it. Eventually the case separated itself into two pieces, revealing some shoddy gluework between the two nice metal pieces. Now I have two nice looking and strong metal pieces for toy.

I'm shocked that Sandisk hasn't resolved the issue.

It ran down the side of the cup when I took the top off. Also when I re-closed the sipper-lid, it pushed milk all over the top of the cup and down the side. Very messy.

If you tighten the cap too much, the band will be squeezed out of position and leak. If you do not tighten it enough the band won't seal and leak.Another thing, maybe not as important as the above, is that it is little uncomfortable to drink directly from the bottle, the lid keep closing everytime.So before you make your decision analize carefully.

Good comfortable grip thanks to the leather pads on the sides.

He could not get the Robeez off making them invaluable to me at the time!

I always dry my hair completely with a hair dryer before using my straightener, because I don't want to damage my hair.

The first one I purchased lasted a year and then over heated causing my hair to burn, the unit started smoking setting off the smoke alarm and shooting sparks out the cord. The second unit last about 6 months and this one quit heating up. It got warm to the touch but nothing more.

I thought it would be a great item because 1) it's a wet to dry iron --meaning you can use it to dry and straighten your hair at the same time; 2) it's curved design would allow me to curl my ends easier; and 3) the way the ceramic plates lay flush with the body of the iron, it's less likely to snag my hair like my other ceramic iron. But the design is so awful that the plates do not fit perfectly together! The section of hair I attemped to dry & straighten (yes, I only completed ONE section before I determined that this thing was going back to the store!) did not dry completely.

I live in florida and I can say that these are NOT good for humidity because my hair usually ends up frizzy and curly after just 5 mins outside.

I searched online to see if there had been a recall, because obviously this could be a safety hazard. I haven't found a recall but saw that another reviewer had the same thing happen.

The ivory flap cover is almost Raphaelite, but it's the photos inside really worth the price of admission. The text has little that's new. Pieces of Callas' private diaries and letters provide a unique, not extensive glance at her private life, forming at times a melancholy sense of a tenuous woman's personal fears and difficulties. Refuting a rumor that Meneghini wanted her to stop singing altogether, she denied that was his view, saying \\"It is not his view, because if it were I would never have sung again.\\" Some interesting bits on Elsa Maxwell, who was apparently in love with Callas, and some of the finest photographs of Maria I've seen anywhere.

I knew this prior to my purchase so I will live with it.Ed Atwell"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Compressor I've owned","review":"This is the quietest twin tank compressor I've been around. It can easily run two framing guns at once. It's built very solid. I used to buy Hitachi compressors. I had one that lasted a very long time until one of my worker dropped a sheet of plywood off the roof on to it. The newer Hitachi's have a plastic front on them. This Makita front is steel. Also, you can run this compressor off an extension cord, which I could not do with a Hitachi. I'm not trying to dog Hitachi tools, I love Hitachi tools and own several of them. This Makita has all other comparable compressors beat in my opinion. It isn't light to carry around, but none of them really are. I would highly recomend this compressor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well satisfied","review":"Very nice compressor. I had purchased it based upon many other reviews which spoke well of the compressor, with my only reservation being that many had received theirs damaged. Mine came in A-1 shape. As others had explained,it provides plenty of air and motor runs fine even in cold weather. It is a little larger than other compressors I've owned but not inconveniently so. Well satisfied with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good compressor","review":"I bought the compressor based on the reviews and am happy I did. I really valued and looked forward to a \\"quiet\\" compressor. Frankly it wasn't as quiet as I expected based on the reviews. As mentioned elsewhere the compressor needs to be broken in when you get it (add oil, open valve, run for about 20 minutes with no load). I would like to add - install air filter to the list. I almost omitted this in my haste and excitement to get going, but was glad I didn't turn the compressor on with the dust protection cup installed in the air inlet port. I'm pretty sure it would have sucked it into a big problem. Pros: upfront controls are very convenient, fast recovery, dual quick connects, retains air pressure perfectly. Cons: kind of heavy, enough vibration to \\"walk\\" when its running, kind of pricey for what you get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Compressor","review":"I do a lot of DIY home remodeling and repair. My old pancake compressor was a pain from day one, and always overheated way too easily. This thing is like a sewing machine by comparison. Never struggles and recycles quickly. It runs my framing nailer with ease. The noise is a lot more subdued than any other compressor I've ever worked with. Very happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"MAC2400","review":"With all the outstanding reviews on this compressor it is hard to further praise this product without duplicating what has already been said so I'll keep it short and sweet. The MAC2400 compressor arrived on time and in perfect condition. After the break-in period I put the MAC2400 through some tests and I must say, I was totally impressed with the capacity, short recovery time and the quietness of this compressor. I use this compressor for my nail guns, an HVLP spray gun, inflating tires, using an impact wrench on my cars and blowing off tools. It's everything I need! It is powerful, quite and has a small footprint which is an important consideration for my small shop. Great tool!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome compressor while it worked.","review":"I would have gave it a 5 star rating but after three years sparingly used it started having problems with pressure switch. I did not bother contacting the Makita company because it has been three years so I tried to fix it myself. I would by this model again."},{"rating":"2","title":"TO HEAVY","review":"I owne several Makita tools and have been quite pleased with there LS 1412 compound miter was and 12v impact driver. So when my old compressor quit I compared new ones and chose this one. It works great, looks good and is quieter but its a lot heavier than the others out there. I sent it back and recieved the Dewalt D55155 compressor and am very pleaded with it. I do not recomend the Makita for those who move a compressor around a lot but if your a weekend warrior it a excellant choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"OH WOW!","review":"Hey all, I depended upon your reviews and bought this compressor package from Amazon.com...FAST and free delivery, everything in one piece...can't beat the price for this amazing unit...I must give it a FIVE STAR rating, my \\"technical\\" friends are impressed and they want one! Thanks, Amazon!...oh, the Makita hotline is also very helpful in setting up of the unit which could not be easier. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little compresser.","review":"I bought thiis mainly for airbrush painting, and I now use it for all my air tools."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Good as it gets.","review":"I got my Makita Compressor tonight from Amazon.

They should not sell products that cannot be returned if they are faulty. Proceed with caution when buying any product on Amazon if it cannot be returned!

We purchased a hose and nozzle to go with it. It's a very heavy,solid piece of machinery."},{"rating":"2","title":"great compressor","review":"im a carpenter and i hear compressors all day and compare to more expensive (a jenny wheelbarrow compressor compressor this is right up there for quietness and that's a big deal if you have to hear it all day. unlike the other reviews mine came in perfect condition so i would recommend this to anyone needed a medium size compressor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just add wheels","review":"A contractor used my compressor to frame my garage because his compressor kept flipping the circuit breaker. It kept up with him at all times using 200 feet of hose, with some leaky connectors. He never had to wait for air. The unit runs quietly. I have been comparing compressors for 6 months and to me this has always been the best compressor for the money.It needs good wheels and a handle to be more portable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great compressor","review":"Not only is this compressor a great looker, it performs flawlessly. It is the most quiet operating twin stack compressor I have used. You can have it right next to you all day without having to wear ear protection. The controls are conveniently placed and the gauges are rock steady. The only reason I rate it 4 rather than 5 stars is the weight. It is heavy. However, a couple of small wheels, a clever home made removeable handle,I can wheel it around effortlessly...after heaving it in and out of the truck, however. I love this tool!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer work horse","review":"I bought this two years ago and run the sh#* out of it powering nail guns and it just keeps chugging along, nice and quiet. Change the oil once and a while, drain it everyday and this thing will last a long time. A bit heavy but I like that because in my mind you can't build a tool like this and expect it to last if it's made out of plastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock Steady Mac2400 Compressor","review":"This is the quietest compressor of its size that I have heard.I read it is because of the large bore cylinder that Makita uses but in any case, the thing purrs...and it is rock steady. I have had it one year and have no complaints at all. Got it at a very great price from Amazon delivered right to the front door."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makita MAC2400","review":"Came well boxed and protected. The breather was not mounted, which was one less item that could have been damaged in shipping (Makita must have learned from prior experience). Everything was great, easy to setup, poured in the included oil and opened the drain and up and running. Setting the regulator pressure on the output was not clearly explained anywhere. The instructions talk about turning the regulator knob, but never mentioned you need to adjust the regulator while air is being used. If you are trying to maintain a fairly low pressure (i.e. 50 lbs.) you cannot be starting at 90 and then working down with the regulator. Using a handheld air sprayer allows you to adjust down. Very quiet unit, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"great compressor, but like other shipped compressors, there was damage","review":"Great compressor just like the other reviewers have said.Unfortunately the pressure gauge face has a crack in it.To me it's not worth going through the hassle of returning the 70Lb compressor via mail.It is the only downside of my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"a tale of 2 compressors","review":"Seeking advice as a first time user of light air tools,my brother , who part times a motorcycle shop, suggested a huge noisy Campbell Hausfield, with piping and couplings everywhere.Not an option for a small pottery shop.My choice was a small ,quiet compressor, but the concern was it would need replacement or repair.Makita is inexpensive considering the extremely long life-if you pay attention to the service schedule.It is unbelievably quiet and takes up almost no space.I thought I might break off fins or filters but it is a protected robust design. For brad nailers, tire inflating , a series of airbrushes and HVLP guns-this compressor does not even break a sweat.At 70 #its rather heavy to hop up and down stairs so it sits on a small dolly and takes an extra length of hose every so often. No matter.It has done great service in the year I have used it.Update to Jan. 2013: everything I have said before in spades!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product,","review":"This has been a great compressor. Amazon shipped it quickly and it showed up without any damage. The compressor is suprissingly quite and runs 2 siding nailers without any slow downs. A great product at a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good compressor but bad packing","review":"I bought this compressor and when I got it there was a crack in the actual compressor housing. I got on Amazon and returned it and they promptly sent another one out to me. When I got this one it had damage to the front air gauge area from the loose air cleaner banging around free in the box. Also, the frame of the unit was tweaked a bit. Everything worked fine on this one so I just decided to keep it instead of waiting a week for another to arrive. The unit works really great I have to say! Pumps up quick, its very very quiet and has really good connections and gauges on the front panel. The only drawback to it is the weight. I think they should include a set of wheels or make a cart for it. Overall im happy with the purchase, it just sucks that they have such poor packing."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a sweet piece","review":"It is everything the desciption said it would be very quiet, solid construction, and good capacity. Having used various compressors in the past from cheap chinese brands to high end models this unit ranks right up there with the better ones. Amazon had the best price and with free shipping it was by far the best deal. Was received with no shipping damage. If this is the size compressor that suits your needs you won't go wrong buying this one"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oil field worker / production","review":"This is an excellent product, it is quite, has a fast recovery time. The air compressor has preformed as advertised. I would recommend to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly as I expected","review":"After reading all the reviews for this air compressor, I decided to make the purchase. The compressor was delivered as expected without any damages( as noted in earlier reviews). It has met all of my expectation for a small oiled air compressor. It is a bit heavy to move from site to site on a constant basis, so I placed it on top of a furniture dolly. This makes the compressor easy to move around."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Compressor","review":"We received the compressor in about 10 days and everything was in great shape. We are building a three car garage and the compressor had no problem keeping up with the nail gun. It is very quiet when it is running and is able to refill very quickly. It is very heavy, but we just use lots of hose and leave the unit plugged into the old garage. Thanks for all the great reviews of this product, it helped make the decision easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only book on Franciscan History you will need.","review":"Moorman's work offers a thourough and accessible account of the development of the Franciscan Order.

The idea of white space, headings, scene and act divisions is totally absent. It doesn't even have breaks for the preface, or titles to mark the change from the end of the first play to the beginning of the second. This book contains no table of contents or index, and Ibsen's famous prefaces are just thrown into the mix.This product would be worth $3-4, because it does contain the words of Ibsen. For $20, I would expect it to look like a real book.Whoever thinks this does tribute to long forgotten works, needs a slap in the face."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another system","review":"The author does a fine job of presenting his system, however, he forgets to explain how he goes about his analysis. A comprehensive book would inform the reader how the author conducts analysis. Besides, one would expect for the price of the publication, a print date of Jan 2001 may offer an updated version of the original print: no luck. Much of the print dedicated to computer application uses old Lotus language - it is clear this edition could care less about users in Jan 2001 - it also seems to pass over the 90s as well. In all, it seems the author presents his notes on a system of looking for cycles, but the path is not clear and the guide not up to date.

It was one of the most poorly written books I've ever read and I read alot. Throughout the book, the two main characters were so angst ridden that they became unlikeable instead of sympathetic. There was really no plot to the book. The writing seemed amateurish, when compared to other romance novelists, and the text was wordy instead of being succinct. The delivery room scene was a good example of this i.e.describing how many centimeters the heroines cervix had dialated. What did that add to the story?

First off, the microphones only work with the Singstar games, which is a bit of a rip-off. Second, the game isn't much fun. In challenge mode, you have to sing along with the person you're up against, which isn't as good as singing solo. There are no extras to unlock, either. The playback feature, where you can listen to your version of the recording you just sang, is nice, but overall the game is quite limited in its appeal.

Having grown up in Louisville, I found it interesting to read of streets and churches which are still very familiar today, but this knowledge is in no way necessary to enjoyment of the novel. There were many poignant moments in the narrative, made more so to me because my German and Irish ancestors might well have been affected.After recent events in New York and Washington, I found reading this book comforting somehow, that although terrorism has been with us for a long time, even in our own midst, we have been able to come through it and become in many ways a better country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"I had vaguely heard a long time ago a tradition or a legend that Jesus of Nazereth had gone to the Far East in between childhood and adulthood.

Having read this, about the best I can say is, I will not say for 100% that Jesus of Nazereth was there, but there definitely WAS a Jesus there and a lot of the teachings of Jesus do mirror Buddhist and Taoist beliefs to at least a small degree."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lost Yera of Jesus","review":"All christian should demand to fimd out what happened to 18 years of Jesus from Age 13 from their Bible writer and Church?Every ordinary or great man or successful man's life has pivotal years from 13 to 26.

Jesus message is for all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unproducable Manuscripts may as well be imagined manuscripts","review":"Simply put, an unsubstantiated manuscript for which there is no evidence of it actually existing is not proof that Jesus was ever in India. The use of such material by actual historians would be considered poor research at best. The manuscripts themselves would be considered primary evidence, but since all they have is hearsay that they even exist, they are useless for anything more than speculation and conjecture. Moreover, if one reads the Bible closely, they know beyond the shadow of a doubt that Jesus did not and does not subscribe to Buddhist, Hindu, Confucian, or Taoist thoughts and ideas. He declared Himself to be God, not \\"a god\\", but the God in the flesh. Hindus believe that we are all god, and Buddhists believe similarly. One who is being honest should not ascribe what Jesus taught to any Eastern religious influence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easier To Go To Original Sources","review":"I found this book to be nothing but a rehash of items found in other more authoritative books available on Amazon.

Changes the Facts to Suit Her Beliefs","review":"This is one book I would absolutely love to give 0 stars, if amazon.com gave me that opportunity. First, the Prophets don't have a clue how to write clear, concise English. Second, this is not an intellectual work- unless you like having ideas shoved into your throat without any consideration of the actual facts- every \\"fact\\" they give is open to broad interpretation, and they interpret the way they see fit. I could probably write a book on how Genesis 1:1 proves that thought gives us the power to create and manifest anything we want, but I'd have to pick my points very carefully. I don't doubt that possibly Jesus was in the East. But the way in which these people throw their propaganda at you is rediculous. This is not a book for you if you want intelligent facts laid down to support a claim- the prophets just make claims and expect that you take it on faith. The great thing about this book is that most thinking people won't think twice about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting","review":"I loved this book.

The Talmund and NT recorded several accusations against Jesus made by the xenophobic Pharisees but no surprise - his Far East visit wasn't one of them. There is no historical nor archeological support for this theory. It is based solely on revelations from spirits (pretenting to be Jesus or Mary) received by Elizabeth Prophet, as well as Edgar Cayce. Don't waste your money. Get the New Testament instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well the Truth is.....","review":"....I admire Elizabeth Clare Prophet, but I must admit that she is lead to researching the false Gospel of Jesus. So when you find such things like this saying\\" Missing Gospel or Missing Bible of Jesus\\", they are false and IS coming outside of the Christian Church. ( Such as the Gnostic Gospel of Thomas, etc relating to Gnostic) The Gnostic Gospel was created by Pagans somewhere in the time of the Apostles after Jesus accended to Heaven with His Father. The Gnostic Gospel is an evil immitation of the Apostles claiming God to be evil when he IS NOT. If you go back to the History of the Christian Church - You will understand why this is a false Gospel and were out to destroy the Church. -So I don't recommend this book, and neither of them.

Unfortunately, this book did not live up to my expectations... I expected the book to be about how Scipio defeated Hannibal. But the years in which Scipio played the greatest part in that war--from his command in Spain to the battle of Zama--only make up about 35 pages in this 332 page book. I am immensly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been called Hannibal II - The sequel","review":"I thought this was a book about Scipio Africanus ? Instead all I get from this book is \\"That Hannibal, he was fantastic wasn't he ? Certainly better than this Roman guy who defeated him.\\" Less time spent on how all Romans were scumbags and more time on Scipio himself, what he actually did and how he went about doing it and this may have been worth reading. I was hoping this book would help contribute to the essay I have to submit on the Second Punic War. After reading this I would suggest Leckie might be better informed by reading my essay. Won't be buying the third book I'm afraid."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"I have not read Leckie's Hannibal, and based on this book, Scipio, I won't bother. The book wanders aimlessly through the early life of Scipio Africanus in the stereotypical way that novels written as memoirs do. We hear about little Publius growing up, learning Greek, admiring his father from a distance, losing his virginity, and so on. All of this is dealt with in no order and with no urgency, with constant interruptions from Bostar, the clerk recording Scipio's tale. The fact that Bostar was once Hannibal's clerk is an annoying absurdity.Once things do begin to get interesting the book becomes rushed, and everything is hurried and skimmed over with no detail. At least Bostar's interjections end at this point. I understand that, within the story, there are reasons why Scipio must finish his memoir in haste. But that doesn't make for a better read.Rebublican Rome is a fascinating period peopled with fascinating characters. Absolutely none of this comes through in this book. Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"A harmless diversion, but unsatisfying","review":"I am not familiar enough with the history of the Punic Wars or Hannibal and Scipio to pass judgment on the historical accuracy of this book. The most distracting part of Lecke's style is his insistence on cramming so many latin phrases and translations into his text. Do the characters really need to say \\"Romanus sum. I am a Roman\\" all the time? The author should have spent more time fleshing out his characters than providing a grade-school primer on Latin vocabulary and Roman society. I thought the description of Scipio's first experience of war was entertaining, but Lecke could have been a little more subtle in his portrayal of Scipio's development. How boring to have the future general constanly think or say, \\"So, this Hannibal is crafty! Perhaps we Romans can learn from him!\\" Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Mr Leckie read Polybius or Livy when reading Classics?","review":"Even worse than Hannibal, if you can believe. Where to begin... Scipio's mother did not die in childbirth of Scipio's brother Lucius (she'd have had a damned hard time making togas for the pair 20 years on if she had). Lucius did not commit suicide and Scipio hear of it, Lucius announced Scipio's death in the Senate at his trial. Can a man who was \\"known by his troops to have a fondness for beautiful women\\" and who committed adultery with his serving maid be gay? Or in denial of his gayness? Bloody unlikely.So many historical innacuracies,so little fact. Mr Leckie's artistic license should be revoked. Doesn't cover historical events until Pg 280 and then at such a speed any sense of accomplishment is lost.

Unfortunately, it's a fairly disjointed and altogether pointless book. What's it supposed to be about? I could not figure it out. It doesn't read as well as Colleen Mcculoughs books and doesn't seem to be half as well researched. Adn for a book about a soldier the battle scenes are pathetic. I cannot imagine what the author was trying to write. Autobiography ? Action war novel ? Philosophical tract? It's all of these and none as far as I am concerned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete and Utter Rubish","review":"What is this book supposed to be? Historical? Not only is Leckie's portrayal of the period and the characters doubtful, to put it mildly - but he consistently (and almost on purpose, it would appear) distorts historical fact. And I am convinced Mr Leckie knows the facts of the matter - no one who has not read Polybius or Livy could write so consistently incorrect rubbish.If you're looking to gain some knowledge about Rome and the roman mindset - forget this book - you won't get it from here. A children's book on the roman empire contains more historical fact than Mr. Leckie's books.Add that to the pretty horrible writing, and you definitely have a book to stay away from.PLEASE - Can't I give less than 1 Star?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Foot Massager","review":"Very hard to contact the supplier in New Jersey.

The solovox, which sounds halfway between a mellow accordion and an electronic organ, makes its first appearance 30 seconds into the first track -- and what a welcome sound! On the third track, Miskulin harks back to the days of Whoopee John Wilfahrt and the Six Fat Dutchmen by including, of all things, a schottische.

This is the only product that lets me forget I am wearing contacts all day. When Clear Care went off the shelves in April I tried another no rub product that was about the same price about 8 bucks US retail and my eyes would start hurting by 2-3pm in the afternoon and would stay dry and uncomfortable until I took them out(eye drops do not work for me, for some reason they break down my contact lens and cause them to break)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Found the Book Helpful and Easy to Read","review":"The publication company shipped very quickly and that was helpful to me because I ordered the book a few weeks before I started lawschool and I was pretty stressed out.

She is already an acclaimed actress, as we all know, but her additional ability to sing and perform in a music venue adds even more depth to her sensitive portrayal of a troubled young woman yearning for the one thing that tragically slips through her fingers.

The main problem is Gwyneth Paltrow: she simply is not believable. Although she has a passable voice, her fake accent and terrible acting muddy up the whole movie. Her acting was so bad, I kept wishing she would go away. (I mean, doesn't GOOP need her to blog about her famous recipe for PB&J sandwiches??) Two hours of my life I can never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Country Weak","review":"I watched this movie because I love watching Gwyneth Paltrow act. For a movie called Country Strong, though, I expected Kelly to, somehow, rise above her troubles and come out on top, even if she quit country music to do it. But, instead of being strong, (Spoiler alert!) and after she gives a fantastic come-back performance, she kills herself. The movie didn't reflect well on the country music industry, either. This movie was not only a downer, it just didn't make sense, and I have to wonder what everyone involved was thinking it was supposed to mean. I did enjoy watching Paltrow and Hedlund perform, as they both sing so well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very surprised","review":"I'm not a huge country music fan...

As a big fan of the late Tug McGraw I looked forward to this movie as a chance to launche his sons Tims acting career into the mainstream stratosphere; unfortunately I was sadly disapointed. This was a movie that failed because it tried to fit too many animals on one boat, the loss of a child, a failing marriage, substance abuse, rehab, country music, and more romantic story lines than a day time soap. Tim's great acting potential was hemmed in by a script that required he play the most wooden character I've seen since I watched Mr. Rogers as a kid. Although this movie was out of focus, I due look forward to Tim McGraw taking on larger more serious roles on the big screen worthy of his acting prowess."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"Slow and boring movie.

I picked up this book at the library because it was in the Suspense/Thrillers section, but was VERY disappointed. I could not read past the first few chapters because of the really annoying dialogue--it read like a very forced casual dialog and read very silly and amateurish as did the THRILLER parts where she flashes back to the life of an abused child.

I've read a lot of the scanlations before, though, and had thought that the series is good enough that I ought to at least buy the first volume of it, so that the author does get some well-deserved cash, sort-of... But after reading the del Rey translation, I feel all fired-up and enthusiastic about School Rumble again, and I certainly do intend to order the next one as soon as it's available. School Rumble has it's own unique sort of \\"zany\\"-ness, and it's just plain fun! Of course the plot is not unique, but the way the story is told, and takes a number of unexpected turns, well...

Tenma loves Karasuma. Harima loves Tenma. Eri loves Harima. Hijinks ensue. But...then it gets weird.Karasuma is anything but a normal human being. Almost completely expressionless, he dresses like a Kappa (a mythical Japanese water imp) and seems to posses supernatural powers. Harima is a master fighter, but has a hidden secret that he protects violently. Nothing is what it seems.Like most Japanese comics, \\"School Rumble\\" takes a while to get into the main story. This first issue is quite a bit of set up, and doesn't have all the elements that the series will grow into. The author, Kobayashi Jin, had the basic plot for the series but hadn't quite hit the tone yet.

I normally enjoy novels which involve extensive research and are crammed with information. However, this book was a huge disappointment. Time-consuming research isn't enough. The material has to be integrated into and support the story. This author did neither. All of the historical data is in either vignettes that interrupt the flow of the story or are crammed into footnotes (Yes, footnotes!) which only a graduate student could love -- and then only a very boring one. Having spent so much time on research, the author then appears to have been too exhausted to write a good narrative. The characters are flat, uninteresting and ofter caricatures of a particular type. And the conversations with God are just TOO cute. Finally the book is at least 200 pages longer than it should be. Pass this one by. It's not worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The greatest story ever told in the most boring way","review":"What could be more exciting for a scholar of religions than to find a lost gospel, written by one of the disciples of Jesus?Certainly not this book.

The footnotes were extremely fascinating and added, rather than detracted, from the novel. That said, I just did not buy Lucy's decision at the end of the book. Not so much that she made the decision, but rather the relative ease by which she made the decision. The character agonized over so many things, but this, one of the most important choices one could make, she appears to do it easily. And this is coming from a pro-choice reader. I can understand that Barnhardt wanted to make a statement about the issue, but he could have done so with more believability if he developed her character's decisionmaking further."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great winter read?

If you like contemporary poetry, you'll really appreciate Haug's gifts for storytelling, language, and character -- so vivid the people and places come alive. Though the poems seem rooted in realism -- from scenes of junkyards to suburban developments -- a sense of mystery and spirituality are there, too, transporting readers.

Tried to use it today to remove 11 dead rose bushes and on the very first bush you could put very little pressure on the spade or it would bend at the junction of the handle and the spade. By the second bush, you could put NO pressure on the spade or it would bend. No cracks, no breaks in the weld, just permanent bending - not flexing!Appears to me to be a design flaw, but contacted Bully today and waiting to see what they say and do. If the design has not been changed, I could not recommend the spade nor do I want a replacement.What a shame, made in the USA, heavy duty, but flawed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"have not recevied","review":"I ordered two Baseball caps and only recevied one.

He is actually a fitness instructor, as his bio states, but he presumes to call himself a master. Go figure. The reason this video is hard to follow is not because you should have a background in tai chi before watching it. It's hard to follow because the author doesn't know tai chi well enough to teach it.

What I found was that it was not dark and depressing in the conventional sense. While the familes were so sad to have lost their loved ones in that manner, I was moved by their struggle to understand and accept the fact that their loved one was in pain and had the right to go on to the next dimension(if there is one and I so hope there is)or at least be at peace. As a parent I was particularly struck by the thought that your kids do not owe it to you to stick around and live for your sake. I think a parent owes that to their child but had to agree that my children do not owe that to me. If they were truly depressed and not just situationally depressed, it is hard for me to justify my child living in pain just because of me. I never thought about it that way before. I found this to be a thought-provoking and inspiring, at least of the survivors, movie.

The editing is superb and the interviewees are left to tell their stories without the intrusion of an interviewer. The impact, palpable. With one exception for me, the soundtrack was almost another character itself.It wasn't until I did a little research afterward that I found out that all of the footage was shot during 2004 by the film maker; I figured there may have always been cameras perched around the bridge in hopes of intervening with the jumpers.

The Bridge asked the question why do people decide to end their lives by jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge, there is nothing fancy about this documentary and it does not need to be. In this film you hear from family and friends who tell there stories, of someone they know who chose to end their lives by jumping off the Bridge and some of the people who commited suicide is caught on film. When you see someone jumping off and see them hit that water with such force, it makes you sick to witness what you saw and feel ashamed that you paid to see this film, but the curious side of your mind wants to know why would they do this.If you can see this film without dismissing it as exploitative then this film will stay in your head for a long time after seeing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly Concise","review":"Not a bad book, but, has grown much since last edition.

It is the favorite music of my 1 year old (he asks for it specifically) and my 7 year old loves it too. The DVD is very simplistic in its animation, but this is appropriate for very young viewers (who shouldn't be watching DVDs anyway!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun with ABC's","review":"They Might Be Giants have done it again. This DVD is great fun, just as one would expect from TMBG. My son loves it, and I love hearing something different in a sea of vacuous children's artists.Quite a few times, I have bought a cd or dvd for my son, just to get it home and be unpleasantly surprised by how short it was. That is certainly not the case here. There were over 50 songs on this DVD, and each video/song is so different from the last, not to mention very catchy. My son dances around singing \\"E Eats Everything\\" like its going out of style.Thank you, TMBG for throwing a party in my living room every day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great departure from the normal preschool videos","review":"My son and I both loved this DVD. I listened to \\"They Might Be Giants\\" music when I was in my early 20's, so was already a fan.

I recommend this for anyone with small children, afterall these are the same guys who did the theme song for Mickey Mouse Clubhouse!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I was hoping to use this DVD as an aid to teach my toddler alphabets, but was not impressed with the DVD. I prefer Leapfrog letter factory which is entertaining and educational"},{"rating":"1","title":"TMBG should stick to quirky alternative pop!","review":"This CD is a total JOKE, it is so BAD! It is an obvious 'grab' by 'John squared' (Johns Flansburgh and Linnell) for a piece of the very lucrative and booming baby market, and it falls short bigtime. The songs, if you want to call them that, are beyond quirky and follow overly-simplistic structure that anyone could have come up with in 5 minutes while sitting on the John (pun intended)! It is AS annoying as listening to fingernails on a chalkboard, and then some. Even my 8 month old stopped smiling when I put this drivel on, and usually she smiles and giggles when I play most of my other 'for baby' CD's. There are much BETTER choices out there for babies and kids music. 'John squared' should stick to making alternative music for the 'older set', which is what they are great at!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Out Of Order ABCs\\"","review":"I feel that for ABCS to become giants, first of all of there has to be order! Generally, children are eager to learn and are fast learners. From Pre-school thru the early Elementary grades, the alphabets are taught in sequential order from A-Z. This DVD skips carelessly about and randomly selects out of order letters from the alphabets as they are presented in song. It is definitely not a great DVD for beginning learners. I would be equally afraid to order the giant numbers DVD created by the same publishers for fear of it producing numbers that are totally out of order as well! Don't be disappointed, find a DVD that's simple and repetitious for early learners if you want success."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible! Nothing like the 1,2,3s","review":"My husband and I love,love,love Here Come the 1,2,3s...oh, and our 8 month-old digs it, too. That is why we decided to buy this DVD, but we were SOOOOOOOOOOOOO disappointed. Ugh--the sounds are irritating and the lyrics are not creative at all. If I had bought this one first, I wouldn't have bothered with the second one. This one hardly has any of the energy of the other.

My three and a half year old LOVES them both. The songs are funny enough to keep our attention and educational enough that it is helping her with spelling. TMBG are great with this stuff.

An educational dvd that is also fun","review":"I first discovered this dvd at the library, my then 5 month old daughter loved it so much that we had to buy it for her. My daughter is now 7 months old and still smiles every time the dvd starts up and the John puppets come on screen. My husband and I love that the songs are mostly educational while not being annoying and when the songs get stuck in our heads we just belt out a lyric or two and laugh. I just bought the Here Come the 1,2,3's dvd as a stocking stuffer and we will most likely end up buying the other cds as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was a big TMBG fan in the '80s, and was psyched to hear some of their fun kids' stuff. This sounds like they sort of phoned it in. There are a couple of okay songs, and a bunch of filler that I think is just bad sounding and not clever. My 3 year old does seem to like it (especially Go for G and E Eats Everything), but I can see the CD getting annoying fast. (Also, did it not occur to them that having toddlers running around saying \\"Q U !\\" might be misinterpreted . . . ?). Sadly, I think this might be one to just buy a couple of the individual songs on amazon or itunes, if they are available individually."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"This product does work on laptops and worked flawlessly with my PC. The graphics are excellent and I have used them with many video and photo editing and production programs. However, if you are not computer savvy you may have some problems. The thumbnails to view the pictures are installed with the program disk but you have to switch between the 10 DVD's to use the pictures for projects. This is normal with a high quality image collection of this size, however it is still a pain. This can be avoided if you install all 10 disks to your hard drive but you need a whole lot of extra memory to do that. I did that and I am happy. Excellent product if you know how to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work on laptops","review":"It's difficult to give this product a 1 star rating when it doesn't even work, but that's the lowest possible rating available. What they don't tell you on the box is that this program hasn't been tested on laptops! And quess what, it doesn't work. When you go to the recommened support website they tell you right away. What's more, they state that if it doesn't work you are out of luck.

Rob Morrow has a tough role, in playing someone with this affliction. I wish I could have contacted him, to ask how long it took him to learn the behavior. He made the character sympathetic. Laura Linney was fantastic, and whoa! was she fine (in her posing), but that's irrelevant. Most actors, who would write, direct, and star in their own work would make it an exercise in ego, but Mr. Morrow manages to strike a good balance. (Too bad Numb3rs which he was on was cancelled). Nice movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important gem","review":"This was an original and extremely well acted film. Rob Morrow was genious in his portrayal of Lyle Maze, and artist with Tourretts syndrome who falls in love with his best friends girlfriend. This film took so many unexpected turns, and steared clear of all the cliches that we have been accustomed to with this genre. I originally picked up this film because Laura Linney tends to do really good independent films, who knew when I took it home that good ole Dr. Fleischman from Northern Exposure had so much talent in writing, directing and starring in this fantastic gem. I hope that he keeps up the good work and gives us many more movies with such wondful performances. I highly reccommend this film to anyone who wants to see something original with great acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full Frontal Female Nudity of a Major Actress","review":"MazeThis movie is highly rated because it is one of the few movies in the last decade in which a major Hollywood star (Laura Linney)showed full frontal nudity. The censors and distributors rule Hollywood all female nudity is cut, airbrushed, edited or obscured; But to see the movie we have to endure a politically correct plot of a man with Tourret's Syndrome. It's annoying to see the tics, spasms and jerks of the lead character, once spoiling a nude scene by spattering paint over the nude model. The plot is of a handicapped man falling for his best friend's pregnant wife and his nude model; and his frustrations of inferiority, until he finally gets the girl after the child is born."},{"rating":"1","title":"sing withc, sing death","review":"goodness, what a horrible stupid book.

When it was first delivered, 2 of the panels were damaged. I called Melissa & Doug's and they sent me new ones...no questions asked. All of the Melissa & Doug products that I have come across are of very high quality similar to the toys I had when I was younger (most toys seem to be made for the short term nowadays). I would highly recommend their products for 2 reasons - durability and customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great table- awful to assemble","review":"We made the mistake of waiting until 8pm on Christmas Eve to assemble this table. There were FIVE adults and it took us FIVE hours. The instructions are not great but bearable. The main issue is that the holes are cheaply made and the screw do not want to go in. We literally had to hold the table on its side and just keep wiggling it to get the screw in. VERY FRUSTRATING but we muddled through. Once assembled, the table looks great and is stable.I am excited that the train is not affixed to the table and the table could be used for some other activity if my son outgrows his interest in trains."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice table. Great value!","review":"I ordered this for my son to have somewhere to build Legos an play with other toys. It seems pretty durable and is a great price compared to other similar tables I found online. Free shipping on Amazon was a HUGE bonus. The table is pretty heavy. There was one small piece that wasn't threaded. I called the company and they sent a whole new package of hardware free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Activity Table","review":"We got this for Christmas mainly for a train table for our 18-month old son. It's just the right height for him and it seems to be very durable.I love that it's the type of table where you can do craft activities or a puzzle or set up the train. It's not limited to a train table.There was a little bit of an issue putting it together. It seems the holes were not manufactured to line up but it was workable. They could have done a better job with that. The drawer could be bigger too. That's probably my main complaint. There is all that extra space underneath and just a tiny drawer.I liOverall, we do love it. It's a great table. Fairly easy for us to move. Great height. Plenty big and it looks great. I would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks terrible after nearly a year","review":"We haven't had this table for even a year yet and the white perimeter is all chipped and the green table is all scratched up. This is with normal play on it not any unusually rough playing. Now it looks very ugly and I regret buying it. Poor quality!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Super Disappointed","review":"I put this table on my list because I was under the impression that all Melissa and Doug toys were made in the USA. Their website is a little misleading in saying that they are the manufacturer of all their toys so they can control the quality. Imagine my disappointment when the box arrived and Made in China was written all over the outside of the box. I could have gotten the table at Costco that came with a Train for $100 bucks if I wanted something made in China. I have some of M&D's other products and they are all made well and have been very durable. I am completely disappointed in the quality of this product. It is made with cheap parts and when put together is not as sturdy as I would think a table like this should be. This will not be something that will last a lifetime. My son will get a few years of use out of this before it is falling apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad materials","review":"HelloWe normally like Melissa & Doug but lately the are producing cheap things. This was one of them. Not worth the money. The screws that hold it all together weren't catching the nuts when screwed it. So basically, they just turned. Because we were giving it to our son for Christmas 2 days later, we used screws we had in our garage but they are for a bed that we will need to use eventually. The wood that the top leans on was easily cracked (an accident done when putting together) and therefore the top is not stable.There is only one flimsy drawer too.I would have returned it if we weren't so close to Santa's arrival. So now I am stuck with this piece of junk.Very disappointed. And so is my son."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality","review":"This table is wonderful!

I liked the idea of this table vs a Thomas brand one simply because it was bigger and more versatile. My 3 year old plays with his dinosaurs and monster trucks on it just as much as trains. The smooth white surface is easy to clean and we are using the wall stickers out there to decorate it. Thomas tables are still cool but i just see this one being played with more over the long term. Also the drawer is really nice and solid."},{"rating":"2","title":"spunki79","review":"I bought this table for my 3 1/2 year old son, before I even had it assembled he was trying to roll his magnetic balls across the tabletop. I am excited to set up his toy trains. Very good quality, very easy assembly, with clear step by step instructions. There could easily be another pull out drawer on the opposite side, bummed it only has one drawer, always nice to have extra storage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in the design of this table","review":"I am very disappointed with this table. First, the sides are only half-wall. A small child can crawl underneath the toy. When you look at the underside, the drawer is exposed, so it is not even suitable for underneath storage. There is only one small drawer where there is ample space for two large drawers. The drawer is only held on by one dowel. One of the supports for the top was stripped, so I cannot secure it. Also, the top is supposed to be reversible but the underneath is just a rough unfinished section. I would not buy recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great activity table","review":"I purchased this table for my 2 year old to be able to put his train set on. This table is great. Its a lot bigger than most of the other tables that you are able to purchase. The reason why I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because one of the bolts I received would not screw in properly and could not get a portion tight enough. The table is still functionable, but spending a $100 on table you would expect all the pieces to fit right! Its a great table and if you are looking for a activity table that is a good size for what ever your kids want to use it for this is a great choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent table but not durable","review":"We got this table for our 2 year-old, although our 3-year old uses it as well. It was easy to put together and looks nice. I would recommend using something like glue to keep the top down as it is not secured and may flip if a child climbs on it. Also, the materials are weak. I tried to slide the table over to vacuum and the bolts broke through the side of one of the supporting panels. I was kind of shocked as I had never had any issues with Melissa and Doug products before and the table seemed strong, but this is a cheap train table and you can't expect too much. On the plus side M&D customer service was great and agreed to send a replacement panel. Still, I don't expect this table to survive long."},{"rating":"2","title":"seems durable","review":"The price was lower than most. Easy to put together, seems durable, my son likes it.

We prefer KidKraft products but their activity table did not meet our requirements. We have other Melissa & Doug products and were expecting something better. The table is rickety (no cross bracing) and some of the hardware to put it together was machined incorrectly. One of the wood pieces had a huge knot in it which compromises the integrity of the piece. Their quality control was lacking. That said, for $100, I guess you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Construction Experience","review":"My husband spent over two hours assembling the table. At one point, finding no less than two pieces or hardware damaged beyond use, he took out his screw gun to assemble the pieces with his own hardware.

The table arrived on time as quoted. However, the box was damaged and it was apparent that it had already been opened prior to us recieving it. Once we opened the box and prepared to assemble the table, we found - 1) the first page of the instructions were missing and 2) the instructions that came with the table had been crumpled up and shoved in the box 3) one corner of the table has some damage to it, 4) inside near the drawer there was was a gouge in the wood and 5)the green part of the floor of the table had obviously been repainted with a different shade of green and whom ever did the painting did a very poor job. If you are thinking of ordering this product, order well ahead of time and inspect the product before assembly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Train table","review":"Love it!

Unfortunately, I have no use for the table now as the purpose was to have a Legos table. I could have added the base plates to an ordinary table that I had an saved myself $100. Those base plates are $14.99 EACH for a 14x14 square. It would take a minimum of like six of those. I should have obviously paid closer attention. I also thoguht there was some sort of bottom underneath of the green. They lift up and there is just a small drawer. Otherwise the Legos would fall to the ground. Too bad its already put together.

I was thoroughly impressed by the amount of research and experience that stands behind this book. Instead of providing a few nice anecdotal cases about customer-centricity or customer loyalty, this book provides a comprehensive view of how technology is changing sales and marketing practices throughout an organization and across all brands.

Consequently even though it sucks up some things it blows dust,cat hair, etc., all around such that as soon as you've vacuumed something it's still dirty.

I have never seen dust spin up into the air before. No matter how hard you try to get it, it flys away from you- crappy design. Seriously, what moron designed this vacuum and who's the moron's friend that allowed it to be manufacturered? Third- the thing is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO loud and it shudders when you turn it on. Finally- the cord gets hot after less than 5 minutes of use.Oh, I guess the reason why I gave is a whopping 2 stars is because it IS light and pretty powerful."},{"rating":"1","title":"please save your money!","review":"This is been one of the most disgusting vacuums I have used. Sure, the suction is okay, but the front of the vacuum blows air, so whatever you are trying to vacuum up, gets blown around by the air first so it takes double the time to get it. Secondly, since there is no bag, you physically have to lift the filter out (with all the dirt and dust bunnies attached) and shake it out in your garbage can. As you are doing that, all the fine dust and dirt filters up out of the can and litters the floor so you can vacuum it up all over again, not to mention all the dirt that gets on your hands from having to shake out the dirt. I would NEVER buy this product again. Maybe the one with the bag is better, but I'm through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Vacuum EVER!!!","review":"This is the 2nd Dirt Devil I've gone through in under a year. Like all of the other reviewers state, this vacuum spits dust and debris into the air while you vacuum.While vacuuming with this machine you will be standing in a dust cloud in your house sneezing up a storm from all of the dust and allergens.Then, after vacuuming, you have to go around and wipe down all of your tables and everything else with a feather duster because this vacuum simply transfers the dirt from your carpet into the air.I can't believe this thing actually made it to market!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is our second dirt devil. The first one gave us a few good years of solid service, so when it finally gave up, we didn't hesitate buying another dirt devil. This was a mistake! As other reviewers point out here, this vacuum literally makes your cleaning job harder. It blows crumbs and dust around in front of the vacuum BEFORE they can be vacuumed up. It COMPLETELY defeats the purpose for which it is intended. We returned ours after a few days of pulling our hair out and bought a more expensive model. Avoid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I hate this sweeper.It's heavy.It doesn't pick up well.It won't stand upright anymore (cheap pedal design).The filter gets hopelessly clogged with dirt.Don't waste your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"blows too well","review":"I have to echo the comments of others this vacuum has its exhaust right in front down low so it really would work better as a leaf blower as the exhaust pushes everything out of the way before you can get close enough to get it....I have never seen such a poor mechanical design as this ...and am totally perplexed as to how this ever got into production and out the door ...dirt devil should be ashamed of themselves, I will make it a point to tell others about there poor design and function...good luck dirt devil your days are declining"},{"rating":"1","title":"Marginal performance - a pain to clean","review":"After 20 or so vacuum sessions, I had to remove the cover plate (which involves unscrewing 4 screws w/ a Phillips screwdriver) and spend a half-hour with haircutting scissors snipping my daughter's hairs off the brushroll so it wouldn't smolder when running the vacuum.I'm not terribly mechanically inclined so I had to search by model number in Dirt Devil's website to find the PDF manual.It picked up dirt a little better after that & the burning smell went away but I still sneeezed at all the dirt it spit back out in the living room.I've been eyeing a new Kirby Sentria on ebay for around $600, a 1/3 the price the salesman was asking.Save your money and get something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubber band wears out too fast.","review":"It does a great job of vacuuming. My only complaint about this vacuum is that, after a few months, the rubber band that connects the spinning brush rollers (for use on carpets) on the bottom of the vacuum to the motor gets very hot and starts to burn and melt and eventually just break. After replacing it for the first time, it wore out even faster. After replacing it about 3 times, it will now only vacuum a few sessions before breaking. If you own this vacuum and smell a burning odor while vacuuming, that's the rubber band overheating and melting. Five stars for doing a great job of sucking up dirt and dust, don't get me wrong, but as far as durability goes, it's terrible. Spend a little more on a vacuum that won't wear out so fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"As I'm writing this, I can still see the cloud of dust spat by this vacuum into my kitchen. This vacuum is absolutely useless: like the other reviewers said, it sucks dust up, only to spit it back out in front of you. If I'd known such backwardly designed vacuums actually existed, I would have done some research before I bought this thing on Craigslist."},{"rating":"1","title":"eats belts sized 4/5 from target","review":"Maybe there is some defect with my particular vacuum. The part which connects to the motor and spins the belt gets so hot that the second belt I put in burnt up much, much faster than the first, as the metal part was already hot.Maybe it was the belt I purchased from the Target which said it was \\"custom made\\" for 4/5 sized belts.Anyways. I think the vacuum is light nad powerful, but otherwise not particularly worth the investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy and useless","review":"This left clumps of dust all over my carpet. Seemed to suck it up, then to promptly spit it out. And need to wear earplugs while using this thing - it's truly the loudest home appliance I own (yes, even worse than my blender)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Exhaust Fan Blows Dirt Up Before You Can Suck It Up!!","review":"This vacuum is ridiculous. I don't understand how anyone could have designed such a vacuum in the way that the fan blows in front down towards the area you're trying to clean. So instead of reaching any dirt to suck up, it just gets blown up into the air. I guess you could say this vacuum blows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Belt Design","review":"I purchased this vacuum when it was on sale at Target a couple of years ago. Initially, it worked well. About 6 months into using it, I noticed a burnt rubber smell as I would vacuum my floors. I removed its bottom plate and found that the vacuum belt would rub against part of its plastic wall as the belt rotated (hence the friction -- burning smell). So I shifted the belt slightly away from either wall, but I knew this problem would return within a few more vacuum sessions. Anyway, one of my roommates used the vacuum, and the belt tore apart. So I either need to buy a new belt or a new vacuum.I noticed no one else has mentioned this defect, maybe Dirt Devil has changed their design. Regardless, my next vacuum purchase will be a Hoover."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Vong story continues...","review":"As with other books in this series, the action is fast paced while still maintaining a depth of character and sense of humour. I couldn't put it down, and wish they could release them much faster (but then the quality might suffer). Aaron writes well, and even managed to give some well loved SW characters an extra dimension. Jaina plays a major role in this story, and although I miss Anakin, she is becoming a favourite character of mine, mostly because of her unpredictability (although Jag may disagree). You will need to read the previous 10 books before this one as there are too many story lines underway, but the series is so good, this won't matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"after so so njo books, this one delivers","review":"After a horribly written Dark Journey, NJO comes back with full force in Aaron Allston's Rebel Dream. In the past, it seems that the Vong always had the upper hand.. more intelligence, more cunning. For the first time in a long time, it seems that the New Republic has finally got its act together. This book introduces some incredible plot twists that are sure to develop over future books and will be reminiscent of the good old days where the good guys were just a band of hopeful rebels. This is definately one of the better books in the series and definately a worthwhile read for NJO fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better books of the series","review":"I must say that this is certainly one of the better books of the series. It's no Star by Star, but it is certainly one of my top 5 favourites of the series.The space action is very well written [as is expected from Allston], and there is some of Allston's traditional humour, although not the same kind as in his X-Wing novels.I wouldn't say it is necessary to read this duology, but I do not know anything about future NJO books, so it is probably best to read it. [It is probably best to read every one.] Overall it is a fast-paced, exciting novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"surprisingly bad","review":"In all honesty, I have not finished reading this book. I will finish it, and I will finish it quickly. I doubt I will have any problems with the story itself, but it is an excruciating read. It is so poorly written that I am constantly distracted. I just want to call Del Rey and ask to speak to the person who edited this book. I suspect no such person exists. It reads like a poor translation into English from some other language. Maybe Allston wrote it in Latin and took it over to his local highschool to have it translated. It makes me angry because the fans deserve better. Because it is so badly written, I have to say it's the worst Star Wars novel I've read to date, and I've read around 40. Don't read it if you don't have to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Step in the Right Direction","review":"REBEL DREAM is a step in the right direction. After so many depressing, dark, dreary, violent NJO books, REBEL DREAM was a welcome relief. While things are still extremely bleak in that galaxy, there is finally a more hopeful feel to this book, and there is even a little humor.I was glad to see more of Luke, Wedge, and Lando. Luke Skywalker has been badly mangled in the New Jedi Order series. REBEL DREAM is the first book since VECTOR PRIME in which Luke was written in-character. It was great to finally see him more active, involved, and having visions again. I'd like to see more of the Jedi Master in the future and more of Han and Leia and Mara too. The books have been leaning heavily in the direction of the younger characters up to this point, and frankly, I prefer the Original Trilogy characters to the teenagers.I like the idea of the Insiders and the New Rebel Alliance. Can't wait for REBEL STAND!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rebel Ways","review":"Finally a book that gave some level of hope, i really liked this book, Aaron Allston did a great job. Everything came together quite nicely. About time we start seeing a real reaction to the problem! i can't wait for book-12 this guy was really funny exactly what's needed for those still recovering from the effects of star by star and the loss of mostly everyones favourite charater. Alot of good ideas came out in this book, keep up the good work man!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"Rebel Dream is a vast improvement over what has been offered recently to Star Wars fans. This book is fast paced, good character development, interesting story line - and no major characters were killed off. Aaron Allston delivered the story with his usual flair for humor, action, emotion. Keep it up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairly good","review":"I read most of the New Jedi Order books. Started skipping around for awhile because I got disappointed. This one doesn't disappoint however. The plot is good and I finally fell back in love with the characters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Video introduction to Costa Rica with interesting families, gorgeous scenery","review":"I enjoyed watching this video with Spanish-language students as well as with adult ESL learners I'm tutoring. As with the other videos in the *Families of the World* video series, two video clips are available on YouTube from each half of this video. Check out \\"Families of Costa Rica (Families of the World) Rural Trailer\\" and \\"Urban Trailer.\\"The two kids profiled in *Families of Costa Rica,* Estibaliz and José, are engaging, and the scenery shot in the diverse habitats of their country is just breathtaking. Even the kids got caught up in what a beautiful place this girl and boy live in.I'd recommend this video highly to teachers and tutors of ESL students, elementary- and middle-school Spanish language teachers, teachers of social studies and geography, librarians, and to families who want a fun way to introduce their kids to life in a different culture.

However, I think that the quality of the recordings has really reached its peak with zappa's own choices (and as far as live recordings are concerned, with the late live albums and former scarce inclusions on studio ones). Therefore, it's maybe unfortunately pointless to look for another perfect version of one tune or the other. But to the \\"hard-core\\" fanatic, this recording might be of a greater significance than, for instance, FZ:OZ. The recording itself is better. The group is interesting in its composition and sound. The Dvd has some files (videos and recordings) which offers delightful insights into zappa's performer side.

It notes that disasembly and cleaning should be done under the supervision of a squad leader and, maybe even an officer. When I read that, I was surprised as the typical US soldier - after basic and advanced training on the M-16 - is left much more to his/her own devices.After trying to take the weapon down, I realized why that caveat was included. The few line drawings included are not detailed enough for the process to be fully understood. More so, there are also some omissions about what is involved in taking apart the gas recoil system. Having an advantage over the notional Private Yuri, I went online to obtain enough information to handle the disassembly/cleaning/assembly process.If you are unfamiliar with this weapon, you need to find something more comprehensive otherwise you will put youself at risk of damaging your SKS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait - this is a book? Complete Rip-Off","review":"Well, for the price, I can safely say this is a complete waste of money. I've bought hard cover autobiographies on Amazon for less. The 'book' is the size of a CD booklet, with 160 'pages'. This book was rated because of all the photos included, but who wants to see pictures in a 'book'that small? I'm sorry I took it out of the package because of curiousity. I should have read the reviews in more detail. In addition to all the pictures, the actual words are written so big that I wondered if it was meant for 10 year olds. I'm sure if this was converted to the size of a real book, there wouldnt even be 30 full pages.

Surprise - 97+-1 degree all the time, mostly 97.1 rectal. Baby hated the procedure. Under arms (you can use it that way per the manual - 96. It was about 11 pm, baby was crying, our idea was she is cold. Tried under arms on myself and got 95.9.

This one seems to work well. Our only complaint is that when you wash it off, it's easy to get water in the battery compartment or in the LCD display which causes the thermometer to stop working. This has happened twice now but thankfully it starts working again after drying out. I wish they had made it totally waterproof since it's easy to get water inside.

As Murphy's Law would have it, it was when we were on vacation and our son was running a fever. We got an error code. I called the customer service line to find out the error code meant \\"internal error\\" AKA permanently broken. I could have mailed it in for a replacement however it is still sitting on my desk. Maybe one of these days I'll actually get it mailed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave false readings- maybe we got a dud?","review":"We bought this thermometer for the good reviews. Then one night, we had called our pediatrician's office since our baby's temp was registering lower than 96 degrees with this. We checked rectally 3 times and under his arm with this to be sure we were getting an accurate reading- all were below 96 degrees, prompting our Dr to advise us to take the baby to the emergency room immediately. Once there, they checked his temp and it was completely normal at 97.5 degrees. They said our thermometer was probably a dud and to try a new one. Had this worked properly, we could've avoided the incredible stress and frustration we experienced with false readings. Maybe we just got a dud, so if you buy this then please be sure you have another thermometer as back-up to double-check any worrisome readings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after 4 months","review":"It died after four months, used it probably 10 times, such a shame, not worth the price.

After using it, I agree! It was smooth and easy. Note that the manual says not to use a lubricant like vasoline with it. They recommend a water based lube to facilitate insertion. I ended up using astroglide which seemed a little counter intuitive but I had it and it worked fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not accurate","review":"We have had this thermometer for more than a year. It has consistently read very low and we sort of have to guess if the baby has a fever or not based on if it is higher than it usually reads (about 95).

To its credit, it is very easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"battery case sucks","review":"I was really excited to use this after all the glowing reviews I read. First try, with baby feverish -- major failure. First, the batteries were dead after less than a month with only one quick test use. Maybe my fault. But still -- I go to change the battery and I can't get the little blue cover off. I used a nickel, I used a flathead screwdriver, a quarter, etc ..... After many tried the cover got stuck in a half-open position and was JAMMED for good. There was no way to get it of this little plastic piece of crap. Why is everything made of cheap plastic these days?!

We were initially against the 'rectal' route, but that was mostly based on old prejudices against really long, really slow older models (that we grew up with).This thermometer has a very short probe (no worries about going too far), and he has yet to even notice what we're doing. And it reads in 10 seconds or less, which is great because you're trying to get a temperature when he's screaming and crying. The armpit model we used before took up to 60 seconds, which is an eternity when he's thrashing and you're trying to hold the probe under his (thrashing) arm.All in all, works fantastic, it's pretty cheap, and we don't have to dread getting a temp!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great rectal probe...that's it!","review":"If your doctor suggests using the thermometer as a probe to help your baby pass stool, then this is a great product for you. But if you want a thermometer that you can actually wash after sticking it in your child's rectum, then save your money. After ONE use, we rinsed this off (didn't even submerge), and the display is broken and appears to have liquid in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"can't say enough good things about this thermometer","review":"i love this thermometer - it's small, accurate, fast and safe - there's no way you can insert it too far. it's a perfect product as far as i'm concerned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work when opened","review":"This product did not work when I opened it. I called the customer service # on the back for a \\"lifetime warranty\\" replacement and they said I needed to buy a new battery. I just opened the packaging brand new. That is terrible customer service.

We've used it a couple times, and it was very easy and quick to use. On October 12th, we tried to use it and received an error message (\\"Err\\") instead of a temperature. Tried turning it on and off, even removing and then replacing the battery to reset it; no luck.

But the thermometer's display stopped to work after probably the 10th use when my son fell sick after another RSV episode at day care. When you have a crying, sick baby and your only rectal thermometer broke, life became a challenge., I had a difficult time to use my auxiliary thermometer to take his temp. It was not as accurate, and doctors do not like any reading other than the ones from rectal ones. So I was kinda suck. I have been careful in cleaning the tip, and really have no idea why it broke. I wonder if I should get another one because I do like the ease of use of this device. But ... Maybe I should look for another baby rectl thermometer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped giving accurate readings.","review":"I'm not sure how the reviews for this product are as good as they are. It worked fine for a few months but then stopped giving accurate reviews. 92 degrees? I don't think so. We are on our third one and they have all failed in this manner.

I find this unsafe and dangerous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, non-Japanese Knock-off.","review":"This is a cheap knockoff of a Japanese Hotpot. Mine arrived in poor packaging -- the kind that Chinese imports are using, not well packaged like the Japanese products. The hotplate was warped and had cracked in half and the lid was to small and would not stay in place. The reason that the lid did not fit and the hotplate broke was the same. The wood was cheap and improperly cured. Shame... I'll be buying the clay pot from Kotobuki Trading. They are a Japanese company that sells Japanese products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half 'n' half","review":"Polly Bergen's output is starting to come out on CD, thanks to the Collectables label. She is an exceptional song stylist, so I considered each new CD released an automatic buy -- until now.I like the fact that companies like Collectables are squeezing two albums onto one CD, but in cases like this, it's a mistake.The first half, the Polly and Her Pop album, sounds entirely -- and I do mean entirely -- different from the second half. This album is almost unlistenable, in my book. It's badly arranged pseudo-country and should have been left in the vaults. As it is, Bergen's father is really the main vocalist on these songs and she's essentially a background vocal, and that's not a recommendation.The second half is much like the Polly Bergen you'll hear in the other two-album CD sets by Collectables, and that means she's great. But it's not enough. I'd recommend buying the other two Collectables sets and skipping this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dynamic sumo","review":"Dynamic sumo is a pleasant book to read. It is a well-written introduction to the different aspects of sumo. It is a source for beginners and also for people with intermediate knowledge.The history-section is especially good. The author has chosen essential parts of sumo\`s history and spices it up with snippets of some spesific events. The descriptions of 20th century great wrestlers\` careers is also included.The photographs and drawings are high class. Photos of bouts catch the strength and skill of the wrestlers in crucial moments and some of the photos can be considered real masterpieces both in timing and angle. The written explantions are accompanied with graphical illustrations which makes it easy to follow the text.In a nutshell Dynamic sumo is a very good book with interesting facts, good layout, excellent graphics and an ability to make one hungry for further information over the great sport of sumo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed in 6 months","review":"I gave it 5 stars in my initial review, but have to downgrade it to 1...

The quality of the pictures leaves a lot to be desired with respect to clear/sharp focus, white balance and noise levels.Indoor photos are especially noisy and this becomes evident any time you try to print sizes over 5X7\\" (not too big).I have seen lots of prints from Canon S400 cameras that beat the crap out of this Coolpix.

I really don't like change, so I looked for another Nikon with which I could use my rechargeable ion batteries and SD card. I chose the Nikon 5200. Bad choice. Maybe I just got a lemon? Not sure, but what I do know is that this camera takes the worst pictures. Practically impossible to get a clear, focused picture inside, and when I do get a picture that is technically focused, it just isn't very sharp. I recently took it on a beach vacation and got all my pictures back with an aura around the white things in the pictures (hair bow, sunhat, etc.). Let's see... bad inside, bad outside. Verdict?

After using Canon's for years, this camera took great picutres, when they weren't blurry or over/under exposed. There are too many settings that change the white balance, etc. that made shooting quick photos a pain. Movies worked well until you played them back (only in quick time), but were choppy and crackly. Recycling between pictures took forever, so you missed a lot of shots. The red-eye-reducer did not work at all. I fiddled with it until I had enough. I returned it and got a Canon SD300.

I don't use them anymore because they are just too long. Besides being hundreds of pages too long, there is a lot of non-essential material you have to wade through. My game plan for all the exams I have taken has been to first study Sybex, then take some practice tests, then two days before the exam, use my notes and up until recently, Exam Cram to cram for the exam. But now I use O'Rielly's MCSE Core (or Electives) in a Nutshell because it is so concise. Exam Cram books, most of which are over 400 pages, are just too lengthy to be used for last minute cram sessions.

The plot is not only believable (could have happened) but vividly shows the intrigues,machinations,the single minded quest for power and the lack of morals during 1554.Pippa ,being caught in the heinous plot of Mary and Philip, shows us that an intelligent and brave woman can overcome anything. Having a man like Lionel Ashton to lean on increases the odds of winning.I love the twist in the plot.The escapades of the secondary characters, Luisa and Robin, gave the story a light hearted touch. The life of a Spanish lady is no fun at all and I'm not surprised at the lengths a teenager(Luisa) has to go to have some fun.This is a truly an enjoyable book and one I expect from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane Feather Can Do NO wrong!","review":"You have probably read the synopsis already. I won't go into whether the subject matter is wrong or not. Jane Feather has written again an intriguing plot filled with unforgettable characters. Her eloquence (and elegance) of language has taken on new meaning if history is your interest. Her hero, Lionel Ashton, is a duplicate of Hugh from \\"The Widow's Kiss\\". Pippa remains the same, only stronger and more intelligent. This was a no-brainer \\"buy\\" immediately and after 12 hours of straight reading, I was overwhelmed!My history lessons tell me that Queen Mary's role in this plot is not \\"right\\". Mary, the virtuous, Mary, the Pious, would not knowingly have been part of this. But that is a minor consideration since none of us read historical romances for their historical significances - do we? Nor do we read them for their \\"nicety\\" of subject matter. This was, after all, the 1500's in England. Don't skip this story. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exploitation as Romance? Yuck!","review":"This book sickened me. How on earth Jane Feather can expect us to accept the relationship between Phillippa and Lionel, even after Phillippa realizes that Lionel was the one taking her (drugged and helpless) to and from the king each and every time she was raped, I just can't comprehend. If there had been some kind of satisfactory repentance on Lionel's part, some kind of show of self-loathing at what he had done, maybe I could have accepted the \\"love\\" story. But as it is, no way. Phillippa deserved better than that, and the author threw her away. A disgusting story by an author whom I expected better from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing and truly unromantic plot . . .","review":"While I generally enjoy Jane Feather's books, I was deeply disturbed by the premise of the novel. The \\"hero\\" facilitates the sexual assault of the heroine, and while it is supposedly distasteful to him, his discomfort did not stop him from repeatedly aiding rape. That is NOT romantic. The heroine forgives him fairly easily, and after two other books featuring this character I had truly wanted better for her. NOT well done, Ms. Feather. Not well done at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Jane Feather is a talented author who likes to tackle new and challenging ideas in her books. Sadly, this one just doesn't work for me. The hero is the biggest problem. Not only did he facilitate the heroine's rape, he also chose to keep her in the dark when the two of them were already engaged in an affair. Character development was insufficient, I just can't indentify with the hero's so called tormented past and his reasons for taking part in that hideous plot. The heroine doesn't fare any better either. I don't find myself sympathise with her despite the fact that she was a victim and can't understand why she chose to forgive him. The complete lack of chemistry and the big \\"ick\\" factor totally put me off."},{"rating":"1","title":"repellent and plodding","review":"What an awful book. I was hoping there might be some other explanation for what was going on, like that Lionel had some sort of guilt about making love to her etc. but how this passes for a romance is beyond me. No hero would ever allow his wife to be treated so. Rape is rape.How she could then fall in love with him is ridiculous. What happened to the lovely little intelligent girl in love with Robin her step-brother in the first book in the series?Grim and plodding, lots of slow bits. Tries to be sensational but the love scenes are all so flat and she frequently repeats herself. I want a book about the magic of falling in love, even with obstacles, not the bitter cynicism of the 'heroes' she has been producing in her last few books."},{"rating":"1","title":"The premise made my stomach turn.","review":"I could not finish this book. The premise that a heroine would fall in love with someone who arranged for her rape is more that I can bear. I love to read romance novels but the couple in this book turn my stomach. I quit after 5 chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my idea of a romance novel.","review":"... While Ms. Feather is a good writer, I DID NOT like the premise of this story. The book begins with a vile act being committed on the heroine, and the \\"romance\\" is built on that. What was done to Pippa was disgusting. I didn't like the fact that Pippa and Lionel (who was involved in the rapes) were not even attracted to each other until this happened. I call that perverted. The secondary story about Robin and Luisa that was thrown in, I suppose for comic relief, did not work for me. I didn't even like the ending. It was totally unbelievable that Pippa and Lionel could live happily ever after with the consequences of this plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Bought This As A Replacement Cord","review":"I bought this as a generic replacement cord for a deep fryer that the cord accidentally got thrown away. It was long enough & it works, so I cannot complain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth contemplating","review":"This book is written by an MIT physicist who seems to be an evangelical or non-denominational. He goes through some fascinating aspects of the bible and science. For example, he explains how time is relative to where you are and that there is a certain way to look at the days of creation so that they last 15 billion years from one POV and 6 days from another. It doesn't seem contrived, and it is very interesting. He also discusses quantum mechanics and a scientific argument against determinism. This is definitely a great read for those who are interested in the question of science vs. religion."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a GREAT book","review":"Not enough time to write a lengthy review. But, this is an AMAZING book. Dr. Schroeder has a wonderful writing style. There is no doubt Dr. Schroeder is a knowledgeable, thoughtful and sincere man. He discusses complex issues and yet does so in a way that is accessible to most anybody. It's remarkable how, in one short book, he is able to cover such a wide array of issues and still he does a great job of being thorough and clear on most every topic. I'd already bought his other 3 books and have started on another. All in all this was/is a VERY pleasurable, enlightening and thought provoking read!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it says!","review":"This book claims that it can converge biblical and scientific wisdom about our universe.And it does! Using only widely accepted peer reviewed sources and early theologians he makes the link. No longer are scientists and people of faith at odds.Highly recommend for those people who love science whether or not they believe in a God or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the beginning God created....","review":"In the beginning God created.... Everything after that is arguing about how. Science is the theology of our discovering God's methods and laws. The Bible was written by men inspired by God's presence in terms of their understanding at a time in history. We've moved deeper in that understanding, but God continues in the center of it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Science","review":"Instead of testing deduced hypotheses against data, the author looked for patterns in the infinite mess of reality that sort of fit the template provided by the Bible. Maybe I missed something, but this isn't satisfactory in science. The book is still fun to read, in the same way that it's fun to read horoscopes."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can only say it in Yiddish","review":"Oy vay!(If you don't speak yiddish it's a short way of saying \\"cut the crap because it hurts my head\\".)I have rarely seen a more ridiculous example of sophistry and naarishkeit... sorry there I go again. It's worth reading as an example of how not to think. Combines junk science and terrible theology. I hope his Rebbe doesn't get to hear of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Science of the Goofed!","review":"The most charitable comment I can give to this book is that \\"it is a journey\\". More specifically, it is a torturing journey. The author tends to mix up very simple scientific methodology and metaphysical philosophy. Often, Gerald seems to look like an armchair philosopher and jumps to unsupported onotological conclusion. One may find plenty philosophical problems in the analysis, arguments from personal credulity and incredulity. The arguments are not even close to being convincing. I would not recommend this chauvinistic exegesis to anyone would like to 'find things out'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pseudo-scientific garbage.","review":"Another christian apologist who is not very good at science appeals to those who are not good at science either. If you really want to know the scientific position on the origins of the universe, abiogenesis, evolution, genetics, geology, do yourself a favor, and pick up books on those topics by actual scientists."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad idea to mix Science and God!","review":"This person sounds like he is no scientist at all.He is trying to mix Science and God, not a good mix!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A convincing book on the existence of a creator.","review":"Having been raised both Catholic and skeptical, I enjoyed reading this book. I was impressed with the way that Schroeder thouroughly explained his points and took into consideration the opposing arguments. I was especially intrigued by the chapter referring to the origin of life coinciding with the existence of water, and the stop/start nature of evolution. However, the part that prevents me from giving a full 5 stars is the chapter regarding free will and why \\"bad\\" things happen. Schroeder's argument for free will within certain parameters does not come as strongly as his thories for the big bang, but is interesting nontheless as it at least addresses the obvious duallity of all nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attention Skeptics!","review":"As a science-oriented person who also believes in a sole Creator with all my heart and soul, my MIND continued to struggle with the scientific \\"facts\\" that suggest the universe might actually be more than ten BILLION years old. Schroeder's book offers mind-altering scientific theories and explanations as to how and why the universe actually MUST have been created, in a non-preaching fashion that allows readers to decide for themselves based on the information presented. Thank you, Dr. Schroeder, for providing the EXACT information I have been searching for my entire life. Sum Tertius!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling,intelligentand ambitious work.","review":"Gerald Schroder has written a compelling, intelligent and ambitious work which bolsters the creationists, as opposed to literalists, side of the evolutionary debate.

The material in this book will challenge your preconceptions regardless of which direction you come from at the start. It uses scientific data and evidence to prove that they are both right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted work","review":"Dr. Schroeder's book represents a great idea and a lot of scientific research. It's masterfully done. Unfortunately, it is not biblical. His theological research is not so great. In Exodus 20:8-11 God tells us unequivocally that He is using actual 24 hour days in the Genesis creation. This is in the giving of the ten commandments. He tells us to pattern our lives on His example of a 6 day work week with the 7th day reserved for rest. A relative day just doesn't fly.Gerry"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless book","review":"The second book by G. Schroeder contains a few good passages, but also some egregious errors, which are puzzling when made by a PhD in Physics. For example, G. Schroeder completely misinterprets the experiments with particles moving through openings, invents some odd concept of heat diluting in enlarged volumes, misrepresents the story of photoelectric effect, etc . One striking feature of this book is that Schroeder suggests in it the chronological data , which completely contradict his own data on the same subject, given in his first book, without a word of explanation why he changed those data. A useless book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my Favorites","review":"I would have to place this work on my top-five list for thought provoking books. The author does an excellent job weaving modern scientific thought with ancient biblical commentary. It is done in such a way that the reader finds the connection between the two topics to be much stronger than would be shown by other contemporary views on the topic.As with other books like this, I would encourage the reader to approach with an open mind as well as a bit of skepticism. The author presents some very interesting ideas, some of which seem highly plausible and some of which are a bit far-fetched. I think the phrase \\"don't miss the forest for the trees\\" would be applicable. One could easily get wrapped up in a particular detail while missing the overarching theme."},{"rating":"2","title":"Geat book! Leaves you wanting to learn more.","review":"I this book was simply fantastic to read. The only area in which it falls short is the fact the author did not write more. After finishing the book I still wanted to learn more. It dramatically changes your prespective on life and the universe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary, original, work on science/theology","review":"Everyone interested in the chasm between science and religion should read this book. It bridges the chasm. I haven't seen its equal in twenty years of being in no-man's land: believing both Scriptural writings and scientific discoveries regarding human origins and history. Schroeder is a physicist and student of the Hebrew text. He maintains that if one takes both sides seriously and deeply, there is perfect continuity between the two at foundational levels of each. This work opened doors for me and I recommend it without reservation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but Flawed","review":"A good and refreshing read, but the quotations from Jewish sources are very selective, and in some places outright misleading. Also, sometimes sounds too patronizing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must Read for Beginners","review":"If you are searching for how to live your life as a Jew the ways are infinite though start off with Mesilat Yesharim. If you are looking to know why you should live your life as a Jew this is the book for you. Notice how people who have problems with it never really say what their issues are or do not cite reliable sources."},{"rating":"2","title":"Schroeder offers up a smorgisborg of new ideas","review":"Previously I have read a few books on Intelligent Design which present you with the Chef's menu: a full meal is picked for you: take it all or leave it all. Schroeder's work is the opposite. He's throwing out intriguing and open-ended possibilities - you pick from the buffet what suites your fancy. Nothing feels cramed down your throat. I bought 5 copies of this book to share with friends because it has given me hope. It is bridging the decades old schisms in my mind left by my voracious appetite for scientific truth and my convictions about the authority of the Bible. His work achieves its magic by stretching the beliefs held on both extremes. This book will not satisfy black and white thinkers commited to either strict Biblical literalism or abiotic evolution. It is however a wonderful read for anyone caught in the middle who is left unfulfilled by either extreme."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reframes old arguments","review":"Mr. Schroeder mentions the dinosaur problem with the Bible but doesn't go far with it, because he can't. I would think he convinces mainly those who are members of the choir who have already taken that leap of faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's got it backwards!","review":"When I first started reading this book I was very much encouraged to see his accounting for gravitational time dilation. Then I realized he got it backward. A clock ticks slower in a gravitational field, so time on earth is 24 hours and ticking of a clock at the edge of an expanding universe is much much faster, billions of years. The author is a Day Ager. This theory is in error both theologically and scientifically. The days of Genesis are not long ages of time, they are 24hrs of earth time. How could someone of such intelligence and learning get it backward and be so confusing on this subject?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Outside of the Norm","review":"This book is surprisingly different than most other creation/evolution books I have read, as, instead of arguing for one or the other, Schroeder actually gives a case for both theories. His topics range from using quantum mechanics to mold the scientific dates and the Genesis dates of the Bible to the same frame of reference.By far the best part of this work is when Schroeder presents his theory that Adam and Eve weren't necessarily the first of their kind, only the first to actually become human beings, in the sense that we are today.The reason I give four stars (would be four and a half)is because the book begins to lag down prematurely, as the final chapters begin to cut away from the main theme of the novel. However, the appendices are quite interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dem bones, dem bones....","review":"Books like this are, and should be, fun. And it is! But...taking empirical data and misinterpreting and misapplying, leaving out critical factual items, and generally filtering it through a major religious philiosphy will achieve the desired results for any author. Perhaps we are really beginning to get the picture that mixing faith and science makes a poor cocktail. If other reviewers have decided that this book will change their lives, then so be it. I felt the same way after my first Spenser P.I. novel. Well, maybe not completely. Dr. Schroeder should be commended on a \\"good try.\\" If he had written a similar tome 100 years ago with the then current level of knowledge, we would be all having a good hoot at his expense. I don't think it will take another 100 to dissolve much of the author's conclusions. \\"Abraham born in 1948\\"....actually a very appropriate way to start the book. Now....where's that copy of \\"Chariots of the Gods\\"? ! That was fun too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interpreting the Bible so that it fits science","review":"This book is full of a lot of great scientific information, however the author's real purpose is to fudge both science and the Bible so that it appears they are one in the same. The author says in the first chapter that he will not try to fudge the Bible so it fits with science yet that's all he does throughout the entire book. His connections are unlikely to convince the average intelligent reader. But don't take my word for it, if you chose to read this book then try this: After every conclusion he makes about the Bible and Science ask yourself 'Does this evidence support the idea that the Bible is true, or is it merely a way of reading the Bible so that it loosely fits scientific fact'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun football","review":"Excellent magazine with in-depth interviews and news coverage not easily-available here in the U.S. At times it pokes fun at the games stars, management, officials, and even its fans, yet it also is not afraid to tackle important issues in the game.

If you don't follow the Premier League or the other British leagues, this may not be the magazine for you, but if you do, it's simply the best. Unlike many other football magazines, it goes into quite some depth with some excellent feature articles that are long, substantial, and well written. It's generally an intelligent magazine, and now that the world cup is fast approaching in 2010, we've renewed our subscription so that we can stay in touch. The internet is a great resource for football information if you're stuck in the US like we are (we do watch Setanta and FSC, too) but there's something about getting and reading a magazine that the internet cannot quite replace.

It is very corporate and flashy but the columns, letters, and monstrous close-up photos give it a lot of personality. The information is sometimes a bit dodgy. If the cover says a manager has professed his love for his team, by the time the magazine has hit the stands, said manager has been paid off and sent off. And in the \\"Boy's a bit special\\" section, I've been reading 442 for 9 years and a tiny handful of those players make it to the premiership.Their best material is their surveys.

It has all of the \\"basic\\" recipes, but frequently with a little twist that makes it more interesting. An example is the boeuf burgenion (pardon my French spelling!!!) which is a pretty straight-forward recipe, well-organized and easy to follow and with delicious results."},{"rating":"2","title":"My most \\"well loved\\" cook book and its now tattered pages","review":"My sister had bought me this book years ago, well before my cooking skills were good enough for all the recipes therein. But it is a great book to grow into for the budding chef - gives back ground on buying, storing, basic cooking techniques, what to have in your pantry and cupboards. Over time, my skills have greatly improved, my library of cookery books expanded considerably, but I still often come back to this book. My binding now well work and pages well thumbed, but can't bring myself to part with it or buy another version (and lose all my margin notes and comments!) But alas, I may have to!While every recipe I've made has been delicious, I especially love the desserts - Almond Sour Cream cheesecake, Chocolate Rasberry cake a la Simca, Baby Brownies... Always crowd pleasers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The NEW Basics is Informative and Inspirational","review":"As much a revolution in American cooking as Julia Childs' first cookbook, this book is full of useful charts such as types of fish, their texture, flavor and substitutes. This is invaluable information given the limited selection of fresh fish at most grocery stores! And apples, who else will tell you which apple to use for pies, sauce, or salad? It is NOT Betty Crocker or Joy of Cooking, nor does it try to be. You won't necessarily find all those old favorite recipes, but some old faves with a new twist, like the apple of her eye pie - Without a doubt the best I have ever made. This book encourages the use of fresh ingredients and does not offer shortcuts with mixes or soup cans, and this is a much healthier way to eat, not to mention delicious!! If you are a microwave mom, this may not be for you, but I encourage you to give it a read and try some things on a Saturday night... you may eventually find yourself eating better all week long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"I'm a fairly proficient cook.

A disappointment","review":"These women must not cook dinner often. If they do, they must have amazing gourmet kitchens. This book has some great recipies if you want to impress someone, and I love the sections that give you menu and snack ideas (how to serve this cheese with that fruit, etc.)....but what's with all the long ingredient lists and obscure ingredients?? This book is not practical for everyday use. The lemon cookie recipie didn't work, and I've heard that other recipies were wrong, so I don't tend to use this book for actual cooking, just for ideas. It looked like a great book but overall was a letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAN'T PUT MY FINGER ON IT","review":"I love to cook, and go beyond the basics in what I prepare, ingredients used, and amount of time involved. I often start from scratch and acutally enjoy the time spent in the kitchen...so why is it I can find the energy, time or interest in making ANYTHING in this cookbook? I have owned it a year and a half, and have yet been moved enough to try more than 1 recipe. I often find a version I like better from more tried and true sources like my Bon Appetit or Gourmet magazines. This cookbook is just \\"too much\\". The one recipe I made for stuffed artichokes failed me and I don't seem to be too intersted in using it again. I can't figure out why such a popular book is so unapealling to me, but I would happily give this away if the chance arose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I loved this movie and the acting, my only problem is tha Amazon tells us the movie is in English and it's not.

Customer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"magnificent surprise","review":"I took a real chance on buying this dvd, but my gambling had a great payoff. This is a much better retelling of the opera Carmen than the more famous Carmen Jones. It combines the classic Bizet story and music with South African locale and customs. Carmen herself is quite a big woman, but she exudes sexual appeal and charm. It is one of the best opera dvds around and for such a bargain price!!

I think I only paid $14 and I see now it is listed at $21 so you might want to check on that. I also might recommend buying a backpack style bag. I carried this thing around for two weeks with a couple masks, snorkels, fins, dive logs, etc and a backpack style would of been worth a few extra bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product not as described, you get what you pay for","review":"According to the product description \\"Users will also dig the inside dry pocket, which protects everything from a change of clothes to important valuables as water sloshes about.\\" Unfortunately, no such pocket exists. Also, bag is too small to realisitically fit all dive gear. you probably need something larger. D rings are plastic and seem like they will eventually break if you tried to carry all of your gear as they are not very well made. otherwise bag seems sturdy and as described."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, sturdy bag, no pocket","review":"This is a great bag with plenty of room for two sets of snorkel gear. Just disappointed that it doesn't have the inside dry pocket, as mentioned"},{"rating":"1","title":"Serviceable Bag","review":"Just received bag and haven't yet put it to heavy duty use. Preliminary comments:1) Construction seems sturdy enough. Easily holds fins (large), masks and snorkels for two.2) No dry pocket despite statement in ad. As one reviewer put it - you get what you see in the ad picture. Someone really should correct the advertising however.Update:Just purchased another bag -- and it's not the U.S, Divers bag. Decided that the dry pocket offered with Brand X was worth another 10$."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Advertised","review":"The bag is serviceable but not what I expected.

WATCH IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairly dull","review":"This book was just not interesting. All the human characters were men. It was hard to tell them apart. They formed no personal relationships. They didn't even have names but were referred to by their jobs.Their discoveries on a strange planet were also not interesting. One could hardly make any sense of them. When the men finally learn what the planet is all about, that, too, is disappointing and not interesting.The only reason I give this book two stars instead of one is that the writing wasn't terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just an OK book.","review":"I really couldn't get caught up in the story. It did make the case that alien species will probably not be anything like mankind and men will not be able to make any judgements of them based on there previous experiences.

I did finish the book, but came away feeling glad that I was done."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRY","review":"it was impossible to like or even care about any of the earth men in this story.. not a single character with even a hint of a personality I found myself disliking them but not in a personal way....totally uncaring( they kill other beings with no thought at all as to whether they are intelligent or even hostile, one of the first things they do after getting out of their craft is kill a small thing animal? person? so they can examine it ( it was just sitting there and showed no sign of fear so they killed it) sheesh ! self centered egotistical and yet technologically imbecilic, even in 1991 the idea of books in some form besides printed on paper was not unheard of, they also did not seem to be very intelligent, having little imagination. I was very disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor version of Fiasco","review":"This book (I believe) is one of Lem's earlier stories and it reads like so-so pulp sci-fi. Fiasco (a true 5 star science fiction novel) picks up the idea of contacting a new world and does it so much better. I suggest reading this only if you are a Lem completist (I've read all of his stuff except 2 books)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.","review":"I finished it. I don't know why. I guess I wanted to be able to see if it would get better. It didn't. Maybe I wanted to see if it would have a good ending. It didn't. I can't comment on any other LEM written books because this is the only one I've read, but based on my experience with this particular book, I doubt that I'll venture down this path again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic.","review":"This fluent presentation of an utterly incomprehensible world represents a masterstroke of classic sci-fi. Eden was a breeze to read through, and the journey of the ship's crew after crashing on the eponymous planet as they struggle to quantify their experiences in relatable terms, and with the moral quandaries borne of their interactions with Eden's civilization was fascinating. There is a pertinent allegory too, on the nature of social control, that will leave you thinking over this book long after you've finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eden","review":"I found the landscape characterizarions hard to follow but I suppose that is the otherworldliness that is trying to be conveyed. Lots of questions posed to the reader by the characters but the tale is interesting enough to keep going."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most brilliant books I've ever read","review":"\\"How to Be Well-Versed in Poetry\\" is difficult to define. While mostly humorous, in some ways it could be educational. It is definitely not a book to attempt with no knowledge of poetry, but some of the amusing poems on structure, meter, and technique can help to make the ideas more concrete. If you are a fan of the classics, you'll find it difficult to read without laughing out loud. \\"The Ravens Reply to Poe\\" and the abridged \\"Paradise Lost\\" (12 lines) are hysterical.A friend recently completed his degree in English Literature, and I thought this would be the perfect book to give as a gift. Unfortunately, it is out of print and hard to find. In the process of looking for it, I have found a number of others who would like a copy. If you are the publisher, PLEASE reprint this book! If you are a reader, I wish you luck in finding a copy before I buy all of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wheel and Tire Assembly 9\\" x 2\\"","review":"I'm writing this review mostly to add information to the product description (because until the item arrived I was not sure it was what I wanted; what does \\"PM\\" in the description stand for I still do not understand).This is a Wheel & Tire Assembly 9.0\\" diameter X 2.0\\" width. It comes without a cap or a washer or a retainer clip. Both the tire and the wheel are black (unlike the original wheel which was white with black tire; so my old mover now looks a little funny). Fits as expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe not the worst western ever--but close","review":"This has got to be one of the weirdest movies I have ever seen. For example, it starts off by showing several unrelated sections of the movie by way of clips. They even show you most of the ending. Later in the movie you see these same clips again, this time in context. What makes this perhaps one of the oddest Western movies I ever saw is the fact that nobody, except for the villain, seems to own a gun of any kind. Secondly, Sterling Hayden has the worst Swedish accent I have ever heard. The basic plot is run-of-the-mill, there's a big land grab and nobody except a pacifist farmer will stand up and fight. Unless you are a big fan of so-so movies and/or Sterling Hayden I would suggest you skip this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star","review":"My friend Judy gets to review this movie for me because I suggested she watch it and this is a condition of forgiveness:Since I have to give this one star, let the star be a collapsing black dwarf.Sterling Hayden gives the worst performance in any actor's life. He might as well be a talking roast beef. My friend said \\"lutefisk?\\" but his Swedish accent does not bear up under the comparison.It isn't just the movie that's bad--the score (guitar, trumpet, ?, etc.?) was obviously written by an escapee from the Insane Musicians' Mexican Rest Home.Nuff said.P.S.

The shopping list for week one alone cost over $400.00 to fill and even then was found to be incomplete. Many of the items listed were available only in quantities that caused a very expensive surplus of things I do not need as the program dropped my already low blood pressure to a point I had to abandon the whole thing.

It is a doll's story, and is told from her point of view. First, a financially struggling white mother sacrifices to buy the white Dolly for her daughter; later, the daughter paints Dolly brown and gives her to an African-American friend; and finally Dolly is sold to an antiques dealer, through whom she is reunited with her now-grown original owner. Dolly's story is interspersed with details about the struggles and joys of the two families: black lung disease, poverty, segregation, discrimination; and playtime, birthdays, holidays, and the progress made by the Civil Rights Movement."},{"rating":"2","title":"The answer is YES","review":"Let me preface this by stating I love Tears Run Rings. I started out with the most recent album, Distance- an album I so enthusiastically played at the radio station I DJ for they hid it from me, and an album I play so often at home I've even hooked my fiancee on it. Knowing this, it likely came as no surprise I soon wanted to order the back catalog. A Question and an Answer is a great start for the band, if a little short. The title track is by far the best in my opinion, as is Sense of Time and the strange Empty Bottles, all of which are pretty steady \\"dream pop\\", as the band is often referred to. The others are more shoe gaze and don't hold up as well, but worth it if you're going for a full collection. I love the interplay of the male/female vocals, and the speed it's played at complements the sweetness and just takes you to another place, much like Grizzly Bear's Yellow House does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Someone Got an A on the Regrade","review":"You always wish you had followed that excellent find of a band from the start, but honestly, I don't know if I'd remember to check for new releases if this was the first of theirs that I'd heard. Title track is worth all the rest combined -- I think it highlights what's unique in their contribution. The following albums are less polarized and are worth listening to in their entirety."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind Blowing","review":"Someone did there showgazer homework and got an A. I think this is closer to Slowdive than the whole Brit rip brat pack of yester years. But all the same this is one of the best Shoegazer-Dream Pop albums(ep) to come out in modern times. I also recommend Citrus by Asobi Seksu and Future Perfect by Autolux. No one can let this genre die because it takes ambient, adds a little white noise and melodies and bam you have a strong drink of musical bliss that sounds like angels from heaven. Sample the songs and you will agree, they did their homework."},{"rating":"1","title":"nVidia beats this..","review":"This card is good, but for the same price you can get a geforce6800GT, which beats this card by a lot.

It makes you feel good to think that a CD like this can change the way you feel when you listen to it and that feeling carries with you throughout the day.

If you listen to this CD, particularly tracks 2 and 3 I have found, while watching footage (with the sound off of course) on your television of the disaster of September the 11th, 2001, it provides for a most moving haunting and for me at least spirtually and emotionally cathartic experience.

Moving Melodies!","review":"Only one other movie soundtrack has made me emotionally moved. And that was Han Zimmer's Gladiator. Well, when I saw the trailer for \\"The Passion of The Christ,\\" I was moved by it's music and imagery. I pre-ordered the CD before I saw the film, and now that I have it, I'm moved by it. It causes me to recall images from the movie that I found to be the most captivating (and horrifying) ever filmed. This soundtrack is amazing, and I'm so glad I own it.My favorites on the CD include:\\"The Olive Garden,\\" \\"Mary Goes to Jesus,\\" \\"Crucifixion,\\" \\"Raising the Cross,\\" and \\"Resurrection.\\"It may not be full of scripture, but the music is enough for me to recall the images of my Savior being tortured while he had me on his mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome and Passionate","review":"This soundtrack is yet another to add to my Movie Soundtrack Hall of Fame!

Peter Gabriel Really Wrote This, Didn't He?","review":"After hearing only a few tracks, I was astonished that the producers of this CD would so brazenly steal from Peter Gabriel's incomparable score for Martin Scorsese's \\"The Last Temptation of Christ.\\" Mr. Gabriel deserved the Oscar he won for his original, painstakingly researched and masterfully composed piece. It's a stunning example of what a score should be for a film of this genre.I'm thoroughly disappointed in Mel Gibson for approving the near-pirating of an original that can't be duplicated - ever.If this imitation is Gibson's sincerest form of flattery, then the least he could have done was to credit Peter Gabriel somewhere on the CD cover.Even though the score may be brilliant, moving and passionate in its own way, I can't take it any more seriously than I would another Elvis imitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Soundtrack of the Year!!!","review":"This CD is very touching.

WHile this made for TV movie is a little patchy at times, it is the fine performances that make it a pleasure to watch. Even the actress who played the younger Judy delivers a fine performance. My only real complaint is the lip synching in the musical numbers by both actors is a little out.DVD SUMMARY: the movie was shot on video tape and you can tell - the transfer isn't great by any means. Extras include a short \\"making of\\" and DVD trailer. Overall, I think the DVD is worth owning, just to showcase the great talent of Judy Davis. And even better, it is a movie which is hard to switch off, the three hours go by rapidly. Check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Davis and Blanchard shine as Garland!","review":"This, the second of 2 tv movies based on Judy's life(Rainbow being the first), definitely shines. Judy Garland is not the eaisestn of roles to play due to the complexities of her persona and talent. Judy Davis and Tammy Blanchard richly deserve their Emmies for their portrayal of Judy Garland. They manage to capture her essence like no one else has. True, the movie was filled with historical inaccuracies, but that can be forgiven, for the fact that this movie manages to portray Judy as she really was. A definite must have for all Judy fans and a great primer for those just starting out in learning about her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life with Judy Garland","review":"Wonderful movie regarding Judy Garland's life story.

This is a piece of acting tripe. I barely made it thru the 1st night of this when it was on TV; didn't even bother with the 2nd night, I was that disgusted. Judy Davis didn't know ANYTHING about Judy Garland & it shows. Supposedly she studied her. Well, she didn't absorb what she watched & read, for it certainly doesn't show! I'm ashamed of Lorna for thinking Judy Davis could do her mother justice!! The girl that played child Judy EXTREMELY WELL would have been a MUCH better choice. With the skills they had even then they should have just aged HER, instead of TRYING to make Judy Davis look young - didn't work. Judy Davis is HORRIBLE!

I was not a Judy Garland fan before this, but after watching the movie and reading Lorna Luft's book I became one. Judy Davis did a superb job as the older Judy and Victor Garber was phenomenal as third husband Sid Luft ( father of Lorna and Joey)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Performances","review":"Both actresses give their all in this bio. Judy Davis' performance is mesmerizing and at times with the right camera angles, you would swear it's really Judy Garland. Her body movements and mannerisms, speaking voice... all are right on the money. The story hovers a bit much on Luft, but that's to be expected as Lorna wrote the book this is based on. Almost devoid of Liza's own story, she's just suddenly not there. I'm sure there was some drama surrounding that departure! I saw this first on TV and wanted to have a copy to watch without commercials. Very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done bio pic...especially Made for Television","review":"Tammy Blanchard and Judy Davis turn in fantastic performances in this crowd-pleasin' look at the train wreck that was poor Judy Garland's life. Lots of stunt casting (that teenage Liza really looks like the real deal! Great Mickey Rooney!) and classic film scene reenactments make this a hoot for film fans, but the hokey \\"Lorna Luft\\" voice over narration is not only biased to the daughter/author, it detracts from the great star turns of the two Judys.The DVD special features are negligible...you can catch this in reruns on TV and get ample enjoyment out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious docu-drama","review":"Judy Davis really pulled out all the stops for this one! She is a phenomenal actress and this role is no different. Her portrayal was spot on! Loved the drug induced mania as well as the \\"fat\\" years where we saw Davis in a huge make-up suit. Such classic lines too. \\"I pleased your wives, I pleased your children, ya sons-a-b----s!\\" My fave scene has to be when she tries to throw herself out the window cause she can't pay her bills. \\"Outta my way!

A \\"no-holds barred\\" approach, showing warts and all, and still making the whole increadible story unstoppable. HOWEVER I had a couple of issues watching this.... Firstly (as mentioned in another review) the video release cuts out many of the most poignant scenes shown in the TV version. This is nothing short of sad. My second critisim, and this is of both version, was the sense of \\"running out of time\\" towards the end. Emotionally charged and powerful scenes were no longer than a few fleeting seconds... this is a scripting fault, rather than a concept/directorial fault, I think. The effect is to dampen the emotions and meanings of these scenes. I found myself wanting more out of the movie, and found the retail version failing even more than the TV version to deliver.

The historical research that went into producing the novel was accurate, yet it is a history of the west that most westerners aren't even aware of: How Scottish cattle barons became influential ranchers in Colorado and Wyoming.The Scottish broage dialect was delightful, bringing another flair of authenticity to the novel.

There is not too much conquest (e.g. Command and Conquer gameplay), as you can only assert direct control over your military units.The major challenge is to create a stable environment that sims will want to move into and work in. The includes building housing areas, markets, resource collection areas, trading bazaars, etc. If you do a good job, people will move in and work in all your buildings, allowing the city to make more money and grow.If you are interested in the above, I would highly recommend this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"potent evocation of the pre-communist city","review":"This is a work of exceptional richness and observation. Beautifully constructed and written -the author draws from converations across the work, the most sensual yet critically insightful portrait of this strangely synthetic city.

Not even gossip."},{"rating":"1","title":"The risks of a live recording","review":"Live performances always preserve the emotion, the excitement and the risks of a challenge; in this case, the risks are huge; four sonatas per night is a Herculean task and, before a sonata cycle like this one, it's hard to keep the balance and the tempo. Sometimes, Tatiana is too intense and the pedaling excess is disturbing; as far as ornaments are concerned, it seems she can't play them \\"a tempo\\" and rubato turns to be a way to solve the technical limitations; as the listening goes on, you'll find too many wrong notes, wrong passages and wrong chords; this may explain the almost cold reaction from the audience. Here and there you'll hear someone's caughing or sneezing, a very low frequency noise and some differences in the piano sound. I think Nikolayeva could have left a better legacy recording this cycle in the studio and should have kept these live tapes in the cans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful entertainment!","review":"This Australian production of \\"The Pirates of Penzance\\" is totally hilarious.

However, I'm always happy to have fun with \\"camped up\\" versions of G&S; productions as well as those true to the original production.Jon English makes an unforgettable and totally hilarious Pirate King. Simon Gallaher, (Frederick), as well as Helen Donaldson make a beautiful couple. The entire cast and orchestra are outstanding.I highly recommend it!!Laurie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be with apologies to G&S","review":"This production was abysmal. I turned it off after watching the miserably feeble attempt of enhancing the Major General's song by adding a pathetic string of rhyming words after the last stanza, as if Sir Gilbert's libretto needed any improvement. Pirates has been popularized for modern audiences many times, most notably, the well done 1980's production starring Linda Ronstadt, but this version is hard to bear. The Major General's daughters look like they stepped off the set of the Rocky Horror Picture Show and the Pirate King seems unsuited to his role despite his histrionic posturing. On the whole, the production is ham-handed, campy and sure to disturb the eternal rest of those venerable gentlemen whose brilliance of wit and musical genius gave it birth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Deception !","review":"I bought this DVD having purchased the Australian Opera DVD of Patience, which I found to be excellent. This version of Pirates is simply AWFUL; it is a parody on Gilbert and Sullivan's operetta, having almost nothing to do with the original work. The so-called music has been entirely rescored, and is abominably bad; the acting is hammed-up slapstick; the dialogue has been greatly modified, and in many spots, Gilbert's text completely disappears. Some of the cast appear to be moderately decent singers; unfortunately, their talents are not allowed to shine in this version.I cannot recommend this DVD to anyone who is a lover of Gilbert and Sullivan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pirates of Penzance (Australian version) dvd","review":"I purchased this dvd from Amazon because I could not buy it in Australia, this is the best version I have see of this operetta, it is outrageously funny and the music is wonderful, the Australian actors are irreverant and the adding of the orchestra conductor to the movie is hilarious.

It is incredibly relaxing yet invigorating. I have a bad back and was able to do all of the moves relatively well. I only gave it four stars for one reason. I think there could have been a little more explanation on some of the movements. I felt that my legs were wanting to do one thing whilst my arms did another. Kinda like when you try to pat your head and rub your belly. I think there could have been a better way to explain the integration of the movements. After a few more tries I'm sure I'll get it down.

I've only been stationed in one place that offered lessons and fell in love with Tai Chi, but only had time to attend for the first few moves. I've read a couple books describing the art, but thought I'd benefit from being shown the moves. This is definitely NOT the aide I was looking for.This guy is probably a great modern dancer and aerobics instructor, but he races through his moves with little instruction or explanation of what one should be experiencing; proper breathing, stance, muscle concentration etc.Don't recommend it unless you're bored with your current workout and know Tai Chi well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it..","review":"This is a great dvd for the beginner.

It seemed that I was expected to either know the Tai Chi forms before hand, or to follow his lead and \\"pick it up\\". The pace of the exercises, are fast - meaning that Mr. Cole switches from one form to the other with little advanced warning or preparation. There is a nice feature on the DVD that allows you to jump to a specific form, so I guess if you chose to redo an exercise you would be able to do so relatively easily.I gave this DVD only two stars one for the quality of the DVD and the other for the artistic touches."},{"rating":"1","title":"A letdown","review":"I have 3 of Scott Cole's Tai Chi workout tapes. I was very happy with the other two Scott Cole Tai Chi workout DVDs that I use. I have to say that this one is disappointing to say the least.

The ballads actually resemble Elton John's early ballads in style, including vocal inflections, suggesting that Gus Dudgeon heavily influenced the work of both Spring and Elton John.

Instead, the design is such that the whole lid wobbles off the pan when the pressure is too high, SPILLING the contents all over the counter. I have had to clean my counter (and all the stuff on it) numerous times, cursing the makers of this rice cooker.-there is a gap between the pan and the body. So when the spillage mentioned above happens, it will leave a sticky coating on the interior of the cooker itself.- again, due to the absence of a hole on top, the residue collects, not around a nice little spot, but around the ENTIRE lid.Summing up, the only reason to buy this cooker would be the pan.

The translation from Portuguese by Margaret Jull Costa is excellent. Saramago's stylized writing shows the process by which many of us think as we contemplate, struggle, and make decisions. I'd recommend this book to anyone who loves a great story with depth of character. We see uneducated people, a potter, his daughter, and her husband, an entry-level security guard and see how their minds work as they think through their situation. I'll read this book again someday! Wow!."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful read","review":"This is one of those books that you press on to finish, and then realize what a great story you have just read.

Not until the end will you appreciate its perfection. You will never forget The Cave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Really A Novel; A Bore","review":"This is an allegorical work. The characters are meant as Symbols of Something Else, which is vaguely menacing. They're two-dimensional, simplistic peasant types. They could have been drawn with a lot more psychological insight, but instead, they are cardboard characters, in a staged world, and the narrative voice can put you to sleep as it moves them along. As another reviewer pointed out, the gist of the book is apparent right away, and nothing that happens changes anything. There is no suspense, no character development, nothing of particular interest except some of the narrator's observations, and those are not stellar. Even the dog isn't that sympathetic.For how this should have been written, please see One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez."},{"rating":"1","title":"too many words, too little story","review":"Disappointing. This book is extremely tedious. The narrative, just like Gabriel Garcia Marquez, is comprised of long sentences, with many commas and no paragraphs.

You really want to spit after reading it. The \\"truth\\" about the honest working class and the evil corporations is more than banal simplification - at most it says nothing about the nature of man, and most probably it is simply misleading. The language of the book is flowing well, but there is no real message. It is a fruitless flow of well written words. If you really would like to know about the nature of man read Kundera. I would not recommend this book to anyone but the most pompous readers who do not know the difference between the true and the false and become enchanted by the flow of the empty words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I know, those who love Saramago unconditionally will be upset at this assessment, but this book could easily have been a short story or novella and got the same points across while being more to the point and powerful.I guess coming straight off Blindness, which, to me, is one of the best books ever written, this one just came up short (or long, actually).Also, and everyone has commented on this aspect of the book, but glowingly, the comment on modern capitalism and the contrast between the center and the potter are making points so OBVIOUS that they almost make no point at all. Capitalism bad. Little guy good. It's that simple. I think he could've been a little more subtle.I will say, I loved the character development and the idea of the \\"Center\\" (although, like I said, it's significance was painfully overt).

After all, the author won a Nobel Prize. So if I'm not enjoying his work, the fault _must_ be mine!But the truth is, I'm just not enjoying this book. So if that makes me dumb or wrong, then so be it!-- The book is too long and rambly for the point it's trying to make.-- The characters don't seem to experience much transformation.-- His philosophical stylings really aren't that eye-opening.-- The themes kind of hit you over the head they're so obvious.It's been a long slog through this one and I felt like I'd finished a marathon when I finally turned the last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does Brooklyn need, or want, a Center?","review":"I would give \\"The Cave\\" 5 stars were it not for the exceedingly complicated writing style. This is the first Saramago I have read and, aside from the (to me) unnecessarily difficult style, I thought it was brilliant, for all the reasons so eloquently expressed by other reviewers. I loved the characters and the way Saramago put us inside their thoughtful, humorous, and very human minds.My only contribution is to bring readers' attention to parallels with the arena complex proposed this week for Brooklyn. It happened that I was reading \\"The Cave\\" as the media told us about how \\"eminent domain\\" will be used to deprive people of their homes and businesses so that private developers can build a huge, artificial, and tax-exempt commercial enterprise!

Well, it's fun. But there are a number of other reasons. For myself, I am an Aikido student, and the practice of tameshigiri has a lot to offer in terms of the teaching of ma'ai (distance), timing, form and movement, and perhaps most important, a noble frame of mind.This book will explain everything necessary for safe and efficient tameshigiri practice. The biggest help I have found is the various cutting patterns and kata that are shown. For students of Shinkendo, this is a training manual. For students of Aikido, this book will show you new doors, and help you reveal the true forms behind your technique."},{"rating":"2","title":"highly recommended","review":"I found this book to be both thorough and insightful. The examples were clear and useful. I found that it answered a lot of questions I had about Ruby and cleared up several areas where I was hazy (such as Ruby's symbols).It is geared toward helping programmers understand the Ruby behind Ruby on Rails, but also explains Ruby in general well.If you want a reference book, the pickaxe would probably serve you better, but as an instructional book it excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very weak","review":"This is primarily a book about Ruby, very little Rails content, and certainly nothing at a deep-dive level about Rails."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"I am new to rails.

Agile will give you a gentle introduction to Rails, pickaxe will be your Ruby reference, but Ruby for Rails will help you cross the chasm from an everyday Rails user to a power programmer who is comfortable with the crooks and crannies of Ruby.David Black spends much of the book covering Ruby internals to give you a better feel and understanding for the structure of Rails, Ruby, and their numerous idioms. In the end, everything is brought together in a sample iteration of a Rails app, where many of the customizations all of the sudden make much more sense.The book is worth every penny, and even more importantly, it is worth your time if you're serious about Ruby, Rails, or both. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Reading","review":"If you are one of the many new developers coming to Ruby through Rails, this book is certainly required reading.Within these pages you will find a solidly paced and effective tutorial of the Ruby programming language. The book speaks to programmers with only a little experience and yet experienced Rubyists will likely learn a few things by the end. I know I did.The book does a nice job of keeping the material Rails centric. Examples often show a Rails slant, though the concepts are primarily vanilla Ruby. This allows you to learn powerful new techniques that will likely help you in many new areas while staying focused on the current goal.This book also has the best description of Ruby's \\"singleton classes\\" yet put in print. It's probably of value to all Rubyists for that alone.I highly recommend this title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was not impressed","review":"I was not impressed with this book.

But there was still something missing, something that would explain more about how Rails uses RubyThen this book was released and I immediately purchased it. Im very glad I did. This book really does fill in the holes in my understanding of how Rails works. By working methodically through explanations of features of the Ruby language, and through Rails examples, the author does a great job of explaining all the ins and outs of Rails.The timing for me, could not have been more prefect.

It presents Ruby in a very manner that ties in with the Rails framework. If you are struggling with all of the mysterious Rails syntax, this book will show you why you are struggling.The PickAxe book is a real reference.

Hazan explores an important - but oftentimes rarely mentioned angle - the merging of politics into athletics to deliver a loud and controlled message on the world stage.Moscow 1980, Hazan writes, was an excellent example of sport and politics being connected and that such major international competitions is politics being played out in athletic arenas.Perhaps the watershed moment of politics and athletics was in the pole vault, when Poland's Wladyslaw Kozakiewicz gave what became known as \\"Kozakiewicz's gesture\\" to Soviet fans who were vociferously booing his efforts, which yielded a gold medal and world record.Hazan adds a well-researched voice to the history of the Olympic Games that are played in a decathlon of politics and ideologies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe Later: One Girl's Struggle with the English Language","review":"What incredible drivel. The subject matter obviously is autobiographical . . . which, in many cases, can be riveting reading. However, with \\"Maybe Later,\\" it's obvious that the author has lived a life only she could ever construe as interesting.

First of all, it is very difficult to control the plane if you do not have a joystick. Second, it is also hard to get the enemy into view in order to shoot him down. Overall, i thought this game to be more frustrating than fun, and it also does not incorporate with the rest of the Red Baron series. It tells you nothing of how to control the plane which is difficult in the 1st place. Being a long time player of Red Baron games, my personal favorite is \\"Hunt for the Red Baron\\".

Gene Smith, a well-known author, puts these lives in the dramatic context of the First and, for Petain and Eden, Second World War. There is little that ties these four lives together, and the book is strong on atmosphere but weak on analysis and interpretation. Smith's thesis centers around his proposed study of the reason for demise of such great men. He cites this reason as being WWI, which pulled these men from the history in which they were so great, and placed them in a 'new' world that would require new men with new minds to develop. A strong point thus is made, though Smith does little to give any fresh perspectives whatsoever in his analysis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Satisfying","review":"This book has it all!

How these two fell in love isn't quite clear. Too many elements of the plot simply didn't ring true, either. I, too, love the premise of the wounded hero who is healed, in every sense, by the love of the heroine. However, with these two people it simply wasn't believable, and with the writing being so formal there was simply too much distance between the reader and the story.

The author has gotten old and bitter and it really shows throughout the book. He keeps complaining about the degrading ecological state of Madagascar, his own health and other issues, and while his environmental concerns are undoubtedly valid, it makes the book a somewhat depressing read.Now if you have actual interest in lemurs, Madagascar or Durrell's scientific work, by all means go ahead and by this book.

What is amazing is hearing the two together on certain tracks, which is rather daring since we are combining East and West, jazzy cadences with precision and punch, but it all comes off with a certain panache.

He made me think about how Judaism was so obseessed with destroying paganism (which means perhaps paganism was more popular than we're made to think) and he made me think about double-dealing Christian and Zionist fundamentalists who claim they follow the word of God while supporting murder and mayhem in his name. So that's why I don't give it a total 1 - there's something to it, but it is not what I was looking for and not a book I desire to keep in my library.Suggest: Harlot by the Side of the Road instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Circumventing the source?","review":"Hmm...

This author is quickly becoming one of my favorites. I picked up this book after reading a free sample of the story on my Kindle and I was so glad I did.This book is imaginative, romatic, funny and heart wrenching. I was really surprised that I could feel any empathy for Louis aka Lucifer, but the author makes you care for him and his struggle with being in love for the first time and finding out that he is not all evil.I really enjoyed the relationship development between Louis and Gianna and I had high hopes for these two and a possible future together.Overall this was an extremely enjoyable read. I cried as much as I laughed throughout this book.

She told me a bit about both of her books and I bought a copy of each (which she autographed). I'm glad I did. \\"Requiem\\" has some great writing in it and while sometimes the characters are a little TOO clever, the storyline kept me interested throughout the entire book. As other reviewers mention, you don't need to be a Christian to appreciate this book. I'm a hard-core Pagan and I loved the story. It really is about love and redemption, not for a higher power, but for oneself.And, yes, I cried for the Devil."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Hear Recording of Beatles Instrumentals!","review":"These instrumentals give the listener a fine example of the Beatles truly creative arrangements of melodies. They are played here on nylon-stringed classic Flamenco guitar. Without the lyrics, I gained a new appreciation for the timeless richness of these tunes. Some are almost note-for-note like the originals, ex: Penny Lane, In My Life, She's Leaving Home. Others are nicely stylized, ex: Michelle, If I Fell, Eleanor Rigby. Regardless of the playing style, these are arrangements I think Lennon and McCartney would be pleased with. Erics' mastery of the Flamenco guitar here is stunning! He has a real feel for this music. The sound quality and ambience of this recording gives a fresh breath to these classics. A few of my favorites: Penny Lane, In my life, Strawberry Fields, Across the Universe. I would look forward to more Beatles releases from Eric Hansen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par...","review":"I have all of Eric Hansens music and love it but this one is not up to par and actually quite boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beatles Acoustic Guitar","review":"I really looked forward to getting this CD, but it ended up sounding like elevator music.

To blame are the Amazon folks. They should either write a short review or at least add the preview for people to hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent attempt to capture what really happened","review":"What actually happened at Little Big Horn may remain a mystery forever, but this film is one of the most balanced and honest attempts to explain the events of Custer's Last Stand. The documentary uses Native American accounts, contemporary newspaper reports and U.S. Army archives to interpret the events leading to that day and what transpired. The film employs still photographs of the battlefield and the battle's key participants to set the context. The roles of key Native American leaders are explored, as is the impact other U.S. Army campaigns had on the mindset of those leaders. To provide a counterbalance, this film also examines the personality of the flamboyant and headstrong George Armstrong Custer. \\"Last Stand at Little Big Horn\\" continues the tradition of the PBS series \\"American Experience\\" in searching for the truth in an honest and objective manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a bunch of backglass pictures","review":"I was checking this book out at Borders.

Lousy movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"the movie was HORRIBLE","review":"This movie had potential in the beginning, and left me hoping that it would lead to a great revenge story after the cruel treatment of Michelle. Way too many things in the movie just happened with no explanation such as the appearance of \\"Buck\\" and Rick knowing his daughter's password for her cybersex chat email address. It seemed like there was a bunch of stuff thrown into the plot haphazardly in order to make the plot seem more twisted, yet unrealistic. The fact that his daughter turns into a [...] right before she dies, and Rick barely shows distraught when he walks away from it is disturbing in a very forced way. The emotion in this movie is so shallow, and the lack of lighting at all is unnecessary to portray the sick atmosphere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Danielle Steel is my favorite author. I have all of her books in hardcover. I just wait for her next one! This was a great book, just like all of her books, my only problem, is that once I start reading her books, I don't want to put them down. I have been known to read way into the wee hours of the morning, and I usually finish her books within 1 to 2 days.I would recommend this book to all of Danielle Steel fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"For me, I didn't care for this one very much. It seemed to lack some of the talent I've seen in her other novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!!","review":"This was the first Danielle Steel book I've ever read. People have told me to try out other Danielle Steel books because this one might not of been for me. I don't even know if I could bring myself to pick up another one of her books. I could barely get through it. It moved sop slowly, and it wasn't very interesting. I did appreciate Danielle Steel's style of writing, but it bored me to no end."},{"rating":"1","title":"a mess","review":"Put this book down after only three pages. Once again, it is a string of words followed by a comma and then and. As I, and many of her other (probably now ex) readers have said-where is the editor? How this woman continues to sell books is beyond me. Does not rate even one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick vacation read, implausible plot","review":"A time passer to take with you on a trip, The Cottage was very implausible and I was very put off by Cooper and his lifestyle. I was so turned off by actor Cooper, especially by his affair with wealthy Alex and the 40 year age difference between them. It is unrealistic that Alex would be so dazzled by 70 year old Cooper that she would overlook his affairs with twenty-somethings and his sudden breakups with them. Alex even brushes aside and seems so nonchalant about Cooper's impending possible fatherhood and doesn't understand why Cooper's ex would want to keep the baby. Yet Alex seems to want to have children with Cooper anyway. I liked the secondary plot better with Jimmy and Mark who are much more likeable that I found myself very sympathetic to them. I agree with earlier reviewers that the \\"instant bonding\\" between Cooper and his long lost grown daughter was highly unrealistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had not read Danielle Steel in several years. I found The Cottage to be shallow, implausible, and completely predictable. I was very disappointed with this work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure drivel","review":"We all read Steele to escape from reality but this storyline is too far out there. We're expected to believe that a neonatal doctor would support abortion of her lover's child, that a woman might find happiness with the lover of her future daughter-in-law, and that a long lost daughter would instantly bond with a self-centered father that never knew she existed. I don't think so. This is the last Steele I'll read for sometime to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written by Danielle Steel?","review":"It is hard to believe that this book, as well as most of Ms. Steel's most recent works were written by the same author as her earlier bestsellers, such as Wanderlust and Zoya. The Cottage lacks any depth of character development, and the author has fallen into a pattern in her more recent works of stating the same character trait many times throughout the book, simply in different ways. As one who has always purchased the newest Danielle Steel novel as soon as it came out, I believe that I have just purchased my last. There are other newer, less popular authors writing books just as good as Danielle Steel's earlier ones who deserve receiving my book budget quite a bit more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid Trash, Save your money","review":"I have been reading Miss Steel since I was 18, my sister gave me Palamino. Over the last two years, I have found Miss Steel's books to be utter trash, she just keeps repeating herself over and over and over, page after page. It's like reading the same chapter 20 times. Miss Steel, what has happenned to to your ideas, like Jewels, Message from Nam, Zoya, wwhere the stories were actually good and interesting. I think you're the only author that seems to put out 4 to 5 books a year. Maybe slow it down and put out something of quality again. People work to hard to buy garbage like The Cottage and Bungalow. Shame on you, for becoming a lazy author. My advice to readers, find a new author to read, as Miss Steel is obviously out of ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's a Writer? Well, she needs an Editor!","review":"This is my first Danielle Steel book. I picked it up in an attempt to learn something about the Romance genre. One thing I found out is that Danielle Steele needs to learn something about grammer and punctuation. I have never seen so many comma splices in my life. This writing would fail a freshman English class. Don't they have editors at Delacorte Press, a Division of Random House?This book also has no structure, and runs on as if churned out. I never quite know who is talking about what from one sentence to the next. Still, I have to admit, the story is sort of compelling, in a shallow and pointless way that somehow perfectly describes the characters and their situations. I am not finished yet, but I do want to know how it comes out.I gave it two stars. One for being written at all, and one for me still reading it.Maybe there is hope for me as a writer yet. This book just shows that my standards have been set too high!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had never read a book by DS before. I got this book from a friend and after reading it, was very glad I did not pay for it. I found the story line to be too far out there and unbelievable. Everything seemed to happen to Coop all within months of each other; such as a gold digger says she is having Coop's baby and very soon afterward he finds out he has a full grown daughter he never knew of. Plus his devoted assistant of 20 years is leaving him during all of this to get married when he really needs her the most because he is going bankrupt. A truly caring assistant would hang in there a while longer to help get him through it. Not a lot of forethought went into the time lines. Also, I have never in my life seen so many sentences begin with \\"and\\" or \\"but\\". Ms. Steel's English teacher must be mortified. The only way I will ready another one of her books is if I get it free again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading the back of a cereal box may be more fun.","review":"If reading the back of a cereal box isn't more fun, at least it's more filling...

However, I do tire of all the \\"perfect\\" people who are in them. I too, was shocked that the neonatal doctor thought nothing of abortion, and the potential father not even being in the picture. I also found it ludicrous that this older man (70) was still in such great shape, with unbelievable sexual stamina, and was so \\"hot\\" looking-legs that went on forever.It was just too much this time. I may never read another Steel book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grammer Police are Incensed","review":"While the previous reviewers have summed up the storyline and content pretty accurately, I was most annoyed by the outrageously bad writing. It was a struggle to simply understand what she was trying to say....dangling participles, incomplete sentences, misplaced pronouns, and just plain bad grammer. At times I had to literally parse a sentence to understand what she was trying to say about whom. I wouldn't mind doing this for a rewarding, or even mildly entertaining story, but for this? I don't think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Having a bad day DS?","review":"I Love DS... But The Cottage was, to say the least, horrible. I got tired of reading the same sentences 20 times over in different places in the book. We all knew Alex was in Love in with Jimmy when she first met him!! I felt DS should have gotten into more detail with the romances between Mark & Taryn, and Alex & Jimmy. The ending of the book was rushed with a \\"this happened to him & her and this happened to him & her\\" like DS had to run to the bathroom and end the book real quick!!!! I was very annoyed with the book when i finished reading it especially for the price I paid to read it!! Sorry DS, two thumbs down for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"the cottage","review":"I thought this book could have better. It was a good book but, I thought that some of the events that happend were a bit too much. It is a bit unreal for a man whose wife just died to fall desperatly in love with in less than a year. The whole child thing was not my favorite section of the book. Yes, I understand that a child and a parent may have a bond, but when you have not seen this child in over 20 years you can not be close right of the bat. This book could have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was this story about?","review":"The problem in this book, for me, was the way that the characters were underdeveloped campy cariacatures of the role they were supposed to play. There was nothing very interesting about the plot, which wandered across the years without direction and tried to build itself by adding in characters till the end. No build up no climax, it was just a journal that chronicled happenings that were dull. In fact the explosive version of a tale of aging Hollywood stars is told by author Thorne Peters in the novel OLDE HOLLYWOOD, which sizzles and sparks where this tale fizzles and treads water. This is the first time of been disappointed by one of her novels, so I will continue to read her work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great One by Danielle Steel","review":"As usual Danielle Steel keeps your attention until the very end again with this book. I really enjoyed reading it. It is about a very rich man who lives on an estate and loves to spend money then he gets in trouble and is about to go bankrupt because he hasn't made a movie in awhile, so he rents out his guest house and one wing of his mansion to two bachelors who have had their own bought of bad luck. The way Danielle brings these three totally different men together and make them friends is heartwarming and keeps you wanting to read more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unimpressed","review":"I have to say this is by far the WORST Danielle Steel book I have ever read. Being a 31 year old woman I just could not get into the affair between the 30 year old woman and 70 year old man that takes place through almost the entire book. Honestly, it was too gross to even imagine. I could not relate to any of the characters nor would I ever want too. The ending was very disturbing...almost like an episode of 90210 the way everyone was switching bed buddies. YUCK! If you MUST read this book wait for the paper back or check it out at the library.

I applied the ginger compress mentioned in this over over a blister on my mother that had even broken skin and did not heal for two weeks. It went away overnight without a trace!

The economic decline is not just a term in this (and many other real-life) household - it leads to self-respect crisis, increasing social distance from the wealthier friends and puts on a surface the weaknesses of everyone involved.After all, the message is that you can still find the strength in yourself and the ones you love.

This is not one of them. I have seen some very bad movies make it to the stores, so I'll forever question why!! Ferocious Planet is a movie I feel every monster movie lover should see. The creatures in this movie were very well made, and makes you glad they are not real, or are they? I have heard there are parallel universes. Never know! I would like to see the T-Rex from Jurassic Park meet this bad boy monster, it would be worth the pay per view. The acting could have been a little better, but I have seen much worse. You basically knew who was going to get killed, all the whimpy people got it with a few cool dudes. There has to be a sequal to this. At the end, the only survivors were standing at an open door. You just know they did not return to their own demention. All in all, its worth the watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"This movie really has an eerie feel to it! With nasty beasts (as per the cover), that just love to dismantle anything that moves! I have to wonder though what their natural food source is.

But to the point of Ferocious Planet....it's so bad you can't believe it, but keep watching because you know it can't really be this bad so you watch knowing something good is about to happen and the movie is going to become interesting and entertaining....well it doesn't.

Sequel!!","review":"Yes, I know we've seen this all before. But, this time it was good. Joe was fantastic in this movie. He came across as a guy whose military training and experience kicked in to help save the day. The movie did not take itself too seriously. That helped to make it both dramatic and funny at the same time. It was good to see Joe again doing action/adventure. There needs to be a sequel because this movie was a step above what Syfy movies usually are. A person could sit back and enjoy the show, despite the blood and gore.

But, the American Showtime version of QAF was truly cutting edge. Most everyone who watched the American version immediately believed that Justin and Brian were (could be) deeply in love. The characters were more richly portrayed - and the producers were honestly willing (able) to make a more adult version: topics and nudity. The British version inspired the American but I never connected with a single character on that show. I found myself hitting fast forward out of boredom. I would highly recommend that everyone watch all 5 seasons of the US version before watching the British series. There has never been a series since that was so honest and willing to talk about the issues - even if many in the community felt that it was over sexualized.

And then, you also have songs that sound like they are put together by a team of songwriters for Mickey Thomas to sing just for the sake of FM airplay.

After the way i was treated in this game i never want to play another game from this company again...There is never anything new going on and the servers are mostly laggy and slow... If your bugged your screwed because GM's will take a good 3 hours to get a hold of you...After that if they see any problems with your account theyll freeze you and make sure you cant move... Even if your in the middle of a timed mission...Service terrible if i could give this game negative stars i would..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Game Diluted","review":"This was a great game when it first came out. I started playing it in Beta and loved the direction it seemed to be headed. The only major flaw I saw to early game play was that \\"Super Groups\\" were poorly implemented and of little use. Aside from that it was an awesome game.But somewhere along the line the visions of the developers ran contrary to the legions of fans. The game play became diluted through constant rebalancing and a large number of the games original players were driven away. I have given up playing it. I tried it briefly recently, just to see if maybe my original impulse to leave was rash and jaded, but it just isn't a fun game any more. Very unfortunate."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Game Into Oblivion","review":"Played this game for well over a year. The developers kept constantly hacking up the game with issues each one progressively worse. The last one was too much. Played Diablo II for 5 years this one did not make it to 2 years. Research your purchase on this one. There are many games out there that demand a commitment of time with little reward in the end. I did enjoy the game but I am leaving while I am still having fun. The next issue will kill that I know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer that says the service is terrible. This game takes a top line computer or else it runs slow. Missions are the same over and over again. There is no customer service. My personal experience with this game was BAD BAD BAD...Wait for everquest 2 or world of warcraft NC soft = Bad games"},{"rating":"1","title":"Booted From Mapserver","review":"I just bought the game today and I have spent two hours trying to play it only to be booted from the mapserver countless times. I've been able to get in about 3-5 minutes of uniterrupted play time and then it freezes and disconnects me. I am praying that they figure out how to fix this issue because the game could be a potentially awesome one . . . goes to show ya, TEST IT BEFORE YOU SELL IT!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Step aside JLA, its our turn now!!","review":"As everyone else who preordered this game, I have been taking part in the beta testing for this game. While I cannot give away any specifics, I will say, this game ROCKS!!!! My first night to play this game was insane! I speant over an hour making up my first character, choosing from the literally thousands, upon thousands of different costume ideas. Then I was off into the immersion of Paragon City...One suggestion I will give any first time players, let your friend and family know that you will be disappearing for a while when you first begin playing; this game is highly addictive!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dont buy this game","review":"ive played this game since beta in 2004. at its release the game was great but as of the last 3 updates they have nerfed the game worse then any other ive ever played its a totally different game and forget being super hero, at best your a moderate hero. i cancelled my account and sold it on e-bay.the devs have over 6000 post all condeming there latest changes and they dont seem to catch on that they've ruined the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great character generation but that is about all...","review":"Boy what a dissappointing game. The city is boring and the missions are redundant. And they certainly could have done better to make the scenery a little less drab. I have seen better graphics in Grand Theft Auto. The character generation is fabulous and the costumes and customization is really nice. But after that, it sort of goes down hill. There is so little content. The only thing they really managed to do right was make the 'dungeons' lockable to a single character or group. What a waste. If you just have to play an MMORPG, there are much better ones out there. Providing you actually have standards and aren't just obsessed with wearing a cape and spandex. If that is your only concern, then by all means..."},{"rating":"1","title":"No gameplay variety","review":"The main problem here is the gameplay. Combat, combat and more combat. And that's it.Really. There is absolultely nothing else in the gameplay. No matter how much you like superheros, you are going to get bored eventually."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the money","review":"This is one of the best games I have played in a long time, a long time. You get to play over the internet with thousands of other people and join different teams, start a Supergroup, level up, and much more. Well worth the $50. I suggest getting the game card too while your at it, it allows you to play the game for free for 2 months, and when you first get the game, your first month of play is free. Appropriate for all ages, hours of enjoyment, a must buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"So far...","review":"If the phrase \\"Massively Multiplayer Online\\" has \\"must subscribe to play at an additional charge,\\" hidden somewhere in it, then I'm sure I'll be able to revise my # of stars upward.So, to reiterate what now is at least listed in a *review* somewhere, you have to pay seperately for time on their server(s?).Which it says in tiny print on the box, I see, now that I have it in my hand.Nor will it let me open an account without giving credit card info, despite the fact that it says I get a free month with the purchase of the game.Horrible introduction to this game format."},{"rating":"1","title":"This shouldn't be an online game","review":"I was over at my friend's house, and he has City of Heroes. Of course I wanted to play it. When i first started I was impressedwith the Character Creation screen, this was one of the best character screens i have seen. After I made my character the troble started. I started to play the tutorial. The tutorial was SOOOOOOOOOO long. I thought it would never end. Finaly when i finished it i started playing in my first city. I play Star Wars Galaxies where I am used to changing professions and gaining skills by crafting ect. There is no crafting in this game I thought, \\"wow, then how do people get money to buy items?\\", well there ius no items. In fact there is hardly no interaction at all. I thought, \\"well then whats the point in making it an online game? Aren't Online games games where people work together to accomplish tasks?\\" Well not in this game. I dont recomend this game unless you like to go solo in online games and not work in groups."},{"rating":"1","title":"never got to play it","review":"I saw the reviews here and was so excited to get the game. I read the instruction book a kazillion times and watched every trailer on the coh website. Well, I happen to live in a town where the only internet available is dialup. However, i was able to play halo pc despite this problem so i didn't think this would matter. Here it comes. I went to execute the game and it wouldn't let me because \\"you have to run the updater first\\" okay clickity clich-gasp! 1375 hours was the approximated download time and it never dropped and if i disconnected it started over. Screw that! I sold the game and bought a psp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless support and poor game - DO NOT BUY","review":"I purchased this game with high expectations. However, after one \\"free\\" month of service and a total of an hour of gameplay, this is one nightmare that I will not continue to use.I have nothing but technical issues since I bought the game. PlayNC support sent me countless boilerplate responses without any concern for my resolving this issue. In the end, when my free account ran out, so did the support.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. It is a buggy, poorly designed product that is a waste of your funds."},{"rating":"1","title":"stuipidest game ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"the game sucked because you had to log on to the website and register to play the game for ten dollars a month.thats 120 dollars a year. and if you want to waste your money thats fine with me ,but don't say i did'nt warn you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best MMRPG i've ever played!","review":"If u don't like this game then, in my opinion ur a stupid <the following has been censored>! You can do nearly anything your favorite super hero can, and with the expansion coming out in 2005 you can even be a villain. And as for that dude who complains about it not working on his computer you don't have to play it then so shut up allready, this game is also almost constantly being updated, that is why u have to pay. So if your not a @#$! like that dude and your into rpgs you'll love this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good overall.","review":"I have enjoyed playing this game. I only give it three stars due to the constant changing of the superhero's powers. As your superhero increases in level, you will choose powers and enhance those powers to your liking. As soon as you design your superhero the way you like, you log on one day and the game has a new version with changes to some of your powers. I think it's also safe to say that the changes that I have seen so far have weakened most powers. This may not seem like an issue to some of you but it is very frustrating to spend 4-5 hours a week for a few months playing this game just to have your favorite powers drastically changed. I actually cancelled my account over the last version. My two superheroes powers were so drastically changed that it was not fun to play them anymore. Beware!! If you like stability, do not buy this game!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious so fast that it cannot justify the monthly fee.","review":"This is the very first MMORPG I have tried. After playing it for a month, I am definitely not impressed. I knew about the monthly fee and read many differing reviews so I decided to give this game a go. The character customization is the only thing I really enjoyed. Afterwards, the sheer amount of just running around and clicking the same buttons over and over again just to attack, attack, attack. What this game seriously needs is something besides talking to an npc or attacking. The incredible amount of time it takes to level up and complete later missions of just fighting, fighting, fighting made me truly ask myself: why is this worth $15.00 a month? I could get more fun out of the original Dragon Warrior or Final Fantasy. I would only recommend this to a person who is both a true comic book and MMORPG fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy this game","review":"NCsoft is a rip off there tech support is a joke if you have problems the chances are slim to none of getting it fixed.after three weeks of e-mails and answering stupid questions like are my cap locks off? I never did get my problem fixed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably great","review":"I'm sure this game is fantastic...that is if you can actually play. I've had it for 2 weeks and have not been able to play once due to various reasons that have not been determined by tech support yet. My suggestion is to visit the site and read the boards before you buy. Hopefully, you'll be able to determine if you will be one of the lucky few that can play the game with little or no issues. I will continue to try until my free month is up and then I'll move on or return to other games I play. Good luck if you choose to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP OFF","review":"Bought this game as a Christmas gift for my son and he cannot even use it. This is an online only game and it was shut down this month! After researching I now know it was announced in August that the game would be ending, yet this company continued selling these games. Scandalous. I am NOT happy about this, I should get a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bye to all of you.","review":"I've been an avid player since June 2004. My subscription had been uninterrupted for the past 8.5 years. I would have gladly continued my annual subscription plan indefinitely if only NCSoft did not kill this game. That they have shown absolutely no willingness to give it up, so they can keep it dead only adds insult to injury.The end of City of Heroes is Nov 30, 2012. Our community will move on and we'll definitely remember who did this to us: NCSoft. I'm glad to have heard that at least half of the Paragon Studio employees (the developers of City of Heroes) have found new jobs after they were let go in mass in September. My best wishes to them on their futures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I purchased this because my son was begging me for it. It was very cheap, but it is just the game City of Heroes that you have to be online to play. You could download it for free online. They are canceling this game at the end of November anyway, so it isn't worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"City of Heroes","review":"This is a pretty fun mmorpg...i did not get very far into it due to the fact i played it on my friends computer but the fighting, gameplay, sound/music were all great. If you are looking for an mmo that isn't completly about collecting items and armour this is the one for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"dont buy","review":"dont buy this game it costs $50 upfront and $15 a month. That turns out to be $180 a year!!!!!!!!! You could buy almost 4 new games, 9 greatest hits or platinum hits, and there are plenty of old $10 games. Plus the websight has no phone support so if you have a problem you have to wait a frikin week for them to get back to you. So spend your money wisely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money and time","review":"I have played this game and have a lvl 20 character. If i could,i would have never played this game. The only thing good about it is the fact that it character creation is unique. But other than that the missions are the same over and over. The customer service is messed up and there are to many forums. There website is also very bad and they will make you sign up for a million things before actually doing anything in the game... STAY AWAY FROM CITY OF HEROES... You'll thank me for it in the end..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful","review":"Make sure your computer has the correct required video card. We have four brand new laptop, computers none of which had the correct video card. After purchasing the game we also found out that only the GE Force 2 series card works without any gliches.

Otherwise, you'll get stuck trying to download a 2.5 Gb 'patch' that routinely disconnects and resets (Its been 3 days since I bought the game and I STILL can't get the patch downloaded...on a cable connection). Meanwhile, my '1 month of free play' is ticking away, completely unavailable to me.Whats in the patch? Mostly, City of Villains content...yep. I can't play the game because I'm stuck dl'ing information on their OTHER game.If I ever DO get to play, this'd better be a darn good game. Otherwise, I'll be busting down some doors at NC. This is NOT a good start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware before you purchase!","review":"Recently purchased this game as a gift for my teenager. Make sure your system has the proper requirements before buying. I thought we had a good sound/video card and have been told that it needs to be upgraded. That and the $14.95 monthly subscription should be prominently labeled on the package and on this site!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Developers continually make your characters obsolete.","review":"I bought this game over a year ago and had a blast for the first six months spending hundreds of hours playing. Then, the developers decided to 'improve' the game by making my two main characters virtually useless. Despite repeated complaints from a large portion of the subscribers, the Developers refused to remedy the situation or even provide alternatives. This is not the only instance of this happening either. Each new 'edition' of the game makes some poor player's character obsolete. In frustration a large number of CoH players have inactivated their accounts. I expect the same will continue with CoV and other games developed by this company. They turned what could have been a fabulous MMORF into a frustrating experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"I had been waiting for this game for a long time. This was an awesome game, for the first week. After that it starts to get really repetitive and pretty boring. Right now I am stuck with a 6 month subscription because they don't give refunds and's what's worse is I can't go trade this game in because once the CD Key is used it can't be used again. So I make a new super hero, have fun with them for about an hour, then the boredom sets in again. I would not buy this game unless you are super hardcore comic fan. Even then it might be iffy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED! EVER!!!!","review":"This is definately the best game I ever played by about 5 miles. The character creation may take a while, but thats a good thing. There are thousands upon thousands of costume choices, dozens of power, origin, and archetype choices. The powers you can change and upgrade, and later get more. In the game, there are hundreds of gangs and orginizations to fight with ranged or melee attacks. If you don't like the controls, you can very easily change them with a simple options menu. The graphics are sweet and the gameplay is awesome. All in all, the best game I have EVER played."},{"rating":"2","title":"Things a like but mostly hate","review":"I didnt enjoy this game. This game gets 2 stars because 1. The character being unque is kinda cool. 2 Spells arent that great but you can make a lot of different combinations. After that i was not impressed with the graphics. The enemies are the same over and over. It like playing EQ and being stuck on the boat going back and forth. Or like fighting bunnies in FFXI who finds that fun. Give me a giant monster with stunning graphics and ill be happy but this game just doesnt do it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this??","review":"This is sheer crap!!

Admirers of Mayer could understandably take offence at the pale imitations of his work offered herein by performers so minute in stature that their names don't even appear, but I would encourage a different response: smile, nod, and be assured in what you know already - that John Mayer and the music he makes now and in the future will be around long after this \\"tribute\\" has been consigned where it belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a travesty!","review":"To all people who have the gift of hearing, do yourself and your ears a huge favor.

Although the author has based some episodes on great rescues in his career, it seems that she missed the boat by giving no clue as to why this man was so beloved by firefighters and all who knew him long before his tragic death on 9/11. This warm, funny, compassionate, brilliant and humble man was a far more interesting character than the fictional (and at times rather boorish) Jonah Malone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mixed bag","review":"Some of the situations are interesting, but the previous reviewer is right that the author introduces too many characters and has too much going on to focus sufficiently on any character or situation. As for the raw description of the homoerotic-or whatever you want to call it- act with one firefighter, Jake Schiller,it didn't add anything, and I would rather not know about it.

I have been struggling with uncomfortable bras for awhile so this one was no improvement. I washed it hoping to just soften it up and make it more comfortable. but no go. I was never able to figure out what made it so scratchy. under the arms and in the back at the closure. Don't buy this bra if you want comfort.

Difficult (for me) to adjust very skinny bra straps. I have a bad feeling Jockey stopped making the one I want -- straps are not adjustable, very comfortable wireless bra (model no. I think 324-4726)This one that I'm reviewing (324-4701) is also wireless but the straps are much skinnier though the material is somehow thicker, and the adjustable strap slider is really hard to move around.Plus the cross-cut v shape of the bra I wanted is gone too. This has a sports bra look to it. Not very attractive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defining what harmony is not","review":"This would be truly wonderful music if only both of the singers actually could actually sing well. The female manages to hit the right notes most of the time, and when she misses, it is not a spectacularly bad miss. But the guy---Eeee Gads!! This is what happens when the tone deaf decide to harmonize. Still, this is a good enough bit of music for people new to the Craft, who tend to think anything even remotely Pagan is a good buy. And Moonstruck do have a nice chant or two during which, blessedly, the guy sings so softly he doesn't ruin it. The lyrics are cutesy fluff and on a Silver RavenWolf level, and again, the chants are good. Not a recommended tape for anyone with musical expertise, particularly in vocals, but ok if you just like witchy music for the sake of itself and aren't too picky."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"AFter reading other reviews here, I couldn't wait to get this CD. Now I can't wait to see if my used CD store will give me anything in trade. The vocals are horrendous- particulary the male vocal is rarely on key. Musical quality is not just \\"unpolished\\" it is awful. The lyrics are heartfelt, but would be better served being sung by someone who can carry a tune.

So I do it at home. It's a dirty job but someone has to do it. ME. After cleaning, lubing and re-assembling and wiping down the gun, my hands look like I just spent the day in a coal mine. A few squirts of GOJO and wash under cold water-no more coal mine hands. I would imagine being a grease monkey and repairing a car engine this product would be useful too. So whether you change a spark plug or shoot a .45-this product comes in handy.The only drawback for some would be-Gojo feels like your washing your hands with wet sand-personally it doesn't bother me.IMPORTANT NOTE: When cleaning your hands after cleaning a gun-always use cold water. Hot water opens the pores and considering what may be contained in the residue on your hands from the gun-it's probably a wise thing not to let it absorb into your skin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for cleaning oilfield clothes","review":"Great for cleaning oilfield clothes.

I have admired both Dolly Parton and Queen Latifah for some time, and looked forward to seeing them mix their moxies. But the shallowness of characters the wrongness of the behaviors just left me embarrassed for everyone involved. The bad boy becomes the hero only because he can choreograph good music, not because he's had a change of heart. We're supposed to just forget about the fact that he stalked and kidnapped the heroine. The ruthlessness of the competition for music designed to praise God is disturbing. And the sexual double entendres in the gospel songs was downright embarrassing. I left this movie depressed at the thought that Americans may have forgotten how to preserve the sacred in anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joyful, indeed.","review":"This movie is not going to change your life, but it will definitely make you smile.

It's even rarer when my wife feels the same way. If it's a romantic comedy or features musical numbers, she's usually onboard for the full ride. Warner's \\"Joyful Noise \\" even had her looking for the \\"Stop\\" button on the remote.The \\"Joyful Noise\\" Two-Disc Blu-ray / DVD / UltraViolet Digital Copy Combo Pack will satisfy people who liked this movie.

As for \\"Choir\\" it's more like a few talented people showboating with some backup singers. The music reminds me of South Park Episode 709, where Cartman said gospel music is just love songs with \\"Jesus\\" thrown in a lot.

It looks like this movie was really marketed toward Christian groups, but I cant believe that any Christian would be ok with the content that this movie brings. There is a scene where a couple just found that they like each other and the next scene you see them in bed together... Lots of teenage making out... All the while, the protective mother is talked about as a crazy overbearing mother by multiple characters. Its a shame that I did not like this movie, as I really do like some of the cast in it.

Quick combat tends to be the same way because there is no randomness. 1-9 planes will come at you and as soon as you kill all of those, 1-9 more will come at you again. Also, although the planes look like they have there own shape, they are really blocks to the computer, which means you may hit things which you really didn't.

At first the lids opened perfectly after one revolution of the can, then part of the lid did not detach from the can, then it took two revolutions of the can before the lid fully detached, now it barely works at all.

Very very slow data transfer. I started copying 18GB before going to sleep, by next day morning (after approx 7 hrs) it copied only 7GB.Even their customer support person told me that this drive will be very slow since it is connected through router and not directly with your computer.

The one excellent thing about Western Digital is the ease with which you can get Phone Support.This does NOT compensate for a VERY poorly organised KnowledgeBase, or for the accompanying manual which seems only interested in getting you to register with Mio Net, a web access service. This seems to be the only thing they are thinking about. Go ahead, de-install Mio Net or it will not stop bugging you to register. De-installing it will not affect the NAS.

That aside, my experience was as follows:The drive would only stay visible on my network for about four hours, then it disappeared to both my PC and my laptop. The power button didn't work at all. I had to unplug the thing to get it to reboot.

Since it ran hot, I tried to remember to shut it off when I wasn't using it, but I would often forget.I'm a computer nerd, so I usually just repair, reformat and retask things when they break, but the parts and software on the MBWE are cheap and proprietary. I did the research when it died and decided it just wasn't worth fixing.I've been much happier with Lacie drives, although I wouldn't recommend their ethernet drives either.

Some books are academic enough to stand up to such scrutiny, though as a result are dry and boring to read. Even texts for chaos magick, which was once a breath of fresh air, are now borish and verbose. Arcane Lore is not one of those. This book is meant to be a comprehensive text on magick and the occult, though is presented with such pinache as to read like a comic book. Arcane Lore is the worn and oil stained mechanic's guide to the automobile that is occult reality. More a compilation of notes, experiences, and humor than a structured document. It is irreverant, funny, and functional. The only reason I am giving this a 4 of 5 is that a large portion of the book is a compilation of quotations from other authors, not as much original content as the page count suggests."},{"rating":"2","title":"urbane, sophisticated scent","review":"If memory serves, noted designer Giorgio Armani was once quoted as saying that his designs were created not to be noticed but rather to be remembered.

In fact, I'm not sure I've ever gone more than 2 or 3 laps without crashing! However, this is the perfect toy for someone who is ready to graduate from some of the less challenging racing games. The differences between the cars is dramatic; the twitchiness of the cars will give you new appreciation of what it takes to keep a high-strung race car under control. Virtually impossible to drive without a racing wheel attachment for your PC -- way too frustrating with a joystick.

In the next hour(s), through free downloads from the web, you will polish it into what I think is still the best road circuit simulation in 2004 : photo quality graphics, hundreds of circuits sometimes better than the originals ( you'll find the old Monza with the oval, Ile of Man TT, Limerock Park, Oulton Park, Le Mans, Laguna Seca ....) .

Now we have these gems of music on CD's and available to us, to listen and enjoy. I bought this cd that had some concertos which had not yet fallen in my possession. On this cd label cop, the renditions are clear and crisp. I think it was worth to buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dull","review":"Who knew Vivaldi could be this unimaginative? Oh nevermind, the concertos on this recording were missing all their parts except for the main violin lines and therefore had to be largely reconstructed. This immense task was done by this recording's violinist or conductor (I forget by whom because I gave away this CD months ago). Unfortunately the reconstructions are depressingly dull and sound as if written by a musicologist rather than a composer. Yes Vivaldi wrote so much that some of his pieces might sound too similar; but one thing that Vivaldi's music exudes is vitality ... vitality that is sorely missing from these reconstructions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"It is clear why she was in the Orange 21 list after she published this book... before she was 30!

This film is as if Erin Brockovich travels through time to stop the evil institution of marriage. All men are slimy cheaters and all female students are kissing and touching eachother in a sexual way. Great acting from a great cast is wasted on this cliche' film. Why attack the fifties? Why set a film in the fifties if you hate them as the filmmakers do. Every 50's icon is viewed with a smirky contempt. You have to wonder what the point of making a film that condems the innocence of the 50's is, when we already live in the jaded opposite of the 50's."},{"rating":"1","title":"A steaming, festering pile of offensive crap","review":"This movie is beautiful, and well-acted. However, the premise is pure crap, and the characters are ridiculous parodies. The really offensive thing is that it's basically an attack on an entire ethnic group -- white, anglo-saxon protestant women. If something like this was made about any minority group -- let's say, Jews -- there would be people with pitchforks marching on the offices of the studio. However, here, WASPs are portrayed as rigid, unfeeling, cruel, shallow, simpleminded and vaguely fascistic. Every single one of them, and at one of the top schools in the country. I doubt very much if Wellesley in the fifties was populated by women as dumb and awful as this, and the effort to portray them that way is more than a little offensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give Me a Break","review":"This movie is the biggest load of BS I've seen in years.

She fights against the idealism of the '50's that woman should not further their education after getting married; that all woman want or need in life is a husband and kids.

We can not see why all of a sudden Julia Robert's character, Ms. Watson, falls in love with the Italian teacher.Is it merely a physical attraction? We do not even see that evolve. We saw her only a few times interacting with the members of her class, so, how does she affect them so deeply.There is no emotional substance in this film.There are so many gaps in this storyline and that in combintation with the generally poor acting makes this one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

I would like to see stars like her wield & flex their power to improve rancid scripts like this. Hopefully the younger babes, if they become stars, will do just that- & ironically learn real lessons from this film that are not contained within.

While other kids were joining sororities, I was singing on a local TV show once a week. Had two a wonderful career in music. I eventually opening my own book store and had two books published. I was always sorry I didn't grow up in the 60's instead of the 50's. Would have made a huge difference in my life. But despite that, I loved the sixties and seventies, and though I was a little older than most all my friends, it didn't matter to them or me.The film was portrayed exactly as things were in the McCarthy era and the up-tight generation of the 50's, and though I liked the film, it kind of hurt to remember it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational","review":"Mona Lisa Smile is the best movie for every girl, lady, woman out there.It teaches women to have strength in themselves and to not rely on a man to provide that strength.Every young girl and woman should watch this film before graduating from high school.It's strong, emotional, funny, educating.

I removed and reinstalled the battery thinking that maybe I installed it incorrectly. After more charging, the same result occurred.Also, the battery I received looks nothing like the one pictured here on Amazon.And the tool that comes with the battery to pry open the iPod also is terrible. The tip of the tool broke off during the procedure. My iPod had never been opened before, and I believe it is most difficult to open an iPod for the first time.

I left it charging for about 4 hours only to return to find the iPod was not closed tightly. Thought that was odd and tried to close it up and it would not engage the clip.

The batteries hold their charge for no more than 15 minutes on a full charge, if I can get the batteries to charge at all. I tried both batteries on my iPod and my brother's and got the same results.Shipping cost me $6.00 per battery, and now I'm out of the country so shipping them back would cost me a fortune.

I was overwhelmed by information which didn't necessarily give hope that recovery is achievable. Nor did it leave me feeling good about myself, just stressed that I wasn't doing \\"it\\" right and that I would end up depressed again.You would be much better off reading \\"The Mindful Way Through Depression\\" by Williams, Teasdale, Segal and Kabat-Zinn. It gives a clear, calm message of hope as well as practical concepts and tools. At the least read the preview on this book and see how it leaves you feeling versus this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helped me understand I wasn't alone","review":"I recently pulled this book off my shelf to give it to someone close suffering their own depression. I read it - and many more books - years ago when tackling my own illness. Paging through and seeing all the underlines and dog-eared pages, I recalled how this one book along with group therapy is what helped me pull though. I could identify so much with what I read and was re-assured that I wasn't alone in feeling those thoughts. This book is not full of self-help exercises as the genre tends to be - frankly, I wouldn't have had the energy at that time to do them and would have felt discouraged by my failure to do so. Reading it was like having a therapist available at any time of day to reassure me that it was going to be okay."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great summation of a confused subject: depression.","review":"As a lifetime sufferer of depression, I've read my share of self-help books, most of which didn't seem to address the real problem and the terrible suffering in a way that I could translate into progress. This book opened up the mystery and offered just the most practical, everyday advice. I've been going around preaching it to my friends so much that they call it \\"The Book.\\" Not to sound too effervescent, but even in the few weeks since I put his suggestions into effect, I've found myself laughing more: always a good sign.

Separate chapters on how the depressed person interacts within the family, at the workplace, in the community were especially interesting. We have used several techniques suggested in the book and found them helpful in keeping me from being pulled in to my wife's depression. She was so impressed with the change in my attitude that she read the book also and now we both recommend it to everyone we know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book on relationships I've ever read.","review":"In addition to helping me cope with a depressed S.O., this gem has more good advice on relationships, marriage, raising healthy children, and living a meaningful life than all the others that intend to do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three reasons why this book was a waste of time and money:","review":"1. It didn't teach me anything I hadn't already read in other books or learned on my own.2. Stressed the importance of medication and ignored the plight of those (like me) who have tried pretty much every med on the market and experienced no relief from symptoms.3. I was personally offended by the brief discussion of antidepressant side effects which, when mentioning sexual dysfunction, focused solely on MALE sexual dysfunction and completely ignored the fact that most females on antidepressants cease to experience orgasms. Apparently I'm a filthy whore who shouldn't be concerned with my sexual enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate about drug treatment","review":"Has inaccurate information about medications. Says that lithium is a near miracle for bipolar disorder, when in fact it works for only 70% percent of people, for instance. (He even says this in another paragraph). Be forewarned. He says similar things about unipolar depression. It is a book about non-medical approaches to treatment, but I hope someone who knows little about drug treatment will take it accurate. It's not just information about meds that came on the market after the publication date, too. Please don't take it at face value."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will help you","review":"When I bought this book, I told myself it was to help understand my mother better. But, I found that it was describing me! I read it cover to cover in two days. I just couldn't put it down. I am now on antidepressants and have never felt better. If you think you have depression, you need to read this book. It will definately help you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rewiring the brain without medication","review":"I found this book quite original and well-written. I come from the school of thought that the greatest component of depression is biological and is most easily undone by medication. Nonetheless, there is merit to what the man is saying, especially in cases of mild depression. I'd recommend the book to anyone suffering from depression. Avery Z. Conner, author of \\"Fevers of the Mind\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the ethereal to the concrete","review":"From the ethereal to the concrete; Dr. O'Connor put into words all that I have felt (or not felt) for 30-some years. Never before had I been able to name my turmoil. With knowledge comes the courage to try to swim to the surface, and into life. His book helped me tremendously, and continues to do so with each re-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great insights on relationships and communication.","review":"This book works as a guide for getting along in all kinds of situations. I picked it up in the library because of its unusual cover and got hooked by reading some of the case studies. Interspersed with the author's personal story adds to the readability. I hope he writes one not only centered on depression."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for Anyone Affected by Depression","review":"This is the best book I've read on depression. It's smart, straight-forward and incredibly useful, offering exercises for living without depression. O'Connor is refreshing in his practicality, compassion - and most of all, his experience with the subject. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you Dr. O'Connor","review":"This is one of the clearest, most compassionate books on depression that I have ever read. Dr. O'Conner, who suffers from depression himself, has been able to take the sticky-spaghetti threads of thoughts in a depressed person's brain and unravel them and explain them in a very straightforward manner. Anyone who has struggled to try and explain his/her disease to a non-depressed person will appreciate Dr. O'Conner's writing.Dr. O'Connor presents a very well-informed well-rounded view of the philosophies and treatments. Good basic book to start with."},{"rating":"2","title":"I usually hate these books but this was great","review":"Wow, this is a helpful book. The best thing is that he realizes that depression effects, long term (if not forever?), multiple facets of your psyche--behavior, thinking, self-image, relationships, etc., and those have to be systematically addressed one by one and over time. It is the most hopeful yet real book I've read on this topic. When I read, \\"We end up being depressed because we never learn how to act differently--'But I'm so GOOD at being depressed'....\\" I said, Amen, brother. We don't need someone else to tell us our self-esteem is out of whack. We need a way to do something about it. Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of help!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Great book.

It takes you on one man's journey to finding himself through this practice. That the man happens to be David Carradine, TV's Caine, is an interesting parallel. For those more versed in Kung Fu this book may contain too little, for those who adhere to Bruce Lee and his methods this book may anger, for those of us who are curious and who are an unwritten page ourselves this book is just what the doctor ordered."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not a kung fu expert but I play one on TV.","review":"David Carradine is not considered a martial arts expert by anyone I know and I've been in the community for over 10 years. I find it funny that he criticized Bruce Lee for being more of an actor than a MA (this is what we call hypocrisy). Bruce Lee was a world class MA who brought Eastern and Western styles together. Carradine who is an actor who had to learn some Martial Arts for a role. If your interested in the TV show or Carradine then this is for you. If you want to know about Shaolin philosophy, then pick up a good book about Ch'an Buddhism - because that's what Shaolin monks practice. There are also much better books about MA philosophy like \\"Zen in the Martial arts\\" and \\"Beyond the Known\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good read","review":"This book didn't provide the insight I was looking for. It read like someone trying to force a spiritual insight they only had a vague awareness of. Sorry, I did love the show but not this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read it only if you want a general view of kung-fu","review":"I got the book in christmas, and, as the book cover reads, I expected to obtain kung-fu phylosophy. Unfortunately, half the book contains Carradine's biography and the other half contains just a little part of what kung-fu phylosophy really is. Also criticizes Bruce Lee for being more and actor than a martial artist, which is exactly what should be criticized on Carradine. As he himself explains, D.C. is NOT a great martial artist or kung-fu expert, but feels able to comunicate the little bit he knows. If you only want to learn a bit on kung-fu phylosophy, read it. But if you really want to learn the art, start by Bruce Lee's Tao of Jeet Kune Do and Tao of Gung-fu. Those books contain a lot of pure, deep kung-fu phylosophy written by a serious martial artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not actually worthwhile","review":"This book wastes a whole lot of time. Who cares how the algorithms work?? Wouldn't it be better just give a better explanation of when to actually use them(something the book doesn't really do).

I really enjoyed mystery solving element of this story. That makes this one of the most engaging episodes of Doctor Who I have ever viewed."},{"rating":"2","title":"At its best!","review":"This is Dr. Who at its best, in my opinion. The story is strong and intricate; the science is integral to the plot's resolution; the one liners from Baker are witty, instead of just kind of funny, as can occasionally happen; surprisingly quotable truisms from The Doctor about human nature are periodically inserted, without being too didactic; and the energy is high - the story doesn't mire down as it can in some episodes.This probably won't end up as your favorite episode, but it may end up as one of those Dr. Whos that will always get the comment out of you: \\"Oh, I like that one!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A real edge-of-seater.","review":"This is classic Dr Who. The Doctor arrives in the uncharted jungles of an alien world and finds the survivors of a doomed space expedition, who have reverted to savagery, and an effigy of his own face carved into a mountain. The first story to feature Leela, who is at her best here, this is gripping sci-fi/fantasy from start to finish. There are strong performances from all the cast, the Horda are a genuinely chilling creation and the scenes in the forest, in which the Doctor and his companions are stalked by an unseen beast, really are behind-the-sofa moments. Add to that some nice little touches of humour and a clever, well-thought-out storyline and you have four episodes of unmissable adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great collection of works by one of the best voices of our time","review":"Kathleen Battle is the owner of one of the best vocal instruments of our time.

It explicitly contradicts the creeds of the Catholic faith that are the Athanasian Creed and the Tridentine-Vatican Creed. It promotes the heretical theory of Karl Rahner that non-Catholics are anonymous Christians. This theory is implicitly contrary to the Great Commission given by Christ and explicitly contrary to the solemnly taught doctrine of faith that \\"outside the Catholic Church there is no salvation\\". The book consistently promotes religious indifferentism, religious relativism, and naturalism; all of which are contrary to the Catholic faith. The two authors of this book are well known right-wing modernists. If you want your questions answered about Catholicism, this book does not provide answers. Instead it is concentrated on modernism because the authors are modernists.

Cliff believes the death was committed by his nemsis, and Cliff goes off the deep end trying to prove this.

Obviously, some mystery readers don't mind a story line that is laced with hard-core swearing and violence. But if you're not one of those readers, then be forewarned and don't bother with this one. I really enjoy a good bibliophile mystery, but in this case I couldn't force myself to go beyond the first few pages to discover the author's touted knowledge of antique books. With so many well written mystery stories to read, I don't need to spend time reading this type of writing. Again, mystery lover beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much teaching, not enough writing","review":"Dunning did his homework in the book department, name dropping ever author and how much their book was worth in 1983. But the story is chockful of cliches and mixed metaphores. This reads like a poor mix of every detective novel on the shelves. (I wonder how much a first edition Dunning goes for?) The writer's world of show me don't tell me does not hold Dunning back from telling us every detail of first edition books. I felt like I was in a literature class on how to open a store; not reading a mystery novel. Oh, yeah, that's in there, too; something about a murder or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"a really different mystery that will have you hooked","review":"I read this book when it first came out and have since read all of John's books. I thought this book was fabulous and it got me really interested in collecting first editions.

This is a first class mystery!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Pleasure to Read","review":"I've read close to a thousand thrillers and mysteries, and BOOKED TO DIE is one of the best ones I've read recently. John Dunning is a remarkably good writer, and the prose in this novel is first rate. The mystery story is well constructed, and the ending comes as a pure surprise.Of course, the main attraction of BOOKED TO DIE is its bookseller hero. Almost every major character in this novel is a book lover and collector. Dunning, a bookseller himself, provides a lot of interesting detail and insights into the way the book selling business operates. A lot of the details in the novel are admittedly dated (it was published in 1992), but I found them fascinating nonetheless.BOOKED TO DIE isn't perfect, and I readily agree that some of the supporting characters are thinly drawn. That being said, the strengths of this crime novel far outweigh the weaknesses. All in all, this is a very entertaining read and I recommend it wholeheartedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Curiosity Pays off in a pretty good novel","review":"As a book collector, I heard from a fellow bookman that I ought to try the Janeway series.

Boy was he right!This book was a joy to read, hard to put down, and when I did, I could hardly wait to pick it back up.We follow our hero, Cliff Janeway, as he makes the transition from a book loving cop (and ex-boxer) to bookseller. Along the way, he solves the murder of \\"Bobby the bookscout\\".The author takes us into the world of rare and first edition books and book collecting to a great depth, but as a reader it has just the right amount of details to make this fascinating world interesting.It is fast paced and well written. I am looking forward to reading the other books in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opens your eyes to a whole new industry!","review":"For starters, this book has a great plot, character base and some wonderful twists and surprises throughout. The thing I'll remember from this book is the in-depth description of the used book industry.

Not only did I learn a great deal about the 'used'book market, but I was kept in suspense by an exciting story -right on the very edge of my reading chair!I'm not, in general, a mystery story fan, so this is highpraise. Yes, the 'good' guys generally win and the 'bad' guysgenerally lose like all good detective stories, but alongthe way you will meet some very well developed, three-dimensional characters - and an ending where all the details arenot all neatly tied up.

I love books and reading, so all the technical details about what bookscouts do and how they operate was fascinating to me, and the plot involving a murdered bookscout and a notorious local criminal named Jackie Newton flies along. Read this book and then search out Dunning's other novels; you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enter the hard-boiled bookworm","review":"John Dunning makes the combo work for a fun read on two levels. His tough-guy protagonist can hold his own with the best of them, doggedly pursuing his brand of maverick justice, meeting and beating the low-lifes on their own level. At the same time he's a smart man whose passion for book collecting provides lots of insights bound to intrigue the avid reader.I recently read Julie Kaewert's \\"Un\\" series, which also involves the acquisition of rare books but with an emphasis on secret societies and arcane messages that give it an \\"Indiana Jonesish\\" quality. Dunning's tidbits about what makes a book valuable are more accessible and interesting, and his hero's brushes with violence arise logically from who he is. Kaewert's Alex Plumtree is beaten, stabbed, shot and otherwise assualted with a regularity that seems a tad excessive in the publishing industry. Besides, you've got to love a mystery that reveals one of its secrets in the very last line of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dismayed But Coping","review":"Is there not a conflict of interest when someone who is directly and/or indirectly profiting from a book publishes a glowing (but non-informational) review of the same book?

The vent visor does what its meant to do, and stays on well if you follow the instructions, but I barely have room to open my window its almost pointless to have, its more of an extra shade from the sun. The ends curve inward, letting water leak into the window, the interesting part is the back part of it has less room than the front part, therefore when I have the front part of the window down enough, the back part of the window is too far down for it.

Examples are weak."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine job","review":"The linear model lies at the heart of a wide variety of familiar statistical methods, including regression, anova, and ancova. Anyone with a professional interest in statistics must get to know it well. This book is a clear, well organized, and practical presentation of the linear model. It is not pie-in-the-sky or esoteric. It leads the reader carefully through the real world problems that are encountered in applying the model. The book can be read on several levels. It provides practical instructions for applying the model to various situations, but also quite thoughly expounds on the mathematical theory behind the model. The theory and practice are separate but parallel, so you can read as much or as little of the theory as you like, or as much or as little of the practice. This book belongs on the reference shelf of anyone who uses statistics. In a world where technical publications are priced through the sky, it is a relative bargain (1400 pages)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Applied Linear Regression","review":"An extremely comprehensive and well written textbook. Very useful as a reference on linear statistical models but at 1400 pages not a straightforward read.

First of all, this cd is nothing original, or even good. Its a riot that while the girls sing \\"girl power\\" and \\"I'm no cinderella\\" their costumes, actions ect are completely contradicting. If you have seen the movie, the girls dance in skimpy outfits and the big climax of the movie is when (gasp) The lead singer gets together with a guy. Wow. I am really proud of how my gender is being portrayed. Along with Hilary Duff, these so called \\"singers\\" are marketed everywhere.

On the contrary, there are songs by other artists too, making this not too repetitive or boring*The girl power- I like this CD because it is all about girl power.

After contracting a virus that went into pneumonia earlier this year, I gave up smoking (which was really keeping me from wanting to exercise) and gave this a dedicated try. I only skip 2-3 days a month. I have become addicted to this work out and I love the variations with it. I would not have been as happy with the set if I did not have the complete one. If I am short on time, I can just do the Slim & ^-Pack (abs) and Slim & Limber (stretching). Most days, I do the entire workout. Debbie is very pleasant and a good instructor. I like that she always includes a man. I am seeing very positive results in my body and overall health, strength and stamina. I am almost 50 years old and this is making me so young! I love it.

My only concern is that it does include some moves that could potentially be performed incorrectly, especially at the fast pace of some of them. Overall, excellent workouts--I would receommend doing the exercises slower than the instructor (half-pace) for the first two weeks until you have completely mastered the form. Even at a slower pace, this is still an excellent workout!

Those two moves in particular are too hard on my knees and there are alot of them in these workouts. I wanted something that would fire me up and inspire me to keep at it. I have Turbo Jam (I love Chalene Johnson) but I wanted to add something else into the mix for variety but this just didn't do it for me.

I noticed in the first round and again in the 2nd(haven't gotten to disk 3 yet). I thought at first, \\"Oh, I just am having a hard time keeping up\\" but I watched it and started counting myself. In disk 1 she does side crunches, it's like 21 on the right side and then only 14 on the left. So I just kinda pause it and do the difference and pick back up.

The book goes something like this...Feldman spends a few hundred pages defending the thuggery, classlessness, and corruption that is the University of Miami football program. It is a boring and pathetic defense, in which he blames administrators (wow, people actually want to emphasize academic integrity and sportsmanship?), the media (EVERYONE is just out to get the \\"U\\"!) and America (they hate us because we're black). Feldman, fess up: Miami is a pure embarrassment not only to college football, but to anybody with a degree from \\"Suntan U\\". Move on, folks.

The illustrations are enjoyable, if a bit gross. The storyline feels a lot like something that Pugsley and Wednesday Addams would do. The mischief that Morty and Ray get into is appropriate for 1st through 4th graders - if your kids are going to do it anyway, you might as well impress upon them the effect poor behavior has on one's character early. The moral of the story is left for parents to impart as needed, or for the reader to infer on his or her own.I bought this as a gift for a friend's son, a 1st grader, and he really enjoyed it. I will probably buy another to add to my son's library in a few years - I may buy it now and just enjoy it myself until he gets old enough to appreciate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preformax replacement belts","review":"I wish these belts did not need to be trimmed to fit the Preformax sander, but they do not fit unless you customize them.

The associated theoretical ideas are dealt with in detail, you can't finish reading a topic and be dissatisfied with what you get out of it. You come away with basic understanding, as well as the ability to design and start working with anything you read about. Remarkable.In all, great book..

Where MMORPGs strive to be something unique, this one fails brilliantly.I've read many reviews that say \\"OMG!!11! teh grafics r soooo uber cool!!111!!1\\". Children, one thing we've forgotten about games is that, sure, it can look great. But will you enjoy playing it? Will it give you the feeling that you're actually accomplishing something? This game does not.Let me share with you the negative points of this game:-Equipment price is outrageous.-Lag lag lag.-Nothing really interesting to do. Go out, kill, repeat.-This game is entirely PvP. Which means you're going to have 'veterans' come out and kill 'n00bs'. Not very fun for someone just getting into the game.-No point.

It was also boring to watch and listen to - the songs were not even sung by the popular artists that sing them on the radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"¿Highly Recomended?","review":"Be carefull, this is only an EP, the three tracks cover no more than eighteen minutes. Eight on the first tracks, almost five in the others two. The instrumentals passages, full of guitars and synths mentioned in the label's review are not here. The interest of this recording is his rarity, no more. Poor melodies, poor playing on the instruments, simple compositions on a kind of \\"soft prog\\".

You play a British spy placed on the Titanic to get back a diplomat's stolen copy of the Rubaiyat, but the plot soon thickens, enfolding your unhappily married best friend, a sinister stowaway, and a German graduate student. In addition to figuring out puzzles, you get to fence, fight, and talk (in a conversational system comparable to Baldur's Gate) your way through the ship as you avoid the guns and suspicions of your enemies as best you can. If you complete everything successfully and get off the ship, you prevent both World Wars and the Russian Revolution... if not, the results are worse than pre-existing history. Apart from seriously strange looking actors and (perhaps) a lack of replay value, this is a great game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disc did not work","review":"This product did not work on any of our computers, I tried different operating sytems but it would not work on any of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Recommend","review":"I really tried to follow this book, but I had a hard time keeping up with the poorly written text and mediocre examples.

The tape starts out with slow, simple steps, but pretty soon, they start stringing together complicated series of steps without demonstrating the women's steps in slow motion. Even when they demonstrate the Dallas Side Pass, (where the man twirls the woman around twice in less time than it takes to say \\"one-Mississippi\\") they slowly show the men's steps, complete with close-ups of the feet, and then show the pair dancing together at full speed, with no demonstration of the women's steps. This is how *all* the steps are demonstrated beyond the first basic steps. They must think that men need extra help with dance steps and that women need no help at all! But even the men's instructions are too fast to follow, as my husband found."},{"rating":"1","title":"There must be something better.","review":"I agree with the other reviewers that the instructors are great dancers but poor instructors.

There's something about them that is other (and greater) than the sum of their first impressions. This isn't to depreciate the obvious -- that Jann Klose is a truly gifted tenor, that the songwriting is honest and powerful, that the musicians are talented and energetic. There is, beyond all this, a current of hidden complexities, a sly wink to the listener that begs a closer look. The songs vary from the bright organic hooks of \\"One Little Chance\\" to the soulful and sexy \\"Real Easy to Say\\" without revealing the mechanism behind it all. It definitely has mass appeal, but doesn't sacrifice what makes it feel so genuine. Jann Klose is a talent to be dealt with.

There really isn't much original about this release. \\"Real Easy to Say\\" is actually a re-release of a cut from the Enhanced CD. Come on Klose, a greatest hits CD before you've even had a hit?

It was only by chance that I ever found this book as it has a rather ugly paperback cover and was easily hidden by the other volumes of the school library.

It doesn't have the bells and whistles of the more expensive rice cookers (no warming feature, no different settings, etc.), but it works well for cooking rice, it's compact, and reasonably priced. Prior to buying this one, we had another basic model made by another company that broke. We replaced with an identical one, and it broke as well. After going through two rice cookers, we decided to pay $5 more to get a different brand- this Panasonic. We have had no problems with it, and we also like the non-stick pot. With our old rice cooker, the rice would stick to the bottom of the pot, so we couldn't eat all of it. The Panasonic doesn't have this problem, so we can make smaller quantities of rice without wasting most of it.

I think I can just turn this on and walk away and not worry about burning anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"How To Help From Splattering","review":"Always rinse uncooked rice until water runs clear - removes excess starch to help prevent messy bubble-splatters and makes for fluffier rice. Before turning unit on, place a paper towel under the lid of the cooker (not too tightly) and fold the excess paper up toward the lid's handle. Paper towel absorbs excess steam-water, so no splattering at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is good","review":"I bought this rice cooker after I reviewed many similar products and compared them.

I eat rice several times a week! Well, when my Asian friend told me my rice would taste better cooked in a rice cooker, I didn't believe him, but he was totally correct. This is a great little rice cooker. Even cheap generic rice tastes great when cooked in this little cooker. It is not big enough for a family, but it is perfect for one or two people. It is easy to use and easy to clean. My rice tastes soooo much better now!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very nice, but small, rice maker","review":"I've had this rice maker for about six months and have used it many times with very good results.Pros: It's small, and can sit on your counter without taking up much space. It does a good job at turning itself off when the rice is done, although from time to time I've had a little browning and drying of rice at the bottom of the bowl, not a big issue. Seems to work fine with different kinds of rice--white, brown, jasmine, etc., even mixes like pilaf. The bowl is coated with a nonstick surface that has held up well so far.Cons: It's small--so you start with a max of 3 cups of uncooked rice. If you want to cook rice for more people you'll want a bigger rice maker. The bowl is made of a very thin metal, looks like aluminum. It's held up OK but I suspect that if you dropped it, you'd dent it, and it might not last forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient Cooker","review":"This small Rice Cooker is perfect for Singles or Couples.

I actually use it quite a bit more than I thought I would. It is nice to put it on and forget it until it's done.The hardest part is that you really need to rinse the rice well to prevent it from foaming over the top and getting to know about how much water I need to use for each grain type to get the right consistency.All in all I am happy with it and use it for multiple rice and grain type recipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"great at first","review":"If you've never had a rice cooker this thing seems great, but after having it 4-5 yrs and getting wiser I can list several cons that should keep you away:1. non stick coating easily comes off. This stuff won't hurt you initially but the accumulation of this and many other toxins in our world undoubtedly has a long term effect2. when the non-stick coating comes off it exposes the aluminum underneath. See above.3. The timer is way off and tends to overcook the rice, invariably burning the bottom. I have to use a separate timer and turn off the cooker manually4. When cooking the sticky liquid bubbles around the sides of the cover making a mess.5. It cooks much less rice at a time than advertised. As an aside, I don't use it to cook rice anyway because it burns the bottom.6. For anything other than white rice the cooking problems are worse"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spits starch & water out the top!","review":"The rice comes out okay. Unfortunately water and starch spits out the venting hole on the top and makes a big mess on the counter top. I would wet a paper towel and place it over the vent hole to cut down on the mess, this worked but was a hassle. I used this model for a couple of years and the rice would over cook on one side but wasn't a total loss. I donated it and am looking for a new one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great so far!","review":"Used it a few times. Rice consistency is pretty good.

It makes perfect rice and I use it for cooking grains, too. Works fast, is small, and takes up little counter space so I can leave it out. It is easy to use and very easy to clean. The rice doesn't stick to it. I like the fact that the button just turns it on and flips off when it is done. My old rice cooker had two settings but that just made the rice get hard and stick. Another thing I think is clever about this one (something you can't tell from looking at the picture): the rice paddle handle fits nicely in the pot handle, so you can keep it right on the pot. Perfect rice pot for cooking for two or three."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Rice Cooker for the Price","review":"Overall a great product.I've had the cooker now for about a month. I've cooked several batches of brown rice and regular rice and so far each batch has come out well. It is a bit on the slow side when compared to a stovepot preparation, but the lack of mess to clean up afterwards and the warm feature creates a natural steaming environment for fluffing the rice, so that's a definite improvement to be sure. It also takes up almost no countertop space so you can tuck it into a corner and let it work it's magic. Wish it came with the steamer basket though. :( It seems this particular model variant does not include it.My only complaint so far is the screw securing the lid to the lid handle has come loose and has required re-tightening a few times.Otherwise, so far so good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent cooker!","review":"I was reluctant at first to purchase a rice cooker that was so inexpensive, but after reading other reviews, decided to give it a try. Well, to say the least, we are very impressed with this little cooker.

This cooker made more of a mess, and it took longer to cook the rice than if I had just done it in a saucepan. The lid is too small, so water oozes out the top and steam escapes. I'm not sure I understand why the directions insist that you soak the rice for 30 minutes, and then, they say nothing about how long different kinds of rice might need to cook. I also get frustrated when instructions for several different models are combined, so you have to look for footnotes to see if a certain instruction applies to the model you purchased.I will try it one more time before I chuck it, but I'm disappointed in Panasonic. The name used to mean quality, but this is not a quality appliance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small and too flimsy","review":"We returned this product because it is too small and the bowl is thin and flimsy"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: THIS IS NOT A STEAMER!!!","review":"This is a rice cooker.

I make brown or wild rice, even an exotic black Canadian rice. I don't soak or rinse the rice (but may start).First I coat pot with olive oil spray. Measure in my water, add measured rice, usually a 2:1 water to rice ratio. I don't use the internal markings on pot.....Putting the water in first has eliminated any burning.

I've heard bad things about the DVD in this series so I'm not going to bother looking at it. The box design was horrible as it's confusing how to open it. The box is composed of two trays that goes out in opposite directions. Unfortunately due to some parts of the box sticking together, it's initially difficult to figure out how this works but I lucked out and was able to open it without making a mess. If the box is this much of a mess, I can see how badly they can screw up the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent dictionary!","review":"This dictionary is cross-referenced and contains many entries about items alas seldom written about in astrology, for example about several modern schools and methods like heliocentric astrology. The articles are not too long, just right for summaries and to whet the appetite if one is interested. Authors' names are mentioned with the articles. There are many tables and drawings. Although he occasionally includes a critical comment, the author seems unprejudiced in favour of a specific astrological school.

If you collect depression glassware and are familiar with Gene Florence's references, you will be disappointed with this author's. I would not recommend it.

This recorder has some good aspect - pretty good battery life, easy to use, has the divider button which is essential when taping longer segments and it's very compact.The negatives - and the reason I'm in the market for a new recorder - is the playback and recording. You get a TON of background noise on any of the three recording levels. The noise isn't just people talking; I'll be conducting an interview in a room, 5 feet away from the person, and when I go back to listen to the interview, the person is almost completely drowned out by a hissing. It sounds like a fan was right next to the microphone during the session.Needless to say, I'll keep using this until I find a different one, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone in the market.

WD did send out a replacement within a few days however after a lot of go arounds with WD tech support it turns out the second drive was also corrupted .

Although there are some hacks out there for accessing the drive using SMB for OS X, it is not a simple procedure and should not be considered a solution but more of a workaround.Also, although the Book World Edition II has a gigabit ethernet port, the backplane (the board that connects the hard drives to the ethernet port) is NOT gigabit.

Access speed are limited to your ethernet speed so access speed can be an issue for speed demons out there. However, contrary to popular belief, you do not need to install any software. Microsoft's built-in network manager can find the drive easily on the same network. If you want the drive for use outside your private network then you WILL need the software. Otherwise, there are a lot of sour grapes out there that do not know how to find a network drive. Word to the wise, the first time we put the drive on the network we had to turn the power off and turn it back on since it didn't get assigned an IP address on the router. So this method may be the trick you need to SEE it on the network.

It is incredibly loud, so hopefully you have some remote location to banish it. It is also incredibly slow. The documentation is minimal, and only implies that you can use the cosmetically altered Mionet software to access the drive. If you do manage to figure out how to log onto the web interface to manage the drive, you will be appalled at how slow the pages respond. Click... wait 4 to 10 seconds, your choice appears, click again... Web sites in Nepal serve pages faster than this thing that is ten feet from my PC.

I had hoped to use this drive to back up my files but it took too long and hung up from time to time, the WEII lights were still flashing like something was happening but my desktop was at rest.

Sure, I spent $1200 on a 1.2 TB Infrant and it came with everything, including Raid 5 and and Print/FTP server capability, but this box is less than a 1/3 of that.Good, cheap, easy to setup. Just don't use the Mionet Access Anywhere software. use the admin interface, add it to your domain/workgroup, create some shares, and mount them as network drives from your PCs/laptops.

I have used WD drives before without issue, so I didn't think twice before buying this one. I was enticed by the thought of accessing my data through a browser from anywhere in the world. DO NOT BE FOOLED. My drive continuously gets dropped or changes letter assignment, which makes backing up a nightmare. I tried using the WD Backup software but as I stupidly threw out the quick install guide, I am unable to get a product key. I refuse to put more money into this piece of junk. WHY would the company put a registration key on a quick install guide? How about a sticker on the disc? Ridiculous. I used it for the 30 day trial and have been struggling with it ever since.

It's been a little more than a year now, warranty expired, and I could no longer access the drive! If I power it down and up, I can see the management page or access a share for about 30 seconds before it essentially shuts itself down. What does WD tech support say?

But if, say, you wanted to use this drive as a NAS for a network of any size, this drive fails miserably.Why is that?This drive includes mandatory DRM features that make it impossible for more than one user to access certain files. Among these files are video files. It doesn't matter if you created the files yourself; if the file fits within the pre-defined scope of what is \\"banned from sharing\\" you're not going to get the file. Back to SneakerNet... or you can \\"fool\\" the drive by naming your file from file.avi to file.avi.txt... but why is this necessary?

However, I felt I should warn others. It is sooooo slow. I lose files almost everytime I move them to the external drive using the MioNet software that you are forced to use in order to share files. Retrieving files over the Internet is even slower than slooooooow. The drive has a hard time staying connected in the MioNet software (and thus, I'm sure this is why files become lost -- let me reemphasize: lost forever! -- don't ever move a file to the drive; copy them, and then do a compare to be sure they are there. Better yet, take my advice and DO NOT BUY THIS DRIVE!).The drive is a great idea.

Perhaps that is a product of Steve Perry finally becoming completely comfortable with his characters, perhaps it is the inclusion of Ellen Ripley.As with the other books, the pacing in this volume is fast and thrilling, keeping with the feel of the movies, and as is tradition with this series, the threat level is stepped up from the last volume so the threat is more horrific than ever- a massive Queen of all Queens, the Alien that controls them all and has the ability to telepathically control humans, as well.The character development is brilliant, and I love the way the author manages to include Ripley without shattering cannon. I was wondering how that would work out, but the Perry's handled it very well.Over all, it's a fast fun read and a nice conclusion to the trilogy: Earth Hive, Nightmare Asylum, and now Female War. I recommended it for fans of the movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Female War","review":"I thought this book would be better, but the end disappointed me so much.

In the movies and other books the story always ends with a good saying and/ or thought. This ended with no good things to say. Another thing- Wilks is my personel favorite character and he didn't even say anything in the end. And the character's stories are unfinished. There are hints of Wilks and Billie falling in love but it never really happens. Steve Perry should write another novel about Wilks and Billie with no Ripley. Or possibly even an Aliens vs. Predator novel with them. Just my thoughts and suggestions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Damn Good","review":"Personally, I found the third book refreshing as a ending book to the other two. I only had one problem with it -- the ending. I couldn't believe it ended like that! With Ripley blowing the planet up?

In this one, the two main characters join up with Ripley (from the movies) and return to the home planet of the aliens and capture their queen mother (queen of the queens) to release her on Earth so all the aliens flock to her, creating a perfect target for a nuclear weapon... you get the idea.

I read about half way through it and got so bored with it that I put it down and didn't pick it up until a couple days ago to finish it.The characters ARE NOTHING like they were in the previous books, if you read the first 2 and then read this one you would swear they were completely different. The actions, dialog, none of it seems familiar.The book also doesn't do a very good job of explaining things, and goes through a lot of dry boring spells and then jumps into action without really setting any imagery for the reader.Overall I think it was ok, I just would have rather had Steve alone finish it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy old Black & White Delight","review":"Tho' dark during the night scenes, you can still make out all that is going on on this DVD - and by the end, it really adds to the atmosphere! This is one of those afternoon film noir thrillers that I enjoyed so much as a kid - glad to have it available to watch again, with great performances by a young James Mason & the wonderful Mary Clare as the kindly old housekeeper ... or IS she? (Duh-Duh-Duhhhh!) Until Criterion decides this one needs salvaging, this DVD is the best so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Book","review":"I would not call this item a book. It is a calendar. There is one page for each month with a large photo and a couple of small photos. In the calendar square for each day of each month there are news items, movie openings, popular songs, TV shows listed in small print.What really frosted me was the collage of photos on the inside back cover. Along with Mt. Rushmore, the Statue of Liberty, and the White House were shots of the NYC skyline including the World Trade Center and the Space Shuttle! 1952? I don't think so!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out for one big error","review":"I haven't yet had a chance to read this book so ignore the star rating I gave it (\\"required field,\\" you know). The book looks like great fun.HOWEVER, watch out on page 243 and 244: the U.S. Senator behind the \\"Red Menace\\" scare of the 1950s was NOT Eugene McCarthy but Joseph McCarthy. Eugene McCarthy was the senator who ran for the 1968 Democratic presidential nomination on a peace platform. An editor at Barricade Books should have caught this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dream Zone Sleep Mask","review":"I ordered this sleep mask for my husband so that he could block out the light from the television when he's ready to go to sleep and I'm not.

I barely even stretched it trying to get it off my head. While it was on it was comfortable. Maybe I just got a defective one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny...","review":"I purchased mine from Duane Reade. I've owned 2 of these masks...the first one lasted about 3 years, and the 2nd one is still in pretty good shape after almost 4 years. It's very comfortable, and the back strap is long enough to accommodate even bigger heads, without feeling like your head is in a wrench with some of these other sleep masks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfied","review":"This mask was comfortable the first few nights, but after a week or so it became uncomfortable. It is too large; light still can come in near the nose, and it presses down on my eyes. It has also been the suspected cause of a couple of sties. However, it is very thick, and light does not filter in through the material."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok...","review":"This product works ok... but when I use it, it hurts my eyes because it presses on them a little too much.

Very soft, light weight, stays put. Even had a scent to it when you first use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than expected!","review":"I passed over this sleep mask the first time I saw it due to the reviews about the peppermint smell. I don't particularly like peppermint and my skin can be sensitive at times, so I was worried about that. I went back to it again and decided to give it a try. The peppermint smell is almost non-existent and it was gone after the first night's use. In addition to that, it is very soft and comfortable. I've never used a sleep mask before, but my husband insists on watching TV while falling asleep which makes it so much harder for me to fall asleep. This one is perfect and a lot more comfortable than I thought it would be. I do take it off if I wake up in the middle of the night. If you're not going to purchase this due to the peppermint smell, buy it anyway! Its definitely bearable and goes away quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over rated","review":"Not as comfortable as I hoped it to be.Wish it was a bit lighter and the band messes the hair and is too tight and the velcro stuck to my hair and bed.

The people aren't wrong. This mask is extremely comfortable and very effective at keeping out the light. The only problem I have with it is the velcro straps that adhere at the back of the head. The velcro always manages to get tangled in my hair overnight, and it's painful to yank my hair out of it. I would prefer that the mask instead had a band that would slip over the head, but that's minor. The mask really is very nice and so comfortable to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasted.","review":"The product was awesome, until the elastic band snapped a week later. Now, it's just a waste of money. Cheap material ruined this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleep Tight!","review":"This mask is fantastic! You won't be disappointed purchasing this one. It's comfortable and really shuts out the light.I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't smell bad!","review":"It has a scent but it's not very strong. I like the way it smells. I don't know what the deal is with all these people hating it. It's a weak aroma that's a combination of fruity and herbal. If you washed it off, it wouldn't smell at all. I would recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best mask so far","review":"I had tried a lot of other masks (most of which were much more expensive) and this is by far my favorite. The material is very smooth and doesn't irritate my eyes or skin. The strap, although a little bit rough, keeps the mask on through the night. It is the best mask that I have had at blocking the light. The only real problem I had with this mask was the smell. I have asthma and allergies, so I could not tolerate the smell. I ended up washing the mask in the sink with some mild soap. After it dried, the smell was completely gone and the mask was still in perfect condition.The mask is also very durable. I bought it over a year ago and it still in good condition. There are two small holes on the outside, but they are mostly my fault and do not make it less effective. I would (and have) recommended this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zzzzzz","review":"This is the best sleep mask I have ever had. The price is right too.

The mask is light and comfortable and fits well so the light is blocked out. No smell of lavender problem. A great price. I reccommend the mask."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Ok","review":"Short and Simple-I did not like the product. I found myself removing it in the middle of the night because I could not get comfortable with how the interior of the mask rests on the eye socket.Before I purchase another mask I will try it out before purchasing so I will know for sure it fits my specific needs since you cannot see a demonstration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please market this as SCENTED!!!","review":"Agree with others- this is a scented mask- the broker should honestly describe their product.

Find a mask with soft straps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Smell","review":"I received my mask a few days ago. I briefly tried it on and it seems to block enough light. Unfortunately, mine arrived absolutely reeking. It smelled like it had been bathed in incense or potpourri. I've tried airing it out to get rid of the smell, but no luck. This thing smells so bad I can't even use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality mask, but not for everyone","review":"This is a well made mask, scented, satin and looks much more expensive than it is. I wish that I loved it more. The problems that I had with it were threefold. First, it sits right up against the eyelids, so that when I move my eyelids, such as when I turn over at night, it puts pressure on the eye. This may seem minor, but the rubbing of my eyelids against the mask was enough to wake me up, and never before was I so aware of how much my eyelids moved when I sleep. The second problem I found with this mask was that it let light in around the nose area. There are satin flaps sewn into the mask that I guess are supposed to fold out and block the light, but these did not work for me. Finally, the satin material is slippery and doesn't stay on. I purchased another mask on Amazon, the Dream Essentials Sweet Dreams Contoured Sleep Mask, which was not as pretty, but works better on all three aspects for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine until the strap broke","review":"Title says it all. I've had it for a couple months now and used it not quite every night and it has been just fine until the strap came off on the end of the mask when pulling it off one morning. I'll be fine with hot gluing it but I wouldn't say it's quite worth it after my experience. It did have a strange perfume smell at first that I wasn't fond of but it went away completely after a couple days. I did like the padding over the eyes and the coverage is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Uncomfortable","review":"I bought this after seeing all the positive reviews. I've never worn an eye mask before so I didn't know exactly what to expect. I have to say, it's quite uncomfortable to wear. It's mainly the strap. I tried loosening it and that did help a little but it still hurts to wear it. Not only that, I'll wake up in the middle of the night to find that I'm wearing the thing half on my forehead because now it's too loose. I guess I'm not surprised considering the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"great lil product","review":"very fast shipping. the product itself is very comfortable. i fell asleep very quickly!! i work nights and sleep during the days, so i needed something to block out sunlight. i didn't feel like blacking out my windows. this handy lil mask does the trick. highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So soft and comfortable!","review":"I was surprised to find such a comfortable, adjustable and soft sleep mask for this price.

Straps need serious adjustment for it to be comfortable, but once i got that down I have been sleeping well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave me Contact Dermatitis","review":"This sleep mask is decently made for the price, but it's been scented with something that broke everything it touched on my face out in itchy, stinging welts. My eyes were almost swollen closed when I woke up after wearing it overnight. Dermatologist diagnosed irritant contact dermatitis and put me on Prednisone for 6 days as well as a cortisone cream...not to mention the fact that I looked horrible for several days. I do not ordinarily have sensitive skin, nor do I suffer any allergies. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nose Contouring a Problem","review":"I tried this one out because I had problems with a different brand slowly coming apart after 4 months. That one, at least while it was still intact, was very comfortable, especially in the nose area. This product, however, is less comfortable, mainly because there is no space for your nose to fit, so you may feel pressure--albeit slight--on the bridge of your nose, which makes napping and sleeping kind of difficult. It does block light pretty well, but I'd love for it to be more contoured to fit your nose."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLEEP MASK","review":"THE MASK IS TOO HEAVY AND THICK FOR ME, IT MAKES MY EYE AREA SWEAT.

I use it every night & I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great eye-pillow for once","review":"I've been having trouble sleeping because I have a really light room, but this eye pillow covers where others don't. It has a cushy feel and a therapuetic scent. It makes you feel like you're in a spa. Definitely recommend for picky sleepers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a dream","review":"Very simple, but totally does the job. The adjustable straps are very helpful, though they could use a little more velcro so that they could be made smaller for those of us with little heads. Keeps the light out, stays in place and doesn't put pressure on your eyes like some sleep masks do. Several customers have complained about the smell, but I can honestly say mine has very little odor. When I inititally opened the bag, there was a fairly strong herbal smell, however it seems that as soon as I got it out of the bag the mask was just fine. I catch a whiff every now and then, but it's nice and light. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleep Mask","review":"It's a nice product, the raised flaps on the inside are good padding for your cheekbones w/o having to have a heavy fabric layer on your eyes. Slips a bit if you roll onto your side, but then again, I don't keep the band tight at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does what its made for.","review":"Although I would prefer that the front of the sleep mask would be black instead of the moon and stars.

Overall Good Product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Very very very comfortable. I have no curtains in my living room and sleep on the couch when my parents come to visit.

I have three other sleep masks (mostly freebies) and none work as well or feel as good. The material is soft and it \\"breathes\\" -- unlike the synthetic materials I'm accustomed to in my other sleep masks. This one fits well, blocks out all the light, and stays on my head at night. Excellent! And, yes, I'm tossing the other ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"dream zone sleep mask","review":"The product arrived as described, although it just wasn't for me.

Find a mask that that has a nice strap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Always wake up without them","review":"I always wake up with the sleep mask away from where it should be. There's a design problem with the wristband, its thick and it has to go over your ears, which is not comfortable at some point when you want to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Designed","review":"I wanted to like this mask, and convinced myself the others complaining about the pressure against the eyes were being drama queens. They were not. It seems to be made of quality materials, and all of the fuss about the smell seems a bit overstated. Yes, it did smell of Eucalyptus after first opening it, but as you would expect, the smell fades rather quickly and by night time I couldn't smell a thing. However, the design of the mask is such that when the band is tightened at all, it pulls in on the mask, forming a crease of pressure perfectly aligned with the eyes. Yes, you can adjust so the pressure is across the bridge of the nose, but then light comes pouring in from below and above. I've had it for less than 24 hours and am ordering a different one as soon as I finish writing this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lease looses after long time use","review":"I got this eye mask about one and half yeas ago.

I did notice a slight aroma as some have mentioned, but I found it to be a pleasant one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sleep mask!","review":"Very pleased with this product. It is soft, adjustable and provides enough coverage to block all light. I read some reviews that mentioned a faint smell of peppermint on the mask?

It sits comfortably on my face and the adjustable straps are really nice. It keeps the light out without pressing too badly on my eyes.

I used it when it was scented and didn't have any trouble, although I prefer non-scented."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is odd to be so excited about an eye mask, but...","review":"This is an ideal eye mask, it is large in surface area, so it will have no difficulty covering your eyes, it is soft, and padded, with a wide, adjustable, comfortable headband to keep it in place. There is a faint smell of peppermint that emanates from the mask, which is great for a headache, but may be a turn off for you if you dislike mint. I am not sure that this scent is intended by the manufacturer, but for me it is a nice bonus. I bought two as gifts, and was so impressed I am back to buy two more for my wife and I. The price is quite low, but the quality is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really like this sleep mask!","review":"The band is nice and wide, unlike other masks I've used.

Had it for awhile and used it every night, until my 4yr old thought she was cool and wanted to wear it out with her outfit one day and it disappeared into oblivion. I will probably buy this again, most other sleep masks seem way too overpriced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fail","review":"Here's the short version: the mask is made of fine materials, but is neither effective at shutting out light (it leaks in through both the edges and the nose) nor comfortable. There are no ergonomics save for an adjustable head strap (velcro). Oddly, there are two fabric pouches on the inside surface that touch your eyelids; decidedly uncomfortable. I know it's cheap, but even then not worth it. Oh, and it comes heavily scented with some aromatherapy incense which I could happily have passed on; your taste may vary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pricey and strap irritates my ears","review":"I'm disappointed that 1) I paid so much ($8) for something that I would never pay more than $3 for in a brick and mortar store, and 2) the strap rubs against the back of my ears a bit too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"the strap is uncomfortable","review":"The mask itself is soft and comfortable and cover my face nicely.

I bought this item having low expectations, but since it was so inexpensive and highly rated, I thought I would try it. I am so glad I did because I've never slept better and longer. Not only has it allowed me to sleep even when it is light outside, but I feel like I am getting much deeper sleep and am more refreshed when I wake. Like another reviewer mentioned, it smells of mint, which is a bonus for me. I will probably order another to keep as a backup and to have for travel."},{"rating":"2","title":"its comfortable, blocks the light, its lite on your face and you cant beat the price!","review":"I got this for my GF and it's super comfortable, blocks the light, lite on your face and you honestly cant beat the low price to high quality ratio!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable","review":"I recently purchased this more as a sexual accessory than as a sleeping aid, but I think it can be used comfortably as both.

It is very easy to sleep with, allowing virtually no light in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Like It Should","review":"I like using a sleep mask because my bedroom has an window which gets the first morning light. I also travel by plane and train a lot. I bought this for obvious reasons and love it. It is comfortable and not too tight. Also, the inside of the mask has divots for your eyes. You don't feel like you are blindfolded. It is also cool, your face does not warm up. I like mine a great deal and am very happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it!","review":"The mask is great for the price and has a nice aroma. I generally don't like scented items like perfumes etc. but the scent of this mask is more natural and not too strong (seems to be eucalyptus).

I plan on using it with a Ruger Mark II pistol. If I do not like it, I will not be out much. Well the scope held up to the recoil of a NEF 243 handi rifle i set up for my son. However anything past 75 yards gets covered up with the dot. A 10 inch circle to be exact. Not a good choice for deer hunting. My son is 12 this year and I moved him into a 3X9X42 scope. Not as easy and fast for him to get on target but way more acurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Notch","review":"I can not say enough good things about Delaney's books, especially this one. Learning Criminal Law is an amazing tool by itself, but the thing that makes it really special is the way that it ties together all of the material in the previous two books in this series. Learning Criminal Law applies the concepts presented in Learning Legal Reasoning and How to Succeed on Law School Exams to substantive criminal law. Not only will this book help you learn criminal law, but it will also cement the Legal Reasoning and Examsmanship methods. The advocacy argument approach is also very engaging.

Starting in 1906, Imogen made pictures of the human body that stand out as the finest today. These images have been lusciously reproduced in this book that plots the history and progress of Imogen through her career. What a pioneering career it must have been. The subjects of her lens were almost unheard of in those days where the showing of an ankle was scandalous. She makes no technical concessions whatever; each exposure is exactly in needle-sharp focus and rendered in smooth gradual tones of the highest quality process. She must have had strict discipline to technical detail to have consistently produced this quality of images, there is no other way. I would have loved to have known her. The things she could tell a fellow photographer must have been volumes. You cannot be disappointed by this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before Her Time","review":"Imogen Cunningham brings to light an eye for the simplest beauty. The photographs contained within this book are diverse with studies in children, families, the male nude, the female nude, textures in nature and some in more familiar home environs.

This gauge is no exception in terms of build quality, but unfortunatley a narrow band AFR (Air-Fuel Ratio) gauge is not very useful. It taps into the car's stock oxygen sensor and as a result what you see on the gauge is a constant sweep back and forth from full rich to full lean. You get a pretty light show, but no useful information. Fortunately, Autometer will soon be releasing a wide-band AFR gauge that will include a Bosch wide-band oxygen sensor. That setup will provide useful information. Until then, skip this narrow band setup and save your money for something useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed... after looking forward to it for so long!","review":"I work with linens all day and a good iron is a must!

There were water spots every time I moved the iron back and forth over my napkins. On silk, it leaves spots! I found a better one (Panasonic NI-C55SR) for almost half the price, that seems to do the job and so far no major leaks, maybe one per job...

Enigma is so deft in its techniques that it often appears unintentionally beautiful, but there are no idle hands at work here, from Milligan's wonderful turn of phrase to Fegredo's full contact sensuality and van Valkenburgh's ability to maintain consistency while dropping the rainbow-floor out from under a scene into stark vacancies.

With 2 people this game is very fun because you can split up and do separate objectives or distract a tank while your friend places a C4 next to it. Aiming is not set up good because it is auto aim and is too hard to hit the guy that you want to. ememy AI is still pretty dumb and will aimlessy run at you. You can stand right in frount of a tank, up next to it and it can't touch you. More challanging than the first and better missions. Very bad level design. Not a very big improvement over the first.

He describes Gissing's writing and eating habits, his attention to clothes, his reactions to Italy and his people, and his opinions of other writers, and all this helps to clarify the novelist's character.

Who knew? I figured hey, if it's good for the kitchen counter, it's good for the car.Some Google-fu brought me to these Meguiar's microfiber cloths. They don't seem to do anything to my car's paint and they pick up a ton of dirt. Also, they're machine washable, but I prefer to hand wash them after each use then hang to dry. Each cloth is so thin, it only takes a few hours until it's dry.Yes, there's a little bit of yellow \\"fuzz\\" on the car, but only in some spots. A quick \\"dusting\\" does the trick. I mean, once you start driving, most of it will fly off anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Polishing Towel","review":"These towels are very absorbent for wiping down after a wash, but where they really \\"shine\\" is in the removal of glaze or wax haze.

I don't know what the color cars the previous reviewers had but it wasn't black.This has to be one of the worst drying cloths I've ever used and I've used many in the last 20 years. The car was never completely free of streaks until I used a microfiber cloth from Wal-Mart and completely went over the car a second time.Again, it may look like it does the trick on other vehicles but it won't work on a dark colors.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy","review":"Meguiar's products are just outstanding in automotive care and I would never question the quality of their products because i have never found one to be bad thus far."},{"rating":"2","title":"These cloths work good on my suv","review":"I could not ask for better cloths for those hard dirt jobs for my car and with these cloths they don't mess my paint up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection","review":"These cloths are great. I got them and used them right away on my Mustang. They left no residue, like little balls of yellow fibers which is always great. They did not scratch the car at all and absorbed a good amount of water so I could use them for a good portion of my car at a time. I washed them and they stayed together and perfectly washed my car again. I am very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Microfiber A Good Thing","review":"When washing or polishing cars, bikes, or chrome microfiber rags work the best.

Microfiber just seems to do a better job all the way around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great super absorbant towel for all tasks","review":"I use these all the time. Camping, cleaning, washing the car, etc. Super absorbant and soft. A great backpacking towel that is small, lightweight and dries you off fast.

I wish I had more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Microfiber Cloths","review":"I just detailed my Corvette and tossed the old cloths I had and purchased some new ones. I opted for the Mequiars and they were excellent. As with most of these type cloth they quickly absorbed whatever it is you are trying too remove whether it is detailing liquid or wax or the grime from a clay bar. I have to use several clean ones on each vehicle I clean however I have been able to wash them and get them back to their almost original condition. The biggest drawback i have is the cost for each cloth. I am shopping for a lower cost substitute. They are still worthy of a four str rating and the one star is deducted due to the high cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meguiar's, the good stuff!","review":"That's right!

That's because I have become an avid fan of Meguiar's products since I bought a Mercedes 7 months ago!This product I mostly use on the interior. It is like a magnet for wiping the dash and wood trim. You hardly need the sprays but they are good too. Keep one handy in your glove comparment.It gives a great shine on the outside whey you use it with Meguiar's Quik Detailer Spray. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Apparently, the quality of the Supreme Shine microfiber towels has declined recently. See comments posted on the Meguiars Online web site. They seem to be getting quite a few complaints. I found the towels I received to be quite thin. They also left some lint.You can get similar towels for less money at the big box retailers. You might also do some research on car detailing forums and find some internet vendors who sell better quality towels for about the same price."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm sold","review":"I bought a pack of the Zwipes from Amazon and 3 packs of these as well. When I first used these, I wasn't very impressed because these were a lot more expensive than the Zwipes. When I fold them into quarters they tend to slide around in my hand. However, after using these and the Zwipes, I must say these work MUCH better than the Zwipes. I don't have to use as many strokes to clean up the same amount of mess as I do with Zwipes.These are also much softer and thicker so when I quarter them, it's very plush. Also, the tags on these come off easy as they were designed to be used on automobiles.I'm glad I made the purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for waxing","review":"These towels work incredibly well for taking off wax.

I use them to finish drying any missed spots. I use it to remove wax and polish. I also use it with detailer sprays. While you can use any type of microfiber i like these because the edges are soft and the size is good. I have some other ones that are just small and the corners get rough after a few washes. Meguiar's however hold up nicely. I machine wash mine and have been using them for over a year. I'd say i can get about two years out of them.

Finally, I found a begginers class that was more in my speed, only to have them cancel it after 9 months of me joining.I started to search the internet feverishly looking for a begginers step aerobics DVD. When I stumbled across Kathy Smith's Timeless Collection. A blast from the past! These are the moves that I remember, with the right amount of cardio. I am able to follow Kathy's lead without fear of injury.Kathy Smith's timeless Collection, STEP WORKOUT DVD is GREAT!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Renovated?","review":"I like Kathy Smith's workouts, but after I viewed it I was disappointed since it was the same old step workout I used to do in the 80's with \\"renovated\\" music.

The problem with this item is that the blade is very nice and made in Austria but the handle is some cheap soft wood. After one partial use my husband had to stop using it because the blade was literally spinning in the handle and it was totally useless. I fixed it by jamming two round toothpicks and glue down into the handle to hold the blade in place. It seems fine now as long as my repairs hold but I would recommend you buy another kind of grass hook that is better made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"The card holder is very well constructed and the advertised red color is more rust, which I actually like better.

I am glad that I did not waste my money buying this book.

Honey and Christmas become best friends, and Honey learns the value of strong family bonds. Honey's brother, Willie-Boy, learns some lessons too from the rebellious 17-year-old Easter. I'm not sure where this book is best suited. The odd-ball characters will not appeal to readers beyond 8th or 9th grade, but some of the salacious plot lines make it inappropriate for younger readers (Easter invites Willie-Boy to go skinny-dipping and later they sneak off together overnight: she's 17; he's 14).I think the author has tried to cover too much ground and missed the mark all around."},{"rating":"1","title":"They are less good than they think they are","review":"This book turns motivational science on its head and provides the antidote to the common-place 'ra-ra' of self-help books.It is good for the occasional laugh...and little else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witch dress","review":"My daughter loved it and called herself a pretty witch not a mean one!

I had to pin the dress because it was a little big, but that was my fault for ordering the size that I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made","review":"I ordered this costume for my 4 year old. It was only $20 so I knew it wasn't going to be the best, but it was in pretty bad shape. The whole thing was wrinkled together in a ball, the black netting in front was all ripped up, and the two spiders that hold up the netting in front were barely hanging on to the dress. There was glue everywhere from they way they tried to attatch the spiders as well. I read reviews before buying, but they did not help apparently. I sewed it up and fixed all the bad spots.

This is a great gift for anyone who has the game, but may struggle with the subscription, especially kids who never seem to have enough cash. You may wonder why you should encourage kids to play video games instead of doing other constructive things - well, look at it this way - they're gonna play games anyway and at least this one is about being a Good Guy!

I know of no other book in English that provides such a concise and accurate analysis of the epic cycle. The only criticism I have (and this is minor) is that the author does not spend much time discussing the similarites between Homer and the rest of the cycle. In fact, he has more examples illustrating the differences between them. A good companion book would be The Tradition of the Trojan War in Homer and the Epic Cycle by Jonathan Burgess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was looking for","review":"This book does not contain the actual stories of the Epic Cycle.

Some of the arrangements are too simplistic and sound a little hollow. Maury Yeston's \\"Unusual Way\\" is transcribed here a half-step higher than Linda recorded it, which I understand is the original key. However, the original arrangement loses the beguiling eeriness that makes Linda's rendition so singular.The more difficult pieces in this book are the songs that truly stand out--\\"I Want More\\", \\"I'm Afraid This Must Be Love\\", and \\"It's Time\\". These arrangements remain true to the original recordings more so than any other song in the book, difficult though they may be to play.Overall, if you liked the original CD, you'll want to have this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"I purchased this iron about six months ago and it has already quit working.
