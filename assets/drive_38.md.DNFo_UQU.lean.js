The movie has several scenes lifted shot for shot from the comics I read in the 1960s. It is a conversion that respects the original material and offers changes that are reasonable where needed. Chris Evans does a masterful job in bringing Steve Rogers to the movie screen. His acting makes Captain Americas shield use believable.

This was the best action-adventure comic hero adaptation that I've seen in a long time. Evil villain, nerd becomes hero, beautiful woman, and of course, Stark Enterprises. :) Of course, it is formulaic. They handled it beautifully with just the right touches to make it real enough and funny.Now the shield as boomerang surprised me, not having read the comics, and I loved it eventually. Almost too exciting for my little self. It was great!Two other action/adventure movies I've seen lately are Thor (GAG GAG GAG) and Green Lantern (lots of fun). Captain America, however, shoots them both out of the water."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good superhero movie","review":"I think the best thing about Captain America was Captain America himself -- a nerd turned into a hero in a matter of minutes.

Effective World War II background for the story: the villain was over the top, but of course this is based on a comic book. I liked the suspended animation twist -- don't know if that was part of the comic books or not.

I was expecting something that was as cool, smart, and brave as the comic book. What I got was a bland rehashing of some hero-like story that was too focused on being politically correct rather than true to the comic book. This simply made it annoying and boring, rather than aspiring or relevant to today's kid. All in all, this was a fatal flaw with the movie. The acting was good, but this made the movie almost unwatchable.

It is almost as if the dialogue and the plot were written around the action scenes. The acting wasn't convincing. I didn't care about the main Character or his journey.

The cases are short but very interesting: Maybe the cases can be improved with more data base.

I think it's the constant vibrato. Yeah, I said it. I know lots of people do, but I myself much prefer this album right here - first one I ever heard, and is on a top several albums of all time list for sure. Strong punk rock influence on this record; with tight counter point melodies over basic chord progressions this album pulls off both epic-ness and simplicity in spades without forgetting about the subtleties that make music a joy to listen to. Great recording and mixing I think.

Piece of Mind \\"treads water\\"?????? Yeah right. That's the most innaccurate statements I've ever heard. Arguably every song on Piece of Mind is a ferocious rocker. Where Eagles Dare, Flight of Icarus, Die with your Boots on, The Trooper, Quest for Fire...oh yeah, those songs tread water. Moron. This first Maiden album is great too. Different sound. DiAnno is much more raw, and with far less vocal range than Bruce (one of the best singers in all of metal.) But there are some truly classic tunes on this, and, as you'll find throughout the entire Maiden catalog, fantastic guitar.

The first song, \\"Prowler,\\" sets the mood for the album. \\"Running Frree\\" is an amazing piece of art. \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" is the highlight of the album, with its fast talking lyrics and spectacular guitar riff. \\"Iron Maiden\\" is a classic, with out a doubt, introducing there pattented harmonic guitar riffs. So why not a 5th star? Paul Di'anno. Not that he has a bad voice, but it's better suited for a band like Def Leppard. With Bruce, the album would be perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic album that every Metal Head should have.","review":"Even though I am a huge fan of Bruce Dickenson, this album has a certain \\"raw-ness\\" that is very cool.

A Must Have for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"The entire album is PERFECT","review":"It is not the best Maiden album, but it's still amazingly perfect. I'll start by telling you that every song is GREAT, as simple as that. You name the song, and it's simply a masterpiece. Secondly, Paul Di-Anno is a huge vocalist. Let's not start with comparisons to legendary Bruce, but Paul is also excellent. I am especially in love with his \\"ooooh-yeah-hi-ye\\" screams (Running Free). Song like Strange World and Remember Tomorrow leave you breathless. I am currently listening to Strange World and just can't express my feelings (you feel like you're floating in the heavens). Get this album as soon as you can, even if it involves killing the salesman for 10 cents (do it at your own risk..) ITS THE CLASSIC OF ALL TIMES!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Di'Anno Will Forever Be Maiden's Voice","review":"As an Iron Maiden fan from the very beginning, I can say Bruce worshippers are clueless. Maiden's first 3 albums (Iron Maiden, Killers, Maiden Japan) are their best, and I couldn't imagine anyone on vocals other than Di'Anno. Number of the Beast was solid, Bruce brought a different (not better) theatrical element, but they were never as good after NOTB.FYI - Paul Di'Anno was not fired because of his singing, he was battling alcohol and drug problems (gee what a unique concept for a rock star)."},{"rating":"2","title":"So long for Dennis Stratton...","review":"This debut by Maiden is simply fantastic. Energetic, a little bit punk, heavy, coming from the heart. The lyrics were to improve dramatically in their posterior albums, because here they are extremely silly.This was the last album by Maiden featuring guitarrist Dennis Stratton. Because he was just a little bit older than the other guys, and because he listened to a lot of different musical styles other than metal, Dennis usually prefered to travel in the bus that carried the KISS road crew, when Maiden toured with Kiss along Europe, in 1980. THe boss Steve Harris did not like it, and that was the last straw for him: Dennis was fired and lost an once in a lifetime opportunity for glory and fortune...In came Dave Murray's old pal, Adrian Smith, and the rest is history..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Debut!","review":"We all know the Bruce Dickinson Iron Maiden era was the big one, but lets not forget how great Paul Di'Anno's asset to Iron Maiden was!

He was the first but certainly Dickenson has more musical talent. The first two albums were very similar. \\"Killers\\" is really part 2. The worst thing about the first two releases was most definitly the sound. Its obvious the producers were not taking the right approach, and is very unfortunate because it gives the albums a bland, 2-dimentional feel. \\"Number Of The Beast\\" in my opinion is when everything started coming together.\\"Piece Of Mind\\" is probably their masterpiece. After that it was downhill. The first two albums are indeed classics but fall a little short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first album","review":"not their classic sound, but for sure their classic style.The major stain here is the sound of the record itself. It is really old despite Brich's efforts at the time.Other than that the album is probably the best first album that has been recorded ever, since first albums are usually poor in style and tecnisism.With Phanton of the Opera Iron Maiden was showing that they were to stay, and not mediocrely, but to become a legend and inspiration for generations."},{"rating":"2","title":"fast and fantastic,a #1 for any real metalhead","review":"If you can sit still and not rock out to this,your dead and buried"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is so sad...","review":"Iron Maiden's debut album, easily the roughest and unpolished sound in Maiden's arsenal. This album features the punky vocals of Paul Di'Anno, the shredding guitar work of Dave Murray and Dennis Stratton, the driving bass lines of Steve Harris, and the slam of the drumming powerhouse, Clive Burr! This album is in the top 5 best list of Maiden's work which also includes the brutal follow-up, Killers! One of the most underrated albums of all time, and also the most under-produced album they ever made. Paul's vocals are constantly overlooked by \\"TRUE MAIDEN FANS\\", Iron Maiden did all of the hard ground-work with Di'Anno before they were discovered, so he deserves more credit than he gets. If you are looking for an Iron Maiden album to start with, this should be your first choice! It's always important to know where a band started! HAPPY LISTENING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing.","review":"Not much needs to be said about this debut except it is an amazing debut from the best band ever.

Among other classsics here are \\"Phantom of the Opera\\", \\"Running Free\\", and the catchy little Punk-rocker \\"Charlotte the HArlot\\". Though Bruce Dickinson (the best singer ever) wasn't on it, this album was an imprtant one for Metal music in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Destined for Greatness","review":"Any self respecting Maiden fan must own this cd, even though Bruce Dickenson is not on board yet, this cd gives great glimpses of what is to come.

Being born & bred Wisconsinite - I really wanted to like the book, however I found it unrealistic, for instance in one paragraph the character is getting a bad gash sewn together, then then next text is that it is healed in a few weeks. Also, the 'wild' area is not that remote maybe 50 yrs ago, or maybe the UP just maybe but not the area she talked about. Theres people there all the time now. Romance it was not.

In the movie, at the end, they show Willie getting on a bus heading for England. Skip is sitting next to Willie's parents. He gives his mom a hug and just gets on the bus, he doesn't pick-up Skip or doesn't say anything to him. There is no way that would have happened in real life.

And it' hard to believe that only two dogs were used for Skip; his appearance changes quite frequently throughout the film.If you want a recent \\"uplifting\\" family film, opt for \\"The Sandlot.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of DVD MY DOG SKIP","review":"MY DOG SKIP is a documentary that will bring tears of joy and grief to the eyes of the dog-loving sentamentalist."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD defective","review":"The dvd gave and error and we could not get it to work. The error was something like : cannot use in this area?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Parade of cliches","review":"I was prepared to like this movie more than I did. I love animals and, well, with \\"Skip\\" in the title, I expected a lot of cute animal stuff. Well, it was there, but it wasn't nearly enough. Roger Ebert raved about this movie; it's obvious now that his love for his childhood pet grossly clouded his usual Pulitzer prize-winning judgment. This movie is a compendium of tired cliches. The voice-over narration is truly laughable. I suppose the \\"messages\\" are \\"meaningful\\" if you've never seen any other movies. But if you have, you'll cringe at the ham-handed efforts of this movie to be \\"deep.\\" This is a movie with a well-intended heart, a heck of a dog as the lead pet, but short of execution. Don't buy this DVD - rent it (at most)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buried in the Heart.","review":"Like \\"Old Yeller\\" and \\"Where the Red Fern Grows\\" this is a story of youth and the pets we love and lose. Set during WW2 this is a story of a kid and a Jack Russell Terrier, purchased by his mother in spite of his father's protestations. But it is this dog the kid so desperatly needs to grow up and learn responsibility and about the cycle of life. A real tear jerker, this should be a family favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable movie","review":"This was a very enjoyable move...enjoyed not having commercials at the beginning to watch before starting.

It was a wonderful, loving, tear-jerker of a movie and reminded me of all the dogs I've had the honor to share a life with.

Richard Harris has done a great job explaining the most important parts of the language that no other book has bothered to cover. Harris explains the troubles that English speaks will have with the language and specific differences are explained in an English speaker's point of view. I have read over this book many times since I have been studying Korean and each time I get something else out of it. It is a definite buy for anyone wishing to learn the language or just want to simply learn what it's about. It makes an excellent reference for verb conjugations, phrases, numbers, and much more. If you want to learn Korean, this is the book to start with. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helpful for an absolute beginner","review":"This book has a lot of good information that will probably be helpful in learning Korean, but if you are looking for in depth explanations of grammar systematically, this is not the book for you. I suggest you find a book used in a classroom. The author gives lots of insight into the culture and history of the language and points out a few of the barriers that he had to overcome, but all in all, this book did not help me actually work with the language. He explains the problems that you will have, but he does not actually introduce the grammatical conundrums that bring about those problems. If you have a grammar book to go along this one, that might be a winning couple, but I do want people to know the limitations of this book. It is not a systematic and comprehensive Korean Grammar. You'll have to find that somewhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"I THINK THEIR THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I THINK THAT THEY SHOULD BE THE BEST GROUP IN THE US. THEIR NUMBER ONE!!!

He was as big as the Spice Girls, he also did a Pepsi commercial and then he was gone. Now he is bankrupt and everyone hates him. There is a growing backlash to the Spice Girls, and it will only get bigger, it just will. Were the Spice Girls even nominated for an MTV Award this year?

This film is little more than extended concert footage with silly and painfully unfunny sequences linked to them.

That isn't a good thing.I did not buy this album, but I have heard so much of it. They are everywhere! And with Geri flying the coup, they have become even more popular. This is music only a girl aged 5-13 could like. Light, fluffy pop music made by five (well, now it's four) very flashy and very wild women who have dented pop culture with the slogan \\"Girl Power\\".The music kind of grew on me the more I heard it on the radio and saw their videos on Muchmusic. While there are only two songs I actually like (\\"Viva Forever\\" and \\"Goodbye\\"), there is no denying their staying power. It took me weeks to get the song \\"Stop\\" out of my head. But to be sure, the music is basically garbage. And hopefully they'll know when to quit.I wouldn't buy this album, nor would I recommend it. But it is good music for kids.By the way, I like Posh Spice the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinky, yeah, but . . . .","review":"Okay, so Spice Girls kind of stink. The two stars are for Viva Forever and Stop. At least they were decent. Well, think about it. How would you like to go around the world and go up on a stage in front of thousands of millions of people? Nobody's stoppin' you! Be my guest. Still, Spice Girls really stink. There are many things that are much better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A blast!","review":"This movie is a blast - true, it helps to be a fan of the Spice Girls, but then again if you're not why would you be watching this film in the first place? The music is top-notch (although I'm still wondering why their cover of \\"Leader Of The Gang\\" seen in the film remains unreleased), and the acting is well done (in a sort of inexperienced Beatles / A Hard Day's Night sort of way). No, it's not an Oscar contender, but is is fun. As a former fan of the group (I gave up when Geri Halliwell left - she was my favorite) I recommend Spice World to anyone who wants to have a good time. It's fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't know, I just think they're FUN!!!","review":"I'm sorry, but I just really luv this album by the Spice Girls - if that makes me a bad person, then so be it!!My only question is, how could you not luv the Girls of Spice??In fact, this record is even fresher than their debut, and that's saying quit a lot!!! I don't know, I just feel that the sounds on this pop album are a bit bolder, more savvy, and even more diverse at times. While the first Spice Girls CD focused on fun bubblegum sounds, this one shows the ladies maturing a lot more, trying new rhythms, basically just being themselves.WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT, PEOPLE!!??Like Madonna and other entrepreneurs before them, these lovely British ladies had a fine Top 40 career - here's hoping they come back soon to us, right!!!How could you not luv this album??!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spice Girls...The Best Girl Band Of All Time!","review":"This cd is one of their best. It has great tracks (Stop, Too Much, Viva Forever). The songs have fantastic lyrics and great beats. Some are good to dance to and some are slow and relaxing. This cd has something for everyone...as long as you still like the Spice Girls. Some songs could have had more meaning and been deeper but overall this is a great cd. It has the lyrics with it so u can sing along and have fun. Ya gotta have it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than \\"Spice\\"!","review":"I got this for Christmas two years ago and I liked it from the start! \\"Spice Up Your Life\\" is a great song to put at the beginning of the CD. And it just got better from there.As for \\"Denying\\" and \\"Viva Forever\\", I have to admit I don't listen to them that much unless I'm in the mood to listen to those songs. But I still like them though.And as I said in my summary, I think it's better than their debut CD. In fact, I can't wait to get their new CD(if it comes out soon)!And no, I am NOT a teenybopper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love these songs!","review":"This is what I call pop music. All of the songs leave you with a certain feeling and that's always a good feeling. I like the way they distribute the parts to sing and the way the lyrics are set up. I've tried many times to write a song like them. I failed! There's only one Spice Girls! Keep up the good work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS MOVIE WOULD MAKE A GOOD MST3K EPISODE","review":"This movie had so many stupid stuff on that it deserves to be on MST3K.I bet Mike and the bots can save this movie from its misery."},{"rating":"2","title":"This c.d. is GREAT!!!!","review":"I absolutely love this c.d.. Even if you're not a Spice Girl fan, you've gotta love it. All the tracks are fun and catchy and make you want to get up and dance. The Spice Girls ARE talented, and this c.d. proves it.

And the Spice Girls are unleashed to an unsuspecting public. This effort is an attempt to cash in on the phenomenon before a fickle populace turns their attention to the next best thing. To be fair, the girls are not to blame for what a tedious flick this is. Rather, they are appealing and prove to be the film's lone redeeming factor. The fault lies in the script that tries to do for the Spice Girls what \\"A Hard Days' Night\\" did for the Beatles. Whereas the Fab Four's film was full of wit and cogent commentary on Beatlemania this flick is unfunny and basically incoherent about what it's trying to say about the Spice craze. I was reminded more of the Monkees' \\"Head\\" than I was of \\"A Hard Days' Night\\". Lots of celeb cameos (Roger Moore, Elton John, et al) that amount to naught. Oh, well. On to \\"From Justin to Kelly\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The best for this group...","review":"And that's not saying much. These girls are annoying and dead(not literally.) This is nothing but pure bubblegum pop, though not as cheesy as the first record. The only good songs on here are Never GIve Up on the Good Times(should have been a single instead of the awful other three) and Viva Forever. My recommendation? Buy the Viva Forever single-t's their only good song, and the rest of this piece...(except for Never Give Up, download that one) isn't worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALL SPICE","review":"It was good to see Roger Mooer James Bond 007 in a film again. This time he plays a character who looks very much like Blofeld. Instead of a cat he now keeps a pig in his lap. Very cool idea! As with David Lean's \\"Doctor Zhivago\\" it is about a few years in the turbulent life of the all-female Anglo-Soviet assembly. The Spy and Spice Girls have plenty of character, and that helps make up for the lack of action and adventure that keeps their movie debut from being a truly epic motion picture. The concert scene at Albert Hall in London was very reminiscent of Hitchcock's \\"The Man Who Knew Too Much.\\" It was kind of a 90's version on some of his themes as well as David Lean's and the Bond producers. However, it has a potential of being cult epic like \\"Austin Powers.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Um, this is the WORST movie!!","review":"Hello people?? How could you give this movie more than two stars?? It stunk. The acting was terribly fake and forced, which is sad because they are supposedly playing THEMSELVES. Or at least their FACTORY made selves! This is NOT a peak into their real world, because they weren't actually friends before they were famous, struggling to reach stardom. They all replied to an add in the newspaper for auditions for a group called the Spice Girls. The movie is just another cheap piece of junk that you gals can put on your shelf. Next to your Spice lollipops,lip gloss,books,CD's,earasers,pencils,perfume,dolls,actionfigures,barbies,posters,stickers,tatoos,pictures,magazines and ice cream!!

Although I enjoyed one or two of the songs on this album that are the sultry and slow song Too Much and the funky and upbeat song Saturday Night Divas the rest of the songs on the album don't make up for it. The only reason I believe that the Spice Girls are popular is because they are in phenomenal shape and are beautiful. They cannot sing if their lives depended on it. Personally I think that Melanie C could do so much better on her own without these untalented women.I don't know what is so special about the Spice Girls. I wouldn't be surprised that in 2 or 3 years from now the Spice Girls will be no more and I think that would do the music world a lot of good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um..... what was that?","review":"I'm begining to understand why The Beatles left England. This movie is the cinematic equivilant of watching paint dry. Here, at last, is a movie where one can miss 30 minutes of it and not miss any plot points. It's the kind of movie you shouldn't buy snacks for because there's no telling how long they'll stay down. This flick is as contrived and mindless as their music. But I suppose the point is that they made lots of money -- they certainly got my brother's [money]. I suppose it's my own fault for watching it. A good veiwing tip would be a full-frontal lobotomy.

It's supposed to be fun, and it is! Songs like \\"Spice Up Your Life,\\" \\"Stop,\\" and \\"Move Over\\" will get anyone grooving, while \\"Too Much\\" and \\"Viva Forever\\" (one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard, by ANY artist) prove that the Girls really do have talent when it comes to singing and harmonizing. A couple of the songs are a bit forgettable, but all in all it's tons of fun.As for all those people who hate the Spice Girls, you're entitled to your opinion.

That was when I was a HUGE Spice Girl fan, and would do anything to see them. I looked over the faults of the movie and just saw the movie because of them. Okay, well here's the lowdown:Plot: Simple, stupid, and it's kind of like an everyday thing. They try to get to this concert on time, it's pretty lame.Characters: THe characters the Spice Girls portray are themselves, and unless you don't know the Spice Girls, then you won't get how the act.The Acting Itself: It's not very good, like compared to the GOOD actors, i.e. Tom Hanks, Gwenyth Paltrow, etc... But it is suprising that they can act... somewhat.So then does Spice World deserve 2 stars? 1 star means it's completely lame. 2 stars means that it's on the edge of lame, but it's not good enough to be okay. It might appeal to people who younger, or are completely obsessed with the Spice Girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but strangely...poingant?","review":"This movie shows how the Girls got so far. It was not their looks (though they are quite attractive) or their singing (which they are also very good at). It was not in the end their planet subding image. It was the simple fact that when you get down to it...hey these girls are pretty decent people!! The Girls are not the finest actors and their own personalities keep poking through (ironically as they are trying to play themselves!!) and it turns out to the suprise of all that those personalities belong to the type of people you would rather like if you met them in normal life. More than any documentry does it make it clear who they are. It is all the more poingant because now that Geri is gone, that glorious quintet of girls thrown together who became best friends is over.

This is a good CD for those who like tongue-in-cheek radical songs and/or are interested in the 1960's anti-war movement.

It would be great for food education with children in particular, because this book is fun. It takes you from the time of the Pilgrims to our modern, \\"cook with ease and simplicity,\\" era. It's also interesting because the book contains clippings of actual recipes, and culinary how-to's. I also agree with the other reviewer, that fats should be and can be, easily replaced in these recipes to accommodate our modern diets. The recipes I have used are delicious, and the way they are presented helps to create a meal from that section, with foods that relate to each other. Very educational and worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full-Time Father","review":"Susan Mallery writes wonderful books and this was one of them.

I really liked the heroine, and I didn't have any objections to the hero - at first. But gradually, his obsession on feeling guilty about absolutely everything WORE ME OUT. I am not using the word \\"obsession\\" lightly. About half way through the book, I started thinking that if this guy started on meds to treat OCD, his emotional health would take a giant leap forward. Worse, it was spreading. The leading lady was normal and likeable, but by the end of the book, she was indulging in the same weird angst. I could barely tolerate her, either.There was a cute and funny (and way too long) love scene in the middle of the book. Where I didn't buy the housekeeper as the all knowing Yoda that the author obviously intended, I thought the thing about her clothes was mildly amusing. And I like that the Epilogue was set five years in the future.None of these minor points could save this book for me, and it is not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of money!","review":"Well, maybe I didn't do my research well enough. Maybe I didn't read all of the descriptions twice. Whatever. This book is still not worth the paper it's printed on.

This is how you create an appointment... This is how you open an email message... That's it!!!! Anyone with a half of brain would figure that just by using the thing; for some mentally challenged there are even manuals on the net.

I can remember the first time I heard this and I still can't believe how good it is. This album was recorded just after Eric Burdon and The Animals got through their psychedelic period.The best song here has got to be their version of \\"St. James Infirmary\\". This version just oozes blues. It's one of the best of many versions of this song. Also included here is a great smooth instrumental track entitled \\"Serenade To A Sweet Lady\\". When you listen to it the first thing you say to yourself is \\"This can't be The Animals!\\" Well, my fellow music comrades it is The Animals and definitely at their best. Also it's worth checking out the other great tracks on here. If you ever find this on a CD it's definitely worth picking up.

ANd they did that is 1968 when having a guru was supposed to be hip. The last song is is meandering mess though, it's twenty minutes long or so and is both good and terrible and the same time with a man complaining in the background. TOO many drugs lead to such bad songs, but this disc was of the psych period in which deluded people thought drugs would free their mind and most only got enslaved. Still overall this is a powerful cd filled with a great band still at their peak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Allergies?

For instance, I didn't know a food could affect another food's digestion process.There are charts provided in the book, which the author has graciously allowed to be copied. These combined with the information in the appendices help to plan menus.

This might have been news in 1966, but it isn't news now.The book not only preaches, it preaches badly: the author's writing begs for editing, as she clearly doesn't have much skill as an author. Clearly, though, the unknown press clearly doesn't have an editor on its staff.Well-intentioned, but much less useful than most other books on the topic.

Behind Live After Death and Rock In Rio of course, but people shouldn't just call this album crap because of its production and songs. You should at least give this album some respect for having Iron Maiden interact with the fans and... well, lets just say that the fans who were at the show thought the show was excellent! I wasn't there but I still believe in this album. The songs were exellent although they're almost identical to the tracklist on A Real Live Dead One (now that's an album that sucks!) but have better quality which earned this album 4 stars. I took of a star because the tracklist hasn't changed from A Real Live Dead One except the only different track which is Wrathchild so that kinda sucks.Nonetheless, I personally recommend this album to any Maiden fans... just steer clear of A Real Live Dead One.Up The Irons!"},{"rating":"2","title":"review for iron maiden","review":"I think this is a great live album but the problem I have is that maiden always put the same songs on every live record,I mean why not put differant songs on each of there live albums-songs like Infinite dreams-only the good die young-fugitive-moonchild-no prayer for the dying,etc.instead of using the same ones over and over-just look at Real live dead one and this one, the songs are all practicly the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a Remastered cd!

This issue came from 1998. When I bought mine 3 years ago, it was advertised as \\"ENHANCED\\" [DIGITALLY REMASTERED]. This is a total lie and a waste of money. The CD you want was produced in 2002. I bought three other \\"enhanced\\" Iron Maiden cd's and I got scammed on those as well. The packaging on the 1998 and 2002 are identical. Make sure you buy the 2002. Maiden pisses me off for putting out way too many repeat cd's of the same material. They use distorted lawyer words like \\"enhanced\\" and make different song compilation cd's.

The hero is an Earl, sold into Military conscription at 12 by his hateful father. He's a \\"brooding wounded soldier\\" but so much more.I am surprised that I enjoyed this romance as I don't normally enjoy \\"royalty\\" romances, as the heroines tend to be \\"too stupid too live\\"-but this series is different as the 3 Princesses must fend for themselves-and the years in exile have made them savvy and street smart.The bedroom scenes are VERY well written and highly sensual.

They have #1 hit singles on the radio, and their music is featured in popular TV shows and in some big-brand commercials. Most Kiwi music is... interesting, but not necessarily worth owning the CD. OpShop, though... what a great band. None of the musicians are virtuoso performers in their own right (no blazing guitar solos), but the band is very tight, and the tunes are well written and have that stick-in-your-brain quality. The songs are not homogeneous in either album, but there's definitely a 'sound' they're working on. They've got a bit of the Coldplay sound in their later album, and some of the guitar licks from the 1st album remind me of early Our Lady Peace work. Overall, a great band - \\"Second Hand Planet\\" is a definite buy.

I feel that I belong to a weird cognoscenti who \\"get it\\" - that is, those who who are stopped cold by Peter Dines' harpsichord/electric piano in the \\"Hearts and Flowers\\" theme song and the rest. The electric guitar work by Miller Anderson and Spit James reflect excellent chemistry in how they weave together. There are some excellent blues riffs yet their music was tight. To date: never heard such a unique keyboard riff as by Dines who later joined T.Rex. \\"Just To Cry\\" is insanely sweet blues. I found this thru CD Euroexpress a CD from South Korea a few months ago. If you like British Blues, imo, this is an absolute *must* - the highest end but a lamely ignored masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"How come?","review":"How come this superb album is available in Germany at this moment (see amazon.de) but not in the US?? Maybe it's because Keef Hartley is much better known over there? I saw the Keef Hartley Band at a festival in Germany in the late 60s, and what a blast they were! They blew the bands which were to follow them - among them the yet-to-become-huge Pink Floyd - off the stage. Off course, the KHB's music has nothing in common with PF's, but those were the days when you would get the most incredible combinations of creative bands in one show.Pity the price of the album is quite high, almost 18 Euros, but to my mind it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undiscovered treasure.....","review":"wow! This band is incredible! they have it all; playing,singing, and great songs!!! Highly recommended!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"Possibly the finest blues/rock album ever made. Excellent musicianship all round, and guitar work on a par with Clapton, IMHO. By the way, Spit James didn't totally disappear, his real name is Ian Cruickshank. He plays and teaches gypsy jazz guitar in England. Look for him on his own Fret Records website, or type in \\"Spit James\\" on a Google search and pick the first website that comes up. It contains links to information on Keef Hartley, Miller Anderson and other members of the band. If only Polygram Records would remaster this one along with \\"The Battle of North West Six\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"May well be the best album of its genre ever!","review":"I have loved this record for more than 35 years.

In addition, the literary style is excellent. The style is so exciting and compelling that it is difficult to put the book down. It is reminiscent of Tom Clancy's novels. While the \\"cold war\\" is often portrayed as finished, in much of the current media presentations, this novel illlustrates the many threatening scenarios that can arise out of a world that is supposedly at peace. Again, an excellent historic and real presen- tation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top-of-the field; incredible book; makes you think!","review":"This book got me going from page one. A lot of people say that about a lot of books. But this book has an unbelievable ability to grab you and keep you. I was sweating from the first few minutes! The climax was totally unexpected. It left me literally out of breath. I've read thousands of books. Not many have this effect. While this is a technothriller, one thing I, as a woman, really liked was that it had good character development and a lot of humor. It made me care about the people, and about our country's future. It's patriotic, without being sappy or ridiculously macho. I've recommended it to dozens of people. I'm eager to see how the author will top this one with the rumored sequel! Get it and pass the word. This author's on his way up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hi-tech bedside thriller at it's finest!","review":"To touch the not so distant \\"reality\\" possibilities from our so-called peaceful nations around the world is scaringly more possible than we can imagine. This book amazingly captures the realizm of things to come, shortfalls of our defense system in the United States and oh so close the reality of things at hand in the not so distant future. Complacency is unacceptable when it comes to protecting the U.S.A. You will have a very different outlook on defense strategy after reading this book. You will be astonished, overwhelmed, and highly entertained! Hats off to the new \\"Clancy\\"!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intensely paced action with accurate detail.","review":"Many thrillers - no, make that many -books-, lose a lot of credibility by making errors in the details. Ross sets forth a scenario that is original as far as my (active) reading in the thriller genre can see. He maintains credibility for the scenario by not dropping the detail ball. No magazine changes in revolvers here...when someone makes that kind of error and then expects me to believe they know what they're writing about, it falls flat. Ross' work stands tall. Another thing I really liked about the book were the 'everyday heroes' in it. Heroic folk and actions portrayed realistically - neither the 'loser turns over a new leaf' fantasy or cardboard superheroes. A very impressive first effort. One of the great things about reading a great first novel is looking forward to following the writer's career. More, Mr. Ross, more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping thriller with deeper impact...","review":"I haven&#65533;t read a lot of techno-thriller fiction, but if Tom Clancy is even half as good as this I might give it a try.

Movin' It On is an energetic anthem. Swingin' Mama is a no-nonsense 12-bar instrumental. After hearing it on the radio, I originally bought this album for the long guitar piece Blues for Al and Peggy (6:50), but that is not my favorite song. Frankie's Blues is infinitely bluesy with great lyrics: \\"I got two little children, but they don't favor me. Now one look like a Chinaman, the other like a Japanese.\\" Now if that doesn't give you the blues, what does?"},{"rating":"2","title":"You are not wasting your money!","review":"The last song is the best.

Man, was I ever disappointed. You can barely hear Martino, production is very lackluster, songwriting just ok, and here is the worst part - the male singer is so bad, that he just ruins the record, making it really unlistenable. Dee Dee is a great singer, but this guy is really terrible. Get the real thing - RTF, or go for the later Stanley Clarke albums, which are excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this edition","review":"I bought this publisher's edition of \\"The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre\\" and was sorely disappointed. The glossy texbook-like binding is strong enough, but the text is set badly and on inferior pulp paper. I would not be surprised to learn that this is a rebound trade paperback- although it does not seem to be of high enough quality for even that. The price tag on these editions is completely unjustified. Buy the trade paperback.The book: excellent. This edition: bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"ready for raw!","review":"this is a hidden jewel of a cd. probably not the most well known, but certainly deserving of it. playing more of a texas style of blues, mike morgan picks his guitar to produce the ear pleasing sound. some amp pumping tracks - pretty woman, nothings going to be all right, you better watch yourself. whiskey/smokey smooth vocals. very much worth the listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Giver","review":"This was a wonderful book.

When Ponyboy finds himself hiding from the police because he and his best friend are wanted for the murder of a member of their rival gang, it is clear to Ponyboy what type of life he can expect. Things seem as bad as they can be. But will Ponyboy be able to come to terms with who he is or will he remain just another Greaser? Find out in The Outsiders. Even though The Outsiders was written in 1967, S.E. Hinton's portrayal of gang life is as poignant today as it was then. Though the dated slang and the trite ending might turn off young readers, Ponyboy's struggle with loyalty and the search for independence are timeless.SynopsisA revealing picture of the tension between loyalty toward friends and family and the struggle for individuality in the life of a young gang member."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"Oliver Twist is a wonderful story.

Figured since it was free I should check one out. It was surprisingly quite entertaining! Its not an easy read. There were times I thought if I were reading this during my teenage years, I might have read over an entire page without understanding what I just read. (The author goes a bit too far describing the scene sometimes.) But for the most part, quite enjoyable. Lots of drama, action, and mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oliver Review","review":"Oliver Twist was not one of Charles Dicken's best works. Being one of his first novels, he was paid by the word. Because of this fact, the book goes on and on about subjects and often has chapters that have very little relevence to the novel's actual plot. Dicken's had great writing skills and definetly had the potential to write excellent works, however Oliver Twist was not one of these. Although the plot of the book was interesting, this 500 page book could have been summed up in about 100 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, Boring, and Tedious","review":"I really didn't like this book at all. I'm a classic literature reader, which is why I picked it up in the first place. It was my first Dickens novel, and I was so disappointed. To me, it seemed to be more about those darn criminals than anything. Judging from this book, I don't like Dickens' style of writing: too wordy, unclear, and imprecise. I swear, the guy could go on for pages talking about a piece of wood if he had to. I got so bored, the words just started slurring together after a while. However, its story about how a boy of poverty becomes rich in so many other aspects is quite touching. But the journey of getting to that point is LONG, BORING, and too TEDIOUS for me to stand. Possibly, if I were a boy, I could relate to this book more. I would, however, recommend this book to anyone who likes a drug-out mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is a mess","review":"It may be surprising to know that this is one of the cases in which the movie is a lot better than the book.This book is literary garbage, an over-written mess with a terrible story.The main problem has to do with just how ridiculous and convuluted it is. If you've seen the musical movie, prepare for a story that is not only different but of poor construction. This is likely from its serialized roots. The convolution would be fine if the work was not written in a ridiculous amount of detail that muddles the already fuzzy story.People also complain that the book is anti-semitic. A top criminal is referred to as a Jew. That claim is ridiculous. If you know a lot of crime fiction, you'd probably know that there are a lot of Jewish criminals and they usually are identified by that detail.I adore the film, which is classic and has great music. Stay far away from this book, which IMO is bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK at times- overall boring","review":"I read this book as an assignment and really did not enjoy it. I thought the characters were not very developed and as mentioned before, Dickens was paid by the word and I think he went off on tangents that had little or no relevance to the overall plot. At parts it was fairly amusing but most of the time, was boring and drawn out."},{"rating":"1","title":"A force feed book!","review":"This book is the worst book ever. The only reason a person should read this book is if they are forced to or they like to hear about thieves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"The strength of this particular edition is of course in the delightful original illustrations. They incorporate the sharp wit that pervades Dickens' work. In terms of plot development 'Oliver Twist' is not Dickens' strongest or cleverest novel, but the story is simply delightful. The characters are deliciously convincing in their respective likeability or odiousness, and each and everyone one (apart from poor Dick and Nancy), seem to come to their well-deserved end. It is certainly a Dickens' lover's must-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dickens classic at an unbeatable price","review":"Charles Dickens' \\"Oliver Twist\\" is regarded among the 19th Century's greatest works of fiction in any language. With its vast array of characters and vivid depictions of the lower rungs of Victorian society, this Dickens classic--an extraordinary study of social Darwinism--will remain such a classic for years to come. Of course, this is not just a cold-eyed \\"study\\".

There was way too much description for the stupidest things. I know, it is interesting to know how the characters look, and this book does do that. But, his comparisons were drawn out and boring! Dickens would be writing about Oliver's trip to the country with Rose and Mrs. Maylie, but he would end up talking about angels in heaven and how their cheeks were a similar shade as that of a kind of flower. I mean, this is a very creative way of describing a flower, but that is not the point of the story! And when that description occupies two or three pages, the reader becomes a little discouraged(not to mention bored!!!!) I've read David Copperfield though, and Charles Dickens' writing style seemed to have evolved into something much more tolerable. Unless you are easily amused, I don't reccomend this book for anyone under the age of about 17."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Dicken's Best- Drawn out and boring","review":"Oliver Twist was certainly not Dicken's best work. It carried on and on about irrelevant issues that did not relate to the novel's actual plot. Although it depicted the lives of the lowerclass in the Victorian era fairly accurately, it showed the upperclass as \\"good\\" people trying to help the lowerclass; This was obviously not accurate.

He never disappointed and I think Oliver Twist so far is the saddest one. (which is alot to say considering the fantastic dramas in all of his books) I call Dickens' books 'Prego'--Spaghetti sauce-- because like the old commercial, whatever you want, it is in it. The potential to be good, evil, be a victim and perpetrator, to be heartless and to be generous...all in his books. A wholesome reading experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenominally excellent!","review":"This book was an absolute classic. Dickens (and Twain) were the geniuses of dry humor, and this book is no exception. My only concern is that this material may be \\"mis-applied\\" to the present, and may heighten in some readers a sense of wealth-envy, what with Dicken\`s rather unflattering characterization of the rich. Readers must read Dickens with a full understanding of the time in which he lived, and not draw too many parallels to our society today, which parallels i would opine are as frequently mis-placed as otherwise.Note: I apologize if there are any glaring errors above.

While I do not consider it a 5 star book, it shows many sides of Dickens. It shows the harsh conditions of Victorian England very well. But it also exposes us to Dickens cynical sense of humor. One case is where the magistrate who is suppose to judge a case is comically unaware of the case. Also Dickens presents us with dramatic irony in that Fagin (the thief) treats his boys better than the legitimate firms. Dickens also provides us with a wide variety of characters. Also, Dickens provides us with an interesting situation in that it is clear that the legitimate firms do not hesitate in their abuse to Oliver. Fagin clearly DOES have a conscience. His concern for Oliver is genuine when Bill Sikes goes into his psychopathic rages. Furthermore, Dickens makes sure we feel a slow and agonizing pain when Fagin is arrested and doomed to die."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame, lame, lame","review":"Yeah I agree with the reader from \\"My Computer, Of Course\\".

Which means that if anybody dosen't like this book, than, basically, they DO have a right to review this novel.(The only exception is when they post it repeatedly and insult others who disagree with them.

Well, here's a view from a Freshman in HS. This book totally blows. It has some good moments during the action sequences, but in all honesty, Dickens makes this story way longer than it had to be by straying away from Oliver and the thieves. It's not exactly the most absorbing story to read.

Charles Dickens and super gifted and no one should appreciate that. One should appreciate the hard way of learning and thats what normal people do ... they grasp the material with efforts. genius' have the easy way out and thats the main example of Charles Dickens. And anyways who wants to read about an orphan. You know that it'll always be a happoily ever after story that can no ppoint, no class, no morals, and no pride. I encourage people to read A Tree Grows IN Brooklyn, an easy to read novel that actually tells you something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sure To Excite Very Emotionally","review":"This old-time classic, written by a genius of a writer was perhaps the best book I have ever read.

The tag is rather irritating, so I decided to remove it. It appears as though the tag is just sewn onto the upper end of the support, and that you can just remove the stitches and be rid of it. Wrong. The stitches that hold the tag on,are the same stitches that are used to put the brace together. If you cut the stitches, you screw up the integrity of the brace. I expect mine will fall apart a lot sooner than it should now.It would have been nice to have some sort of warning to not remove the friggin tag.

I found the story flimsy and obvious, the acting over done or boring, the characters uninteresting, the lighting frequently too dark and overall aggrivating.I do love Altman, and appreciate his stamp here.

My opinion about this movie is not a good one. I watched it with a group of friends and none of us particulary cared for it. It was very slow, predictable. The scenes were dark and there was alot of mumbling among characters. Being from the south, I have to disagree with another reviewer here, I don't think the lead character did a very good southern accent. Robert Downey Jr. actually had it pegged a bit better, in my opinion. I can see how some would like this movie, I generally like movies of this type, which of course is why I rented it.

The music alone is so melodramatic the film can't keep up. The story wanders until the last half hour or so, when everything, including a metaphorical storm that's been building since the beginning breaks in a beautful mess. This might be the worst film I've seen in ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as ambitious as usual for Altman, but succeeds on its own terms.","review":"One could see this as 'Short Cuts' correlativeopposite. That was a movie with great ambitions, that - while good -fell just short. This is a movie of much lesser aim (just a good tensethriller/mystery), that's much more successful on it's own terms.The acting is very good throughout. It may be my favorite KennethBranagh performance; understated and subtle. And a number of the scenesreally are tense. Altman finds some clever ways to create suspense withsound and image that aren't just retreads of what we've seen before.Admittedly, some of the twists are pretty creaky and predictable, thelogic sometimes questionable, and the moral POV of the film is a bitconfusing.

The soldiers broke up the monotony of jungle life with run-ins with local wildlife and villagers, especially the local women.

But to his grandson (Drew Fuller) , who doesn't expect anything, he has issued a list of things to do before he can land his ultimate gift. This is to be accompished under the watchful eye of his lawyer and others.Believe it or not, Jason, the grandson, accepts the challenge.

With songs like \\"Weekend Warrior\\" and \\"Chains of misery\\",It is obvious that this is not the maiden we remember from the 80's.The vocal effort is clearly lacking on Bruce's part.The only songs on this album that remain true to Maiden are \\"Childhoods end\\" and \\"Afraid to shoot strangers\\". To put it Bluntly this album is Maidens worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"good album?","review":"The few songs that are excellent on this album are very good.The ones that are not as good are still ok.The worst ones (3-4 of them) are still not bad.I think Iron Maiden is totaly awsome, but I like the older albums way better (I'm listening to a 1982 Maiden album as I type this).If you get this, keep in mind that the songs that sound stupid get faster and better,way better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still worthwhile","review":"Why do people constantly slam every album that Maiden released in the nineties? Honestly, if so many people decided to desert Maiden ten years ago, why bother jumping back on the bandwagon? This hardly touches this brilliance of their earlier material, but that does not make it the fiasco many people call it. This album has more good songs than bad, and even the bad ones (mostly) are well-intentioned, though a couple are just plain awful. So rather than babbling about how horrible this is, realize that maybe a band that declines doesn't die instantly."},{"rating":"2","title":"standard, excellent music from Maiden","review":"While I believe that \\"Somewhere in Time\\" was Maiden's best work, this album was full of great tunes.In standard fashion, Maiden had the harmonized lead guitars, the awesome voicework, and non-stop energy driving this album.While the next album with the pretender vocalist really sucked, this album was top notch and gave metal fans like me something good to listen to, as opposed to the grunge crap dominating the airwaves."},{"rating":"2","title":"though toned down a notch, these guys still RULE!","review":"iron maiden cleaned their act up a tiny bit on this album, getting into issues and straying from satanism. they did great"},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favourite Maiden album...","review":"Never could get on with this album. I thought No Prayer For The Dying was average (a shock for a Maiden fan from the old days) but this one is downright awful. I was moderately hopeful when the single of Be Quick Or Be Dead was released, but this album crushed those hopes.

Be Quick or Be Dead (10/10) A great opener like classics \\"Invaders\\" and \\"Aces High\\"2. From Here to Eternity (8/10) Hell ain't a bad place. But this album is.3.

There is something wrong with Bruce's voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated Gem.","review":"Bruce Dickinson started to change vocally here but it was their mid career and it was before the band really aged. It has some darker lyrics and a more mature sound to it. It starts off with a fast opening track, Be Quick or Be Dead which is very heavy and has a lot of speed metal in it. A few songs are slower and have a progressive sound to them with a dated early '90s production which gives the album a classic sound. It has some slower paced songs with progressive influences but it's mostly straight forward heavy metal and more stripped down than Seventh Son. The lyrics improved a lot after their lackluster effort, No Prayer For The Dying. Fear Of the Dark is a truly underrated album and I still listen to it regularly. Chains Of Misery, The Apparition, The Fugitive and Fear Is the Key are my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid effort with gem","review":"A solid effort here with a gem - it shows that there is still some magic left.Childhood's End, The Fugitive, Judas Be My Guide - these tracks hold up with any classic Maiden album.Afraid to Shoot Strangers starts off slow and initially did not grab my attention but as the song plays it finally hits its stride, although it takes 2:45 to get there.The title track 'Fear of the Dark' ranks as one of their finest songs, ever.Weekend Warrior, Wasting Love, and 'From Here to Eternity' are solid tracks. Apparition and 'Fear is the Key' are the weakest tracks on the album, enjoyable but not up to the classic Maiden standards fans have come to expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stupid assholes....","review":"Anyone who is a Maiden fan who says anything against this album should kill themselves.

The classic good Iron Maiden -> riffs , solos , rhythmic melodic guitars and very good vocals by Bruce.

Unfortunately this is the last good album...............after this...the chaos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best , but it certainly doesn't suck!","review":"Many are complaining that this doesn't sound like a Maiden album and a lot of the songs are out of character for them. That's true but that doesn't mean the material is weak - just different. If you like Bruce's solo stuff then you'll love this album because that's mostly what you get. To me, the last four songs are the best, maybe just because the two songs before those are pretty bad... but it really kicks into high gear with The Apparition, Judas Be My Guide, Weekend Warrior, and Fear of the Dark. A fantastic finish to an album that seriously drags in the middle portion. Out of the twelve songs, four should have been left out, which would give you the Maiden you're used to - an album with eight classic tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but great.","review":"No doubt about it this album is good. The hits \\"Be Quick or Be Dead\\" aong with \\"Fear of the Dark\\" are fantastic songs. Maiden mixes it up a lot in this album. Some slow soft songs... some fast paced heavy songs... and then just a few with a mixture (Fear of the Dark & Judas be my Guide). Now... I would recomend purhcasing Piece of Mind, Powerslave, & Number of the Beast before this one. Still this is a good album."},{"rating":"1","title":"A SHADOW OF THE ONCE GREAT BEAST!!","review":"This was Maiden's worst until Steve hired Blaze!!

That's why Bruce Dickinson left the boat ( to produce great solo albuns ). This \\" FEAR OF THE DARK \\" shows Maiden reaching the lowest part of their career, producing unbeliavable horrible rock songs like \\" THE APPARITION \\" and \\" WEEKEND WARRIOR \\".

Even though they sounded old and tired every song was decent. \\"Fear\\" is a total hit and miss affair. A first for Maiden. A crack in the armour that has only gotten worse since the unspeakable horror that is Blaze or whatever that singer's name is. Don't even get me started on Gers. The biggest long haired [person] that ever strapped on a guitar. Not only are his guitar solos utterly horrific he is the worst heavy metal performer in history bar none. Prancing around the stage like a long haired ballerina in tennis shoes. I saw them on this tour and the arena was half full. In the 80's the same arena was so packed you couldn't movean inch. Alas, a sign of the times. Nirvana and Co. single handedly destroyed our beloved 80's metal. Bruce saw the writing on the wall and bailed out just in time.

The technique of having the characters unwittingly ask questions that reveal attributes of the Man, are also powerful, at least the first few times this technique is used. The person who wrote this book clearly must have been a reflective observer of humanity.However, I was most disappointed by the ending. After going through a litany of 14 individuals whose lives have been warped by their own or others' evil, the author constructs an ending that would require people choosing to do good! Nevertheless, I did enjoy the flavor of the ending, and how it reflected the Cold War era in which it was written (1961)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but only 5 Songs","review":"The choice of songs is pretty good, the quality is good.

Ray Murphy, a pick-pocket and con man, and Claude Lawrence), a straight-living bank teller, are complete opposites who cross paths in a 1932 Harlem nightclub. In order to pay off their debts to a local crime lord, the mismatched pair travel into the Deep South on a moonshine delivery only to be framed for murder by a racist Southern cop. Sentenced to life in a Mississippi state prison, the bickering duo spend the next 65 years trading barbs and planning their escape, while forming an unlikely but touching friendship. They finally escape substituting dead bodies for their own in a arson-fire - and end the movie together watching a Yankees game together. There are a few good laughs, but it's not what one would expect from the two comedians - it's more a friendship movie that develops over time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not The Funniest, But Still A Great Movie!","review":"Okay, so most people were expecting another \\"Beverly Hill's Cop\\" or another \\"Bad Boys\\" LIFE wasn't the all time funniest movie...but it certainly wasn't the all time worst movie, either.

They'd served 65 years for a murder they didn't commit, framed by a local sheriff while buying moonshine whiskey for a Manhattan club owner to whom they owed money.

They'd served 65 years for a murder they didn't commit, framed by a local sheriff while buying moonshine whiskey for a Manhattan club owner to whom they owed money. In flashbacks we see this odd couple thrown together (Ray is a fast-talking con man, and Claude is a serious man about to start work as a bank teller), the loss of Ray's watch (sterling silver, from his daddy), the murder and trial, the hardships of Parchman, and the love-hate relationship of Claude and Ray as they spend 65 years bickering and looking for a way to escape.

Stross shovels on an unbelievable amount of jargon from page one, and that's all there really ever is. I never got the sense that Stross was ever interested in making this more than an bolted together mess of the current hot topics in Sci Fi.The characters are two dimensional, poorly formed and motivated, and undergo almost no development. You never get the sense that they're anything more than jargon mouthpieces - with the one exception, they largely march through the plot, never really taking in, reacting to, or feeling anything. The bold print passages that link what I'm assuming were formerly independent short stories seem rushed. And don't even get me started on the endless run-on sentences...In the end, I'd hoped for a lot more given the hype surrounding this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"i don't get it","review":"It is rare that I am unable or unwilling to finish reading a book. I couldn't even make it through the first 50 pages of this one. [My worst all time is Arthur & George that my wife insists I must read, but I can't seem to make it past the second page of that one.] I felt obliged to finish the first story in this book. I don't know why. It was awful.I have no problem with Stross' muddled vision. The problem is his writing style is absolutely horrible. Don't believe me, select \\"random page\\" and see if it grips you.It feels like the author is struggling to be clever in each and every sentence. He fails horribly.I don't get the book. His over-reaching style clouds the story that he is attempting to tell.There are much better alternatives available. Don't buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pretty amazing book.","review":"I've read most of Stross' work, and enjoyed it all. This book was a roller coaster of ideas, using the history of a key family to pull the reader along. Was it complicated? Yes. Was it very technical? Yes. But that's all part of the fun. I really enjoyed this book, and found the future history it proposes frighteningly believable and just around the corner.As for it becoming dated and irrelevent too soon - I just re-read the E.E.Doc Smith Lensmen series, where space ships were controlled by teams of people doing calculations (no computers), but that dated content didn't make the series any less enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts great, then dissolves into gray goo","review":"The first 50 pages of ACCELERANDO were exciting and insightful and mind-blowing and fascinating and fun.

Given all the praise for this book, I was sharply disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great collection of stories in novel form","review":"Charles Stross has written expansively on the concept of the Vingean Singularity, where the rate of technological advance increases so rapidly that the future cannot be foreseen. In Accelerando he charts the course of three generations of the Macx family before during and after the singularity.The novel was originally a series of self contained short stories and is very episodic. As such, there is a series of events that are all resolved within the same chapter only to come unravelled at the start of the next. However, all the smaller story elements fit into a greater arc chronicling humanity's rapid rise, obsolescence and recovery.Stross's writing is excellent, although computer literacy is a must. Indeed, this isn't an easy read but it is quite a ride and well recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't bother to finish it","review":"I attempted to read this, got about 60 pages in and decided that it wasn't worth the effort. I didn't like the main character, didn't care what happened to him and wasn't impressed with the authors attempts to think of 17 radical ideas before breakfast and then include them all in the book. The first several chapters read instead like short stories that were a showcase of all the amazing ideas that the author came up with but were only thinly linked with the other chapters leaving the plot somewhat disjointed and incoherant. I've mentioned in other reviews that it takes a fair bit for me to not finish a book once started but so far i've been unable to convince myself to finish two Charles Stross books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meme keywords, cut and paste","review":"Next to no science in this science fiction- it's mostly a world of reimagined legal and business systems that don't hold even fictional water. As for the style- meme spew."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snapshots of the future?","review":"For me this is Charles Stross's best book. In a sense though its not a complete book, more a collection of short stories, keeping most of the same characters, at different moments of the future. That's is strength for me, because each story is quite strong and deals with a specific theme, but I can see that others wouldn't like that.Another attraction is wish fulfillment. If the future was like this, I'd be happy :) It's a bit like Bank's Culture novels and wanting to live there - not that this book is anything like the Culture - it's humanity's journey from now to 'post-singularity'.If you want some fascinating speculation on what life will be like for us in the technological future I have to really recommend this. There isn't another book quite like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you hate plot and character development, then this is for you.","review":"While I will acknowledge that Stross' depiction of the future is imaginative, this book is devoid of both plot and characterization.

But the author throws out so much confusing technical jargon and ideas and concepts that much of the time I'm left bewildered as to what is actually happening.

He loses his glasses, but his girlfriend finds them.At this point, there were three hundred and thirty-five pages left, but I wasn't sure I could handle this much excitement. Good luck to those who buy this book; be aware it is available as a free and legal download."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been a short story","review":"Yes, yes, I know...this was based off a series of short stories. Unfortunately it should have stayed that way. The writer, IMHO, tries to be too clever by simply throwing as many concepts as he can at you and \\"seeing what sticks to the wall\\" so-to-speak. For true, post-singularity reading joy, I'd recommend the Culture series of novels by Iain M. Banks."},{"rating":"2","title":"hard core singularity scifi","review":"An excellent look at the next century from an author who not only believes in the singularity, but looks beyond to see where it will take us on all levels. Good hard science, but interesting characters too. It's presented as a series of chapters which appear at first almost like a collection of short stories, but in reality they link together seamlessly. This almost put me off when I first saw the structure, but it works brilliantly, and allows him to cover a century in detailed chunks, without having to write a 15-novel saga.If you've enjoyed other Stross novels, or other hard sci-fi writers like Alastair Reynolds, then you will love this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mess","review":"This is the second peice by Stross I have read. I think I am done trying this auther out. I personally don't like his style but let me give one insight into this book. It is a constant bombardment of tech buzz words thown at you untill you bleed in awe of his techie-ness. Somewhere in there is a little bit of a story... kinda."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is incoherent- incomprehensibly written","review":"This book is incoherent. I read plenty of Sci-fi and saw some of the rave reviews and thought I would try this novel. What a mistake- I could not get past the first 30 pages. After that I just flipped through the pages without reading them to see, in vain, if something would grab me. I could not understand what was going on, or what this book was about. I dont understand how someone could write so incoherently. A possible explanation is that some of the reviews mention that this book was originally separate stories.I think the author has a great imagination, is creative and has innovative concepts with respect to cyber technology. However, none of that resulted in a novel that I could comprehend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry sci-fi...sigh","review":"A mishmash of the latest techie memes, linearly extrapolated into...well, NOTHING. One can almost see Mr. Stross checking off items on his list of technologies as he writes. Sci-fi guys, study nonlinearity and chaos, then crank up your imaginations, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very very bad.","review":"Maybe the first third of this book could be described as fairly interesting. The last half is a massive slog through very boring and seemingly random characters saying and doing fairly ad hoc and meaningless things.At times, it sounds like the author is simply spewing out random ideas through whichever random character he chooses to use at that moment. The character development is absolutely horrendous. By the end, I couldn't care less what happened to any of them -- it was like some bad episode of Lost wherein people just go back and forth on the island, pop out unexpectedly, and say random things to each other...I _hate_ to get into a book and then feel so utterly put off that I don't want to finish it. Unfortunately, that is what happened in this case. Don't bother trying to read this. Really."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 1st novel to tackle the singularity as it happens","review":"Stross exponentially sumersaults the reader through a technological singularity. Concepts I found interesting: Economy 2.0, the subtle dissing of objectivism (even though I like objectivism), Matrioshka brains, and the descent into resource canibalism. As for suspension of disbeleif, the depicted singularity did start a little fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible writing","review":"I find it amazing that people can actually read this book. The writing is some of the worst I have ever experienced. There is no smooth flow. I got about 30 pages into it and just couldn't take it anymore. It seemed to be more about clever techno-phile BS than anything substantial. Avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hip for me","review":"While Mr. Stross is bursting with some amazing ideas, he really lacks a clarity of prose and exposition that leaves me feeling like I got bees in my brain. Grab your tech dictionary, acronym list, and a lot of patience for this one. I gave it a good try based on all the good press and the Hugo nom, but it gave me a headache."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"This was a painful read. I bought this and Glasshouse together to read while recovering from surgery. Thankfully, I had also purchased some other titles because after forcing myself to finish Accelerando I could not bring myself to even start Glasshouse.I enjoy when an author creates their own vocabulary to express new concepts but Stross takes this practice to an uncomfortable extreme. The number of new concepts being presented along with their associated descriptors was disorienting and hard to follow. Somewhere around the middle of the book, I decided to stop trying to understand the details and just focused on finishing the larger story. I was disappointed again. The End did not justify the means.My opinion: Accelerando as a destination is not worth the journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good approaching-the-singularity tale","review":"Writing style somewhat jerky. Tries to be too clever in places. No unity of time/place.... But this is a story about a jerky, accelerating future, and I find it overcomes those handicaps and fairly rattles along, spewing out thought provoking ideas all over the shop. Recommended for Iain M. Banks, Vernor Vinge, and Greg Egan fans - perhaps not recommended for those who prefer their SF to verge on the techno-thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite Stross book so far!","review":"When I find an author that I like, I usually buy everything they write and devour it. Very rarely does this fail me, but with Stross I have found him very hit or miss. Singularity Sky was a hit for me. This book was not. I haven't even finished it as the characters are so whimsical and alien to me that I can't really care about their futures.To credit the people who have written positive reviews, it is CLEVER writing. The concepts are unique and interesting, but I just don't care what happens to the characters.In short, I like most of Stross' works, but this one didn't do it for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome service!","review":"The bulb on our tv burnt out on Father's Day morning!

Waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Raw Beginning","review":"As almost everyone notes, the first Fanclub album suffers from poor sound and underdeveloped material.

This is one of my top 5 albums of all time and I have a lot of albums. If I was on a desert island, it would be there.The grooves have worn very thin indeed. I also do not feel compelled to write these reviews, but I feel the need to talk about how great this record is. I wish more records were produced with this sound.A word of warning though. this record is very different from their others, so if you are expecting that, this aint it. But give it a chance, its way better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still an underdeveloped album.","review":"This is the only Teenage Fanclub album I am mildy displeased with. The production of the tracks makes every song sound the same--at least the first few times you listen to them.

I like TFC, and think Bandwagonesque is probably their best effort, but there are some really great songs on this. The first cut -- great, great chord progressions -- is probably my favorite TFC song of all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rather good","review":"This single was released at the same time as the \\"Death to the Pixies\\" album. These are simply live versions of songs heard on previous records (they were all recorded for a radio station in Chicago in 1989). If you're buying it as an import, it might not be worth it a steeper price, but there are some interesting changes from the album versions that you might want to hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"A clever series","review":"From the back cover: \\"This is the liberated gourmet's guide to cullinary fun and games.

There was no plot, and Gary Cooper, a find actor gave one of the worst perfomances ever recorded on film. The one bright spot in this movie was Grace Kelly, and I wish this film hadn't been re-edited, which cut a lot of Grace Kelly out. The title song which won the Oscar, is played insesently, which cause it to loose whatever quality or charm it had. Overall, this movie was so utterly boring and inane that it is one of the greatly overated films of its time."},{"rating":"1","title":"tic toc... tic toc...","review":"If you're only used to more modern westerns, this one will kill you. It's is almost shot in real time (meaning that they show the clock constantly, and it's as slow as the movie). Sadly predictable by today's standards.The notion is unique and brilliant, but the movie isn't entertaining. It's borderline annoying.I'm way off base compared to most reviews here, which is why I started out stating \\"If you're only used to modern westerns...\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"High Noon [ 60th Anniversary Edition] Blu-ray","review":"For a movie 60 years old the film had all the definition of seeing it in the movie theatre as a kid I remember seeing it on the silver screen in 1952 as a small boy. The audio was surperb. I once had it on the old 12 inch \\"LASER DISC\\" and the Sound track was terrible!!. What people don't know about this movie is the running time of the film is 1 hour and 25 minutes and all the old clocks in the movie are running in sequence to the film's real time. The movie starts off at 20 minutes to 11:AM on the clocks in the film. So in 1 hour and 20 minutes it's 12 noon and the train pulls in. At five minutes after noon. the film ends giving you 1 hour and 25 minutes and the film is over!!?. Check it out yourself. This why the film is an education in time factor (relative time verses real time. It's a classic short running film, but this time factor is what makes this short running film a classic!!."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Classic Movie","review":"One of the all time great movies in a collector's edition that includes some fun extras.

This is a movie you can watch over and over and never get tired of seeing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll love this DVD","review":"This is a big western classic but you'll love this film even though you don't enjoy westerns. The nature of the film is to analyze human behavior and characteristics. I think \\"Cat on a hot tin roof\\" (Elizabeth Taylor, Paul Newman) can be good shot to compare. They are absolutely the same styles, but only the athmosphere is different. There is no classical western action with exited cowboys and indians. Also the special features has very satisfactory interviews and nice narration. Quite a good shot for classical collectors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore the purported allegory","review":"I've long heard the claim that this film was intended as an allegory regarding the then ongoing search for communists and \\"fellow travelers\\" in the American film industry. Be that as it may, the film stands apart from that context as a simple and powerful story of one man's refusal to ignore his duty despite his fear and the potential consequences. As such, the film's purported message - that a town full of cowards and shirkers represented America at large during the McCarthy years - is left far behind. High Noon remains a great film because it so clearly surpassed the intentions of its creators."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 Disc Ultimate Edition","review":"I can't believe someone gave this film a 1 star simply because he wasn't pleased with Amazon's write up of the film.Yes, it is remastered, and yes its filled with an entire disc of special features.And yes, the actual film itself is an absolute classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Movie","review":"I actually saw High Noon when I was a child. While I liked it then as pure entertainment, over the years I have come to appreciate the pure artistic achievement of this film. In many ways it is a product of it's times, a cinematic answer to the House Unamerican Activities committee and the witch hunts of the times. Some view it as a straight forward story of good vs evil but it is the many shades of gray that I appreciate in this movie. As a film, it is quite simply, beautiful and I know of no more compelling opening scene in any movie. The cast is outstanding from the high minded Grace Kelly to the scheming Lloyd Bridges but as with everything in the film, the characters are multidimensional. Bill Clinton once said this is his favorite movie and perhaps because it is a \\"Western\\" it has never been ranked with the \\"great\\" films but I certainly would put it in my top 10 greatest films of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and Riveting! A Must See!!!!","review":"I am not a westerns fan or a fan of black and white films, but as an assignment for a Liberal Arts course I needed to watch this film and compare it to Individualism.As I was watching this film... I got so engrossed in the whole thing that I had not jotted down one single note! I had forgotten about the piece of paper!My heart actually stopped when the clock hit HIGH NOON!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gunman is Coming","review":"First of all, I have seen High Noon but not this particular DVD so I can't comment on the special features.The film itself is a pretty interesting concept for a western. Gary Cooper plays a local sheriff who learns he will soon be facing a quartet of armed outlaws when the final one arrives on the noon locomotive. Grace Kelly plays his wife who happens to be a pacifist. Other performers include Katy Jurado and Lon Chaney Jr. As time ticks down, Cooper attepmts to get others in the town to join him but ultimately no one is willing. The film plays out essentially in real time on a single day and there are no gunfights until the final shootout. Overall though, the suspense and acting actually build up to the final scenes. Overall, a pretty good western."},{"rating":"1","title":"May have been good in it's time but now it's just dull.","review":"Maybe since the basic theme of this film had perhaps not been explored yet when it came out originally it might have made more of an impact back then. But having just seen it recently in 2004 I don't see anything particularly interesting. I had to fast forward through several parts because it was so mind numbingly dull. It's very eery theme song complete with odd horseclopping sounds are granted 'mega cool' but they just don't carry a dull old movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"More information, please!","review":"Is this DVD restored in any way?This is pretty basic information missing from the Amazon review.Note on the rating: The website does not allow posting without a rating.

Gary Cooper, Lloyd Bridges, and Grace Kelly.Grace Kelly's credit is in a diagonal list of some dozen or so other players.This western diverged from its colleagues because it is about duty, responsibility,selfishness, greed.

This manifest contempt by the studio for a large segment of the home video market is especially amazing considering that my DVD version of High Noon has closed captions. Has thumbing their noses at millions of cinephiles who want the option, for varied reasons, of turning on English subtitles or closed captions now become standard operating procedure at Olive Films? My hearing is still fine, but my wife is a non-native English speaker who needs English subtitles to catch all the dialog. Besides, my hearing won't always be perfect, and I can strongly empathize with the plight of those with impaired hearing. So I intend to wail until a decent studio offers a decent Blu-ray version of this magnificent western."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Showdown Western and one of The Best Ever!","review":"No other western reaches this level of suspense in such little time. Gary Cooper is perfect as Marshall Kane who stands tall and alone against a bunch of outlaws. Grace Kelly, Thomas Mitchell, Lloyd Bridges, Katy Jurado and Lon Chaney Jr. are all excellent in support. Fred Zinneman directs this one in 'real time', repeatedly showing us faces of clocks to remind us that the showdown will begin at noon, this elevates the tension and suspense. The last shootout is also memorable. Dimitri Tiomkin's score is one of the greats and his song; 'Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darling' is the best theme song of any western. One of the all time greats. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 10!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR WESTERNS OF ALL TIME.","review":"\\"High Noon\\" is considered one of the best westerns ever made, there are many reasons why this movie is so appealing. The first thing that the audience notices is the great cast, everybody did a great job, there isn't a single weak performance. \\"High Noon\\" has 2 superstars from that decade: Gary Cooper & Grace Kelly.The plot of the movie is very good and interesting, and as the film moves forward it gets more and more interesting. By the way, \\"High Noon\\" was filmed in \\"real time\\", because everything happens according to the time in the watch.During the last 25 minutes of the movie, the suspense grows increasingly until the movie reaches the climax, so the film gets better every minute.

Chaudiere pool, one of the most beautiful places on the island, is not mentioned.Poor organization is made worse by a weak index.

(I know Frank Herbert fans would argue vehemently against me.) But Hollywood always wants to capitalize on commercial success and squeeze every dollar possible out of a concept. So many story arcs and sub plots started in the second movie are abruptly dropped or never pursued in this final installment of the trilogy. It is as if the movie makers suddenly said \\"Oh @$%, we gotta finish this movie - QUICK!\\" The plot shift is so drastic and unbelievable as to be almost comical.My Advice: See and love the first Matrix, then never, ever watch the following two movies.

Matrix Revolutions tries, but fails, to be a none stop action flick! The movie has nothing new to offer, and it has a very limited collection of cool action scenes (with the exception of some few very notiable scenes like the Zion fight sequence). The end battle with Smith also called Super Burly Brawl is no super at all.

Of all I think the second was the worst, but it is a close running between the third and second.

I have followed this trilogy since it's start and I have completely understood the meanings behind this movie. To follow it correctly you need to have seen every aspect of the story in the Animatrix, The Matrix, Reloaded, Enter the Matrix(Game), Revolutions. What a finish! The story is extremely deep and the action is awesome. This final movie left me feeling fulfilled and amazed. This story is about love, trust and belief in the greater good. This has been the best ride of my life since Star Wars! ***** Five Stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, this movie SUCKS!!!!!!!","review":"The first Matrix was incredible. The second one sucked but i sat through that one without too much of a fuss. But this one was basically \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\" with a gun here or there.

The Matrix has been an obsession of mine for the past couple of years, mostly because of the philosophical ideas presented and the cool kung-fu stunts. This movie was a completely unsatisfying climax to two great, thought-provoking, and original films. Let's see... about 2% of this movie deals with the ideas in the first two films... there are, maybe 3 scenes with the kung-fu we all know and love, one scene with bullet time and a climax that makes sense I guess, but did the Wachowski brothers really need two other movies to give us this?? I give it one star because there was a little, precious little, substance to this film and because I can't give it zero stars. Don't waste your time, people. Just read reviews with spoilers. Believe me- you won't be missing much at all that you liked in the first two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please...","review":"The first \\"Matrix\\" should be the only one. The second two films are severly lacking in all the ways that make \\"The Matrix\\" great: Pioneering special effects, mind-blowing story, and innovation. This movie rides the coat-tails of the first one with little success.It failed to keep me interested, or awake for that matter. I watched it once on the big screen and once on the small screen, and I recommend seeing this in the movie theater for the special effects.Skip this one and get \\"The Matrix\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Matrix Revolutions","review":"If your having a problem falling asleep at night, I would deffinately reccomend this movie. I was wide awake when I started it, and while I was watching it I had to pry my eyes open. I was so damn close to falling asleep.

If you want to see a good trilogy, then go see the Lord Of The Rings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Less fighting, more thought","review":"The Matrix Revolutions is the third and final part of the Matrix trilogy and more the second part of the Matrix II. This time there is less fighting martial art style but more SF fighting between machines. It all looks superb again of course. In the second movie you could sometimes see that the characters fighting were computer graphics instead of real people but not so now, making it looking more real; even for a SF.We finally see the end of the story, but like in all the Matrix movies, makes us think again too. Does it start all over again? or not?You have to see this if you have seen the first two and are interested in the story, you will not be dissappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a stinker.","review":"I wonder when they realized they didn't have any more plot?

Reloaded wasn't what I had hoped it to be, but it was OK, I guess. I gave it a 6 out of 10 stars (my own personal scale). I was hoping the Brothers would redeem themselves with Revolutions. \\"The Matrix: Revolutions\\" was absolutly the single WORST movie I have ever seen in my entire life! There was NO PLOT, nothing from the first two movies are resolved, no questions are answered. I personally gave it (and I'm a HUGE Matrix I fan mind you.) 1 out of 10 stars.

You shouldn't have to go to a movie and try to figure out what is happening on screen. Many people who go to this movie will not have seen one or both of the prior installments, and because of this, they will not understand a thing while watching this third and final episode. Even I, who saw the other two movies, came away shaking my head. Granted, the fight scenes were excellent, but the movie was terrible overall because it was incomprehensible and the dialogue was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo. When you come away from a movie thinking none of it made any sense, that is not a good movie in my book. You shouldn't have to be a Matrix \\"afficiando\\" to enjoy the movie.

Avoid it at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"How do you make a bad actor look ok? Blind him!","review":"This movie is terrible. Don't even bother with it. The trilogy fell flatter than a corn flake. It goes to show you that special effects don't make a movie.

Instead of being the great liberator, it turns out Neo was nothing but a software upgrade. All the same violence, all the same villain, all for nothing but a sunset. Ugh. What a rip off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"I liked the first Matrix film because of the music, the action and the special effects. It had a few weaknesses in the storyline and the science of the Matrix was substandard even for a sci-fi movie, but it was a great action movie and that made it fun.The second and third movies had the action that made the first movie great, but they seemed like fanfiction - like those books Kevin J. Anderson wrote based on the Star Wars movies. I simply couldn't buy Keanu Reeves and Hugo Weaving fighting for control of the world and flying through the air. It seemed kind of stupid.One of the weaknesses in the trilogy is that the strength of the first movie was Neo adjusting to living in the Matrix. When the second movie started, he was suddenly Superman and it took away a lot of what made the character interesting. To make things worse, the brothers focused too heavily on boring and sucky characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Argh, worst ending ever.","review":"Just when you thought as bad as it could get was seeing naked pasty white Neo doing the dirty with Trinity while shots of the fat people doing the naked rave party dance scene... ENTER MATRIX 3! It almost fools one into thinking it is not going to be bad... and then boom. The end comes and you are left with the biggest 'wtf' since the end of The Red Planet.Don't buy this movie, pool your cash together with all the others who bought the first two movies and hire someone to give the creators a nuclear wedgie. :P"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big dissapointment....","review":"Please take some advice from a huge sci-fi / action film fan, and in particular, a huge fan of the original Matrix film. The first Matrix rocked - an amazingly original storyline, great dialogue and a great blend of sci-fi with martial arts. Not this time. This final sequel, Matrix Revolutions, is garbage - basically a souless two hour video game cut-scene. It has a lousy, confusing script with too much emphahsis on over-blown-budget visuals. This is one of the the worst movies I have ever paid money to see. The storyline stinks and the stupid, ambivilent ending is an absolute insult to fans of the original film. The Wachowski Brothers and Warner Brothers' over-meddling producers are living proof that lightning never strikes twice in the same place. Don't waste your money again - I sure won't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid film","review":"This was the worse out of all the Matrix movies. I say this because it was like a rip off of the Star Wars series starting with chapter 4 \\"A New Hope\\". Same story lines,same hero super powers (holding the hand out and controlling objects) and same dull effects. A lot of blue screen (or chromo effects) in this and they where done very slopply. The bullet time effects was (thank god) at a min. The story line continued to drag along leaving the action to die down. Why was this story line needed to be put into 3 different movies? This movie could have been wrapped up in maybe one or two movies . After a while the action got perdictable. Just a string of hollywood greed and a huge waste of time.

Alot of people won't have actually seen the real ending to the film if they didn't sit through the end credits, because the actual ending, for those who don't want to know stop reading now, is neo waking up at his computer screen with the message \\"wake up neo\\" written on the screen, just like the beginning of the first movie. So either it was all a dream, or, the matrix is starting over, with smith gone, and the last exile now the creator, or thats what i think anyways, either way it is left open for a sequel, well they would be daft not to wouldn't they?, and i can't wait to see if there is one.

I remember walking out of the theatre feeling like I had the wind knocked out of me. I was shocked.Bad movies don't make me feel this way. $9.00 dollars is $9.00, I mean unless that $9.00 is going to save my life.

Squids, machine guns, squids, machine guns, repeat, repeat, repeat. Even the Machine City looked pathetic. I saw the first one and was inspired; I saw the second one and was confused.

But, but, didn't the Oracle send Neo to find the Architect in Re-Loaded? Wasn't that the climax of Re-Loaded? Well, i guess they need to find some reason to go back into the Matrix. The Oracle then goes on to tell Neo that there are consequences to their descisions...what descisions? he asks, the descisions we make, she replies.

The battle for Zion is spectacular and the final Smith vs. Neo fight was amazing. But the first Matrix movie didn't make millions because of fight sequences, but because of the thought-provoking theory of the Matrix.The purpose of these two films was to introduce and resolve the real story of the Matrix.

The Bros that made the movie obviously were running out of ideas, so they make the 2nd one full of action, having the viewer waiting on the edge of there seat for the 3rd one, then make one of the worst films ever. Sure, it had good actions scenes, and it DID have a story line, BUT THE STORYLINE SUCKED! It was a final act of desperation to get the 3.5 years of production over. Also, the end was very, very, very stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"After the Sunrise","review":"Science Fiction has a hold on our collective imaginations because of what might be- whether it is a \\"Star Wars\\" or \\"Star Trek\\" or the Matrix works.

Combine that with our birthrights and who we become based on our teachers and parents, and you have values that we cannot control and frustrate us with their elusiveness.The three Matrix movies are powerful reminders of our powerless humanlives, and by the sad end of the third film, memento mori messages about our ultimate goal. To die. Neo fulfills whatever prophecy he is given simply by asking the questions. He will die, but his choice is to mark the time, place and mission that will take him to his end.

Very empty as the film takes the lives of those who matter the most in the fight for freedom.Freedom will not be found if that is what you are looking for.

After all of the interest and mystery of the Merovingian, Persephone, Agent Smith, Seraph, the Oracle, and the Keymaker in the 2nd movie, why abandon all of that for the last movie? This could have been an interesting movie where they tie together the clues in the 1st and 2nd movie and paint a cohesive picture of the world of the matrix and how it came about.

Instead we are treated to more cryptic dialogue, religious symbology to the point of storyline distortion and overblown special effects that become much less satisfying--just as they become the most intense.The final battle between Neo and Smith was a letdown.

Non-sensical plot, zero character development. Not worth seeing - not even on video. I cant believe this movie was made.

I went to the movie with 7 people and we all came out asking 'what was this even about? '. I figure the brothers were given a boatload of money to make a sequel and they figured '... hey lets make it 3 movies, we can sass it up with cool effects and make gallons of cash cause the movie going public are idiots.'

As it ends now I expect we'll se Matrix 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 & 9 over the coming years. (Depends how much MONEY this one earns).I noticed a few people saying you had to understand the final film to like it.

Nothing was resolved in any way that seemed permanent. The main characters were abandoned and minor characters pushed to the front of the stage. What philosophical points it made were confused by the need to show something exploding, speeding, or performing Kung Fu every few minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing","review":"The action and effects were great, but the Matrix presumes to be something deeper. It turns out that it's just confusing mush.There's a lot of talk about choice and purpose and love--and if this trilogy is to mean something it ought to say something. And you think it's going to. But it doesn't. Smith asks Neo why he gets up, why he continues to fight. Neo just says, \\"Because I choose to.\\" Ridiculous. Is that all the Wachowskis want to say? After all the interaction of choice, destiny and love, Neo ends up a pure existentialist? Again, I say, ridiculous.And to top it off, Neo's \\"choice\\" results in peace with the machines. Peace! Are you kidding? After the wonderfully rich set up of the machines as symbolic of the way our own pride, ambition and hubris can blind and enslave us, the result is peace with the enslaver?

I even defended \\"Reloaded\\" to my friends who were hell-bent on trashing the franchise based on the second chapter.What can you say about this festering pile of ... other than it is a movie that can only be tolerated by the few people who \\"get\\" the Wachowski's rambling and too-often ridicous theo-philosophy. the only redeeming moment of the film is when Trinity FINALLY dies after her monologue which seems to take as long as the entire Rings trilogy.The fights were unfulfilling, the usually great supporting characters are pathetic, and the graphics brought nothing new to the discussion. No wonder the Academy totally ignored every aspect of this movie, as it was unworty of any such consideration.I hope that Neo really is dead so nobody tries to revive the franchise and squeeze another $10 out of me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Matrix fans","review":"I would have to say that I wished Revolutions had as much or more of the awesome 'in the Matrix' action of the first two movies, but I gotta say that you can't judge these movies individually, you have to look at them as one. The first one was obviously the more mind-blowing since it was so new, the second was filler, and the third would be the end of the story AS TOLD by the Wachowski brothers. If you're not a Matrix fan, then just relax and go back to X-Men or something. These movies, and the video game, require you to think about the whole story.

The first movie was truly an excellent film. The second was not as great, but I could still bare it. The third one sucked. Flat out. In fact, I think it made the second one worse knowing what it was setting up. I'm thinking I'm probably going to sell my Reloaded DVD and forget Reloaded and Revolutions ever happened. I think the only thing that I really enjoyed about this movie was the fight for Zion. The rest...well, it just makes me shake my head.

This film lacked the substance that the first two had. The dialogue was horrible (bad enough to remind me of Star Wars) and the acting was even worse ......... if that's possible. The only positive I found was the special effects, which were again quite incredible. But you cannot make a movie on special effects alone (again see the new Star Wars films) and expect it to be great.And finally, the ending was a huge disappointment. The first two films left me wanting more, while this one simply made me want it to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN!","review":"I Really never saw whats so great about these movies!! And I think this and reloaded proved this to many people. Since i had seen the first two i decided i had to round out the triligoy. So i watched it the other day at a friends house who got an early copy. It wasn't a terrible movie, but It was far from good. The end of the series couldn't have been worse! I'm not going to say anything for those of you who haven't seen it. But i'm a firm believer that not many people see these movies for the plot. The special effects are quite impressive, but all in all the movie lacks massivly in the dialouge and acting department. The first Matrix was a fine movie, its wasn't great like every one says it was but like, the sequals were almost embarsing! I gave this movie 2 stars because i couldn't give it one and a half. The large scale battle sequence was the only redeming factor to this yawn fest."},{"rating":"1","title":"this wasn't a movie","review":"By far the worst out of the trilogy. The first one was a classic, the second was pushing it, and the third, well it was just horrible. Complements to the CGI guys, but if there was ever a movie that proved that special effects don't make a movie, this is it.We spend the first movie really caring about the main characters, Neo's journey, Morpheous' faith, Smith's joyous evil...then for the grand finale, we're forced into a position where we no longer know who these people are, and could care less what happens to them. It felt like Neo/Reves had a handful of lines, and poor Morpheous--once the grand character in Matrix I, is relegated to a a couple scenes and a few lines.This isn't a movie, it's a show piece for your HDTV set. Regardless, I have successfully convinced myself that Reloaded and Revolutions never existed, there was never a Matrix trilogy. Just the first one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revolutions Blew my mind...","review":"So you think you had the whole concept of the Matrix figured out? You think you knew how this one was gonna end? Well chances are you don't. I must say one thing to those of you who are saying (and might say once you see it) that this movie wraps it up too nicely: This movie is not the end. This doesn't wrap things up cozily no matter what you think. As far as this movie goes... The fight for Zion is AMAZING, the story and action keep you engaged, and YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPPOINTED!!! :D"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks","review":"Ok, this movie sucked for a number of reasons. Hello, where is the plot? Didn't you forget something, like a story that made sense? So what happens in the end? Peace? Peace of what?

And who is that little Indian girl? How sweet that she makes sunrises and sunsets I suppose, but who cares? What happened to her parents? Are they still locked in? And what about Frenchy? Is Neo dead or alive?And what was the point in killing Trinity?Only good actor was Smith who is always good no matter what crap he is doing~Did Neo even have a story line?

I say this because it was like a rip off of the Star Wars series starting with chapter 4 \\"A New Hope\\". Same story lines,same hero super powers (holding the hand out and controlling objects) and same dull effects. A lot of blue screen (or chromo effects) in this and they where done very slopply. The bullet time effects was (thank god) at a min. The story line continued to drag along leaving the action to die down. Why was this story line needed to be put into 3 different movies? This movie could have been wrapped up in maybe one or two movies . After a while the action got perdictable. Just a string of hollywood greed and a huge waste of time.

Not that it wasn't worth the money I paid. I would gladly see it again; it's a good ab workout.But I'm being mean. To their credit they did use Reeves to the best of his dramatic ability and managed to give the audience a wonderful exploration of what CGI can do - even when it's rushed, overused, and doesn't have the dramatic framework to make it believable. And who would've guessed you could have such a prolonged monologue with a metal spike through both your kidneys? Ah, the wonders of cinema.Still, I suggest you see it. If for nothing else than such classic lines as: \\"you did it\\" - \\"no ... *we* did it.\\" The Wachowski brothers certainly left me as they did with the first Matrix movie ... speechless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Koxson","review":"This movie is called Matrix.

I wish I had a movie eraser I could rub out revolutions and the sex scene in reloaded while I was at it.Don't get me wrong for a hollywood movie this gets a 8/10 or 9/10. But for The Matrix... all it gets from me is a 3/10 to 4/10 and a dissapointed viewer.Lloyd Harris."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Sequel","review":"The original Matrix (1999) is superb! Had this sequel been released first, I don't think any others in this series would have been made. This sequel was boring, disjointed and lackluster. What a waste of talent, money and (often boring) special effects. Save your money, just rent it if you haven't already seen it. An interesting observation is that the Matrix series is inversely related to the Lord of the Rings series, specifically, The Lord of the Rings gets much better with each sequel while the Matrix degenerated to an abyss of muddled storyline and rehashed special effects. Something to do with karma balancing out? Beats me. Just an observation I made, that's all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A strangely satisfying ending","review":"While many people said that this movie introduced nothing new and was nothing more than a poor recap of the first 2 movies, I htought that this was one of the best movies of the year. What people don't realize is that this is a very philosophical movie. Look at Neo and Smith for example. Neo sacrifices himself to rid the martix of Smith. Looking into the bible, it was Christ who sacrificed himself to cleanse the world of sin. Many of the characters have different meanings. The Merovingian for example represents Satan. Watch what button Morpheus presses in the elevator the leads to his club. It says \\"HELL\\". Even looking at it from a computer standpoint, Neo let Smith infect him so the machines could lock on and destroy Smith. Thats how a computer destroys a virus. If you haven't seen this movie or the trilogy, watch them. I guarentee if you look into some philosophical books and study some computer procedures you will realize just how brilliant these movies truly are."},{"rating":"1","title":"The revolution did not happen","review":"I felt that this was the weakest film of the series because it concentrated too much on characters that I did not really want to identify with. I think it did not spend enough time on the principle characters and Morpheus does very little in this film. Although the ending is not bad, the Zion attack scene was not what I really wanted to see and the dialogue is pretty corny at times. I think this is a flawed movie and not a very good addition to the Matrix series. Reloaded was better but the original is still the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"300+ Reviews should tell you how great the movie is alone.","review":"Show me another movie with this many reviews.The code of the matrix increases with each installment.The culmination of equality is blasted into a phenominal finish b/w smith and neo.It took one week to get over the depression of it being over.LOVE'D IT TO INFINITY!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most of the movie","review":"Most of the movie was very good.

Of course it never really was a trilogy. With all the multimedia subplots left out of the films the second film was just a waste of time ,computer rendering and human viewing. When they decided to bring back Agent Smith for another slugfest they jumped the shark for the first time. When they had him cross over to the \\"real\\" world they jumped yet another shark.This installment takes the bastardized logic of the original film to it's illogical seeming conclusion. Of course since the ending is ultimately another jump the shark moment and a let down ,it offers a coda to set up the online interactive game.

Devotees rage at such criticism by citing the cool stunts, spiffy costumes and endless explosions that go on ad naseum. But we've seen this ALL before and done better elsewhere. The plot is just not there!And from reading about how this series came about I can see that the Wachowski boys spared no effort in using every hook and device they could think of to create a piece of merchandise that would return a maximum yield on the studio's investment.The studio isn't touting them as great film makers because they make great films but because the Wachowski's have found a way of stealing money from children that's safe and legal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie of the Year?","review":"This was such a boring movie.

This movie died by the first 5 minutes. Then it got worse,how can you ever get worse from death? But of course, it had to end somehow, someway. Matrix pulled it off in many ways, but for the worse.

But in the final analysis - eye candy cannot overcome the awful plot and characters. The original Matrix film was kick butt comic book stuff that the Wachowski Bros nailed cold and amazingly pegged the paradox of our anxiety about technology versus our desire to control it and enhance ourselves.This film and RELOADED both offered plenty of \\"Matrix\\" continuity for the scifi squirrels - but REVOLUTIONS; more than its predecessors, quickly sours dramatically and becomes boring, looking like a bad music video by the end with 'Battlestar Galatica' type plot elements.

The whole movie is about fighting the machines, and they hardly ever go into the Matrix. There are no realy intense fight scenes.

Maybe this is the Wachoski's ultimate inverted joke on us hapless movie-going sheep. The oracle actress was switched as in some low budget soap opera and they spin some embarassing dialog to dress that up in appropriately philosophical Matrix verbiage.The only decent thing (mildly entertaining) was the swarms of insectoid machine attackers (at least they don't TALK for god's sake!).For cutting-edge guys, the Wachowski's are pretty pedestrian.

I saw the original at the movies twice and on tape and dvd many times over. The second movie was so bad I didn't even go to the theater to see this one. A shame.I don't know what happened, but perhaps the incredible success of the first left nowhere to go but down.This movie was a cliche with horrible dialogue and a hard to follow plot. Nothing about the special effects make it worth seeing for just for the sake of seeing them.In any case, I guess, if you are like me, and loved the first movie, and saw the second, you're going to want to see this one. However, I don't recommend buying it, why should we reward such disregard for the high standard set by the first Matrix film, surely the LTR series didn't do this kind of thing (although the Star Wars series sure did)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Matrix Inverted","review":"Formula for an excellent sci-fi movie: first the story, second the story, and third the effects.

The second was pretentious and boring but occasionally interesting: generally a good movie. The third is dreadful: derivative, unimaginative, predictable, inane, insipid and strange as it may sound---boring. The ending, particularly Neo's fate, is predictable. The philosophy is juvenile. The action is incessant and ridiculous. Why not kill the humans with poison gas or biological weapons? (because there would be no endless boring fight scenes). The only thing I'll say about the acting is that the actors checked out long before the move ended with the exception of Jada. And how/why did Lawrence F. turn from a sleek intense fighting machine in the first movie into a hesitant overweight schlub in the third? Why is there even a third movie?

It will not be making its way into my home. What a shoddy bit of film-making this is.As I was watching this in the theatre and dozing off every five minutes or so I just kept saying to myself, \\"Why, oh why did they have to go and make sequels to a film that came across as a one-shot?\\" Of course, the answer is money, but you would think that the Wachowski Bros. could have at the very least put some effort into the plotlines of the sequels for the fans. All flash and no substance is really what makes these films flounder. Reloaded and Revolutions are far from what their respective titles imply. Rather, they are both hollow and hackneyed. In my eyes, unmitigated disasters."},{"rating":"1","title":"The revolution should not be televised...","review":"This movie never really had a chance. The writing is absolutely terrible. The movie plods along with a cornucopia of insipid philosophical mumbo jumbo... all uttered with a straight face as if any of it made sense. Neo and Trinity are barely in the movie. The Matrix itself is surprisingly absent from this installment. Basically it's not so much that it stinks... The problem is that it is boring and lame. There were some pretty big logic problems too... For example, that one girl gets stabbed once in the stomach by that guy possessed by Agent Smith and she dies immediately. Somehow, however, Trinity can have multiple wounds going all the way through her body and still have time for another boring pointless discussion with Neo.

Millions upon millions must have been excited about the second movie. And what a let down in was. It dragged and dragged, and the zion sequences were almost embarrising. If being a survivor means growing dreads and going to a rave each night, well i think i would rather pass.....then came the third.

I'm probably the first to pull out a tissue during a good drama, but nothing in this movie moved me. I consider it a bad sign that after following these characters through three films I felt no attachment to them. Despite some great special effects and a few pseudo-horror winces, I have to say I expected better.

Come on, everyone knows that the Matrix trilogy opened a whole new world on the special effects area, and Revolutions it's no exception, since it has the best special effects ever seen on a movie. All of these can be confirmed when you watch the \\"special features DVD\\" (which, by the way, is loaded with tons of cool extras) that comes with the movie, where you can see some of the amazing and exhausting job that all the team did to make us \\"believe the unbelievable\\".

And while this installment started off with a promising action-packed nonchalance, it quickly devolved into a loud, flimsy, poorly plotted morass. Of course, no one needs little old me to tell them about this flick's shortcomings: fans of the series deserted New Zion in droves after this turkey was released... But I still had to check it out and see for myself. Oh, well. By the way, Carrie-Anne Moss, who plays Trinty, Canoe's love interest, is one of the least interesting screen actors I have ever seen.

They took all of their advance money and bought big houses and partied for months until the night before the script was due. Then they panicked and threw together a story that had enough elements of the first movie to call it \\"The Matrix\\".

LOTR is great film but I cant understand why people love it so much, I watch it once and no more. Matrix on the other hand is a movie that makes me watching it over and over. Maybe its the story depicting how pathetic humans are under the mahines that annoys people.Maybe Revolution doesnt have as many action fights as Reloaded, but I still love the trilogy (+ Animatrix) and the theme behind it.many said they dont understand Matrix.

Neo is not even around for most of the movie, then he gets his eyes fried, but of course he can still see. The battle for Zion is cool, it is what makes the movie worth watching. But as for story development, it sucks. I thought they would explain more of how Neo got his powers, I mean they basicaly make him a God. I guess I expected much more from a franchise boasting as much as the Matrix trilogy has. It seems as if nothing from the second movie even made it to the third.

It had a few good moments, sure, but how any writer can look at himself in the mirror after putting that many tired, used lines in one screenplay, I don't understand.In retrospect, it seems clear that BOTH these races, humans and machines, deserve to be wiped out.

You know like the rebirth of christ.(I know it's cheesy)But what she is saying is interesting only because he will return just without wings(human,rebel,side) because his brain may have been altered by the machines but his soul will not.

I didn't feel compelled by any of the emotional/plot building scenes. There is very little in the way of fighting scenes. One good aspect is the dock fight scene, which is cool. (I'm always a fan of large shot mass warfare scenes.) Other than that the way it all pans out is kind of cryptic, lame, and all too perfect.

The machines are still there so if they wanted they could enslave humanity again. All of the population is still plugged into the matrix. At the end i found myself saying WHAT THE HELL!!!!!!! why bother making a trilogy if you dont end the story. all that happened in the 3rd film is Neo dies Trinity dies and Smith dies, and the machines leave the humans alone.

Not near enough fighting, just abunch of pointless .... that didn't amount to anything. By far the worst of the 3 and left a very bad taste in my mouth about the Matrix trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fooled by Fools","review":"The Wachowski brothers didn't write a movie in the series, But I thought that movie was Revolutions. Low and behold it was the original. The evidence is unmistakable. 2 and 3 don't even sound like the original.This movie tries so hard to be highly intelligent that it obliterates itself and the whole mythology of the original, with all of this overuse of philosophy, and special effects and nonsense. Take the subway station scene for example, How did he seperate his mind from his body. The Wachowski brothers have ideas how it is possible but they don't have a clear answer, and beside the story their direction needs serious help. Although after this movie I doubt anyone will be flocking to see a Wachowski Brother film. So they should probally spend their future doing something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEBACLE","review":"I really didn't expect much after reloaded but after renting this movie I couldn't believe how bad it really is.

However, by the end of \\"Revolution$\\" the Matrix is still in existence. Was Morpheaus wrong? Was Neo really the one? Upon watching the original \\"Matrix\\" again many glaring inconsistencies emerge. While the ending of \\"Revolutions\\" was interesting it was too loaded with philosophical claptrap. Ultimately, the Matrix became the fish that eat its own tail. The guaranteed audience for this dribble made these movies critic proof. People flocked to see the film, as did I, only to realize that it was no more than a subtle money grab by the studio to exploit the desire of film goers to recapture the magic of the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why, W. Brothers, Why??","review":"*sigh* Why did the Watchowski Bros. have to go and ruin a wonderful movie by making it a trilogy?If you've read any of the other reviews or seen the trilogy, you know that the last 2 installments were about special effects more than the plot or the acting. Okay, that's a little bit of an understatement.What really bothers me is that there could have been a pretty great sequel if the brothers had just combined the \\"plots\\" of Reloaded and Revelations and tried to make just one sequel, instead of dragging out a thin plot, measly dialogue, and repetetive fight scenes for two whole movies.The original Matrix was the real Revolution, as far as moviemaking goes. It's too bad the Watchowskis' greed for money lead them to ruin it all. I agree with another review I read; that we should just pretend like Revolutions and Reloaded were never made."},{"rating":"1","title":"From WHAT IS THE MATRIX to WTF???","review":"I just dont understand. The brothers had this franchise that they could have been a huge contender for best sci fi movie series of all. But for some reason, they got greedy and went way out of there minds with special FX. Granted, they are great FX, but that is NOT why I and millions of others loved the first matrix, the FX was a bonus. The first matrix REALLY made you think. It made you question life, and was totally origanl from anything that was on film at the time. For some reason, it went from this vaste world of wonder to : the movie is ganna end in 48 hours, and turns into a war movie. Its a shame that the first matrix is ruined by these high special FX, low story telling sequals. The only good part of this film is the Special FX and fights, other than that, if you wanna a mind blowing trip into wonderland, watch the origanl."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst matrix ever","review":"Wow this movie blows! You know it's bad when the cover looks like a damn video game. The battles scenes were soooooo lame, it was funny especially when that commander guy kept on yelling \\"GOD DAMNIT!\\" That was so funny this movie is so dumb it's funny. I like the other two movies they were tight, the highway scene on the second one was bad ass. But there is no tight fighting scene in this movie, even the final \\"showdown\\" was dumb, more of a \\"let down\\" if you ask me. So here's the verdict, the movie sucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I Watching The Aliens?","review":"This movie is boring. I feel like I am watching Aliens and Superman. I feel like that they are cutting some sences from Aliens and pasting them here and there... cutting some more from Superman and pasting them over there. Story is not good at all. The movie only mentions the philosophical issues brought up by the second movie. It doesn't really discuss what it is so special about these issues. Most of the time, the movie only mentions the wording. There is no meaning behind the wording.IMO, the second and the third movies switches the focus to Agent Smith. I think they should have more dialogs for Agent Smith rather to just make him punch and punch and punch something all the time everytime I see him show up in the movie.Maybe this is why the movie is so boring. There is nothing to tell regarding The One and his followers anymore. And the contents from the special effects are 10-20 years old. (i.e. you punch me, I punch you back. There is nothing special about this.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies I've ever seen--a total waste!","review":"Don't waste your money. The original Matrix was a good movie, the second was terrible, and this one was horrible. It was difficult to stay awake during the first half. There were nothing but special effects which were difficult to follow, no plot that made any sense, very little of Neo, and no feeling for any of the characters. It didn't matter to me who lived or who died. The only reason I stayed for the whole movie was to see the outcome. I'm sorry that I did because I only got mad and felt like I was taken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Logic Out The Window","review":"This movie has great effects and thats about it. The layers of logic that were established in the first 2 movies are pretty much gone. The rules seem to change constantly to keep the story going.

The worst thing the distributors of this film could have done was end the second film with to \\"be continued\\". The third film is bad on so many levels. The film is dismal losing all the glory of the first two films. It loses sight of it's main characters and basically concludes with an ending that negated the whole story line of the initial films. I left the theatre let down that the series I loved so much ended on such a horrible note. I immediately sold back my copy of the second film as I guess (by looking at the ample supply of used Reloaded dvd's) many others did as well. I'll keep the memories of the first film and forget the other two ever happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing!!","review":"I strongly agree with the positive reviews that declare this to be one of the best movies of all time. If you haven't seen it yet, please ignore the critic's reviews as they are trained to see the technical aspects instead of being able to just enjoy a movie. This movie takes the viewer further that you could have imagined possible with the characters, plot, and visual effects. It keeps you glued to your seat and always wanting more. I never thought Neo and Trinity could make your love their characters more, but this movie does that and SO much more! I really got into the movie and felt like I was living and doing right along with the characters. I promise you that you will love it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time","review":"okay.. this movie was a MAJOR disappointment. Here are my complaints:1. Where is the philosophical issues dealt with thru matrix and matrix reloaded?2. Having a massive war scene and leaving out Neo and Trinity for about 40 minutes was completely stupid. I sat there wondering what was happening to them.3. It completely lost the cold hard edge the first matrix had.4. I feel they should have done more with the train guy, and how you can get stuck between the matrix and the real world.5. Needed more guns.6. The big fight scene at the end... there was nothing new, except for the stupid air bit. how stupid.7. Movie overall was too fragmented, didnt have a flowing story line, and was more of a romance then a philosophical movie. ... nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.","review":"I rated this movie before I could thoroughly understand it.

Despite decent special effects, I was bored to tears. Silly plot, stale love scenes, no hot women, no car chases, etc., etc. Unless the actors worked for free, they were vastly overpaid. I just bought this movie for $5 and I feel ripped off. In good conscience, I can't even recommend renting this p.o.s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst final installment ever!","review":"Apparently I watched a different third installment than the previous review. I was ready to turn it off after about half way through this boring, ridiculously idiotic final episode. The childish simplicity that they wrap this trilogy of movies up with is something I would have expected to see on the sci fi channel.

It was a disappointing and stupid ending. It's as if the director(s) had just said \\"oh, bugger this,\\" and neglected the salvagable story. I bet I could have written something better than this. There was definitely lots of balls-to-the-wall action in Zion(hence the 2-star rating), but the Neo/Smith battle was kind of cheesy. Get the Return of the King instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak, Weak, Weak! This movie doesn't even deserve 1 star","review":"This movie is absolutely horrible. I've seen it about 10 times, so I know what I'm talking about. As a matter of fact, all three of these movies are horrible. None of them are enjoyable to watch. The special effects are so 1980s. I can't believe some dorks like this movie. This is quite possibly the worst trilogy of all time. Right behind Star Wars.

After the first two GREAT movies, I just knew this one was going to be awesome. They had such a great story working, and the groundwork they laid for this one in \\"Reloaded\\" had me salivating. But, then I saw this mess. The story in \\"Revolutions\\" didn't even seem related to the other two. Although it did have some nice special effects, the plot was poorly explained and the resolution of the story made no sense. It's like they opened up all these great angles in the first two but had no idea how to resolve them. This movie could and should have been ten times better.

Machines have humans lulled o complacency and asleep in the limbo of their daydreams. This is the last of the three Matrix films. There is a lot of symbolism which may appeal to lovers of puzzles and mystery. The most obvious are the cookie scenes. The perception of reality here is the standout making this a candidate for a cult film following."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't worry. It's really good.","review":"I agree with everyone else who disagrees with everyone who has seen the movie and gave it one star because it didn't transport them into a new stage of consciousness.This is a very good, very cool, fun movie. Good ending to the series. A lot more action and a better story line than the second one, which was pretty darn good, too.The first is still best, though. The first one gets 5 stars. \\"Revolutions\\" gets 4.5. \\"Reloaded\\" gets 4.Go see it at IMAX if you can. Otherwise, buy this DVD NOW!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Closure Here","review":"First of all I am a great fan of the first two Matrix movies. This movie gave me no closure at all. It seemed more toward the end that not even the directors knew how to end such a massive movie so they ended the movie the quickest way they knew how. The storyline has no movement whatsoever and the actress that replaced the old oracle is not very good. Not only that but the movie seemed to try and focus in on her changing in some stupid way. I really didn't like this movie and I know that any fan will go to the theater and see it despite what I say, but I really do just recommend that you continue to watch the first and second Matrix. Leave the end to imagination and don't watch this third movie. The only good thing I can say about the movie is that the battles between Zion and the machines is awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy conclusion to a great story","review":"From the end of The Matrix: Reloaded we know Neo is back in the real world, we know something is different about him and we know in the last film somehow he is going to save the world. The Matrix: Revolutions opens where reloaded left off, but almost immediately the movie feels entirely different. From the first five minutes on the movie leads up the battle for Zion. This would be alright, the problem is the movie drags on slowly with a whole lot of nothing happening untill the machines reach Zion, Neo's character is isolated and becomes weaker and weaker, in the end he does save day (no big surprise), but the method is a cheap shop by the screenwriters, the big end battle for Zion is instantly forgetable (all 20+ minutes of it) and we're left with no clouser, what's worse the ending is left wide open for even more Matrix movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"Enjoyed the first one so much I eagerly awaited the second. The second left me feeling disappointed and blue because it sucked. The third made me feel better because it was so lame that I kept laughing until the end.

However I cannot endorse this book, which I read a while ago. It is pseuo-science of the worst sort. The authors attempt to prove that the recent ice age didn't happen and that the continents were connected by land bridges in the recent past. Their method owes more to the humanities than to science. They pile quote upon quote (all well footnoted) in their attempt to prove thier case. However, they are so selective. Most of their quotes seem to come from obscure professors of about 100 years ago. Haven't they heard that there has been a revolution in geology since then (plate tectonics and all that) of which there is no mention. I guess I could find plenty of quotes \\"proving\\" that the earth is flat if I went back far enough. This book proves nothing, although it purports to rest on a foundation of sciece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor science","review":"This book has very few good points. Its science is so flawed that it really demonstrates that what gets published is what will sell. The diagrams showing the path through the Solar System of the supposed remnant of the Vela supernova (which is said to have burned into the Sun) appear to be quite unlikely, or maybe even impossible. They show their ignorance by seizing upon well-known items like the asteroid belt or Chiron as evidence, rather than researching items that are not well known which could better support their arguments. The writing of the book is so mixed up that I am not sure just what theory the authors are supporting, and they sometimes appear to be opposing their own theories! I have read other books that dealt with this kind of thing that were much better, since the authors attempted to use science instead of this sort of uninformed babble. The really bad thing is that there is evidence that could support some of what these guys say, yet they have missed much of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignorant pseudoscience","review":"One of a genre of literature that mimics science, but ignores the scientific method to draw exciting but untenable conclusions. These type books are often well-crafted; capable of tricking very intelligent people. Modern geology is willing to accept catastrophic events if the evidence is good.

To say the least, although an atmosphere of copious study is fashioned, the result is sheer balderdash.The theory of extraterrestrial cataclysm set out is extraordinary, and the supportive proofs meager. Instead, the book relies on superstition, obscure and mystical folklore, and speculation, and the hard evidence is lacking.At least it was my friend, and not me who wasted the money this time. I got stuck on Bell and Streiber's \\"The Coming Superstorm\\", which was just as bad, if less artful.

The best part of the book discusses Calder's work creating circus animal sculptures, and this topic will surely appeal to students. The latter portion of the book, however, is devoted to the artist's abstract sculptures, and considering the audience level for which this book was written, the author does not quite bring the genre to life for a young mind unfamiliar with such terms and concepts.

I make blackberry jam and needed it to puree the berries and get some of the seeds out. It never did a very good job. It didn't put enough pressure on the fruit so I ended up with a good deal of waste. The second summer I used it the handle fell off (poorly soldered). Then the knob on top came off and I couldn't get it back on so ended up pitching the whole thing.

Boy was I disappointed! It didn't make it through one day of applesauce! After the 44th quart, the bottom that holds the spring on broke, and the lips on the edge that fit over the pan are bent so they are almost horizontal. And it didn't perform well up to the 44th quart either! It's a lousy construction that does not efficiently push the food through, leading to extra grinding, and extra force, which takes extra time. If I could get my money back, I would. My mom then gave me her ancient one, and what a difference! I'm able to grind a batch of applesauce in half the time! They don't make them like they used to."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as the original","review":"My mom has a foley food mill that is 25 years old and works great. I wanted the same thing, but this is not. It looks the same, but they just don't make it like they used to. The blade doesn't line up will with the bottom, so the handle wobbles and you have to be very precise with your pressure when you turn the crank, or it gets stuck, and becomes difficult to turn. I used it to make applesauce, and it is very inefficient. It takes many more turns than the old one to push through the same amount of applesauce. Also, it says it's made of stainless steel, but something black was dripping into my applesauce from the center of the food mill. I think it was some kind of metal or interaction with the apples.

Unfortunately, this is nothing like the older product it replaced - although it looks the same. The product is very poorly made. Don't get me wrong. It looks great - just doesn't work. I don't think the Chinese manufacturer that produced this really has any idea of the intended purpose. Shaft fit is very sloppy, which is the key to functionality on these. It is basically unusable.

I use it all summer long, from apricot season to tomatoes. When the bag of apples ends up mushy, cook them and put them through this mill. I can't tell you how many people I have recommended this gadget to. I have used it for jams, fruit butters, and sauces. It can be used to remove just seeds and peels, or you can flip the screw beneath to remove pits as well.

I also thought that the old one wasn't performing like it should have because it took a lot of work to process the food. I make lots of V-8 and applesauce, so the larger one appeared to be the one for me. After using it for the V-8 season, I must say I'm disappointed. The construction is not near the quality of my older model. The metal that is used is of a lower quality than the older model. The paddle that mashes the food against the graters doesn't contact the bottom of container all the way around the rotation. The pivot point appears to be \\"out of wack\\".

Most of the food remains mashed inside instead of coming out the bottom, and it takes a lot of downward pressure to get anything out.

The movie was made in 1948, but you'd think it was 1918, looking at the hideously blurry, fuzzy, melted frames, and chopped soundtrack. Funny color gizmos even appear sometime for a split second on the screen, definite signs of the little care that was paid to the DVD production of this otherwise decent movie.

Maiden was going towards a very progressive path, and had reached its limit in this field. It was time for a change. And by change, in this case, Harris tought of a back to basics approach: raw and straight to the point.We all know now that Adrian Smith did not agree with that, and was replaced by Janick Gers, a guy that really can play raw. Basically, that's all he can do.But what people did not know is that the \\"raw\\" sound pursued by Harris would result in the worst set of songs ever recorded by Maiden up to that point. They, without exception, have absolutely no merits. The album included one their worst songs ever, BRING YOUR DAUGHTER TO THE SLAUGHTER.

Well....obviously Iron Maiden didn;t have anyone there to let them know that they had just reached the level of ridiculous. No Prayer For The Wicked is just plain crap.

A guy who simply can't play a guitar solo with the same skill as Dave Murray, Adrian Smith or dozens of other British guitarrists (check the \\"butchering\\" that Janick does when playing Adrian's solos, live. Unbeliavable. He spends so much time jumping and kneeling and spinning that he simply don't play them!)Anyway, NO PRAYER has a raw sound. So far so good, but there was no necessity to use such a lousy production, with a garage sound, adn stupid songs like HOLY SMOKE and BRING YOUR DAUGHTER.

There are a couple of good songs, but the distinctive and timeless instrumental sound of Iron Maiden is gone. The melodic chemistry between Adrian Smith and Dave Murray has been replaced by a rather obnoxious sounding guitarist (Gers) who seemingly plays just to make noise. Gers style of playing will leave hard-core Maiden fans disappointed. The quality of songs does not live up the standard Iron Maiden has set with previous albums.

What a downer. Tailgunner and maybe the second song are mediocre. The rest are terrible. Tailgunner is a second-rate Aces High recap with only about 20% of the adrenaline.

Stupid and derivative lyrics and substandard musicianship aside (not that they play them bad, but these are songs where a band like Maiden can just \\"phone it in\\"), all are good enough to make you hum along with repeated listens. Too bad they're surrounded by turkeys like \\"Mother Russia\\", \\"Fates Warning\\", \\"Public Enema Number One\\", \\"Run Silent, Run Deep\\" and \\"The Assassin\\". The title track is acceptable, although it's basically the blueprint for \\"Afriad To Shoot Strangers\\" on the following album (and \\"Strangers\\" is better).

It's a mysery to me how Martin Birch (the producer) did not warn the big boss Steve Harris that the album suck..d.If you are a Maiden die hard, you will find all their albums a work of art.

Another istance is \\"Never Say Die\\" by Black Sabbath, which was the last album with the legendary original lineup.Although Iron Maiden did go on to record one more album with Bruce Dickinson (\\"Fear of the Dark\\" which is a little better than this one) this was the beginning of the end. However, it still doesn't prevent the Maidens from cementing themselves as one of the top bands in metal history."},{"rating":"1","title":"maiden's career low","review":"this is there worst album. all the songs sound like they were rushed through, like they didn't think about the material, they just did it. adrian agreed that they didn't work on songs enough. he was right.jannick gers can't hold a candle to adrian smith.\\"holy smoke\\" is a lame attempt to trash evangelists. in 1990 that topic was an old hat. slayer did that 2 years ago with the far superior \\"read between the lies\\", as well as countless other bands.\\"mother russia\\" is steve's worst epic ever. it sounds like like they just didn't care anymore. they pulled out of this slump after that.fear of the dark was alot better than this crap. lets hope that maiden don't ever sink this far again"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"When this album came out it hammered the final nails into the coffin of the NWOBHM. It simply could not stand up to the massive albums coming out at the time from American bands like Slayer and Megadeth. After releasing two albums with a decidedly bloated euro-metal sound (keyboards and guitar synth), this album meant to hail a return to Maiden's denim and leather days of yore. But without the wailing emo solos of Adrian Smith, and the addition of Janick Gers (who is a great guitar player in his own right, but couldn't manage to break out of blazing through boring bluesy runs) Maiden churned out a bland slab of vinyl. As much as I loved Maiden in the day, they failed their American audience at a crucial point when speed metal was all too happy to step in and take the heavy metal crown."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEGINNING OF THE END","review":"Someone said below this CD is a \\"Must HAve\\". Há ! THis is the first CD after the magical \\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\\" and the departure of guitarrist Adrian Smith. The result? Raw music, which is good, but without any vibration or inspiration. See the work-tittle of the alum \\"Holy Smoke\\": nothing in it. \\"MOther Russia\\" was a failed attempt to reproduce \\"To Tame a Land\\", \\"Rime of the Ancient MAriner\\" and others Harris'epics. Not good at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Iron Maiden Can't be Stopped - but this album flopped","review":"I was the BIGGEST Iron Maiden fan growing up. From age 10, when I got \\"Powerslave\\" for Christmas, to age 20, when I saw IM live for the 2nd time in Salt Lake City supporting No Prayer for the Dying, they were my pet band. After that concert, the songs on this album grew old fast, whereas songs on their first 5 albums have never grown stale to this day. I love Iron Maiden, but this album was the beginning of the end of their flowering as the world's preeminent rock band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw and Powerful","review":"This album gets little aclaim but,this cd rocks! Shorter songs,power chords that will rip your head off and Bruce Dickensons tarzanian vocals add up to a effort that will grab you and never let you go!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst With Bruce.","review":"I wanted to like it but I still didn't. Lyrics, instruments, vocals are all bad. Fear of the Dark is when they shows potential again and it's a decent album, way better than No Prayer for the Dying. Adrian leaving the band was probably part of the reason why they went downhill. The '90s was a bad time for Iron Maiden and it would take until Brave New World for them to recover all the way. Even legends like Iron Maiden have made mistakes in their career. No Prayer For The Dying is by far, their worst with Bruce and the 2nd worst only to Virtual XI. However I've grown to like a few tracks like Tailgunner, The Assassin and Run Silent Run Deep but the rest is forgettable. It's a bad album overall but not horrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"NPFTD","review":"When this album came out it was on the heels of 7th Son. I guess I was just thrown by the overall rawness of the album and the absence of Adrian. All in all it didn't really wow me, but I hardly thought it sucked. I also admit that this was one Maiden album that I didn't listen to as frequently as the others. I recently listened to it again. There were a slew of more progressive sounding Maiden releases from X Factor on (that were all great by the way) after No Prayer. Listening to this CD now is a different experience. It's kinda like it aged a bit like fine wine and now as I rediscover it, I find the songs are pretty good, albeit raw. No problem with that. I'm glad Bruce and Adrian took a little vacation from the band after FOTD because when they came back the material that Maiden put out was simply incredible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give it a chance!","review":"\\"No Prayer for the dying\\", what can I say about it?, well, for me is a regular album, of course, it ins't as good as \\"Powerslave\\" or \\"Fear of the Dark\\", but it's a Maiden CD anyway, \\"Tailgunner\\" and \\"Bring your daughter to the slaughter\\" are good songs, so, if you're a true fan this album can't miss in your collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An all time career low point","review":"This album is absolutely appalling. By any other act at the time it would have been deemed passable, but by the high standards set by Maiden it is an absolute turkey. There is not one track which comes even close to anything else on any previous Maiden album. I don't know what went wrong here but the entire band sound like imposters!! I was dumbstruck by how bad it was when I first bought it. I have been a Maiden fan for two decades and this CD was the nadir for me. Thankfully things have improved greatly since. Take heed and avoid this CD like you would a case of the black death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was a Die Hard Fan until this one","review":"Okay, I'm not sure what happenned here I bought this one though and tried really hard to \\"get into\\" it. This was the album that made me realize that my love for \\"Iron Maiden\\" The Band, was not as strong as my Love for \\"Iron Maiden\\" the music. This album is a huge step down from thier traditional sound. They totally break thier promise which I read years earlier in a tour book of I.E. \\"trying to avoid the AC-DC sound\\". They went from the intelligent lyrics, and sound of 7th son to this almost sell out sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Praise of the Sterns","review":"Had to counter the only other review on this book. Also a big fan of the Sterns, didn't think of this as \\"rehashed\\" from earlier Sterns material, but rather, a celebration of all the great places they've discovered in their years of searching out the off-the-beaten-path shrines to American food. I loved this book--it reads like a National Geographic special on home cooking! To me, anyone who can get you excited about the thought of trying fried chicken from the Bon Ton Mini Mart must be doing something right--they've got my attention!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moon","review":"An excellent work of fiction and an excellent story. This film incorporates the feel of a major studio by using outstanding written accomplishment to obtain a quality production.The story takes all of the good things out of a series of other sci-fi films, such as 2001, Outland and Aliens but avoids the dark and confusing linage of those that remain, such as Bladerunner and Prometheus.You won't have to figure anything out, but will be glad and horrified at the same time by the film's conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sci-fi with an endearing twist","review":"How is it that I didn't see this moving until just a couple of weeks ago?? Absolutely beautifully done. At first you think you know where this is going, the typical sci-fi one man in space against machine and then there's this amazing twist that really brings this film to the next level. I laughed, I cried, it was way better than Cats. ; ) Seriously, well worth the watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Really enjoyed this one","review":"While at the video store, I pulled up my Amazon iPhone app and read reviews for movies that were on the shelf - but that I had not heard of. I wanted something that was not mainstream - but would surprise me. I came across Moon and then read these reviews. The rating was higher than a lot of other films and the reviews here seemed very favorable... So I gave \\"Moon\\" a shot (pun intended). It was GREAT. Thank you Amazon reviewers for giving this film its due credit. Because of you, I was able to enjoy it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moon DVD","review":"I think Sam Rockwell is an excellent actor. Not only is he about the only actor in this movie, he carries off multiple roles.I don't recommend knowing anything about this movie in advance -- especially don't watch the trailer! It gives away too much in what is a movie with many twists and should actually keep you guessing. It is fairly predictable if you watch the trailer, but, Rockwell's fine acting carries the movie. Kevin Spacey has a voice only part in the movie.As you watch the movie -- and again, Rockwell's multiple roles -- you will forget that you are watching the performance of only ONE actor. It's very easy to forget as he plays them so well. Many may disagree, but I felt this performance was at least Academy Awards nomination worthy. I believe Sam Rockwell is one of the most under-rated actors in Hollywood.The DVD has some fine extras that enhances the movie experience overall, but don't watch them first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sci-Fi goes back to its roots: a great story.","review":"I kept looking for Rod Sterling's credit at the end, because thats what this felt like watching Moon. It starts out and your sure you know where its going. but nope. it has its own life. I got this DVD just to see what it was like. saw its trailer on another DVD, it got my interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast-paced sci fi thriller","review":"This was a fast-paced thriller with a surprisingly satisfying ending. It was also the story about the goodness in one's self."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely brilliant","review":"The character development is so strong that Sam Rockwell role has proved what a top level actor he is. This is one of those rare movies where you can connect with the character so much that you want him to be real, because while you're watching him he seems real. It's absolutely beautiful acting & writing.The story is incredibly simple but it's presented in a way that it keeps unfolding itself throughout the entire movie. There is a twist, but the twist is early in the movie (which is rare). The rest of the movie is the character facing the reality of the twist, going through emotions & realizations that are gripping in a very subtle & true way.This is not a thriller, it's not a movie you just watch for entertainment, it's very engaging. I cannot recommend it enough for people that enjoy quality story-telling."},{"rating":"2","title":"A moving mystery","review":"An entertaining space mystery, horrifying yet genuinely moving. Kevin Spacey is great as this film's version of HAL.In the future, most of the Earth's energy needs are met by one corporation mining some wonder material on the moon. The protagonist is the sole human operator needed, scheduled to be rotated out soon.On a trip to check out a mining location, he has an accident. This sets off a strange cascade of events, which he has to unravel to understand his situation. And it's a doozy.Production values and effects are good enough, Rockwell's performance is great, and the whole thing is worth a watch or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moon preview","review":"I've decided after switching to bluray to limit the amount of movies I purchase, not because blurays cost more, but because of the 200 plus dvd's I own. So I bought Moon because I wanted a movie that I thought would have good acting (it does), good dialog (check), and a story that really drives the movie. Moon will not blow you away with it's special effect's or cgi, it will keep you watching because Sam Rockwell does a superb job in this role.Buy it or rent is you won't be dissatisfied with this movie, especially with 1080."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie should be sent to the MOON, or where ever !!!","review":"First off before I get all the backlash from all the people who loved this movie, I didn't hate this, but realy don't get all the hype on it? In general, the movie I thought, was kind of boring, with an ending that brought little to the table. To be honest, even the ladies at hollywood video had said what a great movie this was besides all the great reviews on amazon. I already knew the movie had a slow beginning and would move along slow, so I sat there watching and waiting to see towards the ending how this thing would play out. Well not to spoil anything but just to say I was realy expecting more. There was no real suspense there. Only because of the good reviews did I purchase the movie, but I found it only mildly entertaining. I gave this 2 stars only because it didn't live up to the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.","review":"I love Sam Rockwell, and I was sure that I'd love the movie based on the reviews and the trailer...I didn't. This movie has an excellent idea, but though Sam Rockwell is a fantastic actor, he wasn't electrifying to watch. His performance was genuine and incredible, but boring. There would be periods when it would feel like the movie would pick up and take me somewhere exciting, but then it wouldn't deliver. I wasn't looking for Michael Bay 'splosions and Roland Emerich-level apocalypses, but this seemed more like a novel playing out on screen than a movie. A novel that didn't translate well to images.Moon has a lot of potential. A really fantastic idea, an interesting group of actors, an interesting ending and a thoroughly developed lead character are all things that the movie has going for it. The movie just failed to deliver on all of its promise. It could have been so much more than it was... but it just wasn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie and quality","review":"this movie is so great. blu ray extras were sufficient and cool. buy this movie, you will have no regrets"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dont Read What it is about and you will enjoy it more.","review":"Dont read what this about in advance and you will have a great time.I watched it with low expectations because the actor seemed not familiar but I like the moon so I thought I would give it a shot. I ran across trailer by accident. There were nice surprises and twist and turns and I came away thinking. Where has this movie been hiding. Everything was a cool surprise and I never knew how it could possibly end until the end and then I was pleasantly satisfied. The Cover of the dvd looks horrible though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loneliness, Fear, and Hate - All In Space","review":"Ok, ok, ok, this movie may not contain the most innovative plot. Heck, it might not even be that original. What this movie does, does and very, very well, is portray the feelings of the main character. This character is a lonely miner stuck on the moon. A man without any human interaction and working under a false assumption that he is himself. Through the movie he finds that what he thought was true is a lie, and then must deal with the emotional fallout of this realization. This is what this movie portrays so, so very well. So well, in fact, that you will feel his suffering and anger. Get this movie and see emotions on display with little being held back."},{"rating":"1","title":"$9.99 REALLY!!","review":"I cannot believe I paid $9.99 to watch this movie on-line--I sure wouldn't want to own it.

I never walk out of a movie, but when I saw Moon in the theater I came closer than I ever have before. The plot is tedious and predictable, with several aspects that make absolutely no sense and are never even attempted to be explained (ghostly lady walking around on the surface of the moon?) Also, I understand that this was an independent film, but the production values and set pieces are laughable. This movie is so bad that I actually told people to go see it as a practical joke. Anyone with a sense of what makes good sci-fi, or a good story in general, will have nothing but contempt for this steaming pile of excrement on celluloid (or blu-ray, in this case)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great independent film that has a big budget feel to it","review":"I have no idea why this movie was never seen in theaters. While you have some of the more boring high-budget films out there, this one slipped through the cracks because it's an independent film, but it doesn't seem like it. Sam Rockwell does an incredible job of portraying different aspects of the character, and Kevin Spacey really puts a lot into his vocal work for Sam's only companion, a robotic assistant.The special effects here are top notch, but it's the story that takes center stage. There were several times when I thought I would know what was going to happen, but the story would turn from there. I honestly never saw the ending coming, and that made it much more satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moon - DVD","review":"Directed by: Duncan JonesStarring: Sam Rockwell, Kevin SpaceyRunning time: 97 min.

But as with his acting career, he dropped out early, (although I must say I think he was a much better author than an actor). I read Voyage many years ago and went on to read \\"The Wanderer\\" his autobiographical work. Voyage is about a sailor and the hardships of the sea in the late 1800s. It also deals with the labor union movements of that era. A victim of McCarthyism which ended his acting career, Sterling Hayden's political agenda, in my opinion, was evident in this book.

I call it a \\"thriller\\" in quotation marks because it is in that genre. Really, though, the film does not have that effect. Halfway through the film, things get boring and never picks up until the final scenes. Instead of using true true suspense, The Jackal resots to violence that is both bloody and unnecessary. Usually, I feel that the more violence the better, but it should never be used to fill loop holes in a weak and pretentious story. And maybe it's just me, but I did not get some of the plot twists in this movie. Bottom line, The only reason it should be seen is if its a weekend night and there's nothing left at the video stroe.

Content is one double sided flipper disc: one side the BD, the other the dvd. You can't play both at the same time, but fortunately I have my old single dvd copy which I'm keeping. You may be wondering why? Because Universals put the director audio commentary, as well as extras (the making of), on the dvd, not the BD side! Very frustrating. Fortunately I have 2 BD players to run both if I ever need the 2nd audio channel while watching the BD.

He might as well have scales under his skin and yet he's calm, professional, dignified and even courteous. That's his act.

The lesson was this:\\"Live a life of international crime while dating IRA hitmen, immigrate illegally to the USA where you deceive your husband and kids about your past until, in a moment of vigilanty vengeance, you shoot someone in a subway.

The plot had some interesting elements, but what ruins the film are pretty much everything else. Richard Gere, especially, turns out to be quite annoying and incredibly dull. The chemistry between him and Diane Verona's character didn't work at all.

I should admit the first half of this remake really captured the full attention of the audience.Bruce Willis made his second best acting after \\"Twelve monkeys\\", despite of the fact he doesn't get to acquire the gelid expression of Edward Fox, he gets to involve the spectator.The problem with the film resides in the unnecesary amount of secondary roles, with Sydney Poitier looking extremely uncomfortable with the role, with Richard Gere whose baby face makes incredible his role as an Irish terrorist and the presence of a Russian agent makes the movie had fallen into a very entangled web of dramatic lines whose final resolution affects the primary plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Really IS a bad movie","review":"Okay, Bruce Willis is this master assassin who never leaves a trace.

That's right, the blueprints! And that's what helps them solve the crime he's planning to commit. Boy, this Jackal is a genius - isn't he? Later in the movie he crosses from Canada into the US by boat. Then he makes his getaway from the police using his van. Only one problem, he left the van in Canada (or did he somehow carry it on the boat?) It didn't seem like that big a boat. Well, you get the idea. The film asks you to believe your dealing with an evil genuis, too bad it was written by a dunce."},{"rating":"1","title":"a cheap imitation of a beautiful original","review":"Even with nothing better to do this film was a total waste of time. It hurt's to watch each and every moment of this movie-- especially if one compares this cheap imitation, with its overblown, and overbombed scenes to the original Day of the Jackal. By the last scene it left me calling for the blow up of the first lady to bring some interest to the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major weak point!","review":"I heard so much about this movie but when I started watching it, I felt disappointed.At first, everything goes well... if you like spy movies! Yes, you can swallow it. But what I really didn't swallow was that Richard Gere (IRA) can always guess & predict what Bruce Willis (spy) is going to do next!I mean come on, an IRA knows, predicts and does everything as if he can read Bruce's mind! This was stupid hole in the movie that I couldn't swallow or accept... so the movie gets down rated!Yes, great actors names but awful movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a pale imitation","review":"standard far-fetched action flic - Richard Gere so-so, Bruce Willis completely mis-cast, only bright light was Diane Venora as hard-nosed former KGB agent - anyone who thinks this is as good as the original \\"Day of the Jackal\\" is a moron"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor remake of a classic","review":"I missed \\"The Jackal\\" when it was released, but the promo's all said it was a modern remake of the classic \\"Day of the Jackal\\". Forget it! Not only is this a bad remake, it's so boring I trashed it halfway thru and never want to see it again. Put your time and money into the original \\"Day of the Jackal\\" and see what a great movie-maker like Fred Zinneman and company can do with a story like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a terrific action flick! See it!","review":"There's a reason this movie is on TV all the time... it's great. A very good plot, excellent acting, a scary villain, a sympathetic protagonist and strong ending (I love those), make this a 5-star action movie choice! I enjoyed it very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruce Willis the Bad Guy","review":"Usually, we associate Bruce Willis with the many and varied good guy roles he has played, like John McLane in the \\"Die Hard\\" trilogy or Harry, the mission commander in \\"Armageddon\\".Not so with his title role in \\"The Jackal\\".It was incredibly surprising to me to see the lengths he goes to in order to avoid being captured by Sidney Poitier and Diane Venora, with help from Richard Gere, the only other man who can identify the Jackal. This is one guy you do not want to mess with.I'm willing to bet that playing this role was a nice change for Willis. The fun that he's having portraying this monster is frightneningly evident in several scenes.Not only that, Gere's character is a criminal as well....but I guess there really is a kernal of truth to that old expression, \\"the lesser of two evils.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Based on better form \\"Day of the Jackal\\"","review":"Although a great movie, \\"The Day of the Jackal\\" (the movei which the Jackal was based on) was better. It had a better plot and less killing. I would recommend \\"The Jackal\\" to anyone, but see \\"The Day of the Jackal\\" first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, but BluRay doesn't have spanish subtitles","review":"I love this movie, great action, great content, great artists, great everything...But, I live in Latin America, so I thought that watching (and hearing) this movie in BluRay should be a great experience... but I'm very disapointed because the BluRay format doesn't have Spanish Subtitles, just English language and subs.Even, the DVD has French language and Spanish subtitles, but I really love watching movies in HD.If you speak English, go ahead and enjoy this movie..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zip this one back up.","review":"Dont you just HATE it when the good-guy just \\"knows\\" everything!? The one star is for the nifty cannon. Dont waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A substandard remake","review":"Other than the opening credit sequence and Carter Burwell's score, there is little to recommend this ill-advised effort. Compared to the spare elegance of Fred Zinnemann's original, this film is yet another instance of Hollywood's addiction to overblown crap. It is small wonder that Zinnemann tried to prevent any reference to his movie by this inferior film.Where to begin? Willis's use of a gigantic gun that is remote controlled rather than a weapon that was concealed within a crutch in the original movie. A wildly miscast Jack Black. The testing of a gun that blows up a van sending a gigantic fireball into the sky; how inconspicuous. Willis buying a yacht to cross the longest undefended border in the world. And since when has the FBI had jurisdiction in Russia?It just goes on and on. Watch the opening credits and then shut off the machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use Once & Destroy","review":"Not too good, not too bad, \\"The Jackal\\" is one of those average action movies that brings nothing new but it\`s a competent and mildly pleasant product nonetheless. The plot is derivative and predictable, the characters are bland, yet director Michael Caton-Jones chooses some decent actors (Bruce Willis, Richard Gere), a neat soundtrack (Massive Attack, Primal Scream, Moby) and some decent action sequences that manage to deliver a minimum level of entertainment value. As far as popcorn movies go, there\`s certainly worse, so this is a fair choice to spend a couple of mind-numbing hours.Watchable but forgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ended Too Fast","review":"Crisp, clean movie. Suspense kept me on the edge of my seat until the exciting end. Gere and Willis were both superb in this thriller. Sometimes suspense is better than lots of \\"blow-em up action\\". I liked it much better than Die Hard. The special effects will surprise you and make it much better than the old version. Somewhat similar to \\"The Specialist\\" which is probably Silvester Stallone's best movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"See the great 1970's Day Of The Jackal instead","review":"This movie is not a thriller or thrilling like the 1970's Day Of The Jackal. It's mostly dumb action pre-teen boy stuff with little suspense or interesting plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLASPHEMY!","review":"An insult to anyone who has a brain! How dare they!

Charles Calthrop a.k.a. \\"The (one and only) Jackal\\" to dispose off the herd of imbeciles who thought(?) out this \\"remake\\"!I WANT MY MONEY BACK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you enjoy spy movies, but still have taste for action...","review":"An excellent movie. I'll say that it doesn't compare to other \\"hitman\\" favorites of mine, such as The Professional or the original Day of the Jackal. But I'll say this: I was never a real fan of Bruce Willis, until I saw this movie. The plot develops strongly as the movie progresses. You begin to see the changes in Willis' character, going from cool and smooth to jumpy and paranoid near the end. You learn more about each character as the story progresses as well. I'll admit, the hit at the end was dimunitive of its potential. Not because of the subject's role, but because he/she wasn't an actual person.The original film had DeGaul as the subject, making the film more shocking and serious. The target in this movie would have been pleasing if he/she was an actual person.Besides the shortcomings of the conclusion, I still find this movie very interesting. Definitely worth seeing. There is some fine acting and scenery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Time","review":"Modern society is impatient and lacks the mental ability to appreciate many fine things. If you do not fit into MTV society, don't waste your time and see the original. Yes, the original is slower. But it is smarter. You don't have some stupid only some guy in prison knows the guy. Let's rip off the Rock a little more. Richard Gere's character was superfluous. The greatness of the original was that it was a cat and mouse, tense movie. This movie is fair at best. I wouldn't waste your time with this. There are much better, less trite, less predictable movies being made today."},{"rating":"1","title":"No oscar nominations? What a surprise.","review":"An entertaining movie with a no brainer plot. Bruce Willis actually portrayed his character well but I couldn't get by the terrible Irish accent by Richard Gerbil whoops I mean Richard Gere. I would reccommend the movie to be rented but not bought, unless you're like me and you just like the site of your collection getting bigger. In that case, buy the Dolby Digital version and save some dough. There really isn't a whole lot to take advantage of the DTS capabilities here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget this, get \\"The Assignment\\"","review":"This was released the same year as \\"The Assignment\\". Shame, because it probably stole some of that movie's thunder due to the \\"names\\" in this [although the cast of the Assignment isn't exactly shabby].Simply put, this is mildly entertaining in the action genre, 'The Assignment' is top notch. Don't disappoint yourself, rent 'The Assignment' instead...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Done much better in 1972","review":"I was not present at the deliberations of the committee that manufactured this movie. But I think their decisions were guided by two principles: eschew originality and embrace cliche. And they held to these principles with an admirable consistency, even at the expense of entertainment and coherence. If you like drama, tension, and intelligence more than you like armor-piercing incendiary ordnance and computer technology, then see 1972's Day of the Jackal. It is still entertaining after all these years."},{"rating":"1","title":"preposterous and unnecessary","review":"Willis preens around in various disguises making sure he doesn't smile, Gere gets to try out his Irish accent. Mean-spirited, uninteresting and a complete waste of time.

A Russian mafia boss, devistated by the death of his brother wishes to get revenge on the American FBI for assisting the Russian Police. By doing so The Mafia Boss hires The Jackal to assassinate an authority figure of the United States, and this victim is kept a mystery to the audience until the end.

I don't understand why such stars would lend their names to a script that must have been written by a committee of dum dums."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst ending of a movie I have ever seen!!","review":"The movie was entertaining and the acting was good at least by Bruce Willis. The whole movie is about Willis building a remote control weapon for an assasination. So why does he stand in between the gun and the target when he could be 5 miles away? This ruined the whole movie for me. Maybe filmmakers should be more concerned with storyline than big actors and special effects to carry their film through. A better example of a movie remake with a real story would be the Fugitive with Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones. Maybe the director should look at this film more closely. Don't bother buying this film unless you like disappointing endings!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Double Sided Disks Are Evil, Don't Buy This Release","review":"Universal, for some reason, has elected to continue to produce these double sided disks that contains the Blu-ray movie on one side and the DVD on the flip-side. Why is it that Universal cannot follow in Disney's lead and release these movies as two disk sets. Disney has combo disks that contains the Blu ray and DVD version in the same release, but the DVD and Blu ray disks are on separate disks, utilizing single sided disks.I seriously do NOT recommend this item for purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gere has an accent and Willis changes identitys, good","review":"a solid thriller with Willis as The Jackal and he is hiring to kill a man, Gere is the man in prison who knows The Jackal's evern move. good beginning with the club scene then goes into that famouse scene where the guy gets an axe in the back of the head and then it gets good with Willis switching faces and putting beards on. by the end we have an assassination attempt, a great chase threw the subway and a killer ending. Willis has never been better, Gere with a great Irish accent, Poitier always enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Hollywood dreck...","review":"I bought this as one of those Blockbuster previously viewed specials for a couple bucks, thinking, how bad can it be?It's bad, really, really bad.There is nothing romantic about being a terrorist for hire, yet Hollywood, with Bruce Willis in the uber-terrorist role, manages to pull it off. This is a movie that will offend your senses and your intelligence. Richard Gere is wasted, and there aren't even many of the quote-unquote \\"cool\\" explosions for the teenage boy set.This sets the standard for lame-o, offensive action \\"thrillers.\\"Avoid.

Ham-handed acting, terrible comedic interjections (who needs comedy in a movie like this?), and silly bridge sets where the actors are mostly oblivious to near-hits in the sea just behind them. But worst of all, there was no attempt to disguise the USS Salem heavy cruiser, which stood in for the Graf Spee. The two ships actually bore some resemblace, but c'mon guys, couldn't you at least paint out the Salem's prominent 139 bow number for the movie, rather than lamely suggesting that it was a \\"disgise\\"? A disguise for a US ship that wasn't commissioned until 1949?! The Graf Spee certainly did not wear a large bow number as she prowled the Atlantic. Overall rating: pretty much a waste of time unless you don't konw the story; they should have done a better job when they had the ships around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This was my favorite battle from the history of World War Two and i couldn't wait to watch this as soon as it was ordered, but as early as it started i began to have doubts of it's quality representation of historical facts. I noticed many flaws in it's use of models to represent the ships involved, also the wrong ship was pictured sometimes. What bothered me the most was the inclusion of a \\"dramatic plot-line\\" which had nothing to do with the Battle of the River Plate, and instead omited historical facts from the film (for example when the Captain of the Graf Spee commited suicide at the end, which was never covered in this film.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"the battle of the river platte. one of best warship movies","review":"For a warship collector to see these ships in there 1950's appearance was exciting.

It can provide just the attitude adjustment one needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damien Rice On Prozac","review":"Ray Lamontagne's tracks are a very nice blend of the moodiness and intelligence of Damien Rice and the blues-folk fusion of Ben Harper. On a final comparative note, the entire time I was listening to the CD, I couldn't help but be reminded of Eric Martin (lead singer of Mr. Big) singing \\"To Be With You\\".On the first listen, I gladly heard every track in its entirety without the usual itchy trigger-finger hovering above the skip button. Granted, other than some well-placed mid-tempo numbers, I couldn't tell one track from the other. Still, if the entire album has to sound like one song, he picked a really good song.The album is a must for any TV or movie soundtrack producer. His writing is full of very specific and vivid imagery, settings and situations. And, the instrumentation and vocals are equally keen at invoking both mood and memory.Pick a track - any track - and listen to the preview snippet. If you like it, buy the CD. You will not be disappointed. Scout's honor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply stunning","review":"This CD, from both a lyrical and musical standpoint, is simply stunning. Touted as the next Van Morrison, his style is also reminiscent of Ryan Adams' more acoustic, alt-country songs, but tinged with an incredible soulfulness.

Your Cat Stevens, Van Morrison, Neil Young, and Jackson Browne albums can all take a well deserved rest.All of the qualities that made those artists so great are here in these songs. Ray's soulful voice is filled with a passion that rivals both those of Cat Stevens and Van Morrison, yet it remains uniquely his own. His guitar playing is rich with melodic rythms that flesh out his thoughtful lyrics. There is also some very nice percussion work here peppered throughout most of the songs.All in all this is a great album and a welcome entry into the genre of the singer/songwriter. Songs like \\"Trouble\\" and \\"Forever My Friend\\" will surely keep you interested and eager to know what will be next from this promising new artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth and scratchy","review":"A voice this distinctive deserves great songs to show it off.

I'll take the latter...","review":"Words cannot express the power of Ray's voice. Please buy this album, and let the mournful, cavernous, sugar-textured sincerity of every utterance carry you deep into your soul, into a place where you and Ray are madly in love, where Ray understands every ounce of pain or lust you have ever experienced, and sings each note like it is his last. Each bluesy melody and sexy syncopated rhythm must feel blessed that it has been created by him. Have I made myself clear? See him live, close your eyes, be carried away...but then open them to witness the urgent honesty in his. Ray, thank-you for singing.

How often does an artist come along that can stand up to the greatness of Van Morrison, or (dare I say it?) Bob Dylan? Here's one, and here's hoping he's around for a long time to come.LaMontagne was a high school dropout, working in a shoe factory in rural Maine, when he woke up one day to a song on the radio that changed his life. Hearing that song made him realize that this - singing, writing songs - was what he was meant to do with his life. And it turns out the man has the talent to back up this epiphanal experience.The CD is mellow, uplifting, and heart-breaking. The title track will fill you with the utter joy of a man who's had a hard life, but who's been, \\"saved by a woman,\\" as LaMontagne joyfully exclaims. On \\"How Come\\" he laments of the senselessness of \\"man, killing man, killing man, killing man, I don't understand.\\" And all the other tracks are equally as wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Even though there are only 10 tracks on this CD, all of them are worth listening to.

I want to buy all of his music :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible voice, too much sadness","review":"This incredibly sexy, soulful voice cries out for hope.

The first time I heard \\"Trouble,\\" I thought two things (1)What a good song, and (2) This dude sounds a lot like Tracy Chapman, who is not a dude. Since then I have become absolutely entranced by the album. Now \\"Trouble\\" is my second least favorite song on the album, and I still like it a lot.The song \\"Jolene\\" is gut-wrenching and fantastic. The line \\"Man needs something he can hold on to....A nine-pound hammer or a woman like you\\" knocks me to the floor every time.I hope that you buy this album, and I hope that you enjoy it as much as I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"The man can sing....","review":"This is hands-down my top CD of the year... a claim clinched by seeing him perform live twice since its release. His incredibly soulful, emotive voice is heightened by his humble spirit and his seeming disbelief that he is where he is, doing what he is doing. It is refreshing to witness this in a performer, particularly one who possesses such a unique talent.This CD stayed in my CD player for a solid month, and it left only begrudgingly.... It makes its way back in with some frequency."},{"rating":"2","title":"No 'Trouble' with this vinyl","review":"One thing I've loved about Ray LaMontagne's sound is the vintage, warm vibe it creates. I'd always enjoyed listening to it on mp3 through a good set of speakers, but thought I'd give it a shot on LP. Folks, I couldn't be more pleased. The packaging is beautiful, the quality is solid, and it translates to vinyl flawlessly. Definitely worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Trouble\\"","review":"Excellent CD. Grab it and let it grab you. Ray LaMontagna has an excellent voice and cadence and writes memorably. His voice has been compared to many of the all-time greats like Van Morrison but I find him to be rather unique. Soulful and ranging with a gravely voice, his compositions on this 2006 work vary although each is skillfully executed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dancing with the Devil-ROCKS!","review":"I saw Ray on a special on T.V. As soon as I heard his voice...I knew I had to have that CD. I went online to amazon.com, where I order ALL my music from because you can usually find the best price. Found the one that had the songs that I really liked the most.Bought the CD..and I can play it on and on and not get tired of it. This is a man who sings from his \\"soul\\" and there is something quite \\"unique\\" about his voice. I don't know if you remember when Rod Stewart came onto the scene with his kinda \\"raspy\\" voice that was so \\"pleasing\\" to the ear.I think Ray has that same kind of raspiness...just a little more refined. Without hearing any of the other CD's...this has got to be my favorite. There is NO song I don't care for. Each...and every one Wonderful..with \\"TROUBLE\\" being my personal favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Buying!","review":"I bought this CD because of the song \\"Trouble\\". I wish more of the songs on this cd carried the same vib, but they didn't. I still consider it a good cd to purchase. I play it often, but I expected more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Instant Love!!","review":"I'd never even heard of Ray LaMontagne until a few days ago when I saw a brief ad for \\"Trouble\\" on SBS TV here in Australia.Well, I only needed to hear a few seconds grab of a couple of the songs for me to instantly fall in love. I knew immediately I was listening to something great. I rushed out the next day and bought a copy and I haven't stopped either listening to it or singing the songs in my head wherever I go.What a voice! What passion, pain, love, longing and joy he manages to convey in this beautiful, beautiful album of 10 marvellous songs. I love every song on the album (but special favourites are Hannah, Jolene & Forever My Friend).I'm going to pass the word amongst family & friends to buy this CD. As many people as possible deserve to know about and appreciate such a talent as this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent album","review":"I bought this album for the title track, but I have loved it more with each listen. Ray Lamontagne has a beautiful, soulful voice.I also agree that this would be a great makeout album...or just perfect for summer nights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ditto.","review":"Initially it is a slackened and sexy album. Probably the best makes-outside the album released since the semi one with late 70s. There inevitable comparison of will of the model of Lamontagne with Van Morrison. It is not a bad thing. Personally I would say that it is nice cross of Morrison, Otis Redding, and Bob Dylan, with some contemporary notes of the 21st century as well. Like lower result, its voice is strongly emotive and a perfect foil for the somewhat minimal and honest production on the disc. The album is uniformly excellent, and never monotonous. Its motionless growth on me, but feel Lamontagne of I has more remaining power than Jack Johnson, or any lyric writer of singer of this generation unless Elliott Smith (TEAR). Obtain on this album early, it is guaranteed to be sensational success. If all is well Lamontagne a long career will have. These songs are such a joy to test."},{"rating":"1","title":"No onscreen lyrics to sing along to.","review":"I decide to write a review as this is a piss poor product.

Just finally got this tool. Made the job way faster and easier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Southern Rock Band","review":"Being a huge fan of the Allman Brothers Band, I purchased Grinderswitch's first album, \\"Honest to Goodness\\", on a whim. I am so glad I took that chance when this album first came out in 1974 and purchased the CD when it first came out in the mid-90's. This band's musical style is very much like that of the Allman Brothers, with a good blend of blues and southern rock. Dru Lombar is an outstanding lead guitarist and does some extremely good solo work throughout these songs. The highlights of the album are \\"Kiss the Blues Goodbye\\", \\"How the West Was Won\\", \\"Roll On Gambler\\", \\"Catch a Train\\" and \\"Homebound\\". This is one of my favorite albums of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent History and Entertainment","review":"I fell in love with this History Channel program several years ago, when I would catch it on television. Now, I am proud to say that I own this collection. The historical information surrounding the history of each weapon is both reliable and entertaining. The narration is superb, clearly audible and pleasing to the ear. After watching most of the episodes in this collection, I have noticed that the show does not necessarily glamorize firearms, but gives a fair assessment of their historical significance and place in time. It is a great collection both for its entertainment value as well as its informational value.The packaging is also nice, with all of the discs in individual cases, two discs per case. The menus on each disc are easy to navigate, allowing the viewer to select clearly identifiable segments of each particular show. For any fan of history, firearms, or both, this collection is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"I've seen many of these shows on the History Channel, and found them to be entertaining and informative. The DVD collection is well made. Each episode provided with relevant chapters to enable one to jump into it at for a specific item of interest. Additionally, each DVD is arranged with related episodes being grouped together, rather than simply copying them onto the DVDs in the orginal order in which they were shown on the History Channel.A number of reviews have commented negatively on the video quality. I find that they present themselves just fine on my 64\\" TV. Yes, they are a tad grainy and obviously not shot in HD, but the video qualtity does not really impair the viewing experience, and they are certainly light-years ahead of VHS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"What they said!I'm not normally a fan of history, but this set is well worth it. Fascinating, accurate. Watch one episode and you'll be hooked. It's that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD Set !","review":"This is a great DVD set for the gun aficionado in the house. The pistols, rifles, and automatic weapons that made history from the US, Russia, Israel, Germany, UK, Japan and more. From all the different time periods, revolutionary war, civil war, old west. WWI, WWII, up to modern times. Also the manufacturers stories, the weapon designers stories. A wealth of firearm history is contained in this set. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave Rocks!","review":"This Cd is just awsome in my eyes! The guy's are so intertaining to watch live and have a real heart for god. It is hard to find good talented christian music on the heavy side and this is it! Heavy but still able to worship in my own way. Can you believe the guitar player was like 15 when they recorded this?

The part about life on moonbase is very well written, and I think it's the best part of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice colonization story","review":"\\"Moonrise\\" is my first Ben Bova book and I have to say I will be looking for more of his work. His descriptions of life building an outpost on the moon I believe are quite accurate to what the real explorers may one day encounter. Their attempts to live off the land by extracting materials from the regolith (lunar soil) is how I envision colonization will eventually be done. The only real plot point requiring any substantial \\"suspension of disbelief\\" is in the development of virus-sized nanomachines to build things atom by atom."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry, but...very predictable and mundane...","review":"I was expecting great things from my first Ben Bova novel, but I'm afraid the dialog is too corny for me! I'm used to reading Dan Simmons and Ian M. Banks, and I guess I was expecting a little more flair... the plot and ideas are good, but it just didn't cut the mustard for me as a novel. I just didn't find myself believing the characters were for real... as one reviewer put it - made-for-TV. On the plus side, there are quite a few tense moments that are well-crafted. But not enough to sustain the momentum for such a long book... in the end I didn't really care what happened to the characters. In summary: look elsewhere for deep characters and thought-provoking prose..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak characterizations, coupled with mediocre plot.","review":"After reading Icehenge and Moving Mars, Bova's characters are paper thin and unbelievable. The plot pace jerks along from one implausible situation to the next. This book and the sequel, Moonwar are a great disappointment to those of us who like 'realism' in their science fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"good job Ben","review":"I recently read Ben Bova's Moonrise. This book was easily one of the best Sci-Fi books I have ever read. He had wonderful characterization and the plot kept you guessing. It had something for everyone. Some murder, some action, and some romance too. All-in-all it was a very good book and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fact: This cd kicks ...","review":"My Story:Knuckle Sandwich played some shows at my local firehouse and i go to almost every show and help out.

I mean REAL balls, as in basketballs. I've never heard their music, but I've played hoops with these guys at Lenape Park. They ROCK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fair adaptation of the classic novel","review":"This film is a fair adaptation of Graham Greene'sThe Power and the Glory (Penguin Classics). It is the story of a fugitive priest in Mexico during the infamous Calles Law period that used draconian methods to suppress religious freedom, particularly Catholicism, in Mexico. The laws led to the Cristeros war which is recreated in a new film this summer, \\"For Greater Glory.\\" For that reason, this is a good time to revisit this classic film.The novel focuses a great deal on the shortcomings of the main character and how he is maturing in his faith through redemptive suffering he undergoes in his flight from the police. He comes to grip with his greatest need when he observes, \\"at the end there was only one thing that counted - to be a saint.\\" Though the film adaptation necessarily lacks a great deal of this character development of the novel, it is still a moving reminder that hate can never ultimately conquer faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"You just can't kill that damn religion.","review":"This is another Henry Fonda snooze-fest. He plays a fugitive preist in a ficticious banana republic that has outlawed religion. Worse, they've outlawed wine. I immediately concluded that the the rest of the priests must be witless fools if he is the only one left. He goes about baptizing babies, hearing confessions, performing last rites & other acts of terrorism. Needless to say, this this has nothing to do with the tv series or Harrison Ford movie of the same name. At least they were entertaining. This is an unremtting grim message movie. It doesn't work. Excellent camera technique. Strange angles & use of dark shadows & lots of imagery. The camers loves Delores del Rio as the Madonna metaphor. Director John Ford did many excellent movies with John Wayne & Henry Fonda but this was his favorite. Go figure"},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece !!","review":"I was looking for this film on DVD since several years ago. I think this is a very good work of art for a real fan of old Mexican movies. This film was made in Mexico and describes a particular stort in times of revolution. With an American director, the story is interesting and the picture or photography is wonderful. The cast is excellent, we find Dolores del Rio, Pedro Armendariz, Miguel Inclán ... all of them great Mexican artists. Among the American artists we obviously find John Ford. Congratulations for this release."},{"rating":"1","title":"More John Ford Than Graham Greene","review":"Director John Ford's sanitized adaptation of Graham Greene's \\"The Power and the Glory\\" is best remembered for Gabriel Figueroa's atmospheric cinematography. Unfortunately, the Dudley Nichols screenplay bears little relation to Greene's novel - reflected in Henry Fonda's miscasting as the pursued Mexican priest. J. Carrol Naish deserves special mention for his ridiculous portrayal of an Indian informant. Dolores del Rio, Pedro Armendáriz and Ward Bond do their best under less-than-ideal circumstances. Despite Figueroa's superb location work, \\"The Fugitive\\" looks like an art film gone hopelessly awry. One of Ford's genuine misfires."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want to understand it all you MUST read this one","review":"If you seek to understand the Middle East, this is one you MUST read.

If you want to understand....."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!!","review":"I'm not a big fan of comic books, but I am extremely interested in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, so I bought this book based on that. I was not at all disappointed. The Palestinian experience is shown first hand through Sacco's interactions with them. The way they live their lives is heartbreaking, especially if you live in a free country like the U.S. The Palestinian people's resilience shines through at times, but unfortunately injustice and humiliation command most of the pages. Anyone with a respect for human rights should read this amazing book, whether you are Pro-Palestinian or Pro-Israeli."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good (and well-drawn) but not great","review":"Still a definite recommendation but slightly long and redundant. It's really one-sided (as intended) and should be taken with some balancing perspective. Artwork and the story-telling are both solid for the most part."},{"rating":"2","title":"A poignant account of what the Palestians have had to endure","review":"Joe Sacco's \\"Palestine\\" provides the western world with a powerful account of the Palestinian perspective of their conflict with Israel. Sacco's path takes him through much of the West Bank, Gaza, Jerusalem and parts of Israel. He tells the stories of the people he meets and through them paints a picture of the brutality and injustice they endure under the apartheid policies of Israel. With the media coverage of the conflict being what it is, the accessibility of the graphic novel format makes \\"Palestine\\" a singularly important work. By communicating the truth, perhaps a lasting solution to this conflict can be found.Although the journalistic content of \\"Palestine\\" is its primary value, it also stands on its own aesthetically. Sacco also writes well and the narrative flows smoothly from one part of his journey to another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distorted","review":"Palestinians have suffered, but just blaming Israel for everything means they will never get peace, never have a decent economy because they think Israel owes them something and will keep trying to destroy Israel.Palestinian leaders' corruption, indoctrination against Israel in schools and media breeds only hatred of Israel for no benefit.Palestinians must learn to live with Israel in Peace and stop exploding bombs on buses, firing missiles into Israel, to stop using knives such as on the Fogel family living in the ancient jewish homelands of Judea and Samaria. 2 terrorists came into their house, stabbed and shot the parents and children and cut off the baby's head.Comic books such as this distort the picture, and make peace harder to obtain."},{"rating":"1","title":"The comic side of Palestinian propaganda","review":"More of Sacco's single-minded obsession with placing all of the blame on the Israelis for the Arab-Israeli conflict.This book has nothing to do with a genuine search for historical truth and everything to do with anti-Israel bias.Sacco's use of crude pictures to tell a one-sided story of Jewish evil will, no doubt, remind some readers of similarly crude anti-Semitic graphics employed by the Nazis and indeed, by the Palestinians themselves. We need not linger on this obvious comparison to dismiss Sacco's comic books as the nastiest sort of polemic that sheds little light on either the origins of the current conflict or the nature of war. At a time when anti-Israel invective and Jew-hatred is on the rise around the world, the publication of works like this only encourages more hate; it does nothing to disseminate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor research w/ an agenda","review":"Palestine is melodramatic propaganda.It tows the PLO party line and does not provide any solutions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible writing, lack of facts with reputable sources =CRAP","review":"This book was written by a man who supported deadly terrorist attacks against ISraeli and Jewish civilians.

Additionally, he is both biased and sexist in his writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"suffering put plainly before the reader, without bias","review":"Sacco paints the situation realistically and lets his characters speak for themselves. Sacco is himself among the characters, treated objectively like the rest. This is a plain record of a visit to the territories occupied by Israel since their victory in the Six Day War. It is Sacco's intent, clearly, to portray the physical suffering and mental anguish suffered by all the participants. Among those participants are several Israelis. They are treated with just as much sympathy as the Palestinians. Those who claim that this book is \\"biased\\" have not read it or are themselves bigots of the sort that would embarrass millions of enlightened Israelis.The reviewers of July 25th and May 13th 2004 are writing from an agenda no better than that of a Klansman or a Marxist. They watch American television, rather than reading books. Can you see any evidence that they read Sacco's book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A special edition how wonderful","review":"Along with all other books that need to have special editions such asThe Complete Maus: A Survivor's Talethis wonderful dialouge between man and history, between artist and struggle and between activist and history calls for a special edition.

It's very easy to look up a subject and quickly understand it, which is essential when working through multi-faceted problems later. There are several problems in the text which have inaccurate solutions, but that's fairly minor for the vast resource this book has been to me.

I always used to say that Doc Watson made guitar playing sound easy, but Bromberg makes it sound just as hard as it is. I love both styles.

My wife and 12 year old son even used it without any difficulty. I was pleased to see only positive reviews on Amazon.com, and the price was considerably better than other nailers elsewhere.

Perhaps it is not fair to post this review, because I just could not endure it after 25 or so minutes. Numbingly contrived. Humorous? Good luck trying to find it. Hepburn in my opinion is ridiculously lionized. Spencer Tracy, however, is an acting marvel in such films as Father of the Bride.Let Maltin and the other so-called expert critics do duty to Tinsel town rather than risk alienating their insider friends and colleagues. Not I. Maybe it's a matter of \\"comedy\\" as they say being such a difficult thing, and much of it having a short shelf life."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't get it","review":"I feel this is one of those movies that everybody calls a classic just because they wouldn't dare go against it. Well, I will. Except for the hilarious opening, with Judy Holiday trying to kill her husband, I just didn't think this movie was that funny. The dialogue between Hepburn and Tracy is amusing, but not laugh-out-loud funny. Some may disagree, I know. But watch this movie not thinking it's a famous grand comedy, and you may find that it's not really all that funny. I don't know.... it could just be me. But be warned!For a good Hepburn film, see Bringing Up Baby. For a good Tracy film, see Inherit the Wind. For a good movie about Bruce Campbell fighting zombies, see Army of Darkness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated.","review":"The movie is a victim of poor writing. It has not held up over the years very well, but is a quite stilted and two-dimensional 1940s \\"battle of the sexes\\" movie. (Ah do declare! Ladies can be doctors and lawyers! Zounds!) The movie would have been worth seeing if Tracy had decked Kip and divorced Amanda...... Good acting, certainly, but I found myself glancing at my watch throughout. (The fact that the writers had obviously never been in a courtroom added to my displeasure)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very overrated","review":"I thought the actors were better than the script, and I thought the script was artificial, wooden and deadly dull. It simply was not funny. I didn't even care much for Judy Holliday (the only reason I watched and then kept a copy of this DVD), who, incidentally, did NOT win an Oscar for this flick! Hepburn was one of the kindest human beings in the theater (in the world!) and Tracy has long been a hero of mine, I love them both, but not in this fast-talking turkey. Only two things got my interest. What was Holliday's intention and did she kill Ewell at the start (I guess that's two things right there), and how did they manage the transexual metamorphoses at the end. I really didn't like it. Really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't see this film.","review":"First of all let me say Katharine Hepburn is my favorite actor of all time. Now let me say how much I despised this movie. I had high hopes for this film since I like Judy Holliday and Jean Hagen, however i cannot begin to describe to you how ludicrous this film is. If you have not seen this film save yourself see any other Katharine Hepburn film, or read a book, just don't watch this film. The plot is boring and contrived, and although this film is trying to make a statement about equal rights for women I think it fails. Katharine Hepburn relies too much on Spencer Tracy and the end of the film is a complete let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tracy and Hepburn - wittiest, most brilliant couple on screen","review":"The chemistry between Hepburn and Tracy delights viewers, old and new. Adam's Rib (1949) is courtroom comedy. It established their reputation as the wittiest, most brilliant couple on screen. It is even better in the light of some modern day duds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Into Classics","review":"This classic movie like most of them is a must have! Very funny! Kathrine is bound and determined to make a point how people view the sexes differently. Spencer in the end teaches her a lesson. Very entertaining movie.

Apparently, the author was a teacher at the Wooden Boat School.It covers everything from tools, wood selection, joinery and finishing.

It's much more accessible than general boatbuilding manuals such as Steward and Chapelle, but more in depth than the usual how-to book. The drawings are very helpful and the text is clear, concise and well organized (though for some reason there's no index). There are some subjects I would have liked to see discussed in more detail, but overall a great boatbuilding book."},{"rating":"2","title":"First time boatbuilders need this book.","review":"Covers it all with wit and wisdom. You will probably want other books as well, but this one is the best I have seen, with enough detail and breadth to take the mystery out of many of the processes required to build a boat."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a life saver","review":"I have never bothered to review a book on Amazon before, but this book has compelled me to do so. The description of the lofting process is a masterpiece. I took every book on boatbuilding out of the library and this book is the only one that could adequately describe this confusing and complicated process. I'm an inexperienced boatbuilder and I'm building a pretty complicated John Gardner boat, from \\"Building Classic Small Craft.\\" There are no full plans, just the dimensions in the offset table. If not for this book, it all would have remained hopelessly confusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"An essential reference - Building Small Boats","review":"Building Small Boats'Building Small Boats' by Roessel is an excellent overview and essential reference for anyone interested in the tools, materials and techniques of building traditional small watercraft. There is plenty of practical advice and great descriptions here to get started.

I'm not a fan of their ABC 123 Science kids stuff or even much of their latest adult work, but there's only one weak cut here: Lazyhead and Sleepybones, which seems written to put the kid to sleep and may work altogether too well to be listened to for any other reason..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I purchased this CD after reading several of the reviews and generally liking TMBG myself. I must say I am quite disappointed with this CD. The music is, in my opinion, not engaging in the least and strikes me as way too complex for small children. Nothing on this album \\"stuck with me\\" in the sense that I did not walk away humming any of the songs after hearing them. In fact, I found a few songs to be so unappealing I either felt like I couldn't wait for them to end or I just forwarded to the next track quickly. I do consider myself to have a fairly eclectic taste when it comes to music and was surprised by my aversion to this CD. My recommendation is to consider this only for older children, say age 6 or more and, if possible, try before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I also don't see this as being a \\"kids album\\"","review":"Most of these songs could have been on Apollo 18 (my favorite TMBG album by a landslide), but they would have been the weak titles on the CD.I found several of the songs to have jarring, dissonant vibes to them which I'd have to imagine would not appeal to youngsters.A favorite was \\"Where do they make balloons\\", which sounds a little as if the Monkees were invited to add a track to \\"Revolver\\". That is certainly one any child will enjoy and any parent could hum along to .. well, at least a few times.I'll come back to my love of Apollo 18. That is a better children's CD than this one... in part because it has dozens of very short songs that are silly and appealing in a Sendak vein (or quickly over). There is not a child's song on \\"NO!\\" which compares to \\"Mammal\\" or \\"Dinner Bell\\" from that collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE disappointment","review":"This CD is trying way way too hard to be cool.

It does not play correctly in several CD players I've tried (it's not scratched; it takes the CD players multiple minutes to find the tracks and then often can't play tracks 1-3); and on a computer, Winamp, Real Player, and other programs can't find the music to play it directly.It's a darn shame. I bet a lot of people would love this CD, but its \\"special features\\" make it all but useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic children's album for different ages","review":"My 7-year-old son and 4-year-old daughter have been diverging in musical interests of late. My son wants cooler, more grown-up sounding stuff, whereas my daughter wants simple, silly tunes. Imagine my excitement to find a CD that they both love, and that doesn't bore me as well! This is a fantastic CD that kids of many ages will love, and the lyrics are \\"safe\\" for even the most conservative of parents (except the implication that one spouse is going to leave another for having to do all the cleaning in \\"I am Not your Broom\\"). Definitely recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"I'm a big TMBG fan, and usually enjoy their brand of child-like kitsch. But here they cross the line between child-like and childish. The fact that they are capable of so much more, and are clearly doing this on purpose, doesn't change the fact that this album is terrible. You might as well go out and buy a Barney CD. It would sound about the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exactly that - NO!","review":"This CD is not for kids.

It's just downright scary. That's one thing, but the main reason is it sounds like it was made for kids. Kid's music doesn't have to sound like it was made for them. It should just be good music that appeals to kids and, ideally, their parents too. My kid likes the Beatles and Jimi Hendrix so, believe me, I have no fear of playing heavy material.

But don't let that dissuade you, it's enjoyable for all ages, especially the songs like \\"Four of Two,\\" \\"I am Not Your Broom,\\" \\"Where do They Make Balloons?\\" and \\"Lazyhead and Sleepybones\\" (which, by the way reminds me a lot of \\"My Evil Twin.\\")"},{"rating":"2","title":"Album for the whole family?","review":"They Might Be Giants are like no other band out there. They're not afraid to use goofy lyrics and tones of voice if it makes the song catchy. This is no exception. This album does sound a little more childish than their previous albums...yes, that IS possible. Personally, I don't see what would have made their previous albums unsuitable for the whole family. The Johns have only spouted a few swearing words in their dozens upon dozens of songs. Basically, this album is great if you have an open mind!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Love It","review":"This is an awesome album. I got it for my husband for Christmas. We both are They Might Be Giants fans. We both love it and so does our nearly 2 year old daughter. It is great to have a kid friendly album that is so adult friendly too. It is the same They Might Be Giants I am use to, only the lyrics are crazy in a kid appropriate way, meaning they do not compromise who they are to make a \\"kiddy\\" ablum. It is great, even if you don't have kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely perfect!","review":"I teach a class of awesome pre-schoolers ages 2 and 3. I often get kids' music to play for them. This CD is by far the class's favorite. They love it! And I do too! It has appeal for kids and adults. These guys are so talented and in touch with their inner child. There are so many singer-songwriters who didn't make it who put out kids' music, thinking that a kids' audience will be easy: but they're wrong. Kids know what they like and they really like this album. It is a real stand out in an oversaturated market. Bravo and thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"YES to NO!","review":"This little beauty is for the die hard TMBG fan, or the one with little einers. Some songs have the classic They feel, but some are just down right silly. I personally like it, but I can see how a newcomer could sway from this one. However, it warns the purchaser that the child is the target audience, so don't get it if you can't bare to listen to good advice and silly melodies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really a great kids album.","review":"I happen to be a big fan of They Might Be Giants. FLOOD is one of my favorite albums of all time. So of course I jumped at the chance to buy this one for my kids.Unfortunately, with the exception of \\"Don't Cross The Street,\\" most of these songs are regular TMBG songs that just happen to have kid-oriented phrases in the lyrics or the titles.There are some great, edgy kid albums out there. I recommend the fringy Music For Aardvarks line of recordings.But this one didn't cut it--especially with my four-year-old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old-New-Old Stuff From the Johns From NY!","review":"Don't get me wrong. I'm not a musical Yes-Man. I don't throw 5-Stars at an album just because I like the band. But, I am giving this album 5-stars even though I found it a little lacking. However, I did not find it lacking in quality. Rather, in surprises. See, if you are any kind of TMBG fan, then you've probably heard at least 15 of these songs already. Great songs, mind you, but not unfamiliar. I was hoping there would be more fresh unheard material on here, but alas, twas not to be. Even the funky Flash \\"Games\\" were over-previewed on the website. Also, the running time of 33 minutes left me gasping for more. Still, this is a children's album and, as such, it works. The songs are funny, sweet, unsentimental, and funky-fly. After hearing umpteen bland, boring, uninspired children's albums, this one definitely leads the pack. Pick it up, take it home, clap your hands, stomp your feet and jump in the air."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listenable and fun kids music","review":"My 2 and a half year old son loves this CD.

She listens to oldies (50s and 60s) mostly. But there are several songs on this disc that are catchy enough that she sings them around the house, in the car, etc. We love Robot Parade for instance, but the song about the Museum was just weird for a preschooler. Nevertheless, I recommend the CD and would just say if there is a song or two you don't like, just press skip and go to the next song!

It's not so much rock, as children's music, but there are some songs with the rock thing going on. Actually, those are his favorite songs on the cd. and im hoping that if he likes one they might be giants cd, he'll start to like another and another until he's a rock-a-holic or whatever.anyway, this cd is only for kids. i listened to about two minutes of it before i had to leave the room, because i was so disappointed in tmbg's 'new sound.' if you're an aspiring fan, don't buy this cd first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I was very excited when I saw this light at BestBuy for $19.99.

However, of the two I purchased, one of them didn't work at all (perhaps the two included lithium batteries were dead?), and when I went to use the other one for the first time, the light popped off of the arm. I unscrewed the back (necessary to replace the batteries), put the arm back onto the light, screwed it back on and it popped off again. So - I am returning both of them for a full refund.

It is not the worst I've ever heard, it is not like an old Ma Rainey or scratchy Billie Holiday recording, but there is not credit given for remastering, and I think it is safe to assume that these recordings, from 1966-1971, were NOT digitally remastered.The music is OK, Dillon is not particularly Soulful or vocally dynamic, but it is some pleasant Reggae/Jamaican-style music.

Deliver This! is the perfect example of presuming that every woman is smart enough to follow her heart, gather the information or stories she needs to make her decision, and then decide what is best for her and her family.

Alice tries desperately to fit in higher society and nearly alienates her friends and family as a result. Hepburn's performance is funny and heartbreaking. The sets are dated, but the insight on human behaviour is timeless. Alice gets Fred MacMurray in the end (not in the original Booth Tarkington novel); 1930's audiences relished happy endings."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A poor little rose for your thoughts.\\"","review":"Katherine Hepburn plays the ever upward-groping main character in this movie based on Booth Tarkington's novel, and she is excellent. From the wrong side of the tracks, Alice is in a constant pursuit to make it over to the right side. A wealthy man (Frd MacMurray) enters her life, and she tries to hide her real background from him; the results, of course, are disastrous (yet funny). The picture is a very faithful rendition of the book, and in both (though more so in the movie) we wait for Alice's great (and deserved) fall, but it doesn't come. There is also a subplot with her father and overbearing mother, when the father gets in trouble when he strikes out for himself in business - all a bit schmaltzy. In fact, the last 15 minutes are just that because Hollywood insisted on a happy ending rather than having MacMurray making his getaway, as is expected and happens in the book. That's a real shame.

This final album (issued as ATOMIC ROOSTER IV in the U.S., even though it was their 5th album) just hits the dirt. 60's R&B; singer Chris Farlowe is still around for this album, unfortunately, and really drags it down. Chris Farlowe singing songs about Satan? Gimme a break. By this time, Atomic Rooster had completely made the transformation from prog/hard rock band to dull prog/blues band.

At times the technical descriptions were laborious and needlessly in-depth. Much of the story has the main character, Jake Grafton, a likable if predictable character, struggling with the meaning of life. Much angst over whether to stay in the service and whether or not to marry. At about a third of the way in I began skimming pages because the pace was so slow. The sidekick character, Flap LeBleu, was far more entertaining and would be a good main character. All in all, I was disappointed in this book. Far too little story hidden among technical descriptions as exciting as an owners manual and whiny self-absorbed introspective blather from Grafton. Hard core fans of the Grafton series may appreciate the character insights but the uninitiated will likely find this a boring travail."},{"rating":"1","title":"seriously!?","review":"The first half of this book read like a flight training manual.

Stephen Coonts tells it like it really is during flight operations and doesn't leave much out. The only difference is that he relates just about every mishap that could ever happen to a naval pilot and his BN all happening within an eight month deployment - quite unrealistic, but definitely an engaging read. If everything in this book happened to a real pilot during a twenty year career, much less one eight month deployment, he'd likely lose his mind. If this is what peacetime is like on a carrier, I'd say bring back the war.

It has a great many sea stories, about flying off carrier decks at the end of the Vietnam War, and Jake Grafton's personal triumphs or tribulations as well. But the best, funniest part was when the ship crossed the Equator and King Neptune and his Shellbacks inducted all the lowly 'Wogs' into the fraternity of those who have sailed on a ship that crosses the Equator, and those who haven't.

You have to listen to them at least 3-4 times before starting to appreciate 'em. Most of all I love 'The View From Here' and like all others. The Way Out West remixes are great, especially the 'Not So Manic Now' remix. Motiv 8 are one of my favorite remixers as well.

Great for everyday kitchen use, from cutting thick vines of grapes to opening a bag. Blades are very sharp and easy to clean, and the handle is comfortable and strong.I wish the blades were just a bit longer. However, most cuts for kitchen use are short anyway, and the shorter blades can withstand thicker materials requiring more strength. So, for kitchen use, these shears work very well. By design, shears that are great for kitchen use will not be good for cutting wrapping paper (just an example), and because I needed something that provided strength, I am happy with these shears."},{"rating":"2","title":"They really cut it!!","review":"We have used a pair of cheap dollar store shears and complained every time especially my husband. He is just tickled that I bought these shears! They work like a champ. Fit our hands nicely, very sharp, compact and I no longer have to listen to his complaints !! Highly recomend. Very reasonable price, very good quality.They do cut chicken, I have used them many times for chicken ( especially good for cutting the tips off wings) with no problems.Great for trimming flower stems too.

Jack Olson gathered an enormous amount of first person inteviews with victims, families, psychiatrists, and Shawcross himself. Instead of getting fancy with the order of events (a la Don Lasseter), he logically lays it out for the reader. Shawcross is one sick pup and you'll get to know him real well by th time you put this book down. Only drawback--no pictures! Check out one the the cable companies' serial killer profiles to see what Shawcross looks like and his venues of murder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing","review":"I found this book very disturbing and I have read many books on serial killers. I thought Arthur Shawcross was one of the most fascinating serial killers until I read this book. It is very well written and unfortunatley you get to know the families / friends of the victims which makes it very difficult to read without becoming emotional, especially concerning his child victims - God rest their souls - I take my hat off to Jack Olsen and the way he wrote a brilliant account, with victims and families in mind, of one very sick individual. Be ready to have your world rocked and faith in humanity almost lost. I will never read anything on Arthur Shawcross again - maybe this is in respect to his victims or just plain disgust with one man who was let loose on society thanks to an overcrowded prison system and parol officers who did not have enough information to make such a decision. You really feel for the victims in this one - very upsetting. A really, really good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wealth of information for Chicago history buffs","review":"I'm an avowed Chicago history buff and found references in this book that simply cannot be found anywhere else. The bibliography alone has led to me several other books on the topic, which is appreciated. Really brought the city to life, and made you want to search out the street corners in question. I found myself asking older acquaintances if they ever met Richie Morrison.However I have to say the publishers did not do their job here. This book is poorly edited, suffering from simple errors such as misspellings (it's ward heeler, not ward healer), and in general confusing to those of us unfamiliar with the arcane characters filling the pages. I often found myself having to backtrack to figure out who the author was referring to -- a problem compounded by the numerous Irish names and confusing nomenclature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient Guide to Toronto","review":"This book is ideal for a short trip to Toronto or for those who don't care to carry large, bulky books with them on vacation. Most of the information is short, to the point, with a minimum of color commentary. There is a section devoted to the history of the city and references to other books for those who want more information. The book is small enough to fit in a backpack or even a coat pocket so it can be carried with you. Probably not ideal for an extended stay, but overall helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless book!","review":"I have not used a more useless guide book.1 - the pricing information for museums in this book are completely out of date! The prices they quoted for the AGO, ROM, Bata Shoe Museum and so on are often at least $10 less than the actual admission fees those places typically charge now.2 - they make downtown financial district sound like the coolest area ever, with a lot written about Nathan Phillips Square. That square is over-run with homeless people and pigeon poop!3 - The book has all of 3 lines about the West end of Toronto (Queen St, King St West, from West of Spadina). That's the coolest area in the city with so many good galleries and art spaces, independent businesses, great restaurants. It's a serious oversight of the book's authors to skip this area."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most underated metal album of all time!","review":"This classic is what metal is all about, fast guitars, a bass player that plays instead of just keeping a beat, and a polished sound that never sounds lame,(like most metal bands of the 80's).

Wonderful Jimmy Johnson type vocals and searing guitarwork on this track. It's worth getting just for this one. Many of the other tracks are worthwhile as well.Bobby Parker comes from that sort of Fenton Robinson school of Blues, in other words not as raw and primitive as say, Buddy Guy, but more towards the sweet soulfulness of Bobby Bland and Little Milton.Basically Bobby Parker is a dynamic Blues legend who has influenced alot of white rock'n'roll artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"70 years of miracles by Richard Harvey","review":"One of the most phenominal accounts that I have ever read of God's movement through someone's life other than the Bible. It is a book that moves quickly and can be picked up and read at different times or at one sitting. Richard Harvey relays how God moved through his as well as his parent's life. And it all happened within the past century! As you read this book, you will find yourself drawn to seek Jesus more personally and boldly. Harvey shows through his own life that God moves just a fully and vibrantly through the lives of His children today as He did in the days of Abraham and Paul. I would recommend this book to anyone from the fresh new believer to the seasoned saint. After reading this book, I found myself more candid in my prayer life and open to the movement of His Spirit in my daily walk with Him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"This book definitely lives up to it's name as \\"one of the most interesting autobiographies you will read.\\" The true stories in this book are proof of the power of prayer and faith. This book has the famous \\"Flask Story,\\" which tells about a professor at Allegheny College where Dr. Harvey attended in Meadville, PA. His chemistry professor did not believe in the power of prayer, and challenged any student in the class to pray that when he would drop a flask it would not break. A student did challenge him and prayed aloud in Jesus name the flask wouldn't break, and it didn't!

This is where her soul is at home. She displays both her natural seductiveness and her remarkable vocal control. Her voice has darkened, thickened a bit. Slowly pouring cognac comes to mind repeatedly. The band is a tight unit, but gets as loose-limbed as you like to make it work--and work as a tight unit throughout. For all the talent on display and the clear evidence that they are enjoying it, the material is startlingly weak. Most tracks simply offer an armature for Muldaur and her buds to stew their boogie selves. And what a stew it is. Standouts: tr 1--Second line. Maria preaches/chants the sacred gems of second-line catechism, and I am converted. tr 9--Don't you feel my leg. She teases, \\"You know it don't belong to you,\\" as a loose-limbed New Orleans band rolls, and Dr. John tickles the ivories. tr 12--Southern music.

I was also trying to install the 80 GB HD on the card, and if you have SATA HD (like I do), then you have to do some serious motherboard BIOS tweaking before the PC will even boot up.

Nothing he's done before will ever grace the pages of his later works, and all around, he's probably the only modern author I've enjoyed reading (seeing my attention span problem and all)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, horrible reading","review":"When I saw Ethan Hawke was the reader for this classic, I couldn't wait to check it out. When I brought it home and hit play, I was confused. Ethan reads the ENTIRE book an a near monotone WHISPER! I don't know if he was whispering because it was a stylistic choice, or because he wanted to save his voice, but it ruined the book.

I think the only reason why people read this book is because the famous author. i gave this 2 stars just because those 2 sentences at the beginning of the book i liked were really good. other then that...it sucked.Reading this book was like eating stale tasteless bread.

It was an interesting book but I found it to be highly overrated.After thinking about the book some more I decided that it's an interesting commentary on a war culture. We as a world haven't experienced war and death on the level of the world wars in a long time. After trying to view the book from that point of view I can see it as an interesting view on the nature of death."},{"rating":"2","title":"SL-5","review":"In Slaughter House Five, Kurt Vonnegut writes about Billy Pilgrim's adventure through war, time travel, and life in the end. Vonnegut is able to write well because of experience from writing many other books.Vonnegut's main point is that war is bad because things die from it. He does an excellent job of proving his point, by having an enourmous amount of objects and characters die. He reminds you of how much death there is by adding the short phrase \\"So it goes.\\" after every death.Vonnegut is saying something by having aliens in his story. The aliens teach him to take time in one chunk, instead of dividing it with different events.Slaughter House Five can be compared easily with Catch-22. Catch-22 is also an anti-war book, and shows downsides of war. People die, go crazy, and hate war in both. Both books use a lot of humor.The book was not written in any order. It may confuse some people. Adventurous readers may like this, for a challenge."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very good, entertaining, and easy read","review":"Kurt Vonnegut shows me the reason that this book is considered as one of the greatest pieces of literatture of all time. He sets the main caracter (Billy Pilgrim) as a soldier in World War II. From there he tells the adventures that Billy goes through. Som events are from Billy's real life and opther ar from Billy's imagination. These events mixed wioth Vonnegut's dark humor leave you lauging continuously throughout the book. Yet at times I felt bad for the pain that World War II cause Billy to experience. This is an awesome book and I would recommend it to anyone thatis interested in literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"A banned book list is your best reading friend :)","review":"I checked this book out of a USAF base library 20 years ago specifically because it was a perennial on local school district banned book lists when I was growing up. Otherwise, I wouldn't have given it a second thought. I ended up reading most of the rest of KV's books, which in turn, had a great deal with the shaping of my political point of view. To the school districts of Long Island N.Y who banned this book during the 70's, thanks for showing me the way to the best reading experiences I've ever had. What good is this book? Well, I'm no literary critic, but I will say to younger readers out there, this book was the first I read that married comic and tragic elements in the same instance.

It taught me a lot about the end of the second world war as the story is partiallly placed in Dresden before, during and after its bombing and placed on another planet-according to the protagonist, who can travel through time-where aliens put him in an inhuman zoo with a female of our species. It is original, funny, depressing and uplifting. A work of imagination and much thought, as it is an American classic. I am looking forward to reading more from Vonnedut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book","review":"Vonnegut is able to write about deadly serious topics in a light, enjoyable style without losing substance.

I must say that I really enjoyed it. The style is realy quite refreshing and the plot itself is brilliant. The reason that I only gave it four stars was because of the unnecessary use of graphic sexual description. I understand that some writers may feel that they need to use these sort of descriptions in their writing, but I, for one, believe that a book can be just as good without these references. My reading experience has never been elevated by the inclusion of such content. Still, though, a very good book overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"if you ever thought war was a good idea...","review":"this will change your mind.

I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vonnegut at his cynical best","review":"Over the years I've been fascinated to see how people interpret and misinterpret this famous work, which I first read while studying abroad in 1989.Some people think it is a absurd comedy, others a quirky science fiction novel, others simply don't know what to make of it. But for those of us \\"lucky\\" enough to be keyed into Vonnegut's cynicism, the book is a powerful anti-war statement; nothing more, nothing less.In his amusing, rambling, self-reflexive introduction, Vonnegut seems to concede that the only way to write a great anti-war novel is not to write a great anti-war novel. After all, as he says, \\"...there is nothing intelligent to say about a massacre.\\"Thus I'm inclined to say; this is one of the best anti-war books never written.

The Tralfamadorian ability to see all points of life, which made death a nonissue; Billy Pilgrim's ability to time travel; his abduction and placement in a controlled environment, suggesting our vulnerability to distorted or incomplete information; war commentary from the mouth of a vet- the confused notion of \\"meaning\\" in life when war unwincingly slaughters little girls in pigtails. I also read \\"Timequake\\" and I'm intrigued by Vonnegut's recurrent use of time travel. There is much to be said about experience and memory as related to time, and I enjoy reading Vonnegut's plain, witty, cigarette style. I basically just went along for the ride on this read, but I intend on reading again later to extract a deeper brilliance."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Cat's Cradle","review":"This is my third Vonnegut book. The first I read was Cat's Cradle, which to this day is my second favorite book (after Catch-22). I then tried Breakfast of Champions, which I strongly disliked.

Please read and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent introduction to Vonnegut","review":"This was the first Vonnegut I've read and so far it's my favorite. I am amazed how Vonnegut can contrive wildly imaginative stories and tie them together in a meaningful way. Slaughterhouse-Five is a story about a story of a Billy Pilgrim who becomes unstuck in time and relives different moments of his life. At the surface it seems he is just suffering from delusions from his war experiences. But the narrator makes us believe he has discovered a 'truth' from the Tralfamadorians about the nature of time, that it is not linear like beads on a string but comprised of almost independent moments, and one could jump among them and perhaps see them backwards. Instead of making Billy crazy these ideas make him sympathetic, because they provide a different and beautiful way of looking at human issues of loss and regret.Vonnegut somehow combines an interesting story, drama, and subtle humor that you may not spot the first time around in a very readable novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"-","review":"Vonnegut at the top of his form, which is a fresh style compared to most of the tired writers of this century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vonnegut Virgin","review":"This was a fun indoctrination to Vonnegut's work. Much to think about in this one: the meaning behind \\"So it goes,\\" whether Billy Pilgrim is sane or insane, and how literal was the story in its idea of Billy's time travelling? The movie changes some parts, and leaves some other good points out, but both are worth checking out to complement each other. Great novel about a forgotten event in the history of World War II."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly","review":"Not a fan. I read this a long time ago and forgot how disjointed it is.

I don't think that was understood yet when he wrote it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bizzare yet equally engrossing and enjoyable","review":"Slaughterhouse Five is now one of my favorite books upon finishing it. The book's narrative is very unique as it frequently jumps from one event to another as it chronicles the events of Billy Pilgrim's life before and after his experience in Dresden in WW2. The book is very entertaining and funny yet also sad and thought provoking all at the same time.Some readers may get confused with the non-linear storytelling but the book isn't very long and the events are very detailed and unforgettable.I also admire how Vonnegut described wartime conditions, soldiers did not always have adequate equipment and weapons and being a prisoner of war and forced into labor for you're enemies is not fun and serves as a good anti-war story.i recommend this to anyone especially now when America is at war in the middle east and some people may change their minds about the perceptions of war as it changed mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full Circle","review":"Vonnegut's wit as a writer is hard to match.

The matter-of-fact, low key narration of the life of a common man, Billy Pilgrim, swept up in peresonal and societal upheavals utterly beyond his control is painted as utterly ordinary but wholly unbelievable by Billy's claim of alien abduction in flying saucers, and the simple literary device of punctuating the frequent deaths of people associated with Billy with the phrae, \\"So it goes.\\"With the advent of the current mindless brutality of crusaders and jihadists in that hot bed of stupidity, the Middle East, we can once again sigh, \\"So it goes.\\" Sadly, the immolation of the open city of Dresden without cause may well be repeated in Tehran as well as Fallujah."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very weird story","review":"I didn't like this book at all. First of all, I beleive Vonnegut is a sicko. He writes about things that are so outrageous. The flashbacks did bother me some, and Billy Pilgrim, in my opinion is a loony. I had to read this in my English class and I would not recommend this book to anyone. I despise books about war and the loss of the mind, while people travel in time to the planet of Tralmafadore...very strange novel...I would have given it a one, but I have to admit that it wasn't too boring and was not slow at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slaughterhouse-Five","review":"Classic from one of the masters of Scifi, had heard about years ago and finally got around to reading it, worth the read"},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Vonnegut","review":"I first picked up this book in a [retail store] as a freshman in high school. This book was on my AP English class, and I had a good friend who was a sophomore who read and recommended it to me.So one day a month or so after bying this book I pick it up and start reading it.Vonnegut has a style that reminds me of a seven year old who has been eating sugar cubes, which is a good thing, because it keeps you from being bored.Along with this impressive writing style, Vonnegut adds a thought provoking plot.Well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can one say about Vonnegut?","review":"For some reason Vonnegut has always escaped my \\"Favorite Authors\\" lists.

I am coming out for the first time: Kurt Vonnegut is one of my top five favorite authors.The thing is, Vonnegut is weird. His stories, his novels, his essays... They are all weird. Still, they are hysterically, brilliantly weird, and that is something I can stand by. I dont want to give away specific details of this weird book, because that ruins something, but believe me, it is great.

Vonnegut's originality and humorous approach (deadpan., satirical, et al) to the absurd things humans do proves that there really isn't much new under the sun.Same old world. So we have better toys today than back in the 1960's? Are we any wiser?I recently re-read this splendid novel(eerie given the news today) only about a month or two ago. It still stands. After all these decades,it still stands. Billy Pilgrim is the modern, wounded-male archetype par excellence. We could easily transpose WWII for Iraq. Apt in any age but maybe even more so right now.You don't want to pass this one up, along with this author's more humorous works (BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS). I enjoyed re-reading this so much, I rank it as a favorite in the past year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different","review":"Admittedly I'm not a fan of sci-fi but this book caught my eye in a used book store.

A perfect description for this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Strange but Satisfying Read","review":"This novel reminded me of a bizarre abstract painting. Vonnegut is perhaps the Picasso of literature. Billy Pilgrim's bizarre story is told in pieces, jumbled and out of order, but the novel is still put together ingeniously. Vonnegut brilliantly adds in his touch of science fiction, toying with such matters as time travel and alien abduction, but these are only the backdrop for Billy's real story of sacrifice, tragedy, and the pains of violence and combat. Billy is a tortured hero, pathetic but still likeable. His story is a sad one and you feel as if you must like him or else. The review on the book says it well; it is a book \\"at which you are not permitted to laugh.\\" One of my favorites of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vonnegut at his best","review":"I'll start off by saying that I've read all but 2 of Kurt Vonnegut's works. This was one of the first that I read and to this day it remains my favorite. As a matter of fact, it's probably one of my \\"all time top 3.\\" In \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" Vonnegut somehow manages to tell a story that is simultaneously quasi-sci-fi, psychological, funny, and a deep study of human morals. It's a book that will have you laughing most of the time while you read it, then somber when you think back on it as a whole. It manages to get across the anti-war morals that Vonnegut feels, but NEVER gets preachy or heavy-handed.I don't want to ruin any of plot (and you can see descriptions anyway) so I'm not going to bother to delve into it. I'll just say that this is a once-in-a-generation type of book and it's a quick read too, so you owe it to yourself to give it a shot"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated","review":"At my age (60) I have outgrown this type of stream of conscience anti-war pulp.

Now that I have summers off I thought I would go back and read a classic. And so it goes. Well, I will tell you that I was disappointed. I mean how could it be that I just did not see why others have so cherished about this book. I guess it was that its anti-war theme was so pedestrian that it was rather boring. Truly, boring. Maybe he was the first to do this without the over the top deep thinking, but at this point it was plain boring. It is easy to read and understand, but the aliens and flashbacks, ruined it for me.

It's a unique story of contrast - a light and humorous way of describing a subject so tragic. A different way of looking at war...and life. Kurt's casual style of writing appeals to college students like me. His time-travel, interweaving-plots style of writing makes you want to keep on reading. It's just like a Star Wars movie (by the way, I think this novel would make a pretty good movie, too)!

Billy was simply be a pawn in someone elses game, always. That's pathetic, depressing, and disturbing. I fault the author and his main character with not taking any responsability for anything. NO, we are not just pawns. We do have some control over our lives and our fates are not pre-known (we do not jump around in time so we have no idea what is going to happen to us in the future).

Now I'm wondering what all the hype is about.Slaughterhouse is marketed as an anti-war novel. Honestly, I don't see the point. The book is basically a disjointed narrative that follows Billy Pilgrim, a man unstuck in time.Much like The Time-Traveler's Wife, this book follows the main character as he hops through time. The problem with this book however is that there is nothing to tie the time lines together. There is no stability, just a jump from one time to another, to another, to another, and so it goes.Then the narrative \\"jumps the shark\\" by sending Billy not just through time, but space- to an alien planet in outer space.I can't see where the anti-war theme emerged or made a prominent statement.

The author's delicate sense of satirical humor and suave writing makes the book very readable. It's truly a masterpiece as Vonnegut managed to take a very serious topic--the bombing of Dresden--and make it accessible to the general reading public.As I enjoyed the book immensely, I only have one complaint: it wasn't long enough!

This novel left me feeling the exact same way. The whole time I kept thinking if I just get through this next chapter I am sure I will begin to see the magic. Never happened. The few pages he actually spent on the war were excellent. The dull sci-fi story that takes up the vast majority of the book were not.

Slaughter-house Five is hilariously perceptive.... his unique style is amazingly effective. Makes you intermittently laugh and ponder, revelling all the while in the zany and wondrous realms of Vonnegut's mind.

Meanwhile, I'm scrounging up my allowance to buy more of his masterpieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"a look at a disturbed mind","review":"Slaughter-House 5 has gotten accolades over the years not for being a classically written essay on the trials of war, but instead for being something COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. Laced with sarcasm, irony, parody, metaphor, analogy, and satire, SH-5 explores a mind gone mad due to the horrors witnessed during the tragic bombings at Dresden.Vonnegut manages to craft a classic book that is dark without being overtyly evil, depressing without being heavy-handed, and funny without being comical. Unlike war books such as 'Johnny Got His Gun,' for instance, SH-5 deals with the horror of war almost oddhandedly, making the mental carnage of death all the more surreal.Heartily recomended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compare with Private Ryan","review":"Just a thought on the anti-war theme: compare the totalsenselessness of Billy Pilgrim's presence in Europe (as he stumblesaround comically in his circus clothes) to the theoretically condemning but in fact celebratory aura surrounding Speilberg's little band of virtuous men fighting the Germans. Even though the specific mission seemed meaningless, in Private Ryan the lager war makes perfect sense--we have to hold this bridge so the artillery can't cross, so the Germans can't gain the advantage, etc. In Slaughterhouse Five, the larger war is given no story to justify it, we are simply dropped (like Billy) into the chaos and senselessness of war, and never given a coherent narrative with which to make sense of it. That is why, it seems to me, Slaughtehouse Five is a brilliant anti-war novel, and Private Ryan is more of the same old s***."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I suppose they will all want dignity.\\"","review":"Although I'm just beginning to explore Vonnegut's works, I did thoroughly enjoy this book.

When I was a teen I didn't understand when the forward talked about war being fought by babies. Now I realize that young men and women who fight wars are only babies when it comes to life.

The British POWs that warn of \\"Jerry\\" are hilarious and great sketches of the English.Vonnegut's description of the bleak landscape of war and of normal life is great. But the narrative goes in circles the entire book. There was no progression or path to it. I understood why Pilgrim had the trauma and the absurdity of the events. Still there's no movement and every chapter seems the same. Again, if you've read \\"Jailbird\\" you'll recognize this flaw of his works.I would instead recommend \\"Cat's Cradle\\", \\"Breakfest Of Champions\\" or \\"Mother Night\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple and Simplistic","review":"This is an easy-to-read satire that alludes to the weighty concepts of war, death and fate but never seems to bring home the point. The novel seems to revel in the fact that it even though it is simple it is really about the Big Ideas (\\"Look at me! Look at me!\\"). Just mentioning those ideas over and over again without examining them is not enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slaughterhouse-Five: Or The Children's Crusade, A Duty Dance With Death (25th Anniversary)","review":"Tiemless classic, an excellent read and very difficult to put down once you start. Mr. Vonnegut tells an abstract story based on his own personal experience as a prisoner of war in Germany durring WWII."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read","review":"I liked it, but not as much as Cat's Cradle. Still, if you have not read this, it's worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vonnegut loses his own message","review":"Did anyone else read the copy of this book which had the introduction about Vonnegut meeting with a friend of his from Dresden and that man's wife? He promised the woman that he would not represent the events of Dresden in a John Wayne-style, but instead would represent the horror as it truly was. What Vonnegut has done with this book is even worse than if he had filled it with bravado and glory. His now token use of science fiction makes ridiculous the gruesome truth of war, and places this novel on the level of G.Gordon Liddy's writings in the realm of anti-war. Anybody read JOHNNY GOT HIS GUN?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!!","review":"Great book, the sense of being unstuck in time is just incredible. It has a profound message on what death is really like. Its a MUST read."},{"rating":"1","title":"R. Covington","review":"I have heard of this book for years and thought I'd pick it up for my kindle. It is not what I expected for Science Fiction. Not really my kind of read. It jumps around to much for my liking. Too much back and forth in time. I have read other books that handle this style better IMHO. It may have been ground breaking for its time, but it left me disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading ever","review":"Mind poisoning and looks at life as a free period to do anything and everything in instead of life meaning something. Horrible book, and I regret reading"},{"rating":"1","title":"So It Goes","review":"Though this book has so many reviews, I decided to share my opinion. It appears that a fair number of people love this book, as it was at my school when we read it. However, I'd like to tell anyone who thought it was overly strange and disjointed, I agree! So it goes... some enjoy classics like this, some do not. My english teacher told me I took it too seriously. All I have to say to him is, \\"Po-tee-weet!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious, pretentious novel","review":"To judge by Your SNAP, I'm certainly in the minority. I read this book for a reading group and the best thing I can say is that it was mercifully short. I found the style disjointed and artifical. True, it gave one a desolate feeling about war and its follies, but cerainly other books have done it better, certainly in a more attainable less tedious style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serious, but good fun","review":"This is a serious book about war seemly hidden by Vonnegut. The book jumps around a good bit, as the main character is unstuck in time. Because of this and the lack of character interaction, many people may find the book a hard read. However, the book is well worth the effort. It certainly gave me a new perspective on conventional war."},{"rating":"1","title":"what is so great about this book?","review":"I read this book in an afternoon for a book club. Thank goodness I did not have to waste any more time on it! Other reviewers have mentioned the humor and supposedly wonderful insights offered by this book. I found neither. Yes, Mr. Vonnegut, war is bad. Not a revelation."},{"rating":"1","title":"I believe it is the worst book I have read","review":"It may just be me, Why this book is called is classic is beyond me.

The quality of writing was like reading reader's digest. I just did not get the book. I was forcing myself to finish the book, because when I start a book, I have to finish it. It was not a good writing, funny? not at all....war history? I just did not get the value and hoop la about Vonnegut.....sorry kurt."},{"rating":"1","title":"not writing, slop, perhaps useful as toilet paper","review":"Kurt Vonnegut is not a writer. He is someone who was able, through his contacts with governmental money provided to academics in the 30s, to foist is sloppy, humourous(lacking actual literary ability) cheaply and dishonorably written work upon us. As a student I was forced to read this monster. His books are not writing, they are pure tom foolary. This book, lauded to be the capstone, the beggining for an exploration of his touted literary genious, is actually probably only useful as toilet paper.So it goes... Kurt Vonnegut uses this disgustingly cheap segway to work himself out of every situation. His book wastes pages and pages of precious ink talking about aliens and splicing in images of WWII.Its pure trash. Up their with Michal Moores \\"stupid White men\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time with this one","review":"Why the fuss with this book? It was boring, tedious, and made no point. Vonnegut's works are depressing and life-hating, which stems from his suicidal tendencies."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Get It","review":"O.K., I read it, but I literally have no idea what this book is about. And I'm not reading it again to find out either. Apparently, people like almost anything in life, which is really a sad commentary on the human condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"ick.","review":"I don't like how Vonnegut down-plays death. What's the phrase? \\"and so it goes\\"? I also don't like how the author puts down morals and values. I don't care if Pilgrim has been through war, that doesn't give him an excuse to loose all human pride."},{"rating":"2","title":"I understand why it is a classic","review":"While I wasn't overly fond of the story (it was disjointed, had no plot, character development, or timeline) I really liked this book because of the political and philosophical statment made. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, I guess......","review":"This book was very difficult to understand. I didn't like the book itself, and especially the way Vonnegut belittles values. The only thing I really loved was the way he kept using the phrase \\"so it goes\\" It gave the book a feeling of reality...like saying \\"This is the truth. Deal with it.\\" I think I'll try rereading the book when I'm a little older to see if I like it more then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither an anti-war book, nor a funny book","review":"This book is very easy to read, but not very gripping. I heard its supposed to be an antiwar book and funny it was neither. Its about a weak man with no volition. So, I guess if you are a weak man with no volition, then maybe you would like this book.I cannot fathom why this book is on any curriculum, or is evenly mildly interesting to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A funny, yet thought provoking novel","review":"I found this novel to be a very unique, intereseting novel. The time traveling adventures of Billy Pilgrim and the way the author incorporates himself in the book is outstanding. There are many funny parts to the novel as the author takes a light, peculiar view of life and it's characters. So it goes..."},{"rating":"2","title":"What the hell?","review":"All I can say is that this is one wacked out book. The best line came when Billy Pilgrim was in the zoo and asked for the secret to the universe. When the Tralmafadorians replied that it is destroyed testing fuel, Billy asks if there is anyway to stop it. It was great, but it was twisted. Read with caution. This is a very difficult time period to read from and is very often confusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"cynical and misanthropic","review":"This was the most anti-human book that I've read since Gulliver's Travels. Vonnegut's cynicism and apathy are understandable considering the atrocities that he witnessed during the war, and I imagine writing the book was a cathartic experience for him, but other than that, there's not much to be gained from this novel.Vonnegut's shell-shocked brain appears incapable of distinguishing between the Germans who were injecting dye into women's and children's eyes and rendering them into soap and candles and the Allied soldiers that sacrificed their lives trying to stop them.His main points seem to be:1. War is stupid.2. People are stupid.3. Life is meaningless.4. There's nothing any of us can do about it.5. So, try not to think about the bad things in your life and just think happy thoughts.If this is your life's philosophy, you will also consider this a \\"brilliant\\" work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced, Poorly Made Edition - Stay Away","review":"This is a review of this particular edition from Perfection Learning. It is terribly made, and overpriced. they are basically putting out a permabound edition of the paperbacks here, so in reality you are buying an overpriced paperback. The copyright pages even note the book was a paperback edition. STEER CLEAR OF THIS EDITION of Slaughterhouse 5 and any edition of any book by this manufacturer. Not worth the extra price at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vonnegut's most famous, but not his best","review":"Vonnegut's command of his narrative in this novel is commendable. The story seemlessly moves through time and setting almost too logically for the absurdist universe Vonnegut has created. Not one of Vonnegut's funniest books, but he does justice to the war he never thought he could put in writing. The philosophy of the Tralfamadorian aliens is very powerful and desirable to a tragic hero like Billy Pilgrim, as well as the reader and Vonnegut himself. However, I think even Vonnegut rejects the notion that free will does not exist, or he rather wishes to believe in a world where we are free to escape our misery by our own actions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kurt Vonnegut is a Genius","review":"Slaughterhouse-Five has got to rank as one of the best novels that I've ever had the pleasure of reading. It is sad, it is funny, it is poignant, and it is wonderfully enjoyable to read. It is truly an incredible book. Everyone should be made to read it at least once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!Eye opening book that you won't be able to put down!!","review":"Slaughterhouse Five, by Kurt Vonnegut, does not fall under the category of books I would usually read, but it is different from other books in this genre. It is ironic, captivating, and interesting. Most of all, it is passionate about it's anti-war message and can make even the most pro-war human being sympathize and indulge in deeper thoughts about the individuals and their lives that are affected by war. I definitely recommend this book because of it's light-hearted style used to deliver a serious message in a novel that everyone can find appealing."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Time Favorite","review":"This must be my all time favorite book. (among many)The story is disjointed, but not jarringly so. Vonnegut starts with the story of why the book is subtitled \\"The Children's Crusade\\", and segways seamlessly into a brief lesson of one of WW II's most shocking and little known occurances.You feel like you are there, a fly on the wall, throughout the many stages of Mr. Billy Pilgrim's (the protagonist's) life.Vonnegut writes with an amazing economy of words, and lesser authors would do in 500 pages what Vonnegut accoplishes in little over 100 pages.I could not put the book down, and re-read my copy so often, it is falling apart.God bless you, Mr. Vonnegut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sublime","review":"This book made it onto the Library Boards top 100 English language novels of the 20th century. Guess what? It deserves to be there. Truly an awesome read with a powerful anti - war message without being extremely pendantic."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a classic for a reason","review":"This was one of the most innovative books I read in American literature. It deals with a subject as touchy as the killing of 100,000 people with graceful sarcasm. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird and Wonderful","review":"Hard to describe this one except to say that I loved it.Really a book-within-a-book, Vonnegut's tale gets you turned around with great story telling and (in some instances) wonderful use of absurdity. The writing keeps the pages turing quickly and easily and you finish the journey with your outlook slightly different that it was when you began - in a good way.Give this one a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"SH5","review":"This book is way too confusing and jumps around too much!

All the events were out of order, and the time skipped around a lot, and I was so lost. I didn't understand what was happening, and I still don't know what exactly the \\"slaughterhouse five\\" is. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone...it was a waste of time to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not a Daniele Steele book, so I don't like it","review":"While cultural pundits try to convince you that some literature is better than other literature, the truth is that all art is relative to individial tastes. Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between \\"serious\\" works of literature like this one and allegedly \\"lesser\\" novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are \\"better\\" than any others, and the concept of a \\"great novel\\" is an intellectual hoax.I prefer Daniele Steele, and there's no basis for telling me I'm wrong. Vonnegut is no better or worse than Daniele Steele!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain terrible...","review":"This without a doubt ranks up there with the WORST books I have ever read.

Its a little science fiction, a little war, and a lot of a great book. It is interesting, insightful, and in a strange way, real.

Do you laugh at Vonnegut's trademark humor--here in top form--or do you cry at the emotionless yet moving retelling of the horrors of war, culminating in the firebombing of Dresden in particular? Neither. This can elicit no singular emotional response, unless sheer awe is an emotion. Utterly fascinatingly horribly great"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what the picture is","review":"I got this for a friend because they collect old books, only to find out that the image they provide is not what they sell.

It was irritating to read the story with the flow constantly interrupted by stanzas with tenuous relationships to one another. I imagine an author with ADHD and Alzheimer's would find this to be a comfortable writing style.The antiwar aspect of the book reminded me of later MASH and Archie Bunker television shows: heavy handed and preachy. A few two dimensional characters delivering the same message, over and over.Though it had little in the way of flow (Tralfamadorian style), I did enjoy reading the longer uninterrupted text parcels in the book. I will probably read at least one more Kurt Vonnegut book, but I hope it is better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let this one turn you off from Vonnegut","review":"I don't put books down very often, but I put this one down. There are more readable Vonnegut novels out there for the casual reader (like Bluebeard)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reality and Unreality","review":"If you want to have your mind pulled to the limits of reality and unreality with no explanation allowed then pick up this book. It's hard enough reading a book on a beach which is what I did with this and, of course, Vonnegut made it as difficult as possible for me to get my mind around every little detail he presents.As usual, he is not writing a story. More of a critique and a heavy satire on the world surrounding us. Unlike Cat's Cradle which seems to be a much easier read, Vonnegut really pushes his skills to a level that even he knows he oversteps. It does not make this any less of an exciting, thrilling and captivating book.With his repeated phrase of 'So it goes' and the main character's repetition of events in his mind creates a whirlwind, a cacophony of thought that is all at once quite human and flawed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!

Prof.Sound Vol. 3 is okay, but not as good as Vol. 1 and definately inferior to Vol. 2.\\"Hearhear\\" sounds like he was experimenting with what a drum machine can do.

There is precious little variety in rhythms and almost no melody to speak of. If that crazy beating rave scene is your cup of tea, you might do OK.

Miko Hughes I think did a wonderful job portraying Simon, who is an autistic savant. I think his acting was real and yet not overdramatic. For me, the best part of the movie IS \\"Simon\\". However, the movie itself is watchable as a whole. OK, so it may not be 100% realistic and there may be \\"gaps\\" as someone mentioned. But to me, that's really ok as these inadequacies can be overlooked.

I choose not to comment on the believability or likeability of the plot, but will say instead that the actor who played Simon, the young autistic boy, did an OUTSTANDING job. The writers, apparently, also did some research on the condition. The use of the cards Simon kept pinned to his belt was right on the money. Autistic children comprehend so much better visually, and through the printed word, than they do through listening to people speak. The scene where Simon is spinning wheels on a toy car is also very realistic. My only other comment is on the irony that, in 1998, before anybody figured out or suggested that mercury causes autism (this is a theory first posed in 1999 and gaining more and more credibility every day),the producers had the foresight to name their movie about an autistic boy \\"Mercury Rising.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Mercury Rising","review":"I thought the child playing as Simon did an excellent job.

Good assumption that since Dave is not singinging he would be playing more guitar. Wrong!!! I could stand only one listen, and traded this cd to the used section. I traded in both Megadeth's Cryptic Writings and this terrible cd. I saw Megadeth about five years ago, and they were terrible. They had thin sounding guitars, played mostly post Rust material and had the nerve to play an extremely short set with two encores. The World Needs a Hero may be a step back to their heavy sound, but I am too scared to find out. Megadeth/ Dave Mustains has just released way too much dung.

Ralph W, Estes' powerful work is widely considered one of the most important books written on American corporations and their vast power, and he has nothing kind to say. Compelling and clearly written, his book shines a bright light into some very dark, creepy corners. And although he overstates, over-generalizes and tends to blame corporations for every evil in society, there's no debating that the concept of stakeholder accountability that Estes sets forth has moved to center-stage. Estes' book specifically covers United States-based corporations, but we [...] recommend this book to anyone who is subject to corporate influence, and - from the rainforest hunter-gatherer to you - that's everybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guzziology: As essential as food.

It is set in WW2 and involves a beachcomber and a teacher with 7 charges."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touches all the right buttons.","review":"They don't make stars like Cary Grant anymore, his combination of maturity, good looks, and comedic timing defines triple threat.And subtle, I attribute much of Grant's strength on the screen to his downplay of situation. A movie like Father Goose usually sets up a comedic crisis, onto which more and more outlandish crises are stacked.Through it all, Mr. Grant keeps his powder dry.I personally prefer \\"Operation Petticoat\\" (directed by Blake Edwards) for \`boys will be boys' comedy. But the romanticism of Father Goose (Leslie Caron is great) makes this film play far better to couples.You cannot go wrong with either."},{"rating":"2","title":"River of No Return","review":"This movie is one of Marilyn Monroe's best dramatic roles. It is adventurous and romantic at the same time - what more can you ask for in a movie. Robert Mitcham is the hero and very believable in the role.

The scenery is also beautiful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of Cary Grant","review":"My husband and I enjoy the classics and are fans of Cary Grant. We both agree that this is probably the best movie Cary Grant ever did.

It is a great family film and highly recommended to all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Social Dropouts Viewers Love","review":"It's surprising that no one has mentioned the plot similarities between \\"Father Goose\\" and \\"The African Queen.\\" Both depict cynical men who have become disillusioned and dropped out of society. Both are forced by circumstance to help ultra-civilized, uptight women escape from invading enemies. In each film the hero and the heroine have to make accommodations in order to survive. By the end of the film they're in love. The difference between the two movies is that \\"The African Queen\\" is a drama with comedic elements, and \\"Father Goose\\" is a comedy with dramatic elements. Cary Grant had the talent to play any kind of part, but he learned early in his career that his fans wanted him to play \\"Cary Grant,\\" and he didn't didn't disappoint them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The other side of Cary Grant","review":"One of Cary Grant and Trevor Howard's later films, Father Goose draws on Grant's darker comedic side, casting him as a drunken, societal drop-out forced into supporting the allied war effort in WW-II. The brilliant chicanery that Trevor Howard must use to enlist Grant's support is hilarious. Grant is cast opposite a much younger Leslie Caron, who must deal with young children she is responsible for and Grant's curmudgeonly demeanor. Wildly funny in many places, this could be considered one of Grant's best comedic performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"old time movie","review":"Easy going movie with good old actors you can count on and enjoy.

This is the first book I have read that clarifies the relationship between spirit( inspiration) and will ( feeling) and standing in our true selves as we evolve with source on our journey of self realization. The clarity having to address the release of judgment and at the same time honoring our emotional expressions without suppression and allowing them to come through as part of the unfolding by accepting them as part of us for evolution with out suppressing or censoring them with judgement and allowing them to come forth clearing and healing all of the self denial is key for this journey. Doing this in a form that does not harm us or another is key. Calling upon our Source for assitanace allows this to be a more serene journey.

Simply stated, these are the most profound books I have ever read. So much so, in fact, that I threw away most of my other spiritual books after getting into these. These books are for the serious seeker--they are not for everyone. They are very deep, but they're written in a straightforward manner. In order to get much out of them, you need to be willing to really look at yourself and the beliefs you hold. But if other spiritual and new age books have left you feeling like something's missing, these may be exactly what you're looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Def squad disappointment","review":"this cd is probably the WORST CD i bought in 1998. the only song that's ok on this album is full cooperation. They got too many damn skits, and they put def squad delight, which was already on In tha beginning... there was rap. That song takes up a good 7 minutes and the skits take up around 15, so all you got is 30 mins of wannabe hard-core rap. Most of the beats are wack, and the lyrics don't express anything. The best part of the CD is the bonus CD \\"survival of the illest vol. 3\\" which has demos of some upcoming songs, including a method man promo."},{"rating":"1","title":"el Nino is el whack-o!!","review":"This is the most whack crew i have heard in my life!!

Don't expect the rest of the album to compare to the two great singles already released, Rapper's Delight & Full Cooperation. The CD is only 50 minutes in length, and probably 10-15 minutes of that is skits, talking, etc. Keith Murray gives us his worst rhymes to date and Sermon's production meanders all over the place from good to terrible. It feels like the album was quickly put together to meet the release date. Overall get it for the two singles but stay away if you don't like them"},{"rating":"2","title":"Def Squad rock!","review":"This album is way beyond funky. Whilst the skits are a waste of time, pretty much every track totally rocks! Redman kills it throughout, like on \\"Check'n Me Out\\" where he declares \\"when its time to go out, Im going 'Full Metal Jacket' style, reverse suicide\\". Murray is tight and Erick comes with the beats and a couple of decent bars. This kinda sounds ok at first, but you listen a couple of times and it'll turn you out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent album.","review":"Positives: Some incredible lyrics on this album. Every now and then you hear a rhyme by one of the trio that makes just stop and admire it. There's a least 4 or 5 times on this album that you have something like that. Redman is by far the strongest rapper in the group and he does best to make this a good album. E-Dub will drop a line every now and then that you'll like. \\"Final Countdown\\" is good and the Too $hort part in \\"Ride Wit Us\\" is pretty tight.Negatives: Some of the songs just aren't quite a good showcase of the lyrical talent the group has. The beats are inconsistently good and Keith Murray usually doesn't match up to the rest of the posse. Otherwise a cool album."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is hot !!!","review":"When I first popped in the CD, I was a little shocked on the album time. It's only like 53 minutes, plus skits. But the songs are all worth it. When E-Dub hooks up the hot beat, Red and Keith just rip it. For those who are looking for Erick Sermon beats at his best, check this one out. So it's a little short, a lot of skits, but real hot tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best ever","review":"This is the best CD I ever heard.If you like Eric, Red and Meth then you will love it, they made their best.My favourite is full cooperation but the other songs are tight too. The only whack one is the last Def Squad Delite, it simply doesnt match the album. And also the skits, they take too much time and are boring for the 2nd time. Apart from these El Nino is blazin. If you are a true hip hop fan, buy it. its a must definitely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was sorely disappointed with this DVD.

This dvd has some great aspects to it, but honestly I was hoping for a little behind the music of the band, and there is none. The only other minor disappointment was that they just played, you never get the feel of the music and it's just one song after another (not to mention they don't even put BLACK on there). I am still not upset that I got it, but I probably won't watch it much. You'd most likely want to borrow a friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable!","review":"This DVD is a must for Pearl Jam fans. It completely captures the magic of a live Pearl Jam concert.

They were one of the best live bands in the world, EVER! I haven't seen them in many years live - so I was really looking forward to this DVD. BORING! They don't have a fraction of the energy they used to. They are just stand there and play/sing. Not to mention, not doing their most electric performances live LIVE, BLACK, PORCH. But since it's their only live DVD, it's better than nothing. If they really cared about their fans, they would release something from 5-10 years ago. I would pay $100 to catch that on video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great.","review":"Pearl Jam are a great live band, but this tour is just completely bland.The performances look and sound lazy and uninspired, Eddie Vedders voice sounds totally short from to many cigs, and Mike McCready looks very fat.The only highlight is the more energetic European tour montage, with soundtrack.Perhaps they should of included one of those shows instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a bootleg?","review":"I read all these five star reviews and expected something awesome but recieved what seems to be no better than a bootleg.

From the sincere letter from Ed printed on the inside flap to the amazing bonus scenes, this DVD will be the best concert DVD you will ever buy. The setlist is all encompassing. Everytime you watch it, you will notice something you haven't seen before. Highlights include:-Given To Fly featuring a woman doing sign language-an incredibly moving \\"It's Okay\\" Daughter tag-a montage of \\"blooper\\" type scenes-bonus videos and European tour footage-Stone's continuing reign as Master of the Riff-Some truly classic Vedder, still incredibly and visually passionate after all these years-Mike hamming it up for the camera-Jeff's bouncing bass-Matt CamHonestly, this whole DVD is packed full of some really great performances from the best band in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Significant","review":"This DVD is awesome. I was expecting it to be good, and it just blew me away. The letter from Ed is really cool, and it's great to finally see the incredible video for Oceans.

This might be the best 20 bucks I'll ever spend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relive the experience.","review":"Phenomenal DVD! It stirred the same emotions one feels when seeing them live in concert. Filmed over the course of the American leg of their 2000 tour, the DVD documents what it's like to experience Pearl Jam live. The band, the arena, the crowd - it's all there as documented by three crew members with hand held equipment.I wish it included footage from the European leg of the tour, but there's a great European footage montage as a bonus - somewhere I'm in there.It's a definite buy for Pearl Jam fans, whether they like every album or just a single one - this is a must own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"This is just like being at a Pearl Jam concert! Over 2 hours of music tons of favorites and some rare gems as well, and just like a real show it leaves you asking for more- songs like Black, Small Town, Imortality, Spin the Black Circle, Preasent Tense and Light Years are missing. The songs are full of energy and often have unexpected extras (like sign language and little children) in them. The montages are emotional pieces especially the Band and the Fans. RVM and Go are amazing as are Better/nothing man. Watching this put a smile on my face for the whole 3 1/2 it takes to explore the DVD. A MUST FOR ANY PEARL JAM FAN, A GREAT BUY FOR ANY MUSIC FAN, & THE BEST CHOICE FOR ANYONE ELSE. This is a great DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"must have for true fans","review":"This dvd is pretty cool simply because if your a fan then chances are pretty high that you saw one of these shows and to have video footage of it rules. I'm sure most people that saw them on this tour have the (so called) \\"bootleg\\" cd from that show and this is a great companion for it. You gotta love seeing little bits from various shows. Daughter, from one of the Jones Beach dates, kicks ass when Eddie leads the crowd in \\"It's Ok\\" from Dead Moon. Also the San Diego show will always be one of the biggest highlights of my life. For anyone who went I was the one who got proposed to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rockin In A Free World...","review":"Well, a second DVD has appeared. Amazing. I couldn't believe when \\"Single Video Theory\\" arrived as a Xmas present, that Pearl Jam would ever release 'videos'. Well, I'm glad they did because this one is also a well produced and enteraining bit of Pearl Jammingness. Armed with a three-man/woman film crew, this concert video is chock full of songs (29 to be exact) and is well worth the trip to ... buy. There are also two bonus videos along with the concert footage. No commentary unfortunately, but to quote Mick Jagger, 'You can't always get what you want'.For more, try: [website]See Ya!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK but please release another....","review":"Um... I'd much rather see an older live show when Eddie would actually move a little on stage and had a clear strong voice. This is pretty sloppy and boring. The mix is not great on the music either. I saw them on their first 3 tours and they sounded 1000 times better than this. You could really feel the energy and the tightness. This is just going through the motions, and not that well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Songs, Poor Sound","review":"Pearl jam is an excellent Band, live good expression, good locations, but it is very sad that a band of this quality produces a video concert with a terrible sound quality. It seems that they were playing under the water. If you are really fanatic of Pearl Jam, and you enjoy their CD's in study, particularly I believe that I lost my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inexcusably poor audio","review":"Talk about bootleg recordings: the audio and video on this DVD are less than amateur quality. I can understand using roadies to record the video for something like this, but evidently the roadies recorded and mixed the audio as well. The audio is unlistenable! The 5.1 Dolby Digital sound track is obviously derived from only two mikes (stereo)and is no better than stereo. The music fidelity is not good. The sound track does not even faithfully include all the instruments. Expect from this DVD the sould and video that your buddie might come back after attending a concert with his $300 RCA video camera. It's really no better than that. The DVD medium is wasted on material this inferior. Buy the VHS tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointing","review":"In Pearl Jams first years, they were an energetic band live on stage, and rather impressive to watch too.I thought this DVD would be alot better than it was, but when I think about it this DVD is quite awful.The setlist is the only thing good about it, if only it had been performed better, things might have been alright!Eddie Vedder(The Singer) sounds terrible and the music is performed badly too.One reviewer suggested them rehearsing and I can only agree!Alot of Pearl Jam songs of Yield and No Code are expermimental and kind of ruin what should be a solid setlist, thats not to say that No Code and Yield are bad albums, no way.And Binurals songs are good but sound kind of misrable and boring too, which is a real shame.Don't buy it, if you want a good music DVD get U2 \\"Go Home \\" or the Foo Fighters DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring - Awful Performances - Waste Of Money","review":"When Pearl Jam first started out they used to be an awesome band live!!!If you've seen the video clip to Even Flow, you'll see Eddie Vedder jumping around like a maniac going nuts full of energy, which represents the music, the same goes for the rest of the band.But I think ever since Vitolagy, Pearl Jam have decided they don't wanna rock hard anymore, they would rather stand round on stage playing their instruments and be boring and uninteresting.I bought this DVD and thought it would be good, but it aint.The Music is'nt performed well and Eddie Vedders singing is just blurted out tuneless mumbling and blabber.And Eddie Vedder should shave his beard off and leave it shaved off, beacuse on this DVD he looks like he's 100 years old.The Live at the Garden DVD, is'nt much better in fact its worse than this one, Pearl Jam are not great anymore they are boring, apart from certain songs off their records since Vitolagy."},{"rating":"2","title":"dvd good","review":"dvd good. like there. sometimes forget on couch. eddie vedder sings. stone gossard and mike mcready good. dvd fun to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Overpriced by over two and a half times value.","review":"I received my copy of this book today..its more of a small phamplet 36 pages in length than a book.

Also, the train easily comes off the track, but my son loves playing with the train that way, too. He's very disappointed that the animals are now quiet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Toy for a little Train Lover","review":"My two year old recived this toy for his birthday. He loves it. I like that it can be taken with you. He loves the sounds it makes. I do think that it could be made a little better. The roof on the little station does not stay on but a little glue should fix that. Over all cute toy but I would not think that a kid over the age of 4 would enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR $$$!!! SERIOUSLY!!!","review":"I am a big fan of tike as well and thought that this set would be perfect first train for my daughter who is 22 months and later my baby who is now 5 months... Also before I made the decision of buying this, not only I looked around, but also read the reviews and bought it based on the ratings of this product.Tikes has the reputation of making toys targeted to toddlers, but this thing is boring, DOES come off the rails when making the turn, we have to keep putting it back; you try to put the driver and the train just goes off; and to make it worst it stops after one round, so that when the kids are getting the hang of it and are ready to watch, it has to be started again... The only good thing is that it is portable by just folding it, and that is what I am doing: I am folding it and taking this thing back to where it came from..."},{"rating":"1","title":"train falls off the tracks","review":"We bought my son this as his first train toy when he was 14 months old. It held his interest a bit, but, I found it frustrating that it fell off the track a lot (even just out of the box). We've gotten other trains since, as we've discovered he has a great love of trains. GeoTrax from Fisher Price is a good one. As I buy more toys over the years, I've also discovered that sometimes Little Tykes subsidiaries do not live up to their name (I have a Little Tykes Piano that broke in 1 month and even the replacement they sent is not great)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous toy","review":"The train on this toy is cute and my son like the noises and animals. The track is another story. It looks very cheap but worst of all, there is no mechanism to keep it unfolded. When my son would pick up the track it would fold and his fingers often got caught in the folds. I actually pinched my fingers in it a couple times myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable- very fun!","review":"We bought this train for our son who is 16 months old. He loves the moving parts, noises, buttons, etc. The animals are just right for him to hold and play with. He can work everthing all by himself. The train goes really well off of the track, even on carpet. I have been very impressed with how durable it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute idea, terrible train set","review":"This thing is junk. It looks cute and our son was very excited when he received it for Christmas, but we quickly learned we had wasted our money. The battery compartment has never fit very well, even after screwing it down as tight as we could. So it constantly shorts out and has just gotten worse over time. When my son actually does get it on the track right (which is NOT as easy as it should be for a toddler toy!)the stupid thing just derails at a turn. The figures don't stay on well, the stickers are already peeling off and the orange roof pops off the little building at the slightest touch. It doesn't even fold up easy and is hard to lay back out after it has been folded. Overall it is very disappointing, especially for a little tikes toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something else!","review":"I saw this toy and thought, \\"This is cute!\\", It comes with three little figures and plays sounds.WRONG!!! Wish I saved my money or bought something else! The track is very flimsy and sees like it would snap in half if it was handled wrong, \\"major flaw of a kids toy\\". Second the train gets \\"stuck\\" on turns and falls off the track. It is also hard for a child to get the train back on the track. It will ride with out the track (only plus). A very frustrating toy for kids and adults. Buy something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down by Little Tikes","review":"I purchased this train set for my 1 1/2 year old nephew but I let my 4 1/2 year old daughter \\"test\\" it first and boy am I glad I did. The only positive this toy has is the fold and go feature and I'm not even sure how long that would hold up. As soon as we took it out of the box and unfolded the tracks the plastic had severe markings on the plastic from the stress of being folded and unfolded. When we put the train on the tracks and turned it on the train kept coming off the tracks and my 4 1/2 year old had trouble getting it back on track. There is no way a 1 1/2 year old could do it. Very frustrating and not a play alone toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, but very poor quality","review":"I bought this for my 2 year old with a gift card she recieved. Shortly after buying, the sounds from the animals stopped working. Since I'm a hands on kinda guy, I decided to take a quick peak inside to see if I could fix it. There are very small/thin wires connecting the animal car to the train engine. They were completely severed. There was no way to fix it, so into the garbage it went. My daughter was sad to see it go, but no sense holding onto junk.Don't waste your money and save the landfill - Don't buy this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Tikes Fold Up & Go Train Set","review":"Grandson loved this, and his parents loved the fact that it could fold up so easily and be put away"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like this toy!!","review":"I bought this toy for my 23 month old son who loves cars and trains right now. The track itself is flimsy and we had a hard time getting it to stay open. My son was frustrated that he could not take apart the two parts of the train.

Their vocal harmonies emulated American Folk groups such as Peter, Paul & Mary, Brothers Four, and Kingston Trio, and their guitar playings utilized primarily Merle Travis' finger-picking style. In such songs like The Times They Are A-Changing, Mr Tambourine Man, Girl from the North Country, It Ain't Me Babe, the male lead did a poor clone study of Bob Dylan. I would have given this CD three stars if the sound engineer did a better job in remastering the sound. For Americans who are interested in original-sounding British Folk music from the same era, I strongly recommend groups like the Pentangles, Fairport Convention, Magna Carta, Amazing Blondel, and Gryphon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahead of its time, nice work","review":"In an attempt to capture their vision of the future of the genre, this Deutsch duo embarked on a very trancey trip that honors the name of the genre for its ability to almost hipnotize you with their pulsed beats and loops. Without becoming repetitive they sit somewhere comfortably between a downbeat trance and and upbeat ambient. Listening to it six years after it first came out, it doesn't sound dated, which says a lot, considering how easily some works in the electronica domain fall out of synch with the times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated","review":"This copy of this book was written in 1988.

I thought the book had very pertinent information for a parent entering unchartered territory with a pre-teen child.

It would have saved us both lots of grief! Although some things change (like style of clothing) or are new (like computers), the basic aspects of child development don't change. Reading this book gave me an idea of what my girls are experiencing at this point in their lives. Now I have an idea of what is normal and what is not and I can relax!

I have work through many Sudoku books, and was looking for books containing only difficult puzzles - like many veteran Sudoku fans. I was happy when I received the nicely printed one with 200 'difficult' puzzles. I immediately started with the last puzzle to see how difficult they were, and to my dismay I solved it in minutes. The same went the other last few puzzles. I was able to finish them with a few written notes.Now I have retitled this book '200 Easy Sudoku Puzzles' give away to beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Difficult","review":"These puzzles may be difficult if you are just starting sudoku, but if you have any experience, these are all pretty easy. They are definitely NOT difficult puzzles. I am solving them on an average of 5 minutes each, with no hesitation as I put in every number. Second edition, with orange cover, has same easy puzzles. This book is not a challenge for any experienced sudoku fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bernstein's best","review":"This is Mahler and Bernstein at their finest. Worth every penny. In fact, I would have paid much more. The performances (while not all flawless) are energetic, emotional, beautiful and intense, with not a detail of the scores missed and not a note played without importance. The soloists and choirs are superb, and the video work in the various venues is excellent. DG has also done a great job in cleaning up the original tapes for far superior sound and video to some earlier releases.Also, the documentary/rehearsal disc provides unique insight not only into the methods of Bernstein, and the music of Mahler (both in the actual rehearsals, and Bernstein's analyses and commentary), but interestingly into the arrogance of the Vienna Philharmonic. It's very interesting watching them resist Bernstein's emotionalism in rehearsal, but really letting go over time in performance.Well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out!","review":"My comments have nothing to do with music, only production. I have received, and returned, two sets of these for an inexcusable manufacturing defect. In both sets, the disk that said it contains symphonies 4 & 5 actually contains 1 & 2. The label was misprinted. How many more sets are out there like this? How many returns will it take to get a correct one from Amazon? Shame on DG!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Leonard Bernstein conducts Mahler","review":"It was such a pleasure to view these and to have included rehearsals. I only wish that the other song cycles were included in the set. America and the world owe a debt to Bernstein for helping audiences appreciate Mahler's music. In terms of performace, I have a partiality to the Chicago Symphony recordings done by Solti, Guilini and Levine in the 1970's. As insightful as Bernstein's interpretations were (he had a difficult time with the Vienna Philharmonic getting to play them right), the CSO, I believe has better instruments in percussion and brass. The Chicago sound has always been colorful, sparkly and opulent--perfect for Mahler--while being just as tonally and rhythmically precise as the best European orchestras."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mahler's symphonies and das Lied von der Erde on a set of DVD'd, performed by various orchestras conducted by Leonard Bernstein.","review":"Bernstein's performances are superb, he was one of the top interpreters of Mahler's music.

Happy travels..............."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Life Examples and Reference Guide","review":"This little book, a brief 171 pages, lives up to its title \\"How to Solve Our Human Problems\\", and is a good guide for anyone wishing to see how real life situations pertain to the spiritual path, specifically the Buddhist way of The Four Noble Truths. As with all of Geshe Kelsang Gyatso's writings, the text is clear and consise and easy to digest and then put into practice. The examples given in the book are practical and help provide a better understanding of how to handle common situations, especially problems of anger and suffering, and then learning how not to retaliate (even though we may have an initial knee-jerk tendency to do so). Recommended both as an introductory guide and a reference tool to refer back to over and over to enhance learning and practice of patience when encountering anger and suffering. All in all, a very good, practical toolkit for life experiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical Esoteric Advice","review":"This latest book from Geshe Kelsang Gyatso gives practical advice on using Dharma to solve our daily problems. Just reading a few pages gives one much to think about. It contains the essence of many of Buddha's most profound teachings, but in a clear, simple format. For complete details about each of the concepts woven together here, you would want to read Geshe Kelsang's other books such as Joyful Path of Good Fortune. If you are a beginner, its a great \\"first taste\\" that will whet your appetite for Dharma. If you are an experienced student, I think you will be delighted by the way the teachings are freshly elucidated. I really enjoy this book, and return to it often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking","review":"This little book imparts a whole lot of wisdom. I began reading this feeling completely overwhelmed by issues in my life. As I continued to read it, I actually felt myself really relaxing and my spirits lifting. I just felt better and like weights were being lifted off my shoulders. I don't practice Buddhism and so there were a few parts I read and thought \\"Whoa! That is really out there.\\" But I love to read thought provoking pieces that challenge me to look at things in a different way. This book does that and is a great read with a lot of wisdom for leading a peaceful life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ears are surprised","review":"A friend loaned me a music CD by this artist. I thought he lusted for her body. Maybe he does, and I don't blame him. But her voice, although not sophisticated, is simple, direct, and sexy. She can sing.

There's something magical about a beautiful woman with a decent voice singing in the French language."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good text or study of Cultural Anthroplogy","review":"I am sure you could get a more updated book, but I bought it at a low price to study for my won personal curiosity. It was very informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird noise reduction","review":"These are wonderful recordings. The noise reduction, though, sounds like the 1980s CEDAR system that has the effect of putting the sound through a flanger --- there is a shifting equalization contour that gets automatically set off by something in the recording. It is extremely unaesthetic tonally. No credit is given anywhere on the album of the restoration engineers or methods. I will see if I can find these recordings on Pearl or other reliable label."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera","review":"I received my 20D last week and have been finding excuses to take out the camera to take great pictures. Start up on the camera is indeed almost instantaneous - as quickly as you can get the viewfinder to your eye, it's ready for you. Being able to use my existing EF lenses was the primary consideration for me and because it costed $5K less than its big brother. One minor quibble that I have with this camera is its lack of spot metering. In some circumstances this would come in very handy but 99% of the time, center weighted would be fine.I would strongly recommend the extension grip for this camera. Partly because it has the dedicated portrait shutter button and the shutter speed dial but more importantly it extends the grip in landscape mode just a tad bit more. The added height and other features that the extension grip adds more than justifies for the added weight. The grip can also accomodate a second battery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"Excellent Camera!!!Pros:shutter lag is about the same as a film SLR5 frames per second!!!The Sigma lens for my Canon EOS film camera work well with the digital.Battery life is good (even with that I strongly recommend at least one back up battery)Picture quality is amazingCons:If you are not used to the size of SLR cameras this may seem rather big; however with a good neoprene neck strap the weight is not as noticeableSet at maximum resolution it fills up memory cards quickly - Hitachi makes a good 2 and 4 gig micro drive that is fairly inexpensive compared to other compact flash memoryI have had this camera for about 4 months now and am very happy with it.

I've also use an Olympus C5050. I've been wanting to upgrade to a Digital SLR and believed the great reviews. I've been terribly disappointed with the pictures... all seem far to dark and dull. Doesn't seem to mater which lens or what type of lighting. I'm checking with Canon to see if maybe there is a problem with the camera... if not, I would say this is an awful investment. If you have time to work in the advanced modes, maybe you can find a setting that takes clear, crisp picture; but if you are using in any of the basic modes, you have no control over the results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice As Long as it Does Not Break","review":"We purchased the Canon 20D and it broke after only 4 months. The pictures were great. The camera just stopped working one day for no apparent reason (no power). We sent it to Canon and they want $800 to repair it. We actually bought another Canon as a backup and it broke also (the lense mechanism jammed). So not only are both Canon's broken for different reasons, Canon is very uncooperative about fixing them. Canon's warranty is not very good.End result: We are missing pictures of our just born baby girl, and Canon is requesting $800. So we're doubly penalized, despite having a backup plan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic camera in all ways","review":"Fast, accurate, and produces amazing results. I take lots of indoor shots in low light, even indoor sports shots (I use two fast Canon zoom lenses) and they come out unimaginably beautiful with the 20D's amazingly clean ISO 1600 performance. The camera reposnds instantly, and focuses so fast I almost never perceive any lag at all. The camera is built like a tank with a very solid feel, and the 5 fps shutter has earned me an unbelieveble collection of sports action shots I could not have gained otherwise.Cons? I wish the current ISO setting was displayed in the viewfinder, and the shutter is a little louder than my old Minolta 7000i (film SLR). However, this camera feels like an extension of my hand when I am holding it, and I have no plans to replace it for several years."},{"rating":"2","title":"wish i knew i needed","review":"This is great.

Terrrible support."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the price","review":"This camera is a dream come true.

It is well worth the clams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what I need and then some...","review":"This is my first DSLR, and it's doing everything I need and then some. Solid build, great grip.

So I would wait if I were you for this camera's succesor, and there's a good chance it's due out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolutely wonderful camera","review":"This camera is really great. I knew I liked it before, but I immediately began to appreciate this camera all the more when I ended up with a Rebel XT as a \\"loaner\\" while my 20d was in repair.Not that the XT is a bad camera, it just doesn't really compare to the 20d.The 20d has a nice feel to it; it is fairly large, which is great since I have somewhat large hands. The features are great too. And the image quality is awesome. I don't really need to go into all of the details, as most of the other reviewers have done an excellent job. Let me just say that it is a great camera and is worth the five stars.The only complaint I have about the camera is that it doesn't have spot metering. The ability to do your light metering off of a single point of interest would be great - and they did add it to the 30d."},{"rating":"2","title":"The limited infinity","review":"With a whole galaxy to choose from, 5 stars seems too limited!

With him I have to agree and one has to be puzzled why people would read such drivel as this. The characters, the plot, the story, the background, the atmosphere, the landscape, the tone etc. is just awful, with little or no redeeming social or artistic value. Doug said as much in the interview, but indicated that he hated the idea of writing more of this stuff, but he needed the money.

I found the book extremely boring. Maybe I've been spoiled by the recent fantasy/sf I've been reading, but I found the plot very slow moving, and generally uninteresting and uninvolving. I also disliked the extreme amount of humor and satire in this book. I prefer my novels to be more realistic. I like adult situations (complex relationships, betrayal, violence, etc), and I couldn't find any here. It felt as if I was watching one LONG episode of Futurama.There were good things, however. The book was extremely short. I got through it in one sitting (about three hours), and I don't think I've ever done that before. Also, I found the book slightly humorous in parts, which served to barely keep my interest for that 3-hour reading stretch."},{"rating":"1","title":"No point to the storyline, and wouldn't reccomemnd it.","review":"I think that this book was one of the oddest I have ever read. I really found no joy in reading it and didn1t see the point of the story line. If I had known that this book was so absurd I wouldn1t have read it. While reading it I had to struggle to comprehend the characters1 bizarre surroundings and conflicts. If I had to give this book a rating I1d give it one out of five stars.

If there's one set of comic-themed scifi books that you ever get a chance to read, it should be this series. The one and only reason why I have rated this Kindle edition of the book so poorly is because they have disabled Text to Speech.I can understand audiobook companies weariness of highly intelligent, well designed text to speech software, but it doesn't excuse their actions. By disabling this software, (audio)book companies are only hurting their fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"42 forever!","review":"This is the very first Kindle book I downloaded, because it only seemed fitting. The Kindle is the ultimate incarnation of the Hitchhiker's Guide. The story is very tongue-in-cheek British humor which has developed a cult following since it came out in the mid-1980's. It is too difficult to try and explain here, but to give you an idea of the humor, this is the first book in a trilogy of five (yes, 5!) books. The only explanation I can give is either you get it or you don't.The Kindle version is easy to read: no gaps in the text, no obvious spelling mistakes and no pictures that appear only in greyscale. My only wish is that someone would contact Douglas Adam's estate and get a skin or cover to make Kindle look like the HHGG (large, friendly letters on the cover spelling out, \\"Don't Panic!\\") That would be perfect (or Prefect, depending oh how your Babel fish translates it). Now, where did I leave my towel?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Start here, and don't stop...","review":"One of the finest books ever written! It's funny, and edgy, and thoroughly enjoyable. I recommend it to everyone, though some people do not seem to enjoy the slightly dryer English humour. This is a re-read for me, as it does start off my very favorite five-book trilogy. And contains my all-time favorite quote: \\"Ford, you're turning into a penguin - stop it!\\" Basically, the book begins with the destruction of the planet Earth and ends at The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, with a lot of great adventure (and insight) in between. You really should read it, you'll be glad you did. And if you don't like it, well, you're just a mutant..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rare book","review":"This is one of those rare books that actually made me laugh aloud. If you want to have fun reading a book, this is the book to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zacs Review of hitchhikers guide","review":"When books are made into movies that means, the book is first-rate. The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is no exception. The Hitchhikers Guide starts as Arthur Dent is saved from the destruction of earth by his alien friend posing as an out of work actor. The book really takes off when they are picked up by the president of the galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox. The main idea of the story is to find the ultimate answer to the ultimate question. The book does not really have a solid theme that can be identified, it is mostly random facts from the guide that ties into the story, and sometimes not at all. For science fiction fans/Monty Python fans this book is a must read, it is witty and interesting. The only downside of the book is that it is too short but luckily Douglas Adams wrote a series of Hitchhiker books."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Monthy Python of Outer Space Adventures","review":"In this introduction to Douglas Adam's unique wit and satire, Arthur Dent, the protagonist, sets off on a rampaging Alice in Wonderland like journey through outer space. Through it all he encounters very strange and farcical creatures and events that reveal the jukebox of the universe, the ebb and flow satire that is life in all its monumental and diminutive creations. A great adventure to the nether regions of outer space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Hitchhiker's Thumbs Up","review":"This novel is about a human, Arthur Dent, on a quest through space to find the answer to life, the universe, and everything after he narrowly escaped the destruction of earth. Adams' takes the point of view of an alien so he makes everything humans do seem ridiculous. It apeals to science fiction readers along with those interested in philosophy. Don't pick up hitchhikers, but definitely pick this book up at your local bookstore....or on amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading with Tequila","review":"This book was a very easy, very fast read. Much more entertaining than the 2005 movie. It was very sci-fi and very different from anything I have ever read. Aliens aren't something I generally enjoy in my entertainment but I really enjoyed the humorous approach and casualness of the book. I was so blown away even though there were aliens and it mostly took place in outer space."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BUY, THE BEST BOOK OF MY purchase","review":"I buy 4 books with this one, This one was by far the best of all. Great book, Great design, Great size of the letter font, great hard cover. Everything was perfect about this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant. Highly Recommended.","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxyis an absolutely hilarious science fiction spoof in which the Earth is a giant computer built by sentient mice in order to figure out the meaning of the universe, only to be destroyed seconds before it fulfills it's purpose; Vogons epitomise the very essence of Public Service mentality; and intergalactic hitch-hikers travel the universe with the help of the best-selling 'Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy'. This book is easy to read, often odd and , above all, funny. I highly recommend this and I will be on the lookout for the rest of the books in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"coolest book on earth!!!!!!!","review":"something is seriousley wrong in adams head.and i love every part of it!!!!!!!!! best book ever!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very funny book!","review":"This is the best humor/sci-fi book I have ever read.

Banks, and saw the 5-volume-and-a-novelle (\\"The young Zaphod\\") book, and I thought \\"Hmm, this is rumoured to be a worth-while book\\". I bought it, and it was one of the best books I have ever invested money in. I think, that this book is only for people who have a very (un?)healthy sense of humour... the logic in this book is less than non-existant, and it is even wackier than the Pythons most zany trips. This will be all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Douglas Adams is one Hoopy Frood","review":"Poor, poor Arthur Dent. One day, the man is leading a so-called \\"normal\\" life, working, drinking, and just generally minding his own business. Then one moment later, everything he has known to be true no longer is so. He discovers that his best friend, Ford Prefect, is even stranger than he previously thought. The hitchhiking alien is about to take Arthur on the most amazing, not to mention life-saving, journey of his life through space and time. All this trouble is because some Vogons had been assigned to demolish planet Earth, which coincidentally, was also simply minding its own business.Genius Douglas Adams tells of Arthur's travels with a \\"cast\\" of hilariously absurd characters, like Marvin, the paranoid android, and Zaphod Beeblebrox, the president/most-wanted fugitive of the galaxy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic book for many generations to come","review":"This is a true classic of science fiction it will remain one of the best for generations to come. Besides the strange plot about a man who is taken from the earth seconds before it is destroyed to built a intergalatic highway. By his friend from another planet in another universe (betleguse) and then searching for a planet that makes other planets (one of them being earth) and then going to the cafe at the end of the universe. It really is the end as in the big collapse. There are also great charectors.

Is. The. Best. Book. Ever. Written. It's totally original, but mostly funny. Yeah, the humor is definitely there, with tons of cultural refrences. You do have to be smart enough to understand the jokes, though (like the Ford Prefect joke, which most Americans don't get). Well anyway, there's my rant. Hope it inspired you to read this, or at least think about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read My Review","review":"Well actually,i read the first 3 books in the serias about 2 years ago and i really don't remember that much,but i remember the names and the events,and i must say i laughed alot from this one and the other two after him,the serias is a funny Sci-Fi,the people who will enjoy it very much is a people with alot of humor,and Sci-Fi fans that don't really like all the drama Sci-Fi with all the understandable science facts,that is what this book is all about.it has a funny plot,characters and events all over it. the reason i only gave it 4 stars is because it's too damn short! i'm used to read books with 300-600 pages! what i'm gonne do now is buy the whole serias (i already got the second one and the third),and read it in a raw like a one book,maybe u should try it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"improbably great","review":"By the strangest coincidence I left this classic at the office and was stuck at home reading Hemingway short stories. Hemingway writes about drink, and war, and illness. Adams, on the other hand, writes about drink, and war, and illness. One thing's for sure: Hitchhiker's Guide is not science fiction. It is also not science. Probably not fiction either. What it is is really weird, like the front page of the daily newspaper, only more enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it's just me ...","review":"...but I thought this book was terrible. I've been more entertained reading the ads on a New York subway."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word...OVERRATED!!","review":"This book is marginally funny, at best. At its worst, it's just plain boring. I bought this book because I heard it was on the same level as Monty Python, nothing could be further from the truth, Monty Python has jokes, funny ones, this book relies on lame puns. Most of the time the book is just plain weird, some of it doesn't make a lick of sense, a hippie with three arms is president, people can understand any language in the universe by holding a fish to their ear, the meaning of life is 42, what the hell is that all about? Is this supposed to be funny? Seems there are only two schools of thought on this book, people who think it should outsell the Bible and people who use it for kindling. I use my copy to help cure my insomnia."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow just wow","review":"when i first heard about this book i thought \\"another useless published piece of dirt with no humor but when i read it i was impressed cheers to who ever the author is bang."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Rubbish for Fools","review":"The book begins with the hero sitting down in front of his house in order to stop it being demolished to make room for a highway. He's lucky he wasn't Rachel Corrie, an American who was killed by an Israeli driving a bulldozer. Her death didn't receive one per cent of the publicity accorded this book, which descends into a cycle of abstruse stupidity. If you want a laugh that will make you wiser, read Mark Twain or Joseph Heller. If you want a good story, read Chehov or Tolstoy. They won't make a fool of you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book made no sense at all.","review":"Total garbage. It didn't make any sense at all. If you like books where people put fish in their ears to translate languages then by all means read this book. If you prefer books without silly crap like this go elsewhere. Read the other reviews. Everyone says how wonderful the book is but no one says what the book is about. That's because no one knows. If you want to read quality science fiction books read early Heinlein."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter nonsense","review":"First of all, let me say that much of the so-called \\"story\\" in this supposed \\"book\\" is nothing but lies and weirdness. Some of it even defies all belief! If you like books about crazy aliens who act like they are out of their gord, well maybe this book is up your alley. I'm worried that if you let your children read this, it will make them think the world really works like this, and that you can talk to mice like they are people (no kidding -- it says that). Good luck teaching kids right from wrong after they've had their brains scrambled by this rubbish. At times I could not tell if Mr. Adams was trying to be funny or if he really thinks this way. I suspect maybe he needs professional help or something. I shudder at the thought of encouraging people to publish this sort of insane rambling as if it were a travel guide to outer space. I certainly didn't get any good, practical travel advice from this book. Stick with Fodor's and save yourself the bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"When a good idea goes bad...","review":"This is one that I will likely take grief for, but I can't help it - I did not like it at all. I love the concept ofThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Deluxe 25th Anniversary Edition- quirky end-of-the-world-ness, random characters, coolly bizarre sci-fi bent. But the writing bored me, the characters were either whiny or self-indulgent or caricatures, and the \\"plot\\" felt flimsy.

The jokes in this book are well executed, and some are the punchline to the whole book. It's pretty short, so if you're a regular reader, you'll finish it in probably less than a week at most, but it's definitely worth its hardcover.

I can tell you lines from the book off the top of my head becuase I've read it so many times that now I'm starting to think a friend of mine is an ET from some far off planet! With Earth being blasted into a file folder under a stack of other file folders (or being blown-up) at the Guide offices to the creatoin of a Sperm Whale that crashes into a planet with a bowl of Patunias which developes into an interesting thing for Aurthor in later books, I loved this book. I have even built a Web Site for The Guide that holds alot of informatoin and exerpts from the it. Five Stars from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forty Two.","review":"It takes a very disturbed mind to concoct such ideas as the babel fish and put them all together into one of the most hilariously nonsensical books ever written. Adams grabs your attention in all his books, and you'd be so engrossed, you wouldn't know it if Thor smashed your cranium in with his hammer. If you didn't find his books funny, you probably have a very wet towel over your head. Get rid of it. A great read... and a great laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hate to echo what others have said....","review":"But this book is insanely entertaining and amusing, provided you aren't looking for anything serious.

The same thing happned to me when I read this book. At first, when I picked it up, I wasn't sure that I would like it. As the book progressed farther and farther on, the better it got. And although I am not usually a fan of science fiction, I could barely put Down The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. This book was funny, clever, and had some really memorable characters such as Trillian, Zaphod Beeblebrox, and Ford Prefect. I personally liked when they met Benjy and Frankie Mouse and how mice were said to be the smartest creatures on earth. I also thought it was a great idea of the author to use passages from the supposed original copy of this book. A must read.

The reason escapes me. Ripe with throwaway absurdism and weak irony, this book made me wince more often than it made me laugh.

Douglas Adams is an amazing writer. It's funny and intelligent at the same time. I've never laughed out loud while reading before this book. I recomend this book to anyone that enjoys a good laugh. It gets confusing at times with the whole concept of space travel, but stick with it and it's worth it. It really makes you think and there are few books that can be funny at the same time. And if you like this one, you'll love the other sequels even more. The books get funnier as you go too. Everything about this book is great. Especially the manic depressive robot, Marvin.

The whole series is downright brilliant. Douglas Adams, tragically passed away earlier this year, was a fantastic writer, who could make you laugh, cry, wonder, etc. in just a few pages. The book is a combination of Science, Science Fiction, Humor, Romance and a bit of suspense. It tells the story about a guy, whose house will be destroyed, and at the same time, the Vogons are just above the earth, in order to destroy the earth. Both places must be destroyed, in order to make room for a highway.The choise of words, the similarities, everything gives you a feeling of recognition and believe in all the strange things that happens in the book.Specially for everyone in ICT, like myself: the whole series in mandatory literature !"},{"rating":"2","title":"What the photon is this book about?","review":"Arthur Dent, a thirty years old man you'll find easy to identify with, gets bugged this Thursday morning by the council's willing to knock his house down to build a bypass. This is how the book starts. When it is about to end a mere hundred pages later, you find yourself having hitchhiked all around the fancy places of the galaxy, and discovered at just about the other end of it that you don't in fact belong to the most intelligent species on earth but ranks only third and that earth itself isn't just this charming little blue planet it wants to appear to be. It'll take seven and a half million years, but yeah, you'll eventually learn the meaning of life too, though you won't like it. This, of course, doesn't account for all the fun of the travel, say, in the improbability drive or at the place where they make planets.A fantastic journey in humour and the unforeseen.

As a strictly comic book, this might be OK, but don't read it expecting true sci-fi. Your time would be much better spent with Orson Scott Card or Timothy Zahn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really, did I just read this book again?","review":"Finally read it again after 10 years to see if my impressions had at all changed.

Here is his true wit, his British humor, his, well, hoopiness! The book picks you up, drives you to the movies, and never lets you go! Ford is hilarious with his insane logic. Trillian is a wonderful as the only really sane one on board the Heart of Gold. Marvin is so pathetic that he makes you cry every time you read the book. And through it all, the hapless Arthur Dent just tries to understand what is happening. The plot involves the earth being blow up to make a hyperspace bypass, which everyone should have known about if they had checked the record hall in Alpha Centauri. The plans had been on display for fifty years. Can't complain about it now, can you? Anyway, throw in an ancient race of planet builders, some towels, a stolen space ship, and a restaurant at the end of the universe, and you get the first novel in one of the best sci-fi series ever.

The book takes you all the way from the last seconds of earth to the end of the universe, and all in a strange and humors way. The book uses backwards logic and at some points makes so little sense that it makes perfect sense. I loved the variety of characters, the detail, and the abstract thoughts. The book takes and explains the secrets of the universe and even better how to travel it. In this book you will find the answer to the meaning of life, how to get a lift from a space ship, and why no hitchhiker should ever be without a towel.I recommend this book to anyone who thinks of the abstract or abnormal, or for that matter anyone who has an inkling of creativity in their minds. Recommended to ages 15 and up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Panic","review":"Having listened to my brother rave about this book for years, I finally decided to pick it up and read it.

Don't panic, and whatever you do Read this book.Trying to describe the plot is pointless, for one it makes no sense, and it's not why you read a Adam's novel. I won't give away any jokes, or the such, but if you like Monty Python, or better yet have the smallest hint of a since off humor, read this series. Expect to get a few confusion induced head aches.For those off you who have played the monkey island games, think of Adam's as the Tim Schafer of Books.Remember 42.Oh and Douglas, So long, and thanks for all the fish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful","review":"This edition (with the Movie poster on its cover) of The Hitchhiker's Guide is a novelization from the MOVIE SCRIPT!!! It is NOT the FULL Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy. To get the real effect you need to read the true, full edition of the book. Get \\"The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide,\\" which includes the entire series in one place for less than twice the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is missing something","review":"The Book itself is great, theres no complains about it. But this is an advice for kindle users. I recomend you to buy The ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, that one cost 5 bucks more and has the whole Hitchiker's guide books. This edition is the one that was used to make the movie, but the other book has all serie's books.The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide to the GalaxyHope i've helped you. Pura Vida!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Presented with one VERY serious scientific flaw...","review":"Mr. Adams ignored the most serious concern of spacewalk, despite its over-40-years history. Remember Arthur and Ford being thrown out of the Vogon ship and worring about asphyxiation? They shouldn't have, since their inner body pressure would BLOW THEM UP INTO VERY SMALL PIECES in the first nanosec. This is why our astronauts even bother to wear SPACESUITS in stead of just oxygen masks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! My favorite, all-time book.","review":"This book mixes sci-fi and comedy so well, I couldn't put it down! I think it (along with the others in this series) is so well done, it is the best of the best. I don't think I'll ever find a book that was so enjoyable to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The funniest novel ever","review":"I'll make this short and to the point. \\"Hitchhiker's Guide\\" and \\"Restaurant at the End of the Universe\\" are the funniest novels ever written. The two together would make one incredible book. It seems like the story really ends at the end of \\"Restaurant\\" and after that the series starts getting a bit worse, so at least read the first two. If you like this type of humor you'll probably also like the funniest nonfiction books ever written too -- Woody Allen's 3 books. These 2 by Adams and the 3 by Allen make the 5 funniest books in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A near perfect book.","review":"Superb and impeccable! Had hours of laughter reading it. Douglas is indeed able to capture you into the story with his humour and wild imagination. Learn more about the galaxy, be exposed to science fiction books, read \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\"! Sadly, the blemish that marred its flawlessness is that there is not a really distinct, flowing plot. Nevertheless, this is certainly a good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I've read worse.....","review":"Ok, honestly, Hitchhiker's Guide is one of the funniest things I've ever read.Was I touched? Was I moved? Was I changed forever by reading this book? Nah. Nothing like that.But I laughed myself sick, if that helps. Adams pokes fun at nearly everyone and everything, particularly those who want to take themselves seriously. I was skewered, but I was laughing so hard, I hardly noticed.So, if you've nothing better to read, I suppose this wouldn't be all bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"dated satire?","review":"A couple of the earlier reviews have called this book's satire dated.

All the cute nerdy boys I had crushes on in middle school carried this series around as though it were a bible. So, being an inquisitive young lass (and also trying to suck up to them) I forced myself to read the entire series too. Imagine my shock to discover they are just totally silly and pointless flights of fancy with little insight & all the dated humor of a bad Monty Python sketch. I personally blame this book for my switch to dating obnoxious metalhead morons in high school and my 13yr aversion to an otherwise fascinating genre, science fiction. Read \\"Whipping Star\\" by Frank Herbert instead, if you're looking for comedic and zany sci/fi that's not empty-headed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hint: ONLY READ THIS IF YOU CAN\\"T FALL ASLEEP EASILY","review":"what the heck was this junk? how didit get published.

Incredible!","review":"I will leave the subject matter to others and the published reviews already listed.I will only comment on the fact that this book deserves a special place in the history of Sci-Fi. It is written in the style of the British television program \\"Red-Dwarf.\\" Sort of a cross between Monty Python, Doctor Who, Star Trek & Mr. Bean. Even if you are not a Sci-Fi fan, if you dig British humor, this book is the greatest example of the genre.Your bookshelf will be bare without at LEAST one copy!You WILL read it over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book of 2012","review":"I will never get back the precious time I wasted reading this stupid book for my upcoming book club meeting.This was a \\"best seller\\"?

Yet during the travels through space I didn't consider very funny. While there was somewhat of a plot it seemed to be mostly pointless. However, there was a great twist in chapter 28 (or was it 29?); the book has only 35 chapters.Overall: good beginning and good end, but a waste of my time in the middle."},{"rating":"2","title":"TheHitchhiker'sGuideToTheGalaxy-MalavChakravorty","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy is a great book, with the perfect balance of humor and conflict. Douglas Adams' random humor keeps the story interesting. The plot is confusing towards the end, but the book starts off interesting. This was my first science fiction book, and I enjoyed it very much. I would recommend this book to any science ficion lover that would enjoy reading a light book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Very Very Exilent","review":"After reading this book, I began carying around a towel and glancing at the sky ever afterwards, to put it mildly.

The story itself is an A..but if don't get this if you already have it...nothing is special about it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to all the fans out there...","review":"I do not understand why people love this book. Or why they think it's funny. It's just so boring. There's no plot, there's no character development, and the characters are one-dimensional anyway.The entire story can be summed up in one sentence: The Earth is destroyed, and Arthur is saved by Ford Prefect, who is an alien researching Earth.Woo, what an exciting plot. Honestly, I'd rather be on the Earth when it was destroyed than go on this boring adventure.However, it's obviously a cult classic, and I guess it's just one of those books that everyone must read at least once in their lifetime. And finally I've been able to understand a lot of sayings and jokes that I've been hearing for all these years and not knowing where they came from. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read!","review":"I have never read a book that is as young and jouvenile as this book is. I couldn't even finish reading it I was so disgusted."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah","review":"I suppose this book is written for a different type of reader than I am. I enjoy scifi, but this bordered on ridiculousness, and i was quite disappointed with the lack of substantial stuff going on (I ended the last page feeling I wasted my time). Even though I hated reading it, I will admit to bursting out loud in laughter a few times. It is truely funny in parts. This is a great book for monty python fans (which i am not). For anyone else looking for a serious read, buckle down and get some Heinlen or Gibson."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am surprised there are negative reviews","review":"I would rate this as one of the funniest books I have ever read. It to me was clearly way up there along with Wodehouse. The comedy of Douglas Adams is difficult to categorise as satire or pun. It has satire and puns, however i think his books do more. Douglas Adams makes you laugh using parts of brain whose existance you may not even have been aware of previously. Reading this book was to me like getting hooked on to some strange device which would trigger those areas of brain responsible for laughing which the other books and movies have missed. The ridiculousness of some of the ideas in this book and (most of the) series is unbelievable. The humour can be a bit nerdy and I guess hard to understand. However all in all it is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Science Fiction... yes, that's what I said","review":"This book is satrical farce at it's absolute best. The hilarous situation and comedic dialogue (sharpened by Adams' ever-present wit) are massively entertaining and serve to make the book a quick, enjoyable romp. You can read this in a day because you won't want to put it down. As light-hearted and funny as it is however, it also has some serious undertones. Some of Adams' comments on the human condition have a dead-on accuracy that shine through the thinly-veiled comedic pretentions. This book is a must-read for all of these reasons. And besides, where else can you find the meaning to Life, The Universe, and Everything?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life? Don't talk to me...","review":"Reading this again brought back so many memories! Loved it the first time, and it never dates. Just one disapointment, it seemed to finish so abruptly, I had forgotton it was a trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage!!","review":"This is the WORST garbage I have ever read. Could'nt even get a third through the book. Seemed to me like I was wasting valuable time that could be spent on a quality book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book SUCKED!","review":"This book definetly made me snore. I spent about 5 minutes reading it and I knew it was going to be the worst (or one of the worst) books I have ever read. The galaxy part made absolutely no sense and the way the author had objects on earth be something REALLY important in other planets was just plain dumb. So in conclusion...this book sucked...don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is a star trek wanna be","review":"THIS BOOK IS HORRIBLE. WE DON'T RECOMMEND IT TO ANY ONE. IF YOU WANT TO READ A REALLY GOOD BOOK, THIS ISN'T IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"No fun at al","review":"I was looking forward to seeing this movie, because all critics were very positive. However after watching it, I really didn't understand for whom this movie was made. Some Monthy Python elements were put in, but things simply never get funny.All aliens are boring, but funnier than the cast still...Sam Rockwell's supposed-to-be-funny-character is annoying even when it is unintended. For its originality I give this movie two stars, but it should have been one. This is like watching comediants with another sense of humor than your own. (SARR)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor excuse for Sci Fi","review":"I read this book because Amazon reccomended it as similar to Battlefield Earth by L.Ron Hubbard, probably my favorite book of all time. Hitchhiker did not even come close. I am a Monty Python fan, and oh yes...I get it. This book however had no real story, and reminded me of some sort of silly narration of a story about a book that the narrator never bothered to read, making stuff up as he went along. No wonder it is so popular with the Junior High crowd. Two stars because I actually did laugh at one line when all dolphins departed the Earth...other than that, pure stupidness. I can't believe they concocted a movie from this...I won't be viewing that, I can tell you."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERALL THE BOOK WAS NOT THAT GOOD.","review":"I WAS EXPECTING THE BOOK TO BE MUCH FUNNIER. THE JOKES WERE VERY DULL AND ELEMENTRY. I THOUGHT TOWARDS THE END OF THE BOOK HE COULD OF EXPANDED HIS THOUGHTS BUT INSTEAD HE ENDED IT ABRUPTLY. OVERALL THE BOOK WAS NOT UP TO MY STANDARDS, AND I WOULD NOT CONSIDER READING IT AGAIN."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Incredible Book Ever!!!","review":"I read the book and didn't understand a word. So I figure it must be \\"deep\\". Since I see that other people think it's so great, I'm going to say it's great, too, because I don't want to seem stupid, even though I suspect everyone else who said it was great didn't understand it, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWSOME","review":"this book is one of the best i have ever read. sure the plot is unreal. sure it isn't the best written book. but the way Adams catches your imagination with his own is amazing. i can't put the other books of this series down. plus, the style of writing is quite amazing. the story is well developed for what it is. though they do some crazy things for no reason whatsoever, except that they can make a good joke about it. this book is overall AWSOME! it couldn't be made better. i cannot express how much i like this book with typed words. i'm not good at expressing mysdelf on a computer. i hope you buy this book and have as much fun with it as i have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't Know What To Expect","review":"I heard a lot about this book, though I never exactly knew what it was all about. After reading it, I am very satisfied. It contains a mix of humour and science fiction that I haven't encountered in past novels. It brought up several theories that made me think, including the impossible being the possible. This is a very entertaining book and easy to read. The plot is very easy to follow and the author wrote it in such a way that it is easy for an average joe to understand what is happening in the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eyorre needs Paxil","review":"Just came off reading the Dune series & needed a bit of a break. And this book provided a perfect, entertaining read.I had planned on reading only the first in the series before embarking on Neal Stephenson's Quicksilver jouney. But now, I plan to read the remaining four in this series first.Anyway, if you like dry humor and brilliant characters, such as a gloomy robot that makes Eyorre's disposition seem as sunny as Richard Simmons', you will LOVE this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first, and greatest of the \\"Hitchhiker\\" series","review":"Douglas Adams's \\"Hitchhiker's Guide\\" is a science fiction classic. The story follows a befuddled Englishman named Arthur Dent, and his friends, the alien Ford Prefect, two-headed Zaphod, fellow Eathling Trillan, and poster-child-for-prozac robot Marvin. Basically, ASrthur has to deal with the awful fact that his planet was blown up to make way for an expressway. Lots of wackiness follows. Trust me, you'll laugh by the time you end this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't forget your towel...","review":"You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll throw yourself at the ground and hopefully miss. A bit on the bizarre side but I figured this is something everyone who wants to think creatively should be reading. In fact just read the whole series and then go on to read \\"The Long Dark Teatime of the Soul\\" and see if you start noticing street lamps going out as you pass them by at night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic, Must Read","review":"Douglas Adams is a master. Anyone who hasn't read his Hitchhiker's series needs to prioritize better. Hitchiker's Guide is light enough to never stop being fun, but looks seriously at humans and why we are the way we are. He seems to be able to capture the human condition through farce without becoming shallow or pandering. This book is a necessary element of any serious Sci-Fi reader's library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Side-splittingly funny.","review":"Simply the funiest SF book ever. Fast paced and easy to read with an endless berage of humorous encounters between Earth man Arthur Dent and various aliens following the destruction of the earth by Vogans constructing a hyperspace bypass. Oh, did I mention the earth is actually a giant supercomputer operated by mice! Sure it's insane, but you'll be too tickled to care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless classic, awful quality eBook","review":"The book itself will always be timeless and I think it would be daft to write any kind of review on a book so well-known and loved.So, instead, I wish to berate the awful quality of the bonus material at the end of the book that is largely illegible. Considering the price of the eBook and the unfortunate quality of the bonus material, it's hard not to feel ripped off.Hopefully Amazon will deal with it and upload an improved version at a later date.For now, apart from the convenience of having it in digital format, it's not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Kindle!!","review":"Kindle IS the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and now it's available for download - HOORAY!! A great book and a great product combine.....let me get my towel!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Fast Read","review":"As I was reading this, I said, \\"Man, this book is almost over already. How in the world is it going to be wrapped up in the last 3 pages?\\" Well, it doesn't get wrapped up. Its one of those deals where you have to read the whole series for stuff to get wrapped up. I usually hate those kinds of books, and I'm also not a big fan of Sci-Fi books in general, but this book was quite funny in certain places and I got a kick out of reading it. I particularly liked the part where the police officers discussed how they were really sensitive literary people during their big shoot out.I wouldn't be surprised if I finished the entire Hitchhiker series because the first book is pretty funny as far as written works go, and I would imagine the whole series would move as fast as this book does. I was kind of hoping it would be more surreal and less funny like the Neverending Story, but I still found it to be quite enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wholly remarkable book","review":"I must say that Douglas Adams reminds me a lot of Mark Twain for his sharply satirical syle of writing. \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" is short and sweet and all readers will find it hard to put down. Sci-fi lovers, and even those who are not, will surely get a thrill out of reading this book! It is witty, off-beat and surprisingly easy to follow. Truly, the end of the world was never so funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dry, absurd and grotesque; simply great!","review":"If you took the dry humor of Joseph Heller and the unique science fiction of Kurt Vonnegut, you would be near an understanding of what this book is. The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a bit of fresh air from most other Science Fiction. Everything from Existentialism to Asimov's Foundation series is hilariously scrutinized by the metaphysical universe that Adams used for the setting of this story. The humor of this book reminds me most of the story-lines on the Simpsons. The action of this book requires the reader to suspend his disbelief. This book is so grossly absurd that it almost seems to parallel some of the problems of modern life. In the end, this book shows that while most of these problems will never be overcome, there will always be fodder to poke humor at, and that's at least a start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!Couldn't Stop Reading This Book!","review":"Intriguing! Well-developed characters, understandable plot, this book has it all! It's about hitchhikers traveling through the universe. There are billions of planets and one digital book explains all of them, plus everything else in the universe. The book starts with the Earth blowing up. There is someone named Ford from another planet who is on Earth and he grabs his friend and gets on one of the spaceships that is blowing the earth up. They are thrown into space but Ford's cousin, Zaphod picks them up with the spaceship he stole. Then they continue to travel the universe together with Trillion (an earth woman), Arthur, (Ford's friend) and Marvin, a robot. I loved Douglas Adams' writing style! The descriptions were a little weak, but it is fun to imagine what characters and objects look like. Whether you like science fiction or not I think you will like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest book ever!","review":"This book will take you on the ride of your life! Douglas Adams really makes you think at how insignificant we are in this huge univerese. The mice know it all. It also answers the question about Life, teh Univerese, and everything. my advice is read it! i havent read the whole \\"trilogy\\" yet, but i'm planning to. This book is absolutly hilarious! I'm waiting for the electronic version to come out (you'll understand after you read this book)."},{"rating":"2","title":"You had to be here.","review":"This is a fundamentally English book dealing with a fundamentally English incompetance. American reviewers may call it a 'trip', may think that a 'by-pass' is a 'freeway' and may have problems with 'character interaction' but but basically that's because they haven't been here and don't understand our planning regulations."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good funny book","review":"Having heard about this book from a friend, I decided to read it. I must admit that there were occasions I laghed out loud while reading the book. The author's humour, his sarcasm for the significance of the human race and it's place in the galaxy, as well as his absolutely whacky plot are probably the highlights of this book. All in all, a good funny read, if you want to pass your time pleasantly for a couple of afternoons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe classic","review":"I am sure that when this book came out, it was probably mind blowing. I did find it entertaining, but not enough to recommend to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little too much space-fantasy but the humor is great","review":"This book was very odd. If your into the whole space-fantasy thing then you will love this book. There were some random parts that didn't even really relate to the plot that stuck with me and were actually very very funny. You really need to have an open sense of humor and can handle a lot of different types. There is a lot of cynical humor, and some cracks about British people. Actually now that i think about it, this book is very satirical and if your one of those people who really hates the world and human culture then this is the book is for you! This book will make you laugh out loud.After reading it I want to read the rest of the hitch-hikers series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"I've never read a book quite like this one. Douglas Adams is a very creative and original writer whose ideas cause you to think about the universe in a new way. I didn't give this novel five stars because it finishes too abruptly and some of the humour is a little hard to understand at first. All in all a really fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the best book I've ever read!!!","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is about Ford Prefectand Arthur Dent, and their journey throu space and time.It's a very good book that every sience-fiction-freakshould read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The answer to the Ultimate Question: 42","review":"Douglas Adams dazzles us with his brilliantly hilarious satiristic book, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Arthur Dent, the hero of the story, is an Earthman searching the universe for a decent cup of tea. Arthur travels in various bizzare and funny places along with Zaphod Beeblebrox (a two headed, three-armed alien) Trillian (the sexy space cadet from Earth) and Marvin (the unbelieveably brilliant and astoundingly depressed robot). I invite you to join Arthur Dent in this hilarious satire as he searches for the answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything, a place to relax, and, most importantly, a decent cup of tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"42!","review":"I absolutely LOVED this book! I haven't laughed so much since I read James Finn Garner's books. My favorite part was the entry about the Babble Fish."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed my life.","review":"I know that's a pretty extreme statement, but this book was an experience like none other. Before this, I never knew how much fun reading could be. This story of an ordinary earthman and his adventures through the universe with some colorful space guys will have you rolling on the floor laughing, shaking your head in amazement, and flipping pages like there's no tomorrow. The story is full of ideas, big and small, that you will never forget. Read it again and again"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy","review":"Ok, First off this is the first time I've done this so hang with me. The Reason I read this book was, pretty much, because the movie was comeing out, and I didn't want to see it with out reading the Book first. I'm Glad I did beacause if i had seen the movie first it would have ruined the book for me. The one thing that I noticed about this book was it's so great that you read it really fast, and when u finish you wish you hadn't read it as fast as you did.Anyway I've never Read anything like this book and probably never will again. I recomend this book to any one who likes to read good books."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok...very dated.","review":"Well just wrapped up this book...And unlike other reviewers, I promise I wont write a book report giving every thing away.Any hoots, this book did have some laugh out-loud moments. After the first few though you began to see the setup long before the punch. Some long roads were traveled to get to the 'funny' and at times were a little too predictable.This type of humor has been played out to death since the time of this books writing. So the wit-factor is just not there.At times I got the impression this book had no idea what it was doing or where it was going. Almost as if it was not really thought out and planned but more just banged out and made up as Adams went along.Well all the reviews loving this back can't be wrong either. I guess this book is really more not to my personal taste. Thats my review and I'm sticking to it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the deal with this?","review":"That book could be rewritten as a good 20-page short story. That would be room enough for all the witty comparisons and good ideas it has. Also, the true randomness of the writing would still be interesting as a novelty.As a full-length book, it is a disaster. There's no plot, no characters, the randomness doesn't make any sense. If you shuffle the chapters the book would probably be as readable as it is now. It reminds me of some writing I and my friends did when we were 11 years old, only duller.I don't understand the high praises it has.BTW, I like a lot \\"nonsense\\" humor from people like Monty Python. You might call it nonsense but what they do is precisely crafted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of original paperback edition released in 1981.","review":"I saw the many reviews of this first volume in the then trilogy and decided to dig out my first edition and check the notes I had written at the time. As you can see by the score, I was not as entralled by this novel as the more recent readers seem to be. It seems to be so much hype for a novel that appeared in the just reinvigorated sci-fi world of the early 80s.It is okay reading for young adults, but not for the seasoned sci-fi reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"DON'T PANIC","review":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is like combining Monty Python and 2001: A Space Odyssey. It's wierd, it's funny, it's pure genius. It's quite possibly the most brilliant thing ever written, in that it allows people to think, read, and have a whole lot of fun at the same time. This is my favorite novel, and that's not an easily won prize. Keep in mind that it's not for conventional thinkers, or literalists. But for those out there that have a sense of humor and an interest in absurdity, this is like a religious text. Like the bible, except it's slightly cheaper and has the words DON'T PANIC written in large, friendly letters on its cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"the increasingly inaccurately named hitchikers guide trilogy","review":"ok.. the earth has been demolished by the vogans (less than understanding aliens with absolutely no poetic skills) a couple of thousand years after a guy got nailed to a cross cause he mentioned how it might be a good idea to be nice to people for a change.. this book is crazy. zaphod beeblebrox, a three armed, two headed, ex hippie, and president of the galaxy has taken to basically wondering around the universe with his noggin out of wack with arthor dent, mostly harmless human; and ford perfect, the last beatelguisian since his planet blew up. this book is teetering on the brink of insanity. you catch youself at moments reading in public places laughing histerically and people staring.. but they dont understand... just carry on your psychotic mission and dont panic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable and just unfair","review":"I cannot buy this actress as a cop, and the story is too farfetched to make much sense or keep you from rolling your eyes.

The portrayals were unbelievable, robotic and overly scripted. Directing, editing and cinematography had that one person crew with a camera; jumping scenes; cheapness. Worst was the script in foisting an implausible series of events conjoined with the usual dumb investigative cops. Seemed like a Twinkie movie with not much of a beginning and not much of an end with even less in the middle."},{"rating":"1","title":"the kate logan affair","review":"Very quickly a sense of dread was felt- script seemed poorly written, lacked believability-Alexis hard to accept as police officer.

Absolutely happy with this purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the greatest movies I've ever seen.","review":"Ann make me laugh, she make me cry. She also touches my heart.

It's a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This is a Cinderalla like tale of a beautiful girl winning her way into the hearts of a small Canadian town at the turn of the century. It is my absolute favorite movie . . . whenever I hear the music I am transported to Anne's gorgeously decked out era. This is late Victorian melodrama at it's pinnacle. Everyone needs a dose of Anne's sweet optimism and madcap spunk from time to time . . . I recommend this movie highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Excellent Movie!","review":"This is truely an excellent movie. This movie is exactly like the original book by L.M. Montgomery. I didn't know there was a movie of Anne of Green Gables. When I found out, I immeidiately got it. Megan Follows performs a captivating performance as the high spirited, imaginative, redheaded Anne Shirley (a.k.a carrots). My mom cried, I laughed, the dog barked and everything was just like it was in the extraordinary book. One of the best movies ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have a daughter--she NEEDS this DVD!","review":"I grew up watching this movie, and read all of L.M. Montgomery's books, and now as an adult I wonder, \\"What happened to stuff like Anne of Green Gables?\\" Kids these days, especially girls, don't seem to have any wholesome entertainment that doesn't focus on becoming rich and famous or having the perfect body. If you have a daughter, or a niece, or you yourself just want a nice wholesome movie for a change... buy this movie, you will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charm and Grace","review":"In a world filled with headlines on war and hate, you and your family will enjoy a timeless classic that enthralls people of all ages (including men!). The beautiful poetic Anne captures our imagination and we can see a piece of ourselves in her with every step through her life journeys. Use these beautifully inspiring books to bring your family closer together and grab the attention of your children inspiring them to read other literature. This is a must read for anyone of any age!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne with an \\"e\\"","review":"Love, love, love this movie. My all time favorite. Purchased this to watch with my granddaughters.

If it isn't one thing it is another with Anne of Green Gables!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A real family film","review":"Anne of Green Gables has been one of my favorite movies. Even as a kid I enjoyed watching it. It is such a sweet story. Anne is so warming and seems to touch everyones heart. She always makes the best of things and puts a smile on many faces. Her friendship with Diana is very loving. Anne still remains faithful to her friend even when she is forbidding to see her.Her relationship with Gilbert leaves you hanging there at the end. Matthew is very warm and open to her from the beginning, but Marilla takes a while to love her. This is a story I think the whole Family of all ages will just love and want to see over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"No matter how many times I watch it, it moves me!","review":"I first saw Anne of Green Gables when I was in high school and I fell completely in love with the characters, the setting and the story! That was eleven years ago and I am still moved every time I watch this wonderful film.(I have to keep a box of tissues handy) I think Anne is the kind of girl most of us can identify with. She's in a new place trying to fit in and trying to be true to herself. She sudcceeds wonderfully, growing from an awkward little orphan girl into a confident well loved young woman. I have a 5 year old son & a 2 year old daughter and I will be so glad when they are old enough for me to share this wonderful film with them both. Anne is truly a fine role model for any woman, young or old!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Movie of ALL TIME!!!!!","review":"Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea are my favorite movies of all time. I watched them on PBS as a little girl every time it came on TV. I have watched these tapes over and over again, as many of my friends have done too. Even today in college I have had conversations with many of my friends who all agree that their childhoods would not have been complete without Anne Shirley (Anne with an \\"e\\"), Marilla, Matthew, Gilbert or any of the wonderful characters from the book and movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite series","review":"Megan Follows is perfect as Anne with an e.

Both Anne of Green Gables and Anne the Sequel don't play in any of our DVD players (Sony 7000, Onkyo 910, Dell computer).We had also bought one directly from the Anne of Green Gables Store in Canada (but still region 1), it has the same problem, we exchanged it and the replacement had the same problem. We haven't had problems with any other DVDs, the only common factor here being these discs all come from Sullivan Entertainment.We have contacted them to see if they know of any authoring/pressing defects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality video","review":"This video skipped the first time it was watched. It is being returned! (Looks like an illegal copy because there is no label on the DVD!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This brings a smile to my face ~ even 10 years on","review":"I always remembered that I enjoyed this when I first saw it as a school girl. The second time round (10 years later) still brings a smile to my face. The brilliant cast and storyline make this in everyway a treasured classic. I laughed with and at Anne, I discovered that Marilla was really a big softy under that stern exterior, and I cried when Matthew said his goodbye to Anne. Excellent picture quality. I enjoyed the behind the scenes featurette of Prince Edward Island and the comments from the filmmakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, DVD quality poor","review":"I can't fault this movie (or its sequel), they are simply fabulous and I've never come across anyone who doesn't love it. However Im far from impressed with the DVDs. I actually thought my copy must have been a copy of an original (didn't purchase through amazon), but from another person's comments I gather that I do have the original. Sound quality is only 2.0, no chapter searches (never seen a DVD without this), and the picture quality is about the same as TV. The DVDs are expensive and Im severely disappointed in the producers for not giving us a decent DVD. Have they no respect for this classic film?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Anne Trilogy","review":"I have loved these movies for most of my life! As a young girl not much older than Anne when I saw the fist one, I found her and the relationships between all of the charectors inspiring and lovely to watch. The movie made me read the books, and when the second and third movies came out I was just as pleased with them as I was with the first. The fact that they were able to film it on location made the movies sooo much better! These movies, and books, are testaments to what people can achive with a little imagination and a lot of love. I recomend any of three of them to be watched by people who love good stories!

I bought this for my mother and ended up watching it myself. I loved it and so will you. This is the kind of wholesome, quality TV that not only entertains, but also teaches good morals and values that are sadly missing in most of today's TV. Don't hesitate to pick up this family-friendly series that will have you laughing, crying, and wanting more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne of Green Gables","review":"This is one of the most heartwarming stories of all time. It can be enjoyed by all ages. It's one of those stories that you don't want to end. All the actors/actresses were perfectly cast. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Wonderful!","review":"I can't say enough good things about this movie. Buy it, it doesn't even COMPARE to the movies they are coming out with nowadays, especially for families/kids. I don't think Hollywood even CAN make a movie like this, even if they tried. It doesn't have enough bad attitude and negativity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anne of Green Gables DVD","review":"A great story, but the CD came with no insert to explain anything about the DVD. Very disappointed that you pay [this much], and get such poor quality video. The story of course is great, but they blew it in digitally restoring this. Maybe like the other person said they had a problem, or all these DVD's are boot-legged. The video quality is not up to par with any other DVD we have."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful story!","review":"After reading the Anne of Green Gables books, I found the films Anne of Green Gables and Anne of Avonlea.

(This is my first return to Amazon since then.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is this \\"Anne\\" and what have they done with Anne??!!!","review":"I hated this movie and all the following ones. I am a purest of the most absolute form and they added so much to the movie that does not belong in Anne's life. If you must cut out some things to make it the average movie-length, fine! But to trash her life like that? I wouldn't even give it 1 star if I had the chance. I'm forever arguing with my friends who think it's the greatest in the world. They tell me they didn't like the book, What's not to like??!! LMM didn't create this movie \\"Anne\\" and Hollywood shouldn't have either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anne?","review":"I did not like this movie.I thought it was too mushy and Anne was too romantic.

Wow, what a mistake. So dull it puts you to tears. Its like a 4 hour Little House on the Prairie epiode from you know where. Just plain old corny and dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh, lordy...","review":"This simpering little twit plodding her way through this series should be used as forced-viewing punishment for people who take organized sports too seriously. I suffered through an hour of this with my wife and I wished she's fall down a well and not come out. Or fall off a horse-drawn carriage that's going at full speed. Or, well, you get the idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent adaptation of a classic story","review":"This movie is just amazing! Megan Follows IS Anne, and the other actors fit their roles perfectly. I saw this for the first time on PBS, having already read the entire series. Normally I hold to the rule that the book is always better but this may be an exception. I've seen it countless times and never grow tired of it. My favorite part is when Marilla is instructing Anne to say her prayers and Anne says \\"Mrs. Hammond told me God made my hair red on purpose, and I've never cared for him since\\". Classic!By the way, Anne of Avonlea is just as good, but in my opinion the third part is lacking in charm. It is a good movie, but not great. Still, you should see all three!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Family Movie","review":"This movie is probably by far the best family film of all time. I highly recommend it, and the two that follow it. (The Sequel, and the Continuing Story). I've watched this film when it was on TV, when I was able to buy it on VHS, and now, I'm happy to say I own the three DVD's. Buy them separately, the Boxed set sometimes has the wrong disk/repeat disk as the third installment. I love this film. Megan Follows is extraordinary all the way through. Having Colleen Dewhurst and Richard Farnsworth in it was icing on the cake; truly believable and outstanding performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Family Movie","review":"This is a good movie for all the family to see.

I enjoy young orphan Anne's misadventures with her new family (an elderly brother and sister who own a farm in Canada.Anne is definantly a fanatic when it comes to literature and she has a big imagination. All the background characters are so good at acting, that we forget this is a movie and not simply us viewers looking in.

This is one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"an entertainment delight","review":"As Anne of Green Gables, Megn Follows, will steal your heart. We watch this film at least twice a year and have memorized every word of dialogue and still enjoy it every time. Good entertainment that you want your children to watch. When anyone in our family is sick they curl up on the sofa and watch this 2 video set along with Anne of Avonlea."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this movie","review":"I loved this movie growing up. Maybe it was because I could relate(red hair). Anne was always getting into trouble, but to no fault of her own (most of the time). I always thought that she should have been a little nicer to to Gilbert. And not take things so personally. This movie is just so great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellence at its best","review":"I teach children's literature to college undergrads and we read a critical edition of this novel. I show a short clip of this movie in class and tell them all to go buy it--which, for an English instructor, is a serious endorsement. It captures the book so well. Every child should grow up with this. Even the guys in my classes (not that I get too many) like this book and movie. Don't miss it. (But read the book, too!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, but poor quality dvd","review":"I love the Anne of Green Gables movies, but for the PRICE I just paid for this movie, the DVD was not entirely worth it!!!! I have a problem with the sloppy packaging, no inserts, nothing but a 2 sided DVD. And the DVD does not contain CHAPTERS, so you can't just skip to different scenes like you can with most any other DVD. That seems like necessary feature for such a lengthy move, don't you think? Like I said, love the movie, just disappointed in the dvd version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor video and audio quality for a dvd!","review":"I adore the movie, don't get me wrong, but I was fooled like many others into wanting to replace my vhs sets for dvd. I am very disappointed in the grainy images and mediocre sound quality of this dvd. It seems like Sullivan just slapped the movie on a disk, added the interactive menu and a few deleted scenes and began selling it. For this price tag, I would not advise replacing your vhs copies of this movie. If you have never bought the series before, see if you can find a discounted price or buy it used. This dvd is NOT worth full price!The movie itself is 5 stars, but the quality is 2 (and that is being generous!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The VHS has it! Why not the DVD?","review":"I adore the story of Anne Shirley and was excited to get copies on DVD. My hope was to introduce these cherished stories to my girlfriend who is Deaf.

I loved to watch Anne of Green Gables from videotapes. All of them had closed caption. So I expected these DVDs (individually not the collection) would have the closed caption but it did not have any (subtitles or closed caption). I was so disappointed because I am deaf and these movies had a lot of talking. Finally, my friend showed me this (The Collection) instead of individual DVD. I was so thrilled that it had closed caption. That's why I bought Anne of Green Gables: The Collection.

Megan Follows plays an extraordinary Anne, who is lovable, can be a pain and is tremendously funny. I rarely like movies as much as I like the books they are representing, this movie is an exception. I LOVE this movie. My daughters and I have watched this over and over and over. The movie is set in another place and era and often the morals and hardships they endured are overlooked in this day and age. I love Anne's relationship with her bossom buddy or to Anne her 'kindred spirit'- Diana. If you listen carefully you'll learn from Anne. She'll make you laugh and cry. I hope you enjoy it like we do."},{"rating":"2","title":"MISSING","review":"This series comes in a beautiful collection box. The quality of the DVD's is great.

First, Howie Mandel's character is annoying, like he has ADHD. Second, there are curse words that are totally inappropriate for kids, like the monster pulls down Fred Savages pants and a girl monster says \\"nice a$$\\", that's just one of several examples.Third, and most important, the whole movie has a weird and unsettling feeling to it. But during the climax, when the little kid, who is about 5, is strapped to the wall, with darts thrown at his head, the main monster pulls his face off, exposing his slimy face with his bloody eyeballs hanging out, it was time for me to hit the stop button. My kids were relieved to have it over.It's a bad 80's, albeit very mild in comparison, horror movie. Adults will find it corny and obnoxious, and kids will find it bizzare and frightening, the stuff that nightmares are made of. In short, just awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Day of Christmas Review","review":"For the First day of Christmas I'm going to review...Little Monsters.The Monster:Maurice is nothing then a Beetlejuice clone. The overall acting is cheesy & over-the-top. There's no moral or lesson. It's not that fun at all. The images are too scary for most kids and visualy unpleasing. The Monster World is not even that creative. It looks like the backstage of the set. There's a ton of unexplain story issuses like the parents getting a divorce. It's also very mean-spirited. The pranks,the father and monsters are all cruel. Not only that,the cruelty in this film amount to nothing. Overall, avoid this movie at all cost. I give this film a 1 out of 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"This got one star because I couldn't give it zero stars!","review":"First of all , this is not a kids movie because of the language.It was a good idea poorly executed on every level."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken","review":"so i heard the movie moving in a closed case so i was mad that it was getting scrached the whole trip. but when i opened the case the part that holds the movie all together was broken. whats the point of a movie case that can't hold the dvd"},{"rating":"1","title":"WORTH THE WATCH ONLY FOR ITS STUPIDITY!","review":"I love The Wonder Years - I truely do.

Well, this young boy, whom is played by Fred Savage, (the Wonder Years), soon discovers a whole knew world under his bed. He then meets this friendly young lookin' monster, named Maurice, helps him use his imagination and be able to do the impossible. If you're asking me, I think this film has so much imagination and wonders in it, anyone whose anyone, will enjoy this childlike fantasy. So, take my advise, buy this film, you won't regret it.

I really liked the characters in that show, but with Warehouse 13, I sometimes struggle to really care about the agents and their coworkers.Warehouse 13 is simply too slow and unimaginative for me.

Yet, when it seems that every other sentence includes swear words, the dramatic or comedic effect wears off and these just become an endless string of offensive words. When you combine foul language with a heavy dose of gratuitous violence, you have a fairly good idea of the content of this movie. Are there some comical scenes? Yes, but not ha, ha, ha comical. My British friends tell me that it is easier for those who grew up in England to appreciate this flick, as they can understand the inside humor. For example, one of the stars, reportedly, is a famous English football star. Unfortunately, for some of us, who do not have the background, we just hear the swear words, see violence and remain unamused."},{"rating":"2","title":"lock stock and two smoking barrels","review":"omg bbq askjhsefiuhdfiuhefiuwe jksd sdjdjd djd djd dj dj djd jd dj djd dj djd jd jd dj djd jd dj"},{"rating":"2","title":"MUCH BETTER THAN TARANTINO","review":"Tarantino doesn't have even half the creativity and originality the director of this movie had.

Good, now is it because of the five sub plots or the cockney accents? One must admit that after a first viewing, to feeling a little lost and dumbfounded to what had happened. After a second or third viewing, the intricacies of the cockney accent (which Ritchie caught a lot of heat from critics for) begin to finally click with the viewer, and every other line causes laughter. Aside from the violent, underground crime theme in the movie, such ideas as camaraderie among friends (whether it with the main cast, the horticulturalists, or Dog's gang) also manifest themselves a great deal and allow for cohesion among the characters, making it truely believable that they have been together for quite some time. The authentic East London dialogue gives an interesing feel for all the characters, where they are truely representational for their characters. Overlooking this title would be more than a mistake on your part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"A superbly woven story that features gambling, thugs, drugs, toffs, scousers, cockneys and a couple of antique shotguns thrown in for good measure. The acting is excellent throughout with a very strong casting. Guy Ritchie's direction is excellent with well used camera placement/editing. The soundtrack compliments the film well. I would advise that for the first 15 minutes you don't do anything but concentrate on the film - there are a number of separate storylines that unfold - if you miss the beginning the later scenes might not make much sense. 100% recommended and lends itself to repeated viewings. A classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"'If the milk turns out to be sour...

His own gang is held responsible for the debt. They rob a group that robbed some pot dealers.

While it revolves around the four main characters, there are many other characters with many other plot lines that all tie in nicely togather, and the score to the film goes perfectly with the film itself. The director, Guy Richie, ends the film at just the right time! The Ryming Cockny can be a little hard to understand sometimes, but it doesn't take away from the true genius of the film!

(Don't worry, some of the had me confused)All in all I think this movie is just a very well written and acted piece of work, and a good piece of work will transcend borders, as this movie has.It will be interesting to see how Ritchie will top this, as many directors never release a piece as good as this in their career, and he has done it with his first mainstream movie.A good film, that I am very happy to see succeed in the US as well as in Europe."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUNtastic!","review":"I couldn't remember when was the last time I got so delightfully happy of watching a movie.

For those who've seen 'Snatch' (many of us have been riveted to the screen for multiple viewings), this earlier release is as satisfying as a mountain of buttery mashed-potatoes at Thanksgiving. Ritchie cleverly uses some of the same talented actors (in completely different roles) to prepare this buffet of violence and brilliant acting. Multiple precarious and fast-paced scenarios inevitably run head-on at eachother as if drawn by the power of giant magnet. Upon meeting in a clash, the chaos and irony is unmatched. Action and violence are pushed to the limits and those left standing are our heroes...yes, even the bad guys. For lovers of action films, this movie should be in your library. Same goes for lovers of intelligent scripts, bitter sarcasm and non-stop movement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie - DREADFUL DVD transfer","review":"Love the movie -- one of my favorites. But this DVD transfer is absolutely DREADFUL. Watching on a professionally calibrated Samsung 6167 w/a Denon 1920 DVD player over HDMI, the film looks like a 3rd generation VHS copy. The images are fuzzy, the color washed out -- all the hallmarks of overcompression. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Great.","review":"Good movie.

That being said, I find more humor in Lock, Stock than I did in Pulp Fiction. Lock, Stock is a caper flick at it's heart, and an entertaining one at that. Not too many extras to shout about on the DVD, but it does have a handy dandy Cockney slang dictionary which is useful for insulting people without them knowing it. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels","review":"This is one of the best written, best cast and most entertaining films I have ever seen.

Not to mention the great cast of characters including Sting! I would recommend this movie to every fan of great movies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It","review":"Cannot agree with the other reviews. Got caught up with the marketing of this film. Not quite the worst film I own but a close second. Found the story drawn out and a bit slow. The story as it leads into the action scenes is much too long. I found the sub-plots a waste of time. Anyone want to buy my copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloody Awful","review":"This movie wants so much to be another \\"Trainspotting\\" or \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" but it fails miserably. The characters are bland and interchangeable, the plot totally contrived to be as ironic as possible. Nothing is more uncool than trying too hard to be cool, which this movie is guilty of to the third degree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably Bad","review":"I've heard so many great things about Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels ranging from its similar to the \\"Boondock Saints\\" and \\"Snatch\\" - both movies I really enjoyed. However, what you get is completely different. A dried-out, weak rendition of the Pulp Fiction-style movie where there are too many people to keep track of. The movie is confusing, the dialogue is difficult to understand, and there are too many coincidences to even think that this movie is relatively realistic. Unfortunately the movie just forgot to do anything special.As far as the DVD went, the special features are rather weak and the video/audio is decent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two words: Inspector Gadget","review":"For all you \\"England has to prove itself to the world\\" folks...you'll think this movie is \\"the most amazing cinematic experience ever\\". Well, I've got some news for you...this \\"experience\\" as you may call it is nothing more than a glorified attempt to bring Oasis to the big screen. I've seen four movies in the past week: (1) Clueless (2)Inspector Gadget (3) Water World and (4) Lock, Stock and 2 Smoking B's. Hear me now and listen to me later, I'd take Inspector Gadget over all of them. But, that's beside the point. The Sex Pistols really weren't that good...and neither is this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring British Quentin Tarantino Knock-Off","review":"Basically just a pretentious knock-off of Quentin Tarantino's style. Pulp Fiction was ten times better, and obviously an original. This is just a british version with less interest, less character development, and less panache."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not half as clever as it thinks it is.","review":"I cannot believe some of the reviews here. There are no great plot twists that you do not see coming from a zillion miles away. The joke caling the thin guy fat is not funny the first time and definitely not funny the fifth time you hear it. This seems to me to be one of those movies where we get to hear a lot of cockney swearing and not much else. Like the truly excreable \\"Nil By Mouth\\", one of the worst pieces of dreck masquerading as a movie that was not directed by Peter Greenaway. Also this movie (LS2SM) is supposed to make Vinnie Jones a \\"star\\". Give me a break. The only reason I give this two stars is because I lived in Liverpool and the attitude of the bungling Scouse burglars to the London gangsters is pretty funny ( and accurate )."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's face it: imitators are never as good as the originals","review":"I never understood the hype that this movie received when there were movies like Trainspotting and Pulp Fiction. Now, I am not implying that both of those movies were completely original, but they took so many different influences and completely melded them into a new organic whole. As for Guy Ritchie, his only two touchpoints are Tarantino and Boyle. Even in the beginning of \\"Lock, Stock\\" it had the slow-motion running scene with the rockin' music playing in the background. C'mon Ritchie, get a freaking clue!Anyway, his new movie \\"Snatch\\" (what a clever title!) is out, and I couldn't even bring myself to the theatre to watch it. Funny, my friend told me there was this scene where one of the characters \\"accidentally\\" shoots a guy in the head while waving his gun around -- c'mon folks, it was funny the first time. It's just plain obnoxious the second time around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite simply - you should buy it!","review":"Some films are must-buys. This is one. Why? Multi-layered plot, quirky, modern, original, good acting, real villains playing the villains, and yet it harks back to the ol' British gangster flicks (the more things change etc...). Also look out for four NEW Lock Stock films co-produced and co-written by Guy Ritchie which are currently coming out on VHS in Britain (not yet in US), and which use the same \\"success model\\": Lock, Stock &...... Four Stolen Hooves/200 Smoking Kalashnikovs/Spaghetti Sauce/One Big Bullock. So run down your apple and pears, ignore the trouble and strife and buy these before everything goes pear-shaped!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't understand half of what they said & STILL loved it!","review":"Ok, maybe one of you Londoners could come out with a translation guide for us poor Yanks so we can \\"get\\" all the jokes & understand all the dialogue! As it was, I LOVED this flick! Glad I saw it on video, so we could stop & rewind & listen to parts over again. Constant action, the most intricate plot, fascinating & 3-dimensional characters- what's not to love?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute quote machine if ever there was one","review":"This is the first movie I ever memerized. I can recite the whole script. This (and Snatch) is one of those movies that have a quote every other line that can be applied to everyday life. When you're watching something on TV and someone says something that you don't care about and you turn to them and say: \\"what? and I care?\\" Or someone says \\"what are we supposed to do with these?\\" to which you reply \\"You put them on your head, stupid\\". I failed maths this year because we used to sit there quoting this excellent movie endlessly.If you want a movie that has enormous replay value and a high quote factor then this is for you. There is one more thing......it's been emotional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vinny Jones","review":"Great to see Vinny Jones kicking some a$%.This is just a really good film.

(You can find it on http://www.amazon.co.uk)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Showing Hollywood how it's done!","review":"Surely one of the most original flicks to have been produced for many years with innovative direction and a thumping, hip and sexy soundtrack. This film makes Pulp Fiction look like a 'B' movie and shows just how much Tarrantino's work has dated over the last few years.I'm not going to review the content of the film at all only to say - \\"Get it from the video shop, then YOU WILL buy it!\\"The director was wise to cast relatively unknown actors - I wonder how Brad Pitt will fair in the sequel to Lock Stock wrapping at the moment? I hope that the tinsel-town glitz doesn't spoil the grit and the magic of the original.I hope you guys state-side can understand enough of the cockney-rhyming slang to get the jokes, else this film may well be wasted on you - that's all for now - I'm sticking the DVD on again!That was emotional..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie.","review":"Great movie, one of my all time favorites! It is just so funny and exciting. The Blu-ray version was a little grainy, but I think that's what they were going for."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 many comparisons; not given enough credit","review":"I tell you, I'm getting pretty tired of seeing [him] constantly [compared] to Tarantino , the Coens, etc. and calling him unoriginal... I find it hard to believe that anyone could watch either LS&2SB or Snatch without cracking somewhat of a smile or finding it at least a little entertaining. Granted, I'm not saying the movies should win an Oscar, but they deserve a degree of respect. And this business of calling Lock, Stock a \\"sequel\\" to Pulp Fiction is ridiculous. The only thing similar about the movies is Jules' and Rory Breaker's hairstyle (bad move I guess Guy). And try to find a movie that hasn't been influenced in some way by another. Ritchie takes his obvious influences and runs in a different direction with them. Open your eyes and try to enjoy his movies. Guy Ritchie, to me, is about having fun at the theatre. You don't need a deep, artful, meaningful plot for that...do you?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hillarious film, great soundtrack and colorful caracters","review":"This is a film that you must not miss! Yes, it's violent. But it is all made with a sense of humor. I especially like Vinnie Jones interpretation. (Vinnie is a former soccer-player who once got a red card and had to leave the field after tree seconds!) Rock-singer Sting has a role as a pub-ownwer and father to man that is suckered in the rigged card-game. He is about to lose his pub and is, of course, not too pleased.

The quartet's most talented poker player loses big, putting the other three in a life threatening situation. The game's overseer is a thuggish brute who allows his top two henchman to recover his money. A great soundtrack accompanied by awesome visual is enhanced by a fantastic story that continues to escalate as the movie progresses. I have heard how Ritchie's movies parallel Tarantino in action and suspense, it's true; but this movie has a flavor in it's own. Without hardly trying each character is easily identified in a quirkish flighty manner. Unfortunately, I had to keep the subtitles on to understand the thick cockney speech pattern. Other than that, this is one of the most enjoyable movies I have seen in a long time. The humor is timely and the action is great!!! I'm going to see SNATCH this afternoon, hopefully, it's just as good....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally entertaining,from start to finish","review":"When I first read the plot for this black comedy, I thought it would be one of those types of films that lose their way, midway through the film. However, although the plot becomes thicker as the film progresses, the action and plot unwinds, and leaves you being able to easily watch the comedy of errors as they unfold. I thought the cast of actors who I must admit I don't have a great deal of knowledge of( excluding Sting } were very good and I can recommend it as a movie to watch.

I especially love \\"I Fall in Love Too Easily.\\" It just breaks my heart.

The choice of songs is good, and the sound quality is just perfect compared to the old quality of records. This collection is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD QUALITY CD SET","review":"Great sounding Sinatra recordings made during what was arguably the best period of his singing career as far as the quality of his voice. FS could make a good song sound great and that is what he does with the better songs in this set, such as, Saturday Night is the Loneliest Night, These Foolish Things, If I Loved You, Full Moon and Empty Arms, How Deep is the Ocean, Night and Day, The Song is You, Time After Time, and some others. But there are other songs in this set that, in my opinion, not even Sinatra could improve. Altogether, there is enough good stuff here to make this a worthwhile acquisition for Sinatra fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"'The Voice': simply recorded, simply silky, simply great","review":"This 97-song, 4-CD set includes a large 68-page handsomely illustrated booklet and contains the best of Sinatra's work, mainly ballads and some swingy tunes, of the period 1943-52. One can easily hear the smooth phrasing and pure tonal quality of young Sinatra's voice in the 1940's, the silky sound that made 'em swoon, a time before years of overuse and overdoing took their toll on his instrument."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Sinatra -- A different singer than the swinger we know","review":"Sinatra's work at Columbia was true crooning. The Bing Crosby influence is at its most pronounced on these recordings. It's easy to see why young Frankie's weepy, longing voice kept WW II wives company while their GI husbands were away. Much more sentimental stuff than anything he did for Capitol or Reprise. The remastering of the original recordings (they took the master from a re-pressing of the record mold) is marvelous. You won't believe that records this old can sound this good. Romantic music of a bygone era. If you like Bing and Perry, you'll love Frank \\"Swoonatra\\" when he was a teen idol here. Note the very different way Axel Stordhall arranged as opposed to Nelson Riddle (at Capitol). It's not as swinging, but will tug at your heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rancid","review":"This product was in the correct wrapping and perfect condition but when I opened the box the perfume was green in color.

Her story is heartbreaking and very real. Finally, she and her little brother Rodney are able to live with their elderly grandmother and have a chance for happiness and real love when tragedy strikes again. Some V.C.

I can't wait to read the rest of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes Insulting!","review":"Yes, these last two \\"mini\\" series are totally insulting to V. C. Andrews name and talent. She would not have written weak, empty-headed dramas about four teenaged girls feeling sorry for themselves. Where is the shock! Where is the horror! There was a time when V. C. Andrews was beating Stephen King in horror paperback sales, there is no horror here anymore. Very sad and depressing that the Ghostwriter has begun to ignore the die-hard ADULT fans of V. C. Andrews who read her because her novels were so gothic, so dark. I am so angry with these books I could spit nails, what would Stephen King's fans do if he started writing teeny-bopper romance melo-dramas? Ms. Andrews' was a HORROR novelist, and just because she was a woman, they are altering her style to a more sudsy, soapy variety. Dispicable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Good","review":"Unfortunately I wasn't impressed with this read. Having read and owning copies of all the original V.C. Andrews books and having been a captured reader of HER books, I can only say that when her reads came out originaly, I believed this writer to be a PHENOMENON, and still do! However this book, as well as many of the other books, written by 'other hired writers' just don't seem to cut it for me. These writings done after her death don't seem to have the same appeal and have never been able to capture her forte. For me, this book was another disappointment. In my mind there will never be anyone who can write her books and I think most of the new books written by 'other writers' just shouldn't be using her name. But that's just my opinion.I keep buying them or getting them at local library, so it's something in them that keeps me coming back. I think though, that it is the hope of finding another one that can equal Victoria's writing herself. And that's just never going to happen.

Her story isn't VCA caliber, but it's not a bad book for teens to read. It seems that Neiderman was relying on stereotypes for this book, but by itself it isn't a horrible read, just a lite teen book. Compared to the other books in this series, it's so-so."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!","review":"I too am one of the fans of the older, more intense novels. The only one in this series so far with anything even remotely shocking is \\"Jade\\". The narrative style is horrible--considering that the girls are speaking, the language is very unconversational. Who would really tell an oral story using phrases like \\"She looked at me sadly, her eyes searching me like two tiny headlights.\\" Which brings me to another complaint: Every girl uses the cheesiest metaphors, and none have a distinctive voice--each story sounds like it's being told by the same girl. If I hadn't gotten these first three for 1/2 off, I'd be mad at the waste of money. But I guess they were worthy of 1 star and $2.00 each for keeping me mildly amused for a few hours... I will buy cat and the reunion novels but only when they too are 1/2 off or in the used bookstores.

Please Mr. Neiderman, don't disgrace V. C. Andrews name and lagacy with another miniseries after this awful second one. Write books like the first three series of ghost written books, not R. L. Stine clones. If the horror and rage cannot be done again like in the books that SHE wrote, then at least return to the drama that was in the landry, cutler and logan series, I swear, these two miniseries are some of the worst books that i'm sort of emabarassed to have in my collection, but they have V.

Next, another top 10 hit, the sublime tingling \\"The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore\\" Perfect pop for aching teens yearning to shout with a whisper. There were other attempts at singles, none made more than a once/heard tossed over the shoulder and given out as radio station call, win a 45.Except, Walker Bros. had a fine distinctive vocalist in Scott Engel.

This raised button clicks into a short slot in the belt clip part, which fastens securely onto your belt or pocket. Because it's round, the button-like clasp mechanism allows the phone to swivel, so it doesn't dig into your side or leg when you sit down. (At least with a 7100-series, anyway.)There's a little spring loaded button on top of the clip (the photo on Amazon is really upside-down) that disengages the round clasp and lets you pop out the phone. The design is pretty clever, and it works well. The swivel mechanism allows it to stay semi-secure even while driving. I can't speak to the durability of it, because I've only had it a week.

It is very well edited and is full of nice pictures which makes it a very pleasant reading experience. I only found it a little repetitive in the chapter about psychological aspects of running and a little bit shallow regarding the last chapter on marathon training.

I nearly gave it four stars (see following), but it does many things well. Some may knock the book because it has few bells and whistles (i.e., gear and gizmos). However, anyone that has run for a long time will tell you most of the same things that this book does.I was slightly disappointed that all the photos were \\"eye pleasing\\". Looks more like a magazine of female models for TV spots than the typical healthy runner. In some ways, I prefer the old style of James Fixx in the original \\"Complete Book of Running\\" (not Runner's World).There are almost no shoes shown, which is the most important of equipment. This is good. What is shown is the proper way to size your shoes and reinforcing that a runner should stick with what works for that runner and not chase after fads.The nutritional and healthy lifestyle information is excellent.

It provides a good basic overview of the important parts of running--avoiding injury, nutrition, shoes, etc.Because of the format of using several different authors, there are places in which the book conflicts with itself. I did not find this troubling. In fact, I think it led me more to realize that running is not an exact science. Different training methods work for different people. Because of the variety in the book, readers will more likely be able to find what works best for them as they \\"listen to what their body tells them.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Potpourri of running snippets","review":"This book is nothing more than a poorly structured potpourri of snippets and brief articles on running. The quality and content of each chapter is highly variable, with resultant poor applicability and usefulness in practice.

I do not recommend this book at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This is an absolutely awesome read for beginning runners. I have used much of the advice/information provided and am succeeding in my goal to become a runner. I love how they break everything down to the simplest of terms for greater understanding.

In the true spirit of Tim Robbins' filmmaking, it makes you think, makes you angry, and makes you weep all within the space of two hours. I saw this film 5 times in the theater and would pay to see it 5 more if it were still there. Great performances, incredible subject matter, and very edgy dialogue that shows the truth of the way people are and the way people were instead of simply being kind and nice about ugliness. This will awaken something deep within your soul... if it doesn't, maybe you don't have one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tendentious and Tedious","review":"Unspeakably boring and predictable, except when self-contradictory (in order to put on a play about the glories of unions, the actors defy... the actors' union).

What is the end result? They take a true moment of triumph and fabricate it into a manufactured climax, they take 21 year old Orson Welles and turn him into a 35 year old drunkard with John Houseman as his straight-man. Yes, there are some very touching moments in the movie and Bill Murray is great but it would have worked better if it had just been the truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"This movie is so powerful! Robbins' interpretation of the fabulous musical is phenominal! He gives you the background story from many different intriguing angles. The characters are charged with emotion and tell some wonderful stories. All this leads up to an emotional climax that will leave you changed and inspired! Not to mention the fabulous cast! Hank Azaria, Susan Sarandon, Bill Murray, Vanessa Redgrave, John Turturro, Joan Cusack, Jon Cusack, and the amazing Ruben Blades! Every character will find their way into your heart.

(not to even mention the hatchet job on nelson rockefeller, who was portrayed far more fairly in \\"frida\\", arising from the same incident -- hmm, i guess i DID mention it). the film is sophomoric and replete with ham performances from alot of actors who should know better, with only bill murray acquitting himself well. and most annoying of all is the scant amount of the blitzstein score that is used, further proof of mr robbins trusting his own talents ahead of those of a genuine artist. one of the worst movies ive seen in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely unwatchable","review":"What was Tim Robbins' point here? If his objective was to to prove his intelligence through the penning and staging of turgid, stilted dialog that no human being would ever mouth, then he has succeeded. The result is that he has foisted upon us a completely unwatchable film.This movie reminds me of the premise behind Woody Allen's \\"Bullets on Broadway.\\" In that movie, John Cusack's character is a vaunted playright whose prose results in a work replete with sequence after sequence of artificial, stuffy dialogue. Chaz Palmenteri, attending the practices as a henchman guarding the lead actress, recognizes that \\"nobody talks like that\\" and starts making suggestions to Cusack, much to the delight of the actors.Too bad Robbins' didn't have a similar resource for \\"Cradle Will Rock.\\" Alas, we get the unfiltered Tim. Not a good thing for viewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen","review":"I don't know what Tim Robbins was thinking when he directed - and I use the term loosely - this mess.

Proof positive that the Hollywood elite live in a fantasy land of political naiveté. Cradle Will Rock is so horrendously dull, so stupendously pretentious, so predictably and nauseatingly left-wing it took Herculean willpower to prevent the bile from rising to my throat as I watched it. Just short of the end I couldn't stand it anymore and turned it off. Why do wealthy entertainers like Tim Robbins and wifey Susan Susan Sarandon feel it is their birth-right and moral obligation to reeducate we unwashed masses in the glories of Marxism through the medium of film? More importantly what wealthy Capitalist looney would put up the money to make this garbage anyway? Tie-died yuppie Communist philosophy does not make good theater or good movies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tim Robbins spews again.","review":"Leave it to Tim Robbins to again glorify the theft of the hard earned dollars of everyday people (and during the Depression no less) in the form of taxes so that a bunch of actors can be paid to put on performances that no one would willingly pay for. Rank criminality best describes people like Robbins and his rich Hollywood buddies. This waste of celluloid is political tripe masquerading as entertainment. And Robbins got a tax write-off as a protected corporate entity for the money lost on this dreck. I guess ol' Tim is against Capitalism, unless it's to his own personal benefit.Hey Tim! If you want the government to pay artists (and we know that Tim means to only support artists that promote leftwing causes) why don't you just get your Hollywood buddies to donate the money yourselves? I think a mere 1% tax on actors' bonuses would fund the NEA easily. Naw, instead you want auto mechanics to pay it while you put your own money off-shore.Hypocrite."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRADLE WILL BORE!","review":"It is not often that I turn off a DVD I spent $4.OO on renting, but the agony, the brutal and insufferable agony that this film gave to me is unbelievable. Tim Robbins simply does not know how to make a movie. He belongs (barely) in front of the camrea, but never, under any circumstances, should he be behind one! First he insulted us by trying to make us feel pity for a rapist-killer in DEAD MAN WALKING, and now he tries to pass off this abomination, this complete waste of film, as entertainment. This was not dramatic, scary, interesting, funny, cute, sexy, sad, romantic or anything other then TERRIBLY BORING AND POINTLESS. This movie is not even worthy enough to be a rabid dog's chew toy.

There-in lies the problem...he is not as skilled as these other instruments as other folks for whom these instruments are their primary focus. This includes of course, the members of the original Kansas. What I heard where rudimentary drums and bass, and most of everything else that that is not guitar or keyboard. Kerry is a great guitarist (imo), and the guitar work is far above the rest of the instruments. Unfortunately, what it sounds like to me, is that he had to limit his compositions to music that he could actually play. None of these compositions compare to the songs he used to write for Kansas.

This movie is charming and funny and everything else it should be. I got a lot of laughs.I've seen \\"Everybody Loves Raymond.\\" So Handy's antics are a bit similar to Ray's.

Simply, the guy cannot act. Ray Romano is awful in this movie. I enjoy Everybody Loves Raymond, but his film can be smelled 5 miles off. If you watch the DVD version and want to laugh listen to the director's commentary. The director goes on and on about how funny Romano is in a scene and how he adlibs and how that is so funny. Well the whole time you are watching these scenes you sit there wondering if you are watching the same person as the director.While Gene Hackman and the supporting cast do a good job holding up their end, Romano is just attrocious.Don't buy this one. Really ZERO stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ray, you ruined this movie.","review":"Simply put, Mooseport is a bad movie. Far fetched, not funny, slow-paced and boring. A waste of 90 minutes of my life. This is why this movie went straight from the theaters to DVD and HBO. Ray Romano's poor acting (as \\"Handy\\" the plumber) in particular ruined the movie. Romano was dull, lifeless and easy to root against. If it was not for Gene Hackman, who as usual, does a great job, I would have quit after the first 30 minutes.

The girl-friend squabble (how novel) between Gene Hackman and Romano's characters is too dragged out and unbelievably phony.

The plot is simple - both Ray and the ex-Prez Hackman are running for mayor of the small town of Mooseport, but the laughs are few. Most tragic of all is the wasting of Marcia Gay Harden as Hackman's assistant and Rip Torn is reduced to a minor role. It is a large cast of good B-actors as well.

The idea of the movie is believable and the supporting actors do a good job of adding humor to the plot.

And, all I can say about the movie without revealing anything is that certain plot points were implausible. I can only suspend disbelief so far. The one exception to this movie is Marcia Gay Harden who is, as always, great. So if you simply have to see it, wait for the DVD.

If you are a big Ramano fan be ready for a disappointment because he really lets down in this one.

They could have done so much with the material if they had a funnier script and more moose.

You really have to get a good weave going if there are gaps in the joint and you'll be changing electrodes a lot. But so it goes with the stick welder. I do not have the TIG gun for mine so I can't comment on that. The portability is unmatched at 10 pounds or so. VERY compact little power supply and being able to use DC and either polarity is a real benefit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"this album was a great start.

Shot at Brackettville Texas (the same place Wayne shot his Alamo), this epic follows the later years of James Bowie (Hayden). The action scenes are well staged , and Ernest Bognine is great as Mike Radden. Republics Truecolor is enhanced in this video, but the soundtrack suffers, as Republic only recorded a standard mono track. Overall a good edition to anyones collection, and historically more acurate than other (ALAMO) films. Good supporting cast, including academy award nominee Arthur Hunnicutt, and the musical score of Max Steiner."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Alamo Film","review":"Probably the best film ever made about the Alamo. This one is with Jim Bowie as the central character, and Sterling Hayden is terrific in this best-of-his-career role as Bowie. His confrontation and knife fight with Ernest Borgnine near the beginning of the film is a classic. Richard Carlson is serviceable as Travis, and Arthur Hunnicut is a loveable, folksy Davy Crockett. Good battle scenes and action sequences. J. Carol Naish is a great Santa Anna. I never get tired of seeing this film. It deserves a DVD release. All in all, a better movie than John Wayne's version and a more satisfyingly dramatic piece than the 2004 movie version. Memorable is a great special effects shot of Hayden throwing his knife into a menacing Mexican soldier's side during a pre-siege sequence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product as Described; Delivered in Pieces","review":"Although the product is good, the packaging TWICE caused the staples to be a pile of individual staples and unusable.

This is the first book that has motivated me to actually practice! What an outstanding tool to help Christians like myself fearlessly begin to delve into zazen.The writer approaches the subject from a very human point of view. She is \\"one of us,\\" battling with fickleness and human nature. And yet, with simple language, practical examples and personal experiences, she helps us to smell the aroma of the spiritual feast that awaits us in Zen practice.While this book probably won't add much to the knowledge or practice of those who are Buddhists or are already practicing Zen regularly, it will be very helpful for Christians who may have an interest in meditation. This book is Hands-On and How-To for those who want to do more than just know ABOUT Zen."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Essential Johnny Cash","review":"Discs cover the songs from 1955-1983.

Even though I still have his original music of the 50s on records I wanted to ensure that I would still be able to still listen to the music of one of the greatest song writers, composers and singers of our time. I remember hearing one of the first of Johnny Cash's recordings, Cry, Cry, Cry, in 1955 and noticed the different and unusual sound of his music. I was so struck by the base rhythm of Luther Perkins' guitar and John's rangy and raw voice that I ordered the 45 recording right away.

The system tha thte author lays out it very sensible and disarmingly simple to implement. I particularly found the chapters on how to focus, how to think critically, how to think creatively and Envisioneering were especially powerful. I've already begun implementing the Power Hour concept.

However, I found this book to be dogmatic and lacking the inspiration that I expected. I found that many of the chapters were dry, brief, and did not connect with me. I had the sensation of having someone who had heard \\"this is how to be productive with your time\\" from someone else and was passing on the cliff notes. Instead of this book, I would recommend Brian Tracy's Goals! - which gave me much more inspiration and practical exercises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Padded and poorly written","review":"I bought this book based on the strength of six five-star ratings. Alas, it was a disappointment. There are a few good nuggets of wisdom here, but maybe a magazine article's worth, certainly not a complete book. It's barely 200 pages long and this number was padded through the liberal use of wide white space breaks between paragraphs and a huge number of dot-point lists. It is also poorly written, full of redundant phrasing, non-sequiturs, and improper use of language. Note to the author (and to the author's editor, if there was one): the proper term is \\"risk averse\\" not \\"risk adverse.\\" If you're looking for truly practical advice on improving your productivity, I'd recommend any of David Allen's books over this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible!!!!","review":"I actually thought the first one was ok.

I got a review screener and was hoping for the best. Is it too much to ask that the alleged story make sense? I use the word story very loosely here.New Line should supply some kind of editing software and give a prize to anyone who can re-edit this straight to DVD movie into a cohesive story. It might only be a few minutes long but I think it's possible. The bigger question of course is: How does something like this get made? Were there any adults in the production pipeline who looked at the script and said, \\"Wow, this is great!\\"? Kind of staggers the imagination.Even the synopsis on the box was incomprehensibly weird and confusing. Just like the movie. You have been warned. Life is short, don't waste it on bad movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is a reason this movie went right to DVD ---- > BUST!","review":"1 star is giving this movie too much credit.The original Butterfly Effect was so amazing.

New Line Cinima had no business creating this. It was so horrible that I wish I never saw it. The 2nd one can't ruin the 1st but I lost respect for the whole movie concept after seeing this aweful waste of time. The main charater's motivations are not his loved one's but his own in this one.

I did not expect it to be similar to the first version of The Butterfly Effect. However, what I did expect was that the film would at least do a decent job of telling the story in an effective manner similar to the first. It failed, however. The acting was lousy.

The storyline starts out with good intentions, and had the potential to be a good sequel, but the tale wears thin, and it becomes very obvious where it is going to go, and then when you think it is going to go bad, it just ends, in a very corny way. I would highly recommend if you must see this, borrow it, but try not to pay for it even at rental prices...unless you get it as a freebie."},{"rating":"1","title":"How dare they!","review":"First off I would like to say that this movie doesn't even deserve 1 star, if I could, I would have given it 0 or negative stars. I am extremely pissed at the fact that they produced a follow up. The first Butterfly Effect was amazing and I loved it, they ended the movie with no intention of making a second film. Creating a crappy straight-to-DVD sequel not only puts more [...] onto the portfolio for the unoriginal and non-creative Hollywood, but it also ruins the original for the fans. Why does Hollywood think that if you have something good, you should milk it for all it's worth? 9 times out of 10 they end up ruining a good thing. Why didn't they get it through their thick skulls that IT WAS NEVER MEANT TO HAVE A SEQUEL!!!!

The regional financial contagion brought down much of the good times in Indonesia, Hong Kong, Thailand and elsewhere. The Malaysian Multimedia SuperCorridor slowed. Other development regionally took a backseat as many western companies pulled out.Fast forward to 2004 (perhaps a more appropriate timeframe for Mega trends) and the wisdom is becoming evident again.

The unique Obliveon sound is there, but the riffs and arrangements are overly simplistic and go nowhere. I hate to make this accusation, since it gets made all over the place by anyone who doesn't like something, but this is obviously a commercial effort.

However this book simply does not disappoint in pleasing any fan who was around and remembers the amazing 1985-6 team. The Mets have been erratic at best and God-aweful at worst since 1987 or so. It's nice to have such an explicit behind the scenes look at the team that so many of us fondly recall (surely followed by a sigh and a shake of the head no doubt). The team had it's share of self-induced casualties (Gooden, Strawberry) hot-shots (Hernandez, Dykstra) and team losers (my favorite - Heep, Sisk - who sound like they were loads of fun to hang out with).In short if you recall the mid-80's New York Mets with great fondness - than this book is a must-read. My only regret was that it wasn't longer (and it's already just over three-hundred pages)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book and I am NOT a Met fan...","review":"Best sports book I have read since \\"Friday Nite Lights.\\" The '86 Mets make Sparky Lyle's Yankees look like choir boys.

After all, many women who have that livelihood are indeed well paid. I am not surprised that this portion of the context was lost on Stoltenberg. This is a predictable, politically correct take on pornography consistent with standard academic interpretations. Nothing original here, or in any of the author's other works."},{"rating":"2","title":"A colossal, vigorous and mercurial performance!","review":"All of us are aware of the close ties among Bruno Walter and Gustav Mahler. One could state that Walter was conceptually, an artist imbued into the spirit of XIX Century, that is why his art as conductor was multidimensional and like him Furtwangler, Casals, Toscanini, Weingartner, Walter Damsroch, Jasha Horenstein were men that grew up according the precepts of the art conceived as the final expression of an artistic journey where all the rest of artistic disciplines were melted.Hence, Walter understood the intrinsic value of musical phrase, as part of a superior conceptual unity. That explains the fact his readings about Mahler owned personality and conviction.This first belongs to that reduced genre of anthological performances. The New York philharmonic and Walter reached such level of mutual support and total rapport, due that spiritual chemistry so vital and demanded to achieve such kind of approach.A fundamental issue to collect."},{"rating":"2","title":"close your eyes","review":"If you close your eyes while listening to this album, you can experience the warm sun introducing a new day to a cold winter landscape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nazi 88 Made Believes","review":"This is a wonderful book, easy to read and a very true account of a true happening of our history.

I also appreciated learning more about Hutchinson's background in England, and about her father's own career in dissent. This research, along with the fluid writing, really made Anne Hutchinson come alive for me, in a way she just hadn't before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised...","review":"I started this book a bit unenthused (required class reading) - after all, how could a whole book be dedicated to one Puritan woman in the 1600's manage to keep the attention of a twenty-first century action junky such as myself?Once I turned the first few pages, I couldn't put the book down. An excellent read by an author who has a gift for conveying history in an exciting and fluid manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent research, powerful telling of an American heroine","review":"LaPlante does a wonderful job of bringing her ancestor to life through the court transcripts, but also by bringing to life the world that she lived in. She gives thorough biographies of not just Anne, but her father and her accusers. By giving the reader an understanding of all the players in this drama, Anne's tale is even more powerful. Toward the end of her hearing, you almost want to put your hand over Anne's mouth to stop her lambast of her judges, but at the same time you can't help admiring her courage. The solidity of the early pages dwindles off toward the end, through no fault of LaPlante, because of the paucity of records regarding Anne's last years, we can only get a sketchy outline of her exile. That outline feels like even less because of the fully fleshed out Anne of early in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was Not Pleased!","review":"This Product Not Only Arrived In An Opened Package,And Without The String (Which All Balloons Include)But It Didn't Come With The Taffy That's Supposedly Included.OverAll I Gave This Product 1 Star,And That's Being Generous Because If i Could I Wouldn't Even Give That!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Christmas brand not \\"Gold Label\\"","review":"This is a cheaply made item that doesn't work well.

The music is melodic and sweet, guitar with occasional piano or trumpet, but it's the lyrics that have made this CD one of my favourites for months and months.

This approach is probably best suited for the audience age level, but it should be said that this book gives a very simplistic view of a tumultuous and politically controversial life. Most importantly, though, the illustrations are excellent and the selection of works from different periods and styles of Rivera's career is outstanding, especially in regards to his early work and training. Young readers will enjoy learning about mural painting and \\"public art\\", as well as Rivera's philosophy of creating art about and for people, from a clear and educational viewpoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad electronic edition, missing quotation marks","review":"The Kindle edition is missing all its quotation marks, as well as the original publication date, 1934."},{"rating":"2","title":"FosMom","review":"Love it.

I read all five of the books in about 8 or 9 days ... they were that good!! Although the characters in the Gossip Girl series are mind-blowingly rich, it seems that they deal with the same problems as average teens, such as drugs, back-stabbing friends, and break-ups. When you think about it, that's really the messege of these books: that we're not all as different as we think we are. Also, Cecily von Ziegesar is such a convincing writer, sometimes I feel like I know Blair, Serena, Nate, and the rest of the gang, instead of them just being fictional characters! I recommend the Gossip Girl series to anyone who enjoys romance, drama, comedy, and rich people making fools of themselves!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Honestly the worst book I have read","review":"Too be honest, this is only my opinion!

I kept reading the books up until about half way into the third one. I never liked the books though because I wanted to know how things would end up, I kept reading. The book is unrealistic and does set a good example to teen girls If I (as a teen age girl) decided to follow the lead of the charecters. Then I would be smoking, drunk, partying too much and ok with having a boyfriend who does pot. That was a combenation of a few charecters though I think it gets the point across.

It is concise and well-written, full of poignant examples, tracing economic organization from the Middle Ages through the present. The chapter summaries and discussion questions at the end of each chapter are very useful for both the student and the professor. The brevity of the book leaves open the possibility of including related academic articles or even other textbooks in the syllabus.The main disappointment is that the nineteenth century--which was full of economic, social, and political change--is basically ignored. The content jumps from the Industrial Revolution to the beginning of the twentieth century. The traditional Euro-American egocentrism is also present."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sure there are better books elsewhere","review":"The book provided a fairly decent foundation for the concepts it presents, though I feel as though it does so in an overly wordy and diffuse manner. The authors frequently make sweeping statements about a general topic with little to no evidence; indeed, little to no evidence even exists for some of the generalizations made. Similarly, the authors frequently pose what appears to be a significant question at the beginning of a section and then do little to answer it, instead jumping from topic to topic as if to say \\"look how much stuff we know!\\" I know I have a bias in coming from the physical sciences, but I believe students and instructors can find a clearer and more concise overview of the material in another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you actually read the book, \\"it ain't about the men\\"!!!!!","review":"After purchasing this book immediately after it was printed, I was pleased to have a written history of a living icon.

Barbara Leigh had a career in the Hollywood spotlight that lasted a little over 10 years as an actress, a little longer as a professional model, and for a lifetime the role that she will always be remembered for \\"The Original Vampirella\\". She is now and will always be the most stunningly beautiful woman ever to grace this earth. What is best about this book is that looks are not the only graces she possesses.

So here it is: The complete third season on DVD. What more could you ask for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"When South Park went from just funny to meaningful...","review":"This is the season that SP really got good. If you gave up after season 1 and 2, do yourself a favor and check out this season. It really takes off. It's worth it for the Mr. Hanky christmas special which had me laughing out loud with the opening song about poo."},{"rating":"2","title":"bold, daring, original, and very funny","review":"'South Park: Season 3' is bold, daring, original, and very funny. While Season 1 of South Park might have been a little funnier, Season 3 has great social satire, and embraces sexual topics rarely if ever mentioned on TV. Season 3 successfully leaves behind any sophomore slump found in Season 2. The stories are varied and not formulaic. The characters do, unfortunately, sometimes break into song, but it's fairly rare. I'm ready for more! Reviewed 6/22/2009 after watching the entire season."},{"rating":"1","title":"petsafe dog door","review":"Door is poorly designed and of marginal quality.

The Oistrakh rendering of the First Violin Concerto goes deeper than any others that I've heard, either live or on disc (good as Sitkovetsky, Mordkovitch and Repin are in this work). Moreover, the sound is astonishingly good - very immediate and true to life, if not to the hi-fi standards of the present day. The Rostropovich reading of the Cello Concerto is as definitive as we are ever likely to get. Indispensible performances for any lover of Shostakovich."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shostakovich is one of greatest from the 20th century","review":"Shostakovich is one of my favorite composers. He is one of the greatest from the 20th century. This is a must have recording of his Violin Concerto No. 1 in A minor, Op. 99 and the Cello Concerto No. 1 in E flat major, Op. 107. The violin concerto is from the 1940s, the cello concerto from 1959."},{"rating":"2","title":"All-time great recordings","review":"Performances by the dedicatees of Shostakovich's most famous string concertos which can never be bettered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great recording","review":"I was most interested in the cello concerto of the cd (I am a cellist). For reviews on the violin concerto, best to read other reviews.For the cello concerto, one simple comment: the piece was written for Rostropovich, who plays it in this recording. It's a great version to have because of this. Rostropovich plays it extremely well and I find it very musical and enjoyable :)the cd is worth 5 stars just because of this, although you can get recordings of Rostropovich playing this piece in other compilations that might be of more use to you/have more music on the cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great performances of Shostakovich","review":"I'll make this brief; the other reviewer have said what I would have stated, that this is a great recording. The one thing I would like to add, as an avid violin (and cello, my sister is a cellist) fan, is that the sheer intensity and almost raw (without being crude) power of these recordings, especially the Oistrakh, put them in a class by themselves. The violin cadenza literally knocks you out of your chair. I can't think of a single contemporary violinist who could approach this. There is something from the solar plexus about it. Combined with great technique and a sound entirely his own, Oistrakh makes all of the concerto a riveting listening experience. Some of Rostropovich's playing has a similar power...a willingness to test the boundaries of playing."},{"rating":"1","title":"It does NOT have Spanish subtitles","review":"I bought this version specifically because it said it had Spanish subtitles (I'm learning Spanish). It does not. I tried playing it with several different programs and none of them detected Spanish subtitles. I ended up selling it back to Amazon. Not happy about this at all. If you were looking at this because it claims to have Spanish subtitles (why else would you be looking at it instead ofthe cheaper more popular version that's on Amazon) then you can stop right here and don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was not what I had imagined.","review":"I was disappointed in this book.

This should EASILY have been both scary and intensely erotic --- but it was NEITHER!!! Problem #1: Too many P.C. authors, trying to make their lesbian vampires champions of the political plight of lesbian women --- BORING!!! Problem #2: Very poor mixing of terror and sensuality, which like terror and humor can very often mix together very well! Problem #3: Isn't the whole vampire thing usually portrayed as an older evil guy rapaciously pursuing innocent, virginal young women? So what's so hard about replacing the older guy with a beautiful slightly older woman, having her seducing pretty young women with or without their consent? No, this book was a failure because Ms. Kesey tried to go the politically correct route, and the result is a disappointing, very un-erotic collection of so-so stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"There was not enough action, not enough sex,and the vampire characters SUCKED big time..

Unless you like old English and vampires."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's The Heat?","review":"Glad to see developed minds and stories that contain some room temperature humor but, I bought this in search of HEAT. Erotica that leaves your fingers just a bit too warm after putting the book down. A sting never hurt...without feeling splendid at the same time. Anyway, I was bummed because for once I actually wanted a well thought out colletion of truly bad girls getting it on and terrorizing the night. Instead I got dry sheets and a pout I couldn't get off my face. Oh, well."},{"rating":"2","title":"true experience of the buying the VHS movie FOLLOW THE SUN","review":"I had recently read the book about the bio of BEN HOGAN.

I'd just like to know what you were smoking when you watched it.This is the corniest piece of garbage I have ever seen.

I'll bet she regrets this huge *boo boo.*"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Want My Money Back!!!!!!","review":"I just finished watching this movie having rented it yesterday. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but......... WHAT A TERRIBLE, STUPID, CHEAP, BORING MOVIE!!!!! Terrible acting. Yes, there was some blood but that does not make this movie any better for me. Crazy plot, and it looks like someone took an ordinary cheap camcorder and shot this movie. I suffered through it only because I spent $4.29 to rent it and that was $4.29 too much!!! What a waste of time and money. I could not wait until this movie was over with. Please, don't waste your time and money like I did on this horrible attempt at a horror movie. It's terrible!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"delightfully disturbing","review":"This movie leaves you with the eerie sense that nothing's right with the world.

It will mess with your mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once the sh** starts, it NEVER stops!","review":"I only rated this one star because I was FORCED to give it something. I LOVE horror movies...almost all of them...campy, serious thrillers, slasher, fantasy, etc. And I'm pretty easy to please in the horror genre, allowing a LOT of room for \\"out there\\" kinda stuff. But THIS movie...THIS IS ABSOLUTELY THE 2nd WORST horror movie I've EVER seen. I've almost never seen worse acting, a worse story line or worse camera work. It literally looks like film students conjured up a movie in their heads, smoked a few joints and then picked up a camera and filmed their trash. It's not scary, it's not \\"horrific\\" and if you actually even RENT this movie, you'll hate yourself for wasting the time to watch it. Again, I LOVE horror films, but this one is NOT that...it's a waste of a blank DVD. (and if you're wondering what movie I consider even worse then this, it'sAutomaton Transfusion (Ws))."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bowdrie Review","review":"This is a terrific book of short stories using the main character(Bowdrie) as a composite of all the attributes of a Texas Ranger in the old west.No one writes about the west like Louis L'Amour and in this one its just like you were his sidekick watching all the action.If you like the old west, Louis L'Amour or just good old adventure yarns then Bowdrie is a great read for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great short story westerns","review":"Louis L'Amour is well known for over a hundred western novels he wrote. He also wrote dozens of short stories, many of which first appeared in magazines about fifty years ago. \\"Bowdrie\\" is a collection of short stories all about the same character, \\"Chick Bowdrie.\\" Chick is a Texas Ranger. These eight stories are tightly written, with each having a mystery or puzzle that Chick has to resolve.There is plenty of action. Chick is a young man who is fast with a gun. For awhile Chick was torn between which side of the law he would be on. Another Texas Ranger convinced Chick to work on the side of truth and justice.Another fun part of this book is a number of short historical notes by Louis L'Amour. Each time in a page or two he describes actual events and people who lived in Texas about the same time these stories were written.These are great short stories. If you like short story westerns, this is a nice collection to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Louis L'Amour short stories","review":"The short stories of Chick Bowdrie are the best of Louis L'Amour.

Townswick's techniques have really helped me to improve not only my needle turn skills, but have helped in my design process. The tips about using freezer paper for placement really are great for getting your design to land on the exact area of fabric that you want to use. This is a must have for those wanting to improve their applique know how."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful for beginners","review":"I'm very much a beginning guitarist and this book is well within my range. It offers some fairly easy to play melodies and the songs are some that my own children recognize and can sing, making it enjoyable for all of us.

Jack is the heart and Susan is the brain; as conflicted as they are as a result of Jack's infidelities, they are committed to \\"making history\\" and know that neither one of them can do it alone. This film follows their campaign for the Democratic nomination and the crises of conscience undergone by their staff workers (Adrian Lester, Kathy Bates, Billy Bob Thornton) as they make their peace (or not) with the hardball choices and compromises that a serious bid for the presidency entails.Director Mike Nichol and screenwriter Elaine May have made a perceptive and serious yet entertaining and often very funny film about the American political process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a great film","review":"I love this movie. I watch it each election season to offset the negative campaign ads we're all subjected to. The cast is phenomenal, performances are perfect. I wish they would do a Blu-ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Travolta and Thompson are Superb,along with everyone else","review":"John Travolta and Emma Thompson were superb in \\"Primary Colors.\\"I especially love Kathy Bates part.Along with most of the reviewers,I would like to know if most of the movie is fact or fiction.If its true,Man,what an adventure it was for Bill Clinton's team to get him in the White House.If you love politics like I do,you will really enjoy this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"PRIMARY COLORS","review":"Great product and great service. Love the movie. It should be right up there with the classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Adrian and Bates","review":"Other than Adrian Lester (obviously a passionate and dedicated actor) and Kathy Bates (anything she is in is better because of her participation), the acting was mediocre and the story did not interest me in the least. Travolta played a scumbag, through and through. But the characters played by Adrian & Kathy were very interesting to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incessant profanity was a real turn off","review":"The acting and story line were fine but the incessant and unnecessary profanity marred my enjoyment of this film. Is it really necessary to have characters swearing constantly in films? I now know why I can not go to a mall or down a street without hearing the \\"F\\" word everyday. If hollywood stars spew such trash I can understand why impressionable young people believe it is ok to use such trashy language in everyday speech. The actors in this film were portraying supposedly educated persons who want to govern the citizens of the United States but they talk like uneducated bums! Hollywood, clean up your act!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutley Boring","review":"John Travolta fan, but this movie practically put me too sleep. Humor is sophmoric and the story is listless. One of the worst five movies I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting movie, but too politically motivated.","review":"I'm sorry for giving this movie just one star I think that in terms of acting it deserves at least three. But what totally turns me off by this movie(as well as other Hollywood flicks with a subliminal motive) is how the character(who is undoubtedly a resemblence of Clinton) is laughded(albeit ever so slightly)as a hero. THIS GUY(portrayed by Travolta)IS A SICK SCUMBAG WHO DESEVES TO BE TARRED AND FEATHERED AND RUN OUT OF POLITICS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.The character mportrayed in the movie is a sick person who cares more about himself and his polirtical career than anyone else including the people who voted for him. He is a miserable example of a human being and should be portrayed as such."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like","review":"Bill Clinton - you'll like the story of his presidential campaign, with all the very intimate details."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great political film!","review":"If you saw 1993's DAVE,starring Kevin Kline,you'll love this one. In this film starring John Travolta,whose character is physically like Bill Clinton's,he is of course,a presidential nominee. Great support from Maura Tierney(LIAR,LIAR),Billy Bob Thornton(SLING BLADE,BAD SANTA) and of course Rob Reiner. This film was made in 1997,during the Clinton era. Many people who saw this film also saw THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT(directed by Reiner) and MY FELLOW AMERICANS."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRAVOLTA IS AMAZING!!","review":"An AWESOME movie. A must see especially during election years. John Travolta should have gotten the Oscar for this role."},{"rating":"2","title":"Richard Devine '- Asect:Dsect","review":"Deliciously dark, Richard Devine's ASECT:DSECT never lets up over its running time, a dense conglomeration of sound and noise. And though \\"Cprec\\" starts the album off beatless, \\"\\"Dansk Rap\\" brings in hip-hop heaviness and \\"Floccus\\" the abstract breaks. Some melody edges its way into \\"Corina Chirac\\" and makes that track all the stronger for it. Devine's work with DSP comes to the fore with \\"Vo Stream Bas,\\" and \\"Rusx Fee\\" piles everything on for a thick slab of sound. He ends the album by clearing everything out and returning to a melody, the sad tune of \\"Randale,\\" which doesn't abandon the gritty beats, but gives them something to work with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go with the brand name","review":"The leather was too wide for the holes in my glove (Rawlings) and was very stiff.

First, the leather strip is larger than on the original glove. Second, and really irritating, the metal tool comes out of the wooden handle.

I couldn't get used to it and ended up just not using it at all. The tiny keys are lined-up in straight columns, too close together and the space bar is too narrow. It could have been much more useable if they hadn't tried to tried to cram so many functions into such a tight space. Give me just the basic alpha keys with function keys to get special characters and I would have been much happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesnt stay synced, rip off","review":"CONTINUOUSLY have to pair/sync this with my phone. It will stop typing mid sentence, then I have to turn the keyboard off then back on with the cheap, hard to move switch. This will happen about every 5 or 6 words typically, but can range from way more to way less. Whats way less than 5 words you ask? Pressing one button and have it continually be entered on the screen since the connection was lost, then having to erase the repeated letters that were entered, then the delete key does the same thing erasing possibly your entire message. This happens even right after its been charged, so cant be the battery.Id expect more out of such an expensive product. Having an extra thing to charge every couple of days (NOT 2 WEEKS) is an extra annoyance I'd be willing to put up with if this thing worked. This has driven me to sell my iPhone and buy a smartphone with a keyboard built in (Droid 4).

This is a great idea, but unfortunately the production quality was subpar. The unit works via bluetooth with the iPhone and the connection is incredibly unreliable. When I bought the unit a few weeks ago, there were very few customer reviews listed for the keyboard. Now that I have it, there are a number of reviews indicating that it suffers from bluetooth connectivity issues. I have packaged it up and returned it to the seller (unfortunately a third party on Amazon) and am hoping that a refund is provided/"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing experience","review":"A genuinely good idea but the service and product built was just way below average. I preordered the item but I have to chase it a few times before the manufacturer ship it, needless to ship, arrived way after the original schedule delivery date. Then the USB connector was loose so I cannot charge it properly (I can understand there may be production glitches and that's life) but the really annoying part is the service, I contacted the manufacturer nearly a week ago and I am still waiting for their feedback, may be they forgot they are suppose to turn around within 48 hours. Anyway, I still have a defective unit sitting on my desk and I am still using the Apple onscreen virtual keyboard.... Not a great experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give 0 stars I would","review":"The product is absolute crap. The USB cable is faulty and does not properly fit into the keyboard or the computer jack. Once I managed to get both ends to insert (with great care and effort) did the keyboard charge? Nope. Also the pairing button didn't work.Avoid avoid avoid. Do not buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor battery life, poor customer service","review":"The biggest downside to this keyboard isn't really the fault of the manufacturer; Apple will not allow external keyboards to use auto-capitalize and auto-correction features. Beyond that, however, there is only one shift key on the left side of the keyboard, making it impossible to capitalize half of the letters easily. Also, the keyboard jiggles a bit when it slides back under the phone. I have tried to begin the process of returning mine, but customer service has not responded to my request nearly one week after I made it. Bottom line: if you want a physical keyboard, you probably shouldn't have an iPhone in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Fantasy story","review":"If you love LOTR, D&D, MTG, or any other fine fantasy, you'll enjoy this series.

I bought book 2 of the series hoping for more of the same but was greatly disappointed in that the first and last chapters are drawn by different artists. The characters look so different that I spent the whole first chapter wondering if I'd somehow wandered into a different story. Was that blonde supposed to be Arwyn? Was that guy Gareth? Thankfully most of the book is drawn by Greg Land. I was on familiar territory again when I reached Chapter 2. The last chapter is a complete letdown because it too has a different artist, so again you feel that Arwyn and Gareth have disappeared and have been replaced by doubles -- and not very good ones at that.

It ended up with me collecting a couple hundred new wave band's music for several years. I still listen to several groups almost every month even though it has been 30 years since these were out. The sax is superb, the drums crisp, bass and lead excellent and Hues vocals vary from playful to haunting. If you like this, hunt down Australia's Icehouse CDs.

It is widescreen but only 2.0 I wish studios would invest more money into making higher quality product for movies that are considered old. It was only the 80's and this movie rocks. Regina and Sam survive what is the Night of The Comet. People exposed to the comet are turned into dust or if you were slightly exposed then you may have turned into a zombie like creature who will eventually decay and die. A group of scientists thought they were smart enough to survive the comet but they made a small but dangerous mistake. Now they search for survivors to make an antidote from their blood. Reg and Sam were lucky enough to survive the comet by spending the night in steel enclosed rooms. Now they must figure out what to do to survive the zombies and the scientists. A very fun movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally on DVD!!!!!!!","review":"We have been waiting for this to come out on DVD. It was great to watch it without being edited for T.V.

What you will find is a fun, popcorn romp of a movie that covers zombies, the end of the world, shopping sprees, Mac submachine guns, and secret underground societies.I do agree with one of the other reviewers that the movie gets a bit weak at the end, but overall it's a fun experience, as long as you know what to expect.So sit back, crack open a can, grab the popcorn bucket, and let the movie begin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"low budget but i still liked it","review":"i remember when it was 1st released and i saw it at the movies. back then it was one of the better movies of \\"it's type\\"...not the best but it was very watchable and every few years i find myself watching it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"STILL LOVE IT!!","review":"I have waited YEARS for this to come out on DVD and am so glad that they finally decided to honor this classic B movie with DVD quality.

I thought I may add, too, that watching it at a drive-through cinema on a saturday night doesn't get any better than that! Not so much as it is an 80's movie, but it is sort of timeless in its own way.This female scientist has lost all hope in living, in her own intellectual and/or prosac way of life, and after she has administered the self-suicide solution, she drifts of in a reclined gaze with sunglasses on, uttering (to her self?) musings about life in a rather stoic way. AND THEN... This guy dressed as Santa Clause walks into the door way, unexpectedly, right into the light where she can see him. She is so detached (by way of her personality, the injection or both) she doesn't seem to care if it is Santa Clause or Jim Morrisson (The Doors). It's funny in an ironic way.Yes, this movie is in sore need of DVD reissue.

The science is flawed, but the acting is so above average that you don't really notice. The special effects on the wide shots are 2nd rate, but that doesn't particularly matter either - the story and the decent make-up are what sell it.

This isn't likely to appeal to everyone, but it is worth watching if you are a fan of zombie movies.No plot spoilers from me: The movie centers on an 18 year old survivor of a zombie outbreak. The plot is fairly weak, the acting is passable, and the special effects are not very good, but it all works together better than it should. It is almost worth watching the movie to see the '80s hair.This is one of the movies that I showed my teens since it has become part of pop-culture and is referenced in other movies and TV shows.Recommended!CFH"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Funny, Cult-Classic","review":"Make some popcorn and settle into your favorite chair for this one. As the opening narative states, the world has not seen a comet like this since the dinosaurs disappeared. A good foreshadow as one comet-watcher assures everyone that nothing happened when people were so worried about Halley's Comet coming around so there's no need to worry now. Well they should've worried, as we soon find out in this OmegaMan-knockoff. Yes this is a B-movie and yes there are some inconsistancies, but for the most part the plot has good execution and follow-thru.

How can you go wrong with \\"Mags\\" from The Last Starfighter and the cheerleader from Fast Times at Ridgemount High toting machine guns and fighting zombies? There's enough of a plot and a dose of suspense to keep you interested, while the gags and subtle, well placed jokes remind you that there's a tongue in cheek thing going on here. By the way, Spielberg probably ripped off the whole bodies turning to dust and leaving behind the clothes idea, used in this movie, in his version of War of the Worlds.

My buddy suggested it, and I went along for the ride - and what a ride it is!The acting is so-so - but this film is not built on acting. Vin Diesel, however, is perfect as Riddick and the rest of the cast works well together at least.The script is also average - certainly interesting, but not overly intelligent.What got me about this film, was the cinematography - just an excellent picture in that aspect. As far as I was concerned, this is what made the movie. The bright lights, the planet, the crash, were all incredible shots, and superbly put together.Give it a shot - even if this isn't your sort of flick. It's pretty darn good."},{"rating":"2","title":"DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK-BE AFRAID OF WHAT'S IN THE DARK!","review":"PITCH BLACK is an incredible movie. Lots of suspense. Richard B.

The added footage on the unrated version really explains and adds a lot to some of the scenes of the movie that you see in the rated version. As David Twohy says, \\"Sometimes the less you see is scarier.\\" Not knowing what's out there makes it a lot more bone chilling. I highly recommend seeing this movie to everyone. Especially fans of Vin Diesel(like me)! Would I be afraid of the dark?----not if I was with Riddick(in which case, he might need to be afraid of the dark!!!) Keep up the great work, Vin! Can't wait for the sequel!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This hybrid runs on Diesel","review":"I really like this movie - A LOT. Very strong leads and a compelling main story mixed with a lot of nuance (Johns the druggie, Fry trying to ditch the crew, slight religious over tones.. etc).. about all this movie needed was an alien species a little less generic and a stronger secondary cast. However, I give this movie high marks for what it is and cannot fathom how they got that fantasy hybrid mess of a sequel from this hidden gem. See Pitch Black, skip the god awful sequel.. this is Diesels best movie and best character, not to mention a very nice high definition transfer and plenty of extras, hopefully if there is a third movie they go back to the grittiness of what makes this movie shine.8.5/10"},{"rating":"2","title":"sweet","review":"ALright well to start off this is one of my all time favorite movies.

I know that I'm part of the minority on this forum, but by far, this was one of the worst movies that I saw last year. I did see it in a theatre, and I actually wanted my money back.I found the plot to be silly, the character underdeveloped, and the cinematography (while I understood the statement they were trying to make) to be... poor.I guess that I just can't get into a knock-off of other sci-fi movies that is supposed to be wonderful because it is shot overexposed. But that's just me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money!!","review":"I had a lot of expectations about this movie before seeing it. First off, I never heard anything good nor bad upon watching it. Secondly, the only good scene was when the dude breathes out fire and then you realize all the creatures that surround him. This movie has the worse characters that must have been picked up from the side of the road (the one's you see \\"will work for food).\\" About the only good thing was the special effects. I am big on special effects, but this movie is certainly not worth owning for that alone. My advise, rent it like I did and then thank yourself for not wasting your money on purchasing it or seeing it on the big screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"an average film","review":"Pitch Black is highly overrated.

If you want good FX, buy The Matrix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very slick sci-fi.","review":"I love this movie.

Not only were the actors terrible and annoying, but the plot stank. 22 years before they crash landed on the deserted planet, there was an eclipse. Somehow this triggers the girl to think that there will be an eclipse the exact time there one the planet. If there was an earthquake 5 years ago in Cali. that doesn't mean there's one every 5 years.

That's about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fabulous","review":"While Pitch Black certainly borrowed elements from other sci-fi critter flicks, it's delivery of those elements definitely sets it apart. The acting was outstanding and incredibly believable, and certain little twists (pleasantly unexpected, I might add) in the plot kept everything fresh. The character of Riddick (played superbly by Vin Diesel) defintely stole the show, but not so much as to overshadow the rest of the cast. I've watched it several times, and everytime I like it just a little bit more. I highly recommend this movie, which isn't something I usually do with critter flicks. Check it out.

The cast, who I thought did an excellent job, worked with a tired plot where there is a \\"good guy\\" and a \\"bad guy\\". The movie tries to show that the bad guy character is bad in the beginning, but we all figure out the plot way ahead of time and that he will become one of the \\"good guys\\". The plot does run very typical of a horror movie. People get killed one-by-one. For me the enjoyment of the movie was the special effects of the modern-day vampires. The ending also was a twist of what everyone thought was going to happen but didn't (exactly). I would recommend this flick to everyone who enjoys Sci-fi, horror and special effects. This movie can be seen over and over again and still be very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best horror/sci-fi film since Aliens 2","review":"Although not the most original science fiction film, Pitch Black is a blast to watch. From the at times disorienting tinting of the early scenes to the excellent use of sound effects, Pitch Black is a worthy addition to any science fiction lover's collection. The creatures themselves are fast, viscious and scary. While there could be more character development, there is enough so that we actually care about the criminal's apparent redemption.

If you want completely derivative and contrived plots coupled with predictable script and story, then this is the film for you.Imagine the scene - a ship crashes on a planet, which is dark only once in 22 years. Guess when they crash, yup - the day before it all gets dark.Also - there are nasty aliens which are all predators, and apparently no other life (so what do the predators live on before the tasty humans turn up). The aliens only come out to play in the dark, by the way.To top it all off, once it goes dark, the humans have a psychotic criminal, who just happens to be getting transported on their ship. And guess what - he can see in the dark. Now wasn't that lucky.Predictable, poorly acted and the script gave me the impression that the 'actors' were making it up as they went along at times.

I frankly think Dieselwas much better in Fast and Furious than he was in this.But I must say that he alone was the incentive to last as longas I did. As far as the monsters, that go bump in the night,anybody who compares them to those in Alien must be blind anddeaf......I found them interesting but definitely not scary, or maybe you needed to be there to see them in person?

The plot line wont blow you away, but this movie isn't reall all about the plot anyways. The visuals are top notch and the acting is decent enought to pass. The plot itself is predictable as most of your other summer blockbusters, so don't expect a sweeping epic, just a movie that will keep you entertained for a good 2 hours. As for the DVD, there are decent features, but nothing outstanding.

Never the less, rent it and you'll probably enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see, if only for the fx","review":"Sure, the plot is derivative and uneven in spots, but the visual effects used in Pitch Black are quite stunning in spots.

First of all, Vin Diesel is great, he definitely is fun to watch, he has a future in action films. He isn't a big bodied numbskull like Dolph or Van Damme. He has definite charisma and talent. Second, the visual style is fantastic. It completely convinced me that they were on another world. The spectactular eclipse sequence is unforgettable. The sequence is completely distinctive, director David Twohy definitely has a future. The only part of this movie that falters is of course, the plot. It is derivative and all the characters are stereotypes, but that doesn't take away from the fun of the picture. I highly recommend this as a highly stylistic piece of sci-fi filmmaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pitch Black","review":"When the movie first came out in the theaters I payed it no mind. I came upon it while surfing the channels on lazy Saturday afternoon. I am a Sci/Fi fan but for some reason this one didn't grab me...at first. I watched it that day, went out and bought it that evening. I am now a Vin Diesel fan. I do hope in the sequal that they go into more depth where Riddick is concerned. They could go a million ways with him, and Diesel could pull it off. Keep your eye on him, I see a gold statue that bears a resemblance to his profile. Not bad for a poor kid from New York !..."},{"rating":"2","title":"What sci-fi should be...","review":"Say good-bye to space operas, Pitch Black inserts the viewer into a scenario that's all too human. The fine special effects are just a back drop for this gritty thriller -- as it should be. You'll be on the edge of your seat, and you'll never guess what happens next. A must see for any sci-fi buff."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sci-fi blast!","review":"I just saw Pitch Black for the first time and I didn't expect much but I must say that I really liked it. Critics called it a disappointing second film from the director of the Arrival but even though I liked Arrival I think this is a big step above that. Vin Diesel gives the biggest break through performance of the year next to Hugh Jackman's in X-Men. Radha Mitchell and Cole Hauser also give fine performances. Besides having a good cast this movie is also full of a lot of nail biting suspense. It doesn't only come from the aliens that attack when it's dark but from Vin Diesel's character as well because you never know if you can trust him even if he is the hero. Diesel's so good at Riddick that I wouldn't mind seeing him reprise the role sometime. This is a lot better than the other Sci-Fi's of this year like Super Nova and Mission to Mars so check it out"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Straght Lost on Inhospitable Foreign Planet Gritty Genre film","review":"Well acted and put together lost on an inhospitable planet tale.This films longevity is that it is really a prequel of a wider canvas to a sci-fi/fantasy serial also as it is fairly straightforward, and it's depth is as a good Genre serial introduction as much as the film itself.It is more of a straight Genre film than a pulpy film, and while not being really scary it is most enjoyable as a straight Genre watch. It has a tight narrative, which it needs, and explores it's simple premise to the maximum. One of the best aspects of the film is in it's connotations to it's wider galaxy factors, for example when the survivors leave on the spaceship, flying off on a wider voyage of possibilities in tone.- This review is for Directors Cut -"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pitch Black","review":"This is Vin Diesel best movie this is what got him started this was so good that everything else he put out doesnt compare. A little about the movie... a crew is travelling when all of a sudden the captains on the ship are awaken to their space ship falling apart and are forced to land on a mysterious planet where there are creatures that only come out at night and the planet is about to go dark and then mayhem occurs this movie rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Afraid of the dark? You will be...","review":"Whoever said that Sci-Fi is only ever any good with huge budgets and big stars must be eating their hat now.Pitch Black, with a cast of relative unknowns and relatively little money just goes to prove the opposite.This dark, scary \\"bug hunt\\" movie will definitely not leave lovers of the genre wanting anything. Maybe not thought provoking but a great ride nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets Even Better With Repeated Viewings.","review":"When I Saw this film at the Cinemas, I Must Admit.. I was Not Blown Away, A few of the Stupid Lines got Stuck in my head and I felt a bit Disappointed. But after seeing the barrage of Disappointing Sci/fi films that followed this one, (\\"Mission to Mars\\", \\"Red Planet\\", \\"Battlefield Earth\\" and \\"Titan: AE\\") \\"Pitch Black\\" suddenly looked Alot Better, it came out to hire, I hired it, and since then, It's gotten better with every viewing.The Near-Unknown Cast are all Above Average, the Direction is Good, the Pacing is Swift and the Effects are Great. What More could one ask from a Monster Movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pitch Black","review":"Pitch Black [Blu-ray]The shipping of this product was very fastthe film on blueray is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"This movie start well but it gets boring and uninspiring afterward. Overall: Mediocre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitch Black","review":"The special effects were cool, especially with the sky and the planets. Riddick's eyes were cool. The acting was average/poor. The events were too convinient to be taken seriously. For example, they just HAPPENED to crash on the planet when it was going to get dark. And that happened once every 20-some years? It was also convinient that one of the characters could see in the dark. This movie had some good parts. I especially liked how Riddick did that shoulder-out-of-joint trick to get free of that pole. But overall this movie was a waste of time. I recommend this movie to anyone lacking a better imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Art imitating night.","review":"This had all the makings of an interesting project, but ultimately it falls between two stools. Is it an art project, or is it a Hollywood blockbuster?The premise is simple; put Vin Diesel and some other actors in a windowless room, turn out the lights and then film the action. With only your hearing to guide you, two hours of mayhem ensue as Diesel kicks off in a big way when Rahda Mitchell states that \\"The Fast and the Furious\\" was rubbish.However, eventually the noise of screams, breaking glass and even a screeching tyre noise (suggesting to me that some effects have been added in for comic effect) becomes tiresome. Only the hardcore fans of Diesel's gravelly tones will make it through two hours of this.Astonishingly, this video doesn't feature subtitles which is a disgrace.Unimpressive, and a poor addition to the Diesel collection. Leave it alone. Leave it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deport this movie!","review":"If you liked \\"Plan 9 from Outer Space\\", you'll love this movie. Vin Diesel makes Arnold Schwanzegger look like a Shakespearan actor. Except for the blonde, I couldn't understand what most of these actors were saying. This movie never should have left Australia."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst Sci-Fi movies ever","review":"Along with Alien Resurrection and Hardware, this movie is one of the worst sci-fi movies I've ever had to endure. I stopped after 15 minutes. The entire movie is shot like a TV commercial. This may be good for effect for a few scenes but for almost the entire movie -give me a break! And what about the accents! The lead actress is Australian (as is a few other characters) but tries very unconvincingly to portray an American. One or the other thanks -very distracting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a rehash","review":"With all the hype I guess I was expecting something more. When the movie was over I simply felt that I had seen it all before. Wish I had rented it first. Just my own opinion but this movie falls into an ever growing list of movies which rely on special effects alone. The story line is used simply to wrap the special effects in. Don't get me wrong, I love special effects but I think the days when they can carry the movie is over. We need some brains along with our effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Low Budget Sci-Fi thriller","review":"Crash landing on a dry planet, a motley crew of space travellers have to band together and find a way of getting a convicted criminal (Diesel) to use his amazing speed and fighting skills to get them off planet.A very enjoyable prequel to The Chronicles of Riddick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Let me just say Vin rocked in this.Many say its similar to aliens, sure but not all of the movie it like aliens. Go see this for what it is,not to compare it with aliens."},{"rating":"2","title":"best horror film of the year!","review":"pitch black is the best horror/sci-fi film of the year! it combines tragedy, drama, and imense horror.

I came out of the theatre realizing I had wasted my money. My friend came out of the thearre realizing he had to go to the movie of my choice the next time we went out. I will admit I'm not much of a sci-fi fan, but I do have ones I like. This was not one of them.Rent it before you buy it. Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably bad","review":"People actually get PAID to make this stuff?? Bad plot, bad acting, bad directing and utterly abysmal cinematography made this movie go straigt to the top of my list--of the WORST movies of all time. Not even worth the [money] to RENT, much less any price you'd pay to buy it. Too bad [I can't] assign 0 stars, that's still more than this picture deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitch Dull......","review":"This is only the second film I have seen that I considered walking out of.The plot is at best predictable, the characters shallow.

Only good part was the ship crashing down on the planet. THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT -ALIEN-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new to see here!","review":"I bought the Unrated Director's Cut of this film with great anticipation. I loved the theatrical release of Pitch Black. It is one of my favorite science fiction films, hands down.But the Unrated Director's Cut? Is a waste of money. The additions to the film were so few and so subtle, I barely noticed them. The Unrated part? More violence? Not noticeably. More cussing? More bare skin? No, neither of those. And the extras? Are almost non-existent. There's nothing on this DVD that I didn't get on the first one, except some hype about the sequel, and not even that was very convincing. Seriously, if you already own this film on DVD, don't waste your money on this reissue.If you don't own this film on DVD, see if you can find the original release. At least it has the theatrical trailers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It BUY IT","review":"One of the best Vin Diesel movies I think. I love this movie, probably my favorite of its genre. Blu ray makes it even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darkness Rules","review":"As far as Sci-Fis go this is pretty good. It is cetainly better then \\"Chronicles\\" I believe this movie was Vin Diesel's first big break out role and does a good job planning, well a character you'd expect him to play. Definately a movie you should check out and it is worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommendation","review":"For the most part, Pitch Black is your basic sci-fi horror movie. You've got a group of people who want to survive but are forced to learn how to do so by trial and error. It's true to the genre, in my opinion.However, what really makes this film stand out is: 1) it doesn't show us the monsters too clearly too early, 2) the stunning photography during the first half of the film (before nightfall), and 3) fantastic character development.The character development is the most interesting part of the film and I've watched it often just for that. Vin Diesel is spectacular in his role, as is Radha Mitchell and several others. The role reversals and character developments and humor make this film very fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, very cool flic","review":"Turn off your brain and have fun..this is a really slick movie if you give it a chance. I've been waiting for this DVD for quite some time :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Aliens...it is not","review":"I have to be honest, I really wanted to like this film, but I was ultimately disappointed. Vin Diesel was interesting as the anti-hero, but the effects, save for a few scenes, were cheesy and obviously digitally done. This film wanted so badly to be mentioned in the same breath as truly great sci-fi films like 'Aliens,' but in the end doesn't even come close. It actually comes off more like a late night B-movie from the Sci-Fi channel. It's alright for a rental, but I doubt you would find yourself watching it over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good B Movie","review":"This movie is pretty good, but the hard thing for me is that just about the whole movie is very dark. If you like horror combined with Sci-fi, then you probably will like it.A group of people are stranded on a planet. the only way off is to hike accrost this barrin wastland to get to another space camp. unfortunitly, this planet is loaded with flesh eating creatures. The slightest light will keep them away, but stray out of the light, and you are instant dinner for these huge powerfull creatures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pitch Black","review":"I liked the graphics and the special effects.

Lots of action"},{"rating":"1","title":"The special effects were cool...","review":"And that was about it. The first hour was filled with talking about the research team that landed on the planet. When the aliens attacked, they did things that any idiot would never do and they just died. The only character that I actually liked was the one who had the weird eyes (the killer). The creators also didn't put into account that the aliens were hurt by light. Only once did the light bother them, and that one was already dead. The only reason that I gave this 2 stars was because the special effects saved it. The rest was stupid. My suggestion is to never see this movie...ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks Imagination","review":"It might be a good alien rip-off, but why not just watch aliens? The action and special effects are good, but the plot has so many holes... for example, what do these aliens eat over the years when there is sunlight? Pretty massive population of these creatures when there are no other discernable sources of food except for the little glow bugs, who make a surprise appearance when the characters need them most. And the night happens only once every ten years! Why would these types of creatures evolve on a planet where they usually can't hunt? Seems a little forced..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This will make you afraid of the dark...again.","review":"Special effects are excellent! Great actors, and a good story.

I'v been a Vin Diesel fan ever since The Fast and the Furious, and i thank this is a better movie. Vin is the same guy in all of his movies, so if you like vin's other movie's you will like this one.

I saw this film three times in the theater. This film cost about $20 million to make and its better than those expensive hollywood films like Alien Resurection and MIB. David Twohy is the man. I knew this from watching The Arrival. Vin Diesel plays the coolest bad-guy ever. Who can forget those eyes! They story was good, the cinematography was out of this world. Not the mention the rest of the all-star cast. Keith David whom was in Platoon, also the voice of the Spawn character. The cop whom was in Good Will Hunting and Higher Learning. I can't wait to own this film and I'm sure I will watch it on a daily basis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Opportunity","review":"This movie has a great premise: ship crash lands and survivors must face some very ugly and vicious creatures who come out during an eclipse. I must say I had great expectations about it and was quite disappointed. Most of the actors seem to be just going through the motions, never really getting into the story. The most annoying aspect: the escaped convict-hero who spends most of the movie delivering BS one line comments as if it were high philosophy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not Buy this one.","review":"I watched the chronicles of riddick and enjoyed it. I rented pitch black which was the first in the series. I was not impressed. the cussing did nothing to enhance it' it made me wonder if the writer and directr did not have a dictionary to consult. also there was no tie in between pitch black and the chronicles of riddick. in fact pich black made no sence. the chronicles of riddick stands on its own."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one S.U.C.K.S.","review":"I lost track of the movie when they crashed on the planet. Stopped watching after this, because of one main thing:Extremely bad acting.I don't think I have seen worse acting in a movie. So I couldn't bare to watch it any longer, because I felt I was in the middle of a movie where they actually paid for everything except for the actors.I know this review isn't as throughout as all the other ones here, but there is no more to say about this movie. I recommend this movie to nobody, it just is pure garbage, and can only be unmatched in a garbage pile. Why any people would achieve at giving this movie 5 stars, is beyond my world, in what I call movie quality.

Most of the actors are new,but pretty darn good.The effects are wonderful and the story IS good. (despite what others may have said). It is a story SIMILAR to Aliens...but they are totally unaware of what is on the planet with them. They have a few \\"obsticles\\" (haha) on their mission in repairing the ship. I have to tell you my favorite part is where that good looking guy with the shades does this cool thing (don't want to give it away) by staring the \\"thing\\" snap-dab in the face it is really cool.I would say more about the \\"scene\\" but I would give something important away. It's good!

From a technical point of view, Pitch Black has many original ideas to pull it away from the cheap slasher type. Sometimes it seems kind of hard to catch up, for it is somewhat bumpy in storytelling but not full of mistakes. The quick cuts to different scenes make the film quite short-wave. Action is always an difficult element and though it's not the quintessence of the movie, it's perfectly realized and even comes up with a few surprises. Visually the movie is just great, the difference between day and day, the black night and Tatopoulos' beautiful creatures ensure great popcorn entertainment. The great DTS Surround Sound creates a fantastic atmosphere, especialy at the planets night. One last thing, Vin Diesel ist absolutely great."},{"rating":"2","title":"VISUALS","review":"I saw this 4 times in the theater. Its such a cool sci fi flick. Aliens is my #1 movie of all time and nothing can compete with it...but this one comes pretty damn close.Put everything in the movie aside for a second and just notice the visuals. Not necessarily the special effects, but the visuals. I just remember how the desert scenes had all the highlights blown out, it was so blaring and bright in the theater....with a yellow tinge. And then cyan later...it was like some kind of film experiment it seemed like. Its so incredible. Ive never seen anything like it before.The crash scene in the beginning is increible too. Very intense and realistic. I felt like i was crashing with them. Theres subtle things to it. I remember the camera going from the girl's eye to the crash, and back again....and the sound drops out....and hits you again...and drops out. Very very intense."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sci-Fi movie of the Century","review":"I think the movie was great.It was full of action.Ladies this is a movie you'll like.Having two great lookings guys in it.Vin Diesel who plays the character of Richard B.

If you're looking for a thorough explanation of mythic characters, this is not the book for you. This is a dictionary, a handy guide for when you want to refresh your memory on an archaic reference. What it lacks in depth in makes up for in scope however; I was happily surprised at how many cultures were represented in the collection. In leafing through, you may find a character or story that sparks you to investigate further. A pleasant, but again rather narrow, addition are the thematic cross-cultural mythic references (creation, death, etc.) each discussed for a page or two throughout the book.

It combines stories of how service leaders in different industries actually do it, along with analysis of what works and why. I happen to like stories that give me a glimpse into how successful operations work, but I'm tired to nice stories that can't be translated into action for other companies. One nice thing about this book is that the combination of stories plus the author's insights gives you the inspiration to push for self-improvement along with an understanding of how you can do it, not just how someone else did it.I've read dozens of service quality books, including a couple by the same author, and although I was hesitant about reading yet another one, the time was well worth it.

It is crammed with wonderful examples of how the dozen or so companies studied make service a delight for both employees and customers alike. Berry's knowledge of the subject also shines throughout the text, with matter-of-fact statements that reveal deeper philosophical insights, such as \\"The hard truth is: selfish companies cannot compete\\", or \\"Most great service companies are high touch and high tech, not one or the other\\". Overall, this book deserves to be studied not only by service practitioners, but by the highest levels of corporate management. It opens gateways to social and community service approaches that revisit and surpass the era of corporate paternalism. While acknowledging the power of contemporary shareowners in public companies, Berry, like Robert Monks, envisions greater emphasis on long-term ownership, rather than purely short-term profit-driven strategies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid summary of Basics of Customer Service","review":"\\"Excellent customer service\\" is a the frequent promise, which is SELDOM achieved.

Naturally, due the weight of this item, the free shipping offer was a fantastic promotion. Unfortunately, shortly after ordering, I was notified that ABC was \\"out of stock\\" and, therefore, my order was cancelled. Now . . . perhaps I am being inordinately suspicious but I suspect the order was cancelled due to ABC's unwillingness to honor promotion.

The little annoying boy could never be understood at all, and the chick seemed to be that same way a lot of the time. Then, that stupid native guy came along and brought a bunch of naked tribe members along. That made no sense. Next came half an hour of pointlessness. For half an hour, the chick skinny-dipped, the native Australian guy went hunting, and the little annoying boy was a pain. And another stupid thing- why did they have a weather baloon launch? It made no sense with a weather balloon being launched in the middle of a movie about people surviving in the Australian outback with some native wearing a thong. Oh- why did they show so many closeups of that guy's thong?

I read the book for 7th grade English, and it is very beautiful and moving. It gives information about Australian plantlife and about the Aboriginals. Sadly, the movie is very different, and it is very untrue to the book. Some examples of the mistakes: 1. In the book, the kids are from South Carolina, but in the movie, they are from Australia. 2. In the book, they are in a plane crash. (In the movie, the father tries to kill the kids, burns the car, and then shoots himself.) 3.The girl is supposed to be 13 and the boy is supposed to be 8. In the movie, the boy acts like he's 3!!! 4.Although I can see why they would do this, the boy isn't supposed to be wearing a loincloth. He is supposed to be naked!!!

Yet at it's core I think the film is still effective today because it is so enigmatic-Peter Roeg's direction glides across oppressive landscapes and the characters appear to mumble rather than pronounce. The breakdown of communication is crucial to the accumulation of incommensurable elements. In the end, there is no contact, and everyone is in some sense broken. A fine achievement with many resonances today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contemplative Prayer: Not a Gimmick But a Grace","review":"Thomas Merton's thoughtful work on Contemplative Prayer is worthy of careful contemplation by Christians of all traditions. The chapters are brief as is the book but it contains many powerful ideas. Merton is careful to not separate contemplation from either corporate worship or service. He will have none of the false dichotomy of \\"spiritual\\" life and \\"earthly\\" life. He also avoids pointing to contemplation as a gimmick or a method for true spirituality. The highlight of the book for me came on page 112. There Merton writes, \\"Prayer does not blind us to the world, but it transforms our vision of the world, and makes us see it, all men and all the history of mankind, in the light of God.\\"I come from a different Christian tradition than Thomas Merton, but I value his insights as I seek to walk the sometimes fearful, sometimes exhilirating, sometimes inscrutable path of prayer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed my life","review":"This book goes on my shelf with the top books I've ever read.

Thomas Merton mentions his associations with Zen Buddhists and has written other books about Zen. Because I see this form of prayer creeping into the Christian church, I wanted to learn more about it, to warn others who may be deceived by Rick Warren and the Emerging Church movement that is changing the simplicity of the Gospel of Christ and recommending New Age techniques. Thomas Merton tells you how to empty your mind (meditate), but he also warns of the dangers of this and that some have had mental breakdowns while meditating. This is the last days apostasy that is mentioned in 2 Thessalonians 2:3."},{"rating":"2","title":"A guide book for sailors","review":"Reading this book made me realize how much I have in common with the sailors of old in our illustrious Navy. We all hate general quarters. This book is a good read for anyone looking for a more indepth look at what naval life was/is like. Underways are long, port visits are short ( and more restricted than ever), and you never feel at home no matter where you go. Naval life is great but it isn't a adventurous as some writers tend to make it appear. To have adventures you must go it alone or pick a liberty buddy with similar ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Questionable Authority","review":"If you find yourself in a position where the individuals in authority over you are, in the actual state of affairs, your moral inferiors, then on this level alone you will be able to appreciate this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"White-Jacket","review":"I feel quite strange presuming to give a numerical rating to a book by one of American literature's greatest authors.It's important for readers to realize that White-Jacket is not what would, in the modern day, be considered a novel. There is essentially no plot structure. It's a melange of events, descriptive passages and polemic, narrated by the eponymous White-Jacket, whom I suspect of being Melville himself. At times the book is entertainingly humorous - as when the narrator tries to get rid of his famous jacket. And much of the description of life aboard a man-of-war is fascinating -- the book would make a helpful companion for people reading modern novels such as O'Brian's series. (And, of course, White-Jacket probably was one of the sources used by O'Brian and other aquatic novelists.) The polemic -- Melville's rants against flogging and his pacifist pleas -- I found tiresome, as I always find polemic, regardless of its aims."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take it with you all over the world","review":"My parents like Willie Nelson, and so I was never a big fan. I bought this for them and ended up buying one for myself. This is one of the best CDs I've ever heard, and one of my all time favorites. In its entirity it is a wonderful collection of music, moving you from heartbreak and pain, to heartbreak and laughter, and once or twice just to joy at the music and lyrics. Some of the tracks are great pieces like, \\"I Never Cared For You\\" which makes you stop and appreciate word play and lyrics. Willie Nelson might be wonderful on his own in, but Emmylou Harris makes this album great. Her singing possesses the tracks she sings in, and it is her accompaniment which gives this album its tortured (but in a good way) soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under Your Skin","review":"Teatro doesn't just get to you... it crawls under your skin and wraps around your heart until you find yourself singing the lyrics and even orchestrating guitar licks and drum beats as you go to sleep at night.

Nelson's guitar remains one the most lethal weapons in all of music's arsenal. The vocals on both this album and the recently released \\"Me and the Drummer\\" have a rougher and more rustic edge with a lower pitch adding another quality to the classic Nelson sound. The backing unit does a great job with Harris's backing vocals and Mickey Raphael's harmonica standing out. There's not much better than hearing Willie, Mickey, and family doing this stuff live in Austin, Texas on a Saturday night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Duet of Willie and Emma Lou","review":"Nice listening CD.

I knew of Teatro's critical acclaim, I like a lot of Lanois' other work, and was expecting to be impressed. Some of the songwriting is lukewarm compared to his classics, but Willie and his guitar work are as fine as ever, and Emmylou Harris' backup is a perfect fit. But those drums-- a crime! They are pushed absurdly too far forward in the mix, insisting \\"hey listen to me! ME!\\" Considering how soulless they are, why are they allowed to dominate? Especially the cymbals are literally nonstop and repetitive, and drove me nuts. I went from primed for a good listening session to drop-jawed disbelief.This is my first review ever, and it's too bad that it took such a disappointment! Dig through some of Willie's back catalog, where he is backed far better, before buying Teatro."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Alive!

Plus, you can clearly see the bolt through Willie's neck on the back cover shot (not really)."},{"rating":"1","title":"not Willie, a replay of old stuff, packaged differently,","review":"Emmy Lou is miscast, never a backup, she and Willie do no meld. Willie should stop being the star and let others do their thing. Playing the guitar is one thing , playing it well is another.Stop with all the retros of old songs, just a way to make money. Better look at Lyle Lovett, he is playing, and Writing good Texas music, Being an ICON means you have to maintain a level , this album appears to be commercial, not musically new or inventive.

He's got skills galore, and speaks to the heart and soul. if you know patsy cline's \\"crazy\\" you know what i'm sayin. and His lounge blues jazz skills are equally impressive, I swear he reminds me of Nat.Teamed up with Lanois whos like the mack roots producer. whos produced the nevel brothers and knows how to tweak a beat out with atmospherics slammin boom bap production.it's something for the mind and the body.

What a treat...I was a Willie fan years ago, moved on from country, to find Willie also going in a different direction.

It appears to be merely a superficial compilation of newspaper articles from the past several years.In addition, the authors are annoyingly \\"policically correct\\" in their use of grammer and in the first paragraph of page 383, they clearly show their anti-gun bias.Also, in the section on sexual harrassment, the authors omit two necessary items:1. That sexual harrassment can only occur between individuals that work for the same company (this is mentioned nowhere), and 2. What compensation would be due to a MAN that had been unfairly accused (and perhaps disciplined or fired)of sexual harrassment. The authors, in their politically correct manner, go into depth on what would be due a WOMAN that had been sexually harassed.I was on the Amtrak on the way to work when I finished this book. ....

I also liked Ralph Bellamy, Arthur Treacher, and Ruth Tobey. The film has it's cute moments although the plot is thin.

Instead of treating great figures as saints or unapproachable geniuses Hofstadter gives a realistic picture of what they believed and what they stood for. More than that he points to the philosophic and cultural continuity that these figures embodied, struggled with, and sometimes redefined. It's as much about how the greater American view on work and indivdualism evolved from the founding as about the men who made it. Also, kind of inadvertantly, the author weaves in a history of the American liberal idea and how Jeffersonian liberalism stressing free markets, small business, and individualism, was transformed into New Deal liberalism. He argues that the transformation wasn't a betrayal but was instead a development based on necessary responses to an economically and socially changing world.

Unfortunately the rotating bezel did not work at all -- the numbers are there but it does not rotate at all. This was one of the reasons I bought this model.When it arrived, I started to set the time, alarm, etc. The buttons were slow to respond and then it started beeping continuously (like a loud alarm) and none of the buttons worked at all. I could not get it to stop making noise and it did so for almost an hour.Eventually it stopped making noise and seemed to begin working properly again.

(please pardon the awful Elizabeth Barret Browning misquote) To begin with, on the pianist, Robert Casadesus, other than Ravel himself, he is the premier interpreter of his work. Not only that, he was also a close friend and one of the few present at Ravel's meager funeral.On the recordings themselves, they are of a superlative quality. What many interpreters today try to do is make a melodrama of everything. They forget that the composer himself drew inspiration from the machines of the time (his father was an engineer) and thus lose some of the forcefulness and directness of the works. Unfortunately, many today try to drown them in fluff and emotion.Another added benefit of these recordings is the convenience of having them all in one set, digitally remastered of course.

I would definitely recommend this if you're not looking for too much meaning in a book. it's one of the most fun reads i've had in a long time, and it only took me one night, so if you're strapped for time, you've got a winner. however, i can't write this review without stating that Tristan Egolf's first book is the finest piece of literature i've ever had the pleasure of reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"yak and prattle","review":"Tristan Egolf's Lord of The Barnyard was what modern lit badly needed someone not obsessed with overly perfect prose and crystal clear simple sentences. I worried the follow up would be a disappointment. Skirt in The Fiddle is a fun swift read with a main character-Charlie who is duped into accepting a gig playing for a band called Volstagg defined by Egolf as \\"corporate-Satanic Limburger metal\\" and abandons his violin playing ending up in a flophouse. He also ends up bagging rats through the sewers for money-he is paid by the rat just an example of the way Egolf finds the oddball in the oridinary. Another example of Egolf's prose is a line on page 55 \\"watching him yak and prattle\\" this is what I enjoyed about Egolf's writing these fun sentences and clever witty prose not just dry and informative language. This a nice comical romp."},{"rating":"1","title":"He must have wrote this over a long weekend.","review":"I loved Lord of the Barnyard. This was not good, plain and simple. The chapters didn't connect with each other, therefore a coherent story was never formed. Another problem is that you never really care about the characters. The chapters are such \\"skits\\" that they never seem remotely real or compelling. Finally, there is zero follow-through in anything that occurs. Everything is what it is with no resonance or greater importance. I'm guessing his next book will be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cool Brazilian funk/soul album","review":"This 1969 album, originally released on Odeon Records, is one of the better Brazilian funk albums of its time. Eduardo Araujo started his career as a teenybopper rocker, and later went psychedelic and then mainstream pop. In between, he recorded this soul-drenched set, which features several songs by '70s funk star Tim Maia. Maia also wrote Brazified arrangements for North American soul songs by Arthur Conley and Smokey Robinson... Okay, it's not P-Funk or anything, but by Brazilian standards, this was pretty smokin'. Worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funky, Finnish & Fresh!!!","review":"Don't expect the usual warped techno of the Warp label, but instead this Finn churns out some unique, homemade funk and soul on Intervision. Wiping Out is particularily groovy with it's vocoded vocals and jazzy sounds. Jimi might fancy himself a Scandinavian Barry White on tracks like Downtown and a Nordic Marvin Gaye on Can't Stay With You Baby. Top marks for the swingin' instrumentation and imagination put into this one man show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing.","review":"This cd has some great movie themes but the performances are lousy.

I know people who have contracted work to the author's BREW software company. The company described many technical limitations of BREW, which were later proved simply not true. The company's programmers simply did not understand BREW. This book continues in that tradition.You are better off sticking with Qualcomm's SDK docs, which are skimpy but more correct and concise than this book.

I was about a third of the way through when I realized it was a different author. No matter - I was enjoying this story so much that I kept on reading, finishing the book in a day. This is the type of sci fi I like - more of a social cultural look at our future rather than dependance on hardware, with many themes that we are still tackling today. Fast paced story, well written, with interesting characters and dilemmas. Now I want to search for more of this writer's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too contrived and plot lines thin","review":"Ship of fools is very readable but I found it rather lacking in the plotting. The author wanted to set up a sense of dread and fear but did so at the cost of any depth. Characters tend to be paper thin and there is not enough background to explain any of their actions. Too much historical background is left unknown never allowing the reader to connect with the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dishonest book","review":"Do not let the excellent wtiting and character development fool you. This is a book that truly underestimates its audience. During the whole book, there are questions, mysteries, and plot that are never resolved. Instead, we are left to think that not all questions are answered in life and to enjoy a sense of mystery.The problem is that what is left unresolved is not trivial, but quite major and essential. So, I truly think that the author developed the questions, plot twists, and other unknown facts WITHOUT EVER INTENDING RESOLVE THEM.Instead, he opted to satisfy his readers with a movie ending.So, I repeat: the author himself does not know what motivated the aliens, the reasons for the preponderance of the Church, the history of the humans, or anything that he teased us with.He never intended to answer these questions, so he did not bother to answer them in writing or even in his own mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling","review":"The premise seemed good. The cover looked promising. However, this was one of the worst books I've read in years. I was shocked. It read like a direct-to-video movie. The characterization was unrealistic. Individual character traits, such as the deformities of the main character, were never explained nor added anything to the deapth of the character. There was absolutely NO explination for why the aliens would perform such savage acts on humans, why the humans let them do it, or how they went about performing said acts. There is likewise no explination of how the survivors plan on dealing with the consequences. The history of the ship is hinted at but never explored in any deapth. All in all, the book offers much promise, but delivers about as much as the average Schwarzenegger movie. I would not reccomend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent writer - surprisingly incomplete book","review":"Pros:1) Russo is an excellent writer and very easy to read.2) He develops characters well3) He describes settings well4) He initiates a number of interesting conceptsCons:1) Ridiculously incomplete2) Virtually every important concept and event introduced was left underdeveloped and unexplainedBottom Line:If I had Russo's talent for writing, I'd be embarrassed to release such an incomplete work. Even if a sequel is on its way, this book left me feeling cheated. If he was a poor writer I could have dismissed the book shortly after picking it up, but because he has such obvious talent it was unexpected that he would fail to complete the many interesting concepts introduced."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great and Very Dark Sci-Fi Tale.....","review":"A very dark story populated with fascinating, multi-dimensional characters.\\"Ship of Fools\\" is told from the perspective of the first officer of a giant generational star ship.

Russo crafts a believable 'generation ship' and then dives into the machinations of different political and religious factions on board. The story is told from the perspective of an unusual protagonist, which serves to highlight the tension and claustrophobia, especially once they make planetfall. The encounter with the alien ship is very well handled and original. Overall this book is a great read. Once I got into it, I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"fooled by the ship of fools","review":"I was fooled by the \\"ship of fools\\". I must say this is one of the weirdest books i've read, not because it has strange ideas - it hasn't - and not because of the plot - it doesn't exist - but because I've finished reading it and I asked myself what? What did Mr. Russo want to say? and if indeed want he did - where did it go wrong? The book is very readable, you can read it cover to cover in a couple of hours, but in the end, I'm sure you would wonder yourself: why? Reading it through I feel like opening layer after layer of gift-wrappings, only to discover there's no present inside. Very very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"execrable","review":"Intensely unsatisfying, Ship of Fools reads at it's most reductive level as a scattershot elision of Aliens and Event Horizon. You could call it plagiarism if it didn't plainly reek of creative bankruptcy. The theological investigations alluring to so many previous reviewers are pedantic, obvious, and naive. I'd label this a Christian attempt at scifi if I didn't hesitate to lambaste other far more insightful works with Russo's hackjob.

This is definitely the kind of sci-fi novel that will not let you set it down until you finish it. There is very little monotony, it kept me turning every page with more and more anticipation and relentless curiosity. I absolutely loved the idea of a gigantic ship that has been the home of humans for so many hundreds of years that some even believe the ship has always existed.The ending is very un-hollywood which is a good thing, a little inconclusive and leaves the reader hoping for a sequel. Nevertheless, this book won't let you set it down! Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something...?","review":"Reading Russo's \\"Ship of Fools\\" is one of the most regrettable reading experiences I've had in years. This book reads like a novelization of some deservedly straight-to-video \\"Aliens\\" knock-off. The author tries to spook us, and subscribes heavily to the \\"what you don't see is scarier than what you do\\" school of the macabre.Unfortunately, Russo winds up showing the readers nothing of interest or originality, leaving us stranded aboard the dingy corridors of his fanciful generation ark hoping against hope that something interesting will happen.Be afraid.

Indeed, that's why it was originally crafted, for students to learn French with ease. Since then, it has become a representative piece of French art. Written at a time when totalitarianism was still a dominant anti-U.S. force, Le Petit Prince is chilling at points despite its optimistic, airy, childlike prose. Don't be fooled. This book is far from childish despite the characters, for, behind it all, each character le petit prince encounters is a representative of a different facet of human nature, often not for the good.I have not read the book in English, yet I would strongly urge you to read this in French if you can. It is not a difficult read. The fact that I have been asked to read this book for high school French, intermediate college French, and advanced French studies, as have many, is a testament to its enduring legacy and the fact that it has touched many a reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"c'est bon","review":"I am just learning French.

Seven Drones is a great piece, but it uses anything but dronish effects! The moods move very well in this piece. Some of the most satisfying pieces are Bjorn Free and Soul Fate, which are mellow is contrast to the other pieces. This music has a familiarity similar to Soft Machine from the early seventies.

If you are a rock fan you should buy it, but if you are a metal fan, you maybe disapointed. Where is the heavy guitar vibe metallica once had in the past?? It is missed on this DVD. The guitars are recorded with low volume and there is no punch. Tired of wah-wah solos by hammet and what about the bass of jason??? simply terrible. I think that maybe not the production's fault but it was recordable at metallica's worst period (during load and reload releases). If you see the perfomance of \\"one\\" you will be throwing up...

I would have never of guessed in 1988 that ten years later Metallica would be lamer than Def Leppard without Steve Clarke.

I can't count how many times Lars hit the drums and the sound comes a second later. Kirk and James seems to be playing a different song than the one coming out if my speakers... Away from that, this DVD was the best thing I've ever bought. Jaymz, Kirk, Jazn and Lars really kicks Fort Worths a**! Lars seems like he has been playing them drums since he was born.

Most of the renditions on this video are lackluster and butchered. And what the is the deal with them only play two and a half minutes of \\"Master of Puppets\\". The band does do better on the second have of the show, but 50%, even 60% effort is unacceptable, especially for a video.Pros: The second half of the show is much better than the first. It is still Metallica live.Cons: They sure did choke or something because some of the songs are brutal and almost painful to watch.Final Thoughts: Save your money and buy \\"Live Sh*t Binge and Purge\\" or \\"Cliff 'Em All\\", both of which feature far better performances unless you need to have all of Metallica's videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another killer live DVD set from Metallica!!!!!","review":"\\"CUNNING STUNTS\\" was the first concert video filmed with the DVD format in mind, and it looks that way, too: great sound and picture, alternate camera angles and loads of special features.

Other than that, a killer concert from Metallica!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever Stunts","review":"This dvd is one of the easiest to use. The concert its self is just amazing.

Pandering to the crowd, playing with the lights on for the first few songs, asking if the crowd wants \\"heavy\\". Give me a break. Metallica never needed to do anything but go up on stage and crank the stuff out, so why they resorted to these tactics I don't know. Other than they are playing to the cameras, which every band does, but this is a little out of character. I don't understand the glowing reviews here. I frankly feel the audience got shortchanged and didn't experience a true Metalli-show where it's all black, all music, all fist pumping, all the time. And the stupid camera-angle-change feature of my DVD didn't work. More marketing to the masses I suppose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metallica rules...leave Napster alone.","review":"Great DVD by a band of millionares. Seriously, great production and sound.

New video technology, excellent sound, etc. were all reasons to buy this. The quality of this video is exceptional. Great camera work, sound, lighting. It was all great. But Metallica has lost the edge they used to have. Hearing James Hetfield straining on vocals, I couldn't sit through this video. Although the musicianship is still top-notch, they sound to me like a very tired band. The newer material is also not my cup of tea and to have only a medley of the killer old stuff, it just didn't do it for me. I own almost everything Metallica ever put out, cd's and videos, but had to draw the line on Re-Load. I may pick it up at a second-hand cd store sometime. Kirk Hammett remains the best guitarist in the world as does Lars Ulrich on drums. Diehard Metallica fans-buy this DVD. Those old timers-spend your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for the money","review":"We were really expecting a piece of junk, but pleasantly surprised by this item. It works well, especially the detector. It spins a little slow and in daylight you can forget about seeing the laser light (but it does come with the detector, so it's not a big deal.) Also it's a little bit of a pain to use it for corners, you have to mount it on it's side. HOWEVER for a squaring laser, you can't get anything near this price and it did the job it was bought for, so we are happy with it and would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edited for Content","review":"I started to watch the film and the first thing I saw was a disclaimer that the DVD had been edited for content, and I stopped right there. A couple of Amazon reviewers mention this too. I found more information about it on IMBD, at [...]. Apparently, there is a legal issue involved, which does not affect the story, but required the removal of a dead actor's name. So don't let it throw you like it threw me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wondering Boys ?","review":"My initial reaction after watching this movie was \\"Huh?\\" This movie has very little in the way of a followable plot-line.

Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK also - terrible story line, miserable acting","review":"Half way thru we turned it off - and that's very rare for us. Of course, we rarely get suckered into watching such a bad film."},{"rating":"1","title":"FLACCID FUN","review":"Critically acclaimed at its time of release, I can't find myself jumping on the bandwagon for this one. WONDER BOYS features some really good performances from Michael Douglas as a washed out professor whose tribulations on a certain weekend would be more than enough to vanquish any male; Frances McDormand as the college chancellor and lover--and wife of his boss (a subdued and underused Richard Thomas); Tobey Maguire as a rather glum young wannabe writer with worlds of talent; Robert Downey Jr. as a homosexual editor who sets his sights on Maguire; and even Katie Holmes as one of Douglas' students who offers him solace. The whole thing is so laid back, though, and its points of conflict seemingly forced that I couldn't get involved in spite of the acting. WONDER BOYS just didn't fill me with any kind of wonder at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even Waterworld wasn't that bad!!!","review":"I rented this movie because of the cast which included the Michael Douglas, Frances McDormand, Tobey Maguire and Robert Downey JR. I am surprised today that all these famous (some award winners!) agreed to have their name attached to this movie. Problems with the movie are: 1- the characters are not likeable or dislikable enough for the viewer to care. 2- The story line does not make any sense. You follow these guys aimlessly plotting their way through nonsense!! 3- The actors looked like they did not care of how the movie would come out. I haven't seen bad acting like this in years. No wonder I never heard of this movie while it was in theatres!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The music is great, and I love Robert Downey, Jr., but .....","review":"I rented this movie because I have the CD and the music is great!

I just might have to buy this one to keep!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad","review":"This was a bad film. It's clear why the film didn't receive more notice from the Academy Awards. All it has going for it is a talented cast, and the ridiculous script irritates much more than entertains. The characters motivations are always questionable, although Michael Douglas is consistently likable. All in all, I think you'll find this movie is not as good as you thought it would be."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of a good cast.","review":"This movie has the makings of something special - good actors, interesting plot, but the way it was made just makes it boring. I ended up not caring about any of the characters which is fine because nothing really happens to any of them. A resolution to one problem at the end was nice, but otherwise this movie was a tease of what it should have been. Don't blink or you might miss the adorable Katie Holmes."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU MUST BE JOKING","review":"Anyone who said that Tobey MAcGuire acting in this movie was great must be joking !! He's atrocious here, ruining the whole picture. Anyway, we don't care at all at the characters of this movie, so shallow they are. It never explains the trouble with James Leer's (MacGuire ) parents, nor why he is a future gay, only waiting for some smart gay ( Downey's character ) to seduce him and lead him to the \\"EVIL WAYS\\" ... The appearance of Vernon is a shameful attempt to twist the plot in a comical way, but it fails miserably. All in all, Hanson dropped the ball here. I agree the movie is different from Hollywood clichs, and this is good. Douglas performance is outstanding. Along the middle, the movie already made the audinece lose all attention on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!!!","review":"I have heard how wonderful Wonder Boys is and how it has been unjustly ignored by the Oscar voters this year. So I rented it and have to say that there really isn't anything special here. In fact, I ended up watching it in three different sessions as I fell asleep during the first two portions that I watched. That says something on its own.I think that Curtis Hanson was trying to make an intellectual slapstick comedy when he made Wonder Boys. But that combination just doesn't work here as the disasters faced by the main characters aren't very funny. I thought that the only performance worth talking about was that of Poe, the blind dog who meets an unfortunate end. With a great cast of actors who I have enjoyed in other flicks, it just didn't do it for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiderman, Iron Man and Batman's Girlfriend All In One Movie","review":"Okay, a little deceiving title to my review since this movie has nothing to do with superheros. In fact, this movie is more about the anti-hero with its flawed, but endearing characters. I really love to watch top-notch actors (multiple Academy Award nominations) given quirky characters that allow them to stretch and become much different personalities than what they've often portrayed in other movies. I recommend this movie for people who appreciate dark comedies with interesting and lovable loser characters that by the end of the movie you'll be hoping wind up a little better situated than they were at the start."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I... am a writer!\\"","review":"Man, I hated that guy the second he got to the podium and said that!A friend of mine lent me his copy of \\"Wonder Boys\\" a few years back. This is the book, mind you. I loved the book, so I was interested in seeing the movie when it came out... but I never did. I actually had to borrow the DVD from the same guy who lent me the book in the first place!I was worried that the movie would really deviate from the book and try to sensationalize the murders (the dog... the snake). However, though the snake was omitted, they did not. In fact, aside from the whole story with the auto and the trip up north to his in-laws' house, the movie is pretty accurate to the book. I like how the movie was paced as well. Despite all the zannyness of the book, the film and the actions of the actors came off to me as realistic.Also, I'm glad they shot on location in Pittsburgh. I would hate to see a movie about Pittsburgh (where I'm living now) and it be filmed in Toronto or Indianapolis..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonder Boys","review":"This has turned out to be one of my favorite films of all time. Every single main character is memorable, as well are the supporting characters.I am a Michael Douglas fan, and I believe that this is his best role. I could not imagine anyone else playing Grady Tripp; same goes for Tobey Maguire as James Leer. Robert Downey, Jr. IS Crabtree.Much of the humor is subtle and not overly obvious, not is it humorous to the characters in the situation.This is one of the types of films that has it all: great characters, great story, great acting, great cinematography, great directing, and great music (which, by the way, fits in perfectly with each scene-- look at the scenes specifically with the Neil Young and Leonard Cohen songs).This is definitely one of the best films that's come out of the past decade, and I'm sure it'll remain a favorite for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really dull","review":"I love the actors in this movie and was very excited to watch it. Unfortunately I found the plot dull. Maybe it was too \\"deep\\" for me. I thought the Michael Douglas Katie Holms student teacher thing would be more of a factor... but it was mostly about the Michael Douglas character (a successful writer who's teaching at a school and hasn't published a book in a long time) trying to help a very dark student writer (Tobey McGuire) who is very manipulative... Michael Douglas's publisher (Robert downey) shows up and is somewhat entertaining... but the relationships between the characters were just too odd for me to relate to. All the characters had such severe character flaws that they were just depressing to watch... there was no hero or heroine or any character I could remotely relate to. An aspiring writer might like this movie, but it was too strange for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonder boys","review":"GOOD QUALITY DVD.I HAD OWNED IT ON VHS AND BOUGHT IT AGAIN ON DVD.RECEIVED IT IN QUICKLY AND WAS REASONABLY PRICED."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and entertaining.","review":"This is my favorite Michael Douglas film, based on a novel, great script, funny, and delightful romp through a day in the life of a popular college professor who has writer's block.

The actors and director must have been under some contractual obligation, for not since Steve Miller's ''Hearts Like a Wheel'' album of the late 70's has anything so horrible been released. To be fair, Frances McDormand was good. Robert Downey, Jr.'s camped-up, bug-eyed character was a little over the top, but his acting was at least on par with that of the baby McDormand carried in the final scene. Smarmy Tobey Maquire ruins every movie he's in. The only way this video will be worth the purchase price is if you open it and find instead ''Gladiator''."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad","review":"Go see this movie if you need a good two-hour nap.This is the most boring movie I have ever paid money to see. I cannot believe that anyone liked this flick. The story was terrible, the characters were not likeable, and Robert Downey's character molests Toby Maguire. Does this sound like your type of movie? If so, then you sound watch this movie.However, if you aren't homosexual or into child molestation, I recommend not touching this movie with a 10-foot pole."},{"rating":"1","title":"As Bad as it Gets","review":"You know a film is bad when you can't wait for it to end, and that's exactly what was happening as I watched Wonder Boys. Yes, it has a superb cast, but that's the only high point. The rest of the movie was a mash of horrible plots, bad scripting, and redundant scenery. Maybe my expectations for this movie were too high. Maybe after hearing how great this film was, I had expectations that the film could never meet. I'm not sure why I hated this movie so much, other than it moved me only to boredom. It lacked inspiration, it lacked hope, it lacked the reasons why I watch films in the first place. Maybe it's just me, but my recomendation is to avoid this film, unless you enjoy being uninspired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pulp","review":"Shallow and contrived. Like it was made with a formula.Stories about writers, especially writers with writer's-block, should be outlawed - First Amendment rights or not.

Tobey Maguire doesn't convince me that he is a genius underneath a loser exterior. And the absurd plot and weak relationships give the audience 120 minutes with no where to go.It is all a shame. This movie bombed for good reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK!!!","review":"Michael Douglas plays a writer/professor with a major case ofwriters block. His wife has left him.

His gaypublisher (Robert Downey Jr.) is in town sniffing around trying to find outwhen the next book is coming out. One of his students has latched onto himbut the student has his own problems that Douglas is having problems dealingwith.I really am not certain what the point of this movie is. My wifeexplained it had to do with Douglas coming to terms with his inner demonsand getting his life back on track.

After listening to Michael Douglas drone on for just over an hour I had had enough.What is the meaning of this?, why should I care? This was the first film I have ever turned off. I cannot find anything good to say so I'll keep it short,STAY AWAY. I was lucky I had also rented the Sopranos series 2, you might not be so lucky. Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, funny film","review":"This has probably been said of every performer in nearly every movie they ever made, but, seriously, this is probably Michael Douglas's best performance to date. Yes, yes, Traffic and Wall Street are each close seconds. Toby Maguire departs from his usual, likeable, huggable kind of character in favor of a likeable but oddball kinda guy. Katie Holmes is better than her personal average in her role. Frances McDormand is about on par with her other roles (which is rather good). If you like strong plot elements, this movie will probably disappoint you. There are a few things that get started early on, but they're mainly just excuses for the characters to interact. I love this kind of character-driven movie, so I think it's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonder Boys","review":"Grady Tripp is a professor/writer living in Pittsburgh who is struggling with writer's block. Whilst doing this, he also manages to get the chancellor pregnant. In the meantime, he and a college student, James Leer are trying to find a rare jacket once owned by Marilyn Monroe, and a college girl, Hannah Green boarding with Grady has a bit of a crush on him. \`The Wonder Boys'. this character is not a stereotypical teacher but a fantastically original creation emphasized by Douglas winning performance. The acting is flawless, with at least two superb supporting roles. Robert Downey jr sparkles in his role, but it is Tobey Maguire who makes you feel he has always been that awkward, deadpan student that is James Leer. Fresh, funny and entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Funny Quirky Movie","review":"This movie shines of a couple of levels primarily, strong performances and a good script.

In it we follow Tripp, who seems to be permanently unlucky, who gets himself into endless amounts of trouble along with dark student James and his editor Crabtree. What really makes the film so compelling is its outstanding performances, particularly from Maguire and McDormand. Also impressive is the way in which the film itself is narrated by Douglas, making the whole thing seem like a real novel. Of course at the end that's precisely what it is, and that explains why all the ends are so neatly tied up at the end. You'll like this film, but you won't know why."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Wonder Boy to Spider-Man","review":"Okay...so the headline IS a little far-fetched, but I happen to believe that one could make a 2 hr movie, solely focusing on Tobey Maguire's face and its expressions, without anyone losing interest....that boy is TRULY a talent!! That being said, this whole movie shines. All of the actors are, of course, great - especially Tobey and Frances McDormand - and the plot is...well, just fantastic. Rarely, if ever, have I seen a movie that so subtly changes moods in one scene (from tragic, to funny, to moving...) without you being aware of it, until your tears are replaced by laughter.There's not much of extra material on the disc, but that's ok. The stuff there is is interesting, and kept in an offbeat way - exactly like the movie - and I mean this in a good sense!!I'd have rated it 13 out of 10 stars....Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"simply works","review":"Product seems to work pretty well.

To my adult eye, the box has the appearance of hardened cardboard and the ballerina is painted plastic of the cheesiest kind. The real flaw is that the mechanism that stops and starts the music is of the crudest kind: it basically folds - and sometimes crushes - the ballerina itself. Sure enough - after very little time - the plastic ballerina snapped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Balerina Jewelry Box","review":"I got this for my 3 year old Neice for Christmas.

First problem.The music is fantastic and in the end we bought it for that specific tune. First good point.After less than 2 weeks of DD (age 6) opening it, the poor ballerina sprung into action (literally) and this caused the poor ballerina to fall apart: the belly separated from the tutu, the tutu separated from the legs and the legs came off the little spring that triggers the dance.We tried to fix it once, and it worked.Unfortunately once it breaks, it will bvreak again. And it did. And when we tried to put it all back together we ended up pushing out one tiny screw that triggered the music.Not a success story.But DD loved it while it lasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jewelry Box Review","review":"I am very pleased with the jewelry box.

First I expected a lot more from Greg Kinnear and Matt Damon which are both very talented actors. Second this movie was about an hour longer than it should have been. Maybe they could have padded the material out to 90 minutes but to punish the viewer with TWO full hours of lame dialogue and lifeless acting is just criminal.Why on earth did they use Cher, who looked like she was wearing some kind of plastic mask the whole time and acted even worse.I just hope I can forget this film so I can stop kicking myself for buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such talent!

But still i didn't like stuck on you. It had a few funny one-liners here and there, but all in all, the Farrally brothers have been funnier. Me Myself and Irene, There's Something about Mary and Dumb and Dumber were the brothers in their prime. Lately, with this, Shallow Hal and Say It Isn't So, they haven't been what they once were. Before I watched this I was afraid that it was going to be the same joke over and over, and it started off different than that, but it eventually sunk into being a one-dimensional movie. It was a pretty original idea for a movie, and it wasn't completely blown, but it definitely lost its edge after about 40 minutes or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"PAINFULLY, EXCRUTIATINGLY UNFUNNY","review":"Maybe it's time for Amazon to include minus-star icons for movies that are so bad they are, well, bad.Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear are conjoined twins in the Farrelly brothers' painfully unfunny STUCK ON YOU. Cher and Meryl Streep have small parts but the only laughs are from the blooper real. Too bad the whole feature film couldn't be about two actors trying not to laugh while playing conjoined twins.

Worse, individually these twins come off as half-wits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not stick with this one....","review":"This movie was not funny in the least...boring, stupid, and in some spots down right vulgar....do not let you kids watch this movie if they are under 16....IMHO!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Farelly Bros.

Was he as embarrassed about it as I was for him? I mean, he was great on Saturday Night Live, so we all know he can tackle comedy with ease, but was this a stretch? Could he actually save the Farrelly Brothers from their downward suicide spiral? The answer is absolutely not. The movie lacks the cleverness of their early works and any laughter is uncomfortable - nothing like '...Mary'. Please, don't waste your time. This has been a public service announcement..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dumb premise, but","review":"A very intelligent and funny movie.

I saw Matt Damon in Ocean's Eleven, and thought he was great in that as well.I saw Shallow Hal, which was also directed by the Farelly brothers, and thought that (aside from being kind of stupid) it was really funny.I hated this film, and there weren't any redeeming qualities at all. I kept waiting for Kinnear and Damon's wonderful acting abilities to pop out and completely bring back the entire movie.It didn't happen.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone- it was a complete disappointment for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work","review":"Watching this movie you can be forgiving about a few things:1) The subject matter is in very bad taste2) The story idea is totally ridiculous3) The acting performances are less than polished.What you cannot however forgive is the fact that this latest gagfest from those auteurs of gross-out comedies, Bobby and Peter Farrelly is actually NOT funny.I am a firm believer in the premise that \\"making light of a subject\\" does NOT automatically mean that the subject is being taken lightly, but that having been said, any moments of levity here are very few and far between. The acting performances are as you would expect, neither great or excessively bad, but the real problem for me was failing to tackle such a thorny issue as Siamese twins by making it insulting rather than humorous."},{"rating":"1","title":"By far, the worst Farrelly brothers movie","review":"Sorry, this was indeed a waste of 2 hours. If you're a fan of the Farrelly brothers and liked 'There's Somthing About Mary', 'Dumb and Dumber', and 'Me, Myself, and Irene' you'll probably hate this movie. This movie doesn't measure up at all compared to any of their previous efforts. 'Shallow Hal' was previously the worst of the Farrelly movies until 'Stuck On You'.

Calculations of shadow prices are very simple, a pragmatic appproach that I find very useful for those not interested in becoming scientists in the field, but professionals who know the COMPLETE process of evaluating a project and its impacts from both the private and public perspectives.

The songs on this album are trite, uninspired and forgettable as your last breath. Plus, I have a problem with Sharleen's new image.

This is one of the best easy listening records I have. Sharleen's vocals are one of the best in the pop scene. There are a lot of different moods on this cd.

Highlights of the album are: Tell Me The Answer, Summer Son, When We Are Together, Day After Day and Saint, but the others are equally great.

In HUSH, Texas has opted for a lighter ABBA/DIANA ROSS/TLC fusion/pop sound that underscores every track. If you liked White on Blonde and/or Southside, be warned ... this is a major shift in sound. Gone is the textured sophistication that drove Texas' best work ... Sharlene seems to have fallen in love with falsetto singing ... Her voice, while incredible, gets tiresome when she sings falsetto over the entire CD.

With every new CD they've released I've been looking for that sound again, but have not found it.

I miss the emotion and heavy drive of Rick's Road, one of the greatest CDs ever in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"this album sucks","review":"I bought this disk thinking that it was the same band that made \\"Southside\\" and \\" Mother's Heaven\\".

These songs all sound the same and lack any of the qualities that made the early albums great."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good slice of pop music","review":"I had pretty much given up on pop music...Until now. Once I heard \\"In Our Lifetime\\", I knew Texas had something good going on, and I was right. If you're sick and tired of the usual mainstream pop, then this is for you! It's mainstream pop with a likeable twist. However, one thing I would like to know is why they didn't turn song #8(Zero Zero) into a full song? The instrumental and the background music sounds great and I'm sure it would've sounded even better over Sharleen's voice!

Here at his retirement Cosell writes about sports franchises relocating, problems within the NFL and boxing, sports announcers and Monday Night Football. Cosell makes several interesting points, but unfortunately his arrogance and ceaseless criticisms for his coworkers (and bragging about himself) was such a turnoff that I never finished these pages.

Baum doesn't try to accomplish too much in this tale--his main intent seems to get that humbug of a wizard back to Oz. Along the way there are some amusing adventures, populated with wonderful new creatures and characters. As a child, I especially enjoyed the scene (and illustration) in which the Wizard slices the vegetable king cleanly in half, though the escape from the gargoyles is also quite engaging.

But I never could find it.This book seems to be an on-demand book published as needed from a computer file. It's an okay read and I'm sure youngsters who are fans of the series would enjoy it.

Great for toning and leaning out!","review":"I absolutely love this dvd. The moves are low impact but incredibly effective for elevated heart rate and toning your body. I was skeptical about whether the low impact exercise could be as effective as lifting weights, but after doing this tape for a month, I am a believer!This workout affected parts of my body that just aren't reached by doing weight reps, and I love how sweaty I get without jumping around my apartment like a maniac!

Maybe it's my undiagnosed ADD, maybe it's how I sort of feel like the training is a little cold, maybe it's the repetition--inevitably, to me, it is probably clear that it is all of the above. For me to get through a workout, I need to feel involved and motivated. This bored me to tears, to the point that I kept stopping to do things. I will say that I gave it an extra star because even though I did it bored and half-as*ed, I was still a little sore the next day.So for you hard-core's this might be a dream. For anyone who struggles to find a workout that is engaging for an hour---something that might motivate them to workout instead of watching a re-run of [Insert BRAVO television show here], this might not be the best choice.

I'm not sure if he died before Elizabeth's reign, I'll have to check my facts, but the Dukes of Norfolk were related to Elizabeth I through Anne Boleyn.

The film is full of elegance and pageantry, but the storytelling is kind of weak, and hard to follow at times. But these shortcomings are made up by good performances by a unique cast. Cate Blanchett (\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" Trilogy) gives an immensely powerful and intimate portrayal of Elizabeth I, and Christopher Eccleston (\\"The Others\\"; TV's \\"Doctor Who\\") is menacing as the Duke of Norfolk. The supporting cast (Which includes Joseph Fiennes, John Gielgud, Geoffrey Rush, Daniel Craig and Richard Attenborough) also give strong, solid performances.Overall, this is a good film that takes a unique and unrelenting look at the Queen who changed the history of Britain forever.Movie/DVD Grade: B+"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This movie gets very boring, not worth buying.

Some of the conclusions are just too weird.A note about the costumes: if you're going to do a story about Elizabeth and set it in a different historical period for some effect, GREAT! but don't try to pass off early 20th century clothes as Elizabethan.

To portray him as a 90's style skinhead was just plain wrong. And, there is no proof that Elizabeth slept with Robert Dudley. If you know anything about her psychology, you just know she wouldn't have taken the chance of getting pregnant. This was the 1500's after all. Birth control did not exist.

The movie does not depict events in logical sequence, and is sometimes confusing. I did think that Cate Blanchette did an excellent job of portraying the very complex Elizabeth. However, the scene toward the end of the movie when she cuts off her hair and dons white make-up was a farce. She wore white make-up to cover smallpox scars and old-age lines; she wore elaborate red wigs to cover her own thinning red hair. It was very misleading.

As a visual extravaganza, the film is lush and dramatic. And yet, the overall effect is rather wearying. The director uses a pretty heavy hand, especially when it comes to the score. He also manages to make the drama of Elizabeth's early life, which hardly needs any embellishment, seem unlikely. I don't mind loose treatment of factual events if used in service to the story, but this film was loose in tone, so that it was hard to believe that these were Elizabethan men and women, rather than actors in rich costumes. This is filmmaking as music video instead of filmmaking as storytelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elizabeth","review":"This movie is fine if all you want is a costumed drama, but since I've very familiar with the actual history, I found the liberties taken with historical fact absolutely unconscionable.

Both of these movies will not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intrigue-filled Historical thriller!","review":"This is a excellent film!I love the atmospheric cinematography and great acting.I also love that the film had the suspense and the intrigue of a really good political thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blanchett's noteworthy performance.","review":"Australia's coolest blonde for Hollywood Cate Blanchett should have won the Best Actress of 1998 Academy Awards over Gwyneth Paltrow in SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, no matter that she already won in the Golden Globe. Her pale white beauty with the ruthless stare is incomparably real for the role Queen Elizabeth I. Her acting and perfect English accent and speeches strove to be among the A-lists i.e. Meryl Streep etc.From the beginning when Elizabeth is wrongly accused to be sentenced, the times during her political standing against all rivalries and their hidden agendas, to the end she rises to her feet as the ultimate Virgin Queen, Blanchett is fully in control of her powerful acting and plays her parts stately. And when it comes to her affair with Sir Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes), Blanchett's soft feminine side shines through radiantly.This DVD will always remain one of my favourite period films for a very long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful - and a true story to boot !","review":"Powerful acting, excellent cinematography and tremendous costumes.

(Issue already addressed....)Anyway, again, another Hollywood eye-candy treat. Visual splendour, excellent acting, and a plot that intrigues. Cate Blanchette is a fine actress and does a wonderful turn as she evolves from shy, timid Princess Elizabeth to strong-willed, take no prisoners Queen Elizabeth.

There were just so many ham-handed elements in Elizabeth that just provoked ridicule and popcorn tossing at the screen. PS Robert Dudley was actually Fredo and when Michael, er I mean Elizabeth, finds out his betrayal, well... see the movie..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite","review":"This is a brief opinion of the film Elizabeth--you can read detailed synopsis elsewhere if you're interested. Cate Blanchett's performance, as well as the screenwriter's care with her complicated character, are a marvel to behold. The film itself is not perfect, but this film is well worth your time just for this exquisite performance by Ms. Blanchett. (By the way, try \\"Oscar & Lucinda\\" for another wonderful performance by Cate.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overated","review":"Overated as far as story or historical context goes. The conspiracy never actually makes you wonder if it's going to work or not. Sets are medieval, costumes are gorgeous. Cate is great, but you will come away confused by the story and owning a number of misconcepts about what actually happened historically."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cate is superb, the movie isn't","review":"Cate Balnchett give a bravo performance as Elizabeth I in this otherwise disappointing (and historically inaccurate) biopic.Nice cinematography, and some good turns by the supporting cast (most notably Geoffrey Rush) can't make up for the grizzly, almost sensationalistic nature of the script which seems more geared to attract American audiences then it does will telling a historical tale.Cate will survive this mess nicely. Look for her in the much better and criminally overlooked film \\"Oscar and Lucinda.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, gripping film","review":"The film may take many historical liberties, but it delivers a solid emotional portrayal of the times. The costumes and actors were magnificent. This movie may just turn me into a medieval film fan! Cate Blanchett gave an incredible performance - it's been many years since I've been so enthralled. This is one of the few films I will likely watch multiple times. I think I fell a wee bit in love with Francis Walsingham, the character played by Geoffrey Rush."},{"rating":"1","title":"great actors-poor script","review":"Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush were perfect casting for the historical personages they portrayed. Unfortunately, the script is such a total distortion of history that they were wasted.If you know any history, you know that Elizabeth was no political innocent at the beginning of her reign. She knew what she was doing and had the sense to listen to Cecil (here portrayed as an impotent fool). I watched this movie in disbelief of its manifold inaccuracies. Particularly distasteful was the character assassination of Mary of Guise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once again Producers pander to Prurience...","review":"The dazzling sparkle of Cate Blanchett cannot save this disaster of a film from embarking on a literal trashing of the Great Queen Elizabeth I. One can only summon, since everyone in the film seemed preocupied with tawdry sex including a sicko murder in the palace, that the writers and the director were just pandering to the appalling sexual appetite of American audiences. The rather lush photography is supremely wasted by another romp into the sexual gardens by a supposed cerebral writer. I really thought the British had more decency than to make this trash.FeleciaP.S. - Sir Richard Attenborough should renounce the worst career move he has ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time or Money","review":"I am a lover of English history, in particular the period of Richard III - Elizabeth R.

Joseph fienes is a very sexy actor, but playing the same character he played in Shakespeare in Love, in my opinion. he is nothing special... Too much sex in this movie... but otherwise it was very entertaining and mesmerized me.. I didn't really know much about Elizabeth before this movie and i don't know how historically correct it is but it is worth a look.."},{"rating":"1","title":"An embarrassing misrepresentation of Elizabeth's life.","review":"As someone who has studied English history for years, and especially Elizabeth I, I was literally embarrassed by this awful version of the life of this brilliant woman. Everyone who was important to her was misrepresented, and there was certainly no reason to change history. Robert Dudley was her childhood (and best)friend and was by her side practically til the day he died, --she called him \\"her eyes\\". She did put him in the Tower, but only when he did not tell her about his second marriage (she was present at his first). Sir William Cecil presented Elizabeth with Queen Mary's ring( after Mary died) and was her most trusted advisor until he died. His son replaced him. Walsingham, although loyal and important to her, was never as close as Cecil. The list of discrepancies is endless. The writers and producers of this film, that should and could have been wonderful, should hang their heads in shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Off with its head!","review":"Other critical reviewers have already noted that Elizabeth makes a travesty of history, and unnecessarily so. The politics, personalties, and intrigues of the Elizabethan period were fascinating enough without debasing them with this kind of cinematic rubbish. Even more deplorable is the quality of the screenplay itself. In contrast to such classics as Elizabeth R and Mary Queen of Scots (and even The Virgin Queen), the writing here alternates between the banal and the sophomoric--it's just plain boring. See Shakespeare in Love for a lesson in how truly talented writers can bring this period alive with an engaging, witty, intelligent script."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful movie that is historical fiction","review":"I have little to offer that others have not all ready written. The top positive and negative reviews say it all. Well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Queen Elizabeth In Blu!","review":"Wow! In one word that is what the Blu Ray disc looks like. This movie was always one of my favorites but in Blu it looks almost three dimensional. The disc quality is THAT good.It was a pleasure just to view the colors and get a better appreciation of the costumes and set design. The lake scene with the masks is simply superb. The blacks are velvet not grainy as some darker scenes tends to be - even in blu.A worthy upgrade don't hesitate to buy - now."},{"rating":"1","title":"could have been better.","review":"Movie lost me about half way in. Not because it was confusing it just wasn't a film that grabbed and kept your attention. The costumes and scenery were nice but the film just failed at keeping your attention. Also from what I read it had a fair share of historical inaccuracies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bah!","review":"This portrayal of Elizabeth was on a par with the second season of Blackadder, but not quite so good. On the other hand, Hollywood is not in the business of teaching history to the great unwashed, so historical atrocities like this and Braveheart are sure Oscar winners, provided they are sufficiently cheesy, sleazy, violent, loud, and artsy. Pecuniae vindice."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT CAST AND HISTORY WASTED...","review":"Great cast and history were wasted the the director's heavy hand in conducting this movie. THe narrative is slow and boring, although the general plot is so good.

This movie turned Elizabeth's life into a nothing but a torrid love affair and forbidden trysts. It cheapens who this amazing woman actually was. And to top it all off it's not that well done for what it is. If you want a Tudor romance try Anne of a Thousand Days"},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing FICTIONAL tale about Queen Elizabeth","review":"This is an beautifly told and designed story. I say story because that is what it is. A story. If it had been a documentary, as other reviewers seem to base it's merits on history books, then it would have problems but since it is not a documentary then it is ridiculus to treat it so. This is a riviting movie. I have to stop myself from renting it everytime I go to the store and I can't wait until I can afford to buy it. I would recomend this movie to anyone who enjoys a well produced movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular!","review":"Existing reviews both on and off Amazon already say it all.

The edging pieces don't last forever, but they needn't be perfectly undamaged to function well.A few hints:If it's cold when you assemble the mat, definitely get out the hair drier to warm up the mat edge before trying to snap the edge pieces on. Ideally, assemble before it all freezes up. I store mine in summer, off the floor so that the wood can breathe -- fold the mat as little as possible (ideally roll for storage), and allow to flatten in the warm sun a day or so before reassembling.All in all, this product has worked well for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily defeat-able!","review":"I bought this lock a few years ago as a security device when I moved to LA.

Except for it becoming loose, it would still be \\"useable.\\" Second, when I went to file the warranty, they claimed the original registration never got to them and therefore not entered into their system. I attempted to show them that I had the receipt for the certified letter and a copy of my original receipt, but the representative basically told me they do not honor the 1000 deductable grantee.

The harmonies on the original albums don't get a chance to shine with the muddied vocals on this CD. I'm glad to have a CD version of these two albums, as mine are pretty scratchy, but i'll still play the vinyl when i really want to hear the Talbots at their best. If you somehow have the albums in good shape after all these years, don't buy the CD...you'll probably be disappointed at the sound quality. But the CD is definitely worth having if you don't have the albums. Mason Proffit was one of the best concert bands of the early seventies, especially in small venues like the basement of River City in Iowa City in 1972.

Among the varied artists were Marvin Gaye, the Grateful Dead and lesser knowns like Mason Proffit. Blending Rock and Roll and pure Country, they gave us tunes we could sing along with and feel at the same time. My personal favorite, A Rectangle Picture, expresses the torn feelings of my older brother, back from Viet Nam. Some call their music Country, others Country-Rock. I just call it good! This compilation gathers many great songs into one small package, of one little known group who had great talent and insight into our generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic rock masterpiece","review":"I first heard Mason Proffit when Two Hangmen came out on a little known radio station in St. Louis, mo, called K-SHE 95.

Their first album, containing the regional hit, \\"Two Hangmen\\", launched them into a much wider audience. With each subsequent album Mason Proffit perfected their craft, writing haunting ballads and foot stompin' revival tent songs.

And, I too, like Katie Fisher was a heavier girl in high school and have since lost the weight. I really enjoy reading books where I feel like I can jump into a character's shoes and feel right at home.Paul Van Dorn's character had bit parts in the novels previous to this. He was always a bit cocky and a show man, so to see him humbled by his hockey career ending early made for an interesting character in this book. Paul was the hockey jock in high school and one of the most popular guys around. So, it makes sense that he wouldn't have dated Katie Fisher. But, of course, 10 years can change things.It is a funny, romantic novel. Light hearted and fast paced. I really enjoy Deirdre Martin's books. This is a great story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much time spent on the wrong thing...","review":"I had such high hopes for this book because I thought Paul was going to be the Paul we'd been introduced to in Michael's story. Wrong! Why Paul put up with Katie, I have no idea. And though I wanted to like her for him, I really didn't get the chance because most of the book was not about THEM, it was about her, her nephew and her messed up sister (don't even get me started on that one!). When Paul did get into the picture, he was more of a fixture, not believable at all. And the ending was SO anticlimactic. Very rushed and not fulfilling."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful read!","review":"Penalty Box does not dissapoint any fan of Deirdre Martin's.

I found myself going ho-hum most of the time. The story could have been more in depth and it seemed like Ms. Martin was just trying to fill up the pages so she could sell a book. The romance was sweet but not as hot as it could have been. I will keep reading her books and hope this is the only one I found to be a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is terrible","review":"I didn't like Martin's other books \\"Body Check\\" and \\"Fair Play\\", and this one is just as bad. Katie's humor is dry and she tries too hard to be funny when it is not. I particularly do not like stories where the reject-turned-hotty are so easily compliant to the popular jerks that they had a \\"crush\\" on back in high school. If the guy treated you bad, why would you have feelings for him? Paul is like a big kid stuck in a grown man's body and he was being a prick throughout the entire story. Katie's sister Mina who happened to be a teenage mother is one horrible person to read about. The dialogue is like a convoluted mess. Katie and Paul talk to each other like children, and some of the words spoken are not okay to be said among lovers. I couldn't take this book seriously at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Penalty Box","review":"A romance story about hockey players, what's not to like?

She escapes and eventually tells her parents, who realize they are hurting her. The warm family ending won't work out, but that's where her story stops.

It should bother you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jaded","review":"Jade is a girl caught in the middle of her parents' divorce. They're fighting over custody of her, not because they love her oh-so-much; rather, it's to claim the prize. She doesn't want to take sides, but her parents are putting her into situations where she feels pressure to choose one over the other.Jade's story was a bit repetitive. Parental bickering, choose me, I feel so invisible / like a game piece, second verse same as the first. Also, the creepy internet guy who holds her hostage was ridiculous not scary.

You ain't seen nothing yet. \\"Misty\\", \\"Star\\" and now \\"Jade\\" have nothing in common with our beloved VC Andrews stories about dark family secrets waiting to be unveiled while a poor and rejected heroine beats the odds and grows into a beautiful woman. It is merely the tale of 4 girls from broken homes that meet in a psychologist's office to tell their yawn-inducing personal stories. The non-existant plot reads like an article in \\"Reader's Digest\\" and even VC Andrews' usual, neverending metaphors seem overbearing and are an unsuccessful attempt to make the story worth reading. If, like me, you are a VC Andrews fan, spare yourself the disappointment and don't waste your money on this one...you're better off digging out the older Andrews novels and reading them again instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good edition to the series","review":"When Jade's parents got married they're marriage was more like a buisness partnership.

When Jade's parents got divorced they fought over her not becasuse they loved her, but becasue they wanted to come out on top. Will Jade be able to deal with everything? Or will she fall apart.I really liked this book it's a good edition to the series and so far my favroite. I've already read Misty the first one and I'll be sure to read Cat and Star.

It happens far too often if you ask me. And this is another example. The music on this record is great! Lovely arrangements of horns and piano's in a catchy 70s piano-pop sense, but Utrillo Kushner's voice is just weak, straining, and to be honest, quite out of tune at times.

Hansson is just briimming with diverse musical ideas from a wide range of infuences, and he weaves them together into an enduring thematic whole. Unlike so many other progressive rock bands of the time, Hansson lacks the somewhat grandiose pretensiousness other groups seemed to engage in that now makes their music seem dated and unsophisticated.

Spielberg was robbed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth all the praise","review":"All right, it is a good movie but it is by no means great. It takes away from Shakespeare's creativity instead of adding to it. Christopher Marlowe even outlines the play's plot for him - making it more his creative genius than Shakespeare's. While it is interesting to see an idea into where the story came from I found it to be trying too hard in many parts. All in all it is worth seeing, but far from the Best Picture award it received."},{"rating":"1","title":"What? 5 stars?

It is fine entertainment. The actors are all having a great deal of fun.But it's like watching cotton candy. It's all sugar and spice, but no substance. In particular, there is no sense at all that this is a film about *Shakespeare*. A film about his plays, yes. But this Shakespeare does not remotely approach the genius we see in the plays. And that's too bad, really, because any film that could capture *that* would be a film worth watching again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another example of Hollywood gone bad","review":"Technically, I suppose this movie deserves some credit. The stage and costumes were exquisite, and, for the most part, the actors seemed to have given their all. It wasn't their fault the flawed screenplay was as dull as a door. I'm sure Shakespeare would be rolling in his grave were he to see some of the historical inaccuracies portrayed here. The use of music was inappropriate. Just about every scene was filled with notes and notes and notes, as if to cue the audience what emotion they should have at that point. Although I feel Paltrow is a fine actress with a stable career ahead of her, her character in 'Sliding Doors' had much more depth. Also, I would have rather seen Colin Firth in the role as Shakespeare instead of Joseph Fiennes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sappy predictable movie","review":"This movie is not worth two hours of your time, let alone an oscar for Gweneth.

The story within a story meld together as a storyline, and it also burns a path to your deepest passions. The movie is a master in the craft of using the English language to express the heart. As only Shakespeare himself could have done, as he painted words that blazed a permanent impression in the depth of you mind, this movie reaches out and grabs you by the heart and pulls every ounce of passion that you posses. To not see such, is a telling of your story, as how the blind is not necessarily a matter of eyesight."},{"rating":"1","title":"So boring, even my wife hated it...","review":"My wife generally likes \\"chick flicks\\" of this nature (i.e. well done an and not insulting).

Honestly the one truly great aspect of this film in the great and cleaver script! As a writer, this is without a doubt a good one. Though, I urge everyone to go out and see Elizabeth and compare Gweneth's and Cate Blanchet's performances, and you decided which one deserves the Oscar! Gweneth was cute and again charming, though falls flat of portraying true grace, artistry, emotion, and character. In my Opinion, Cate was robbed. As a film student, Shakespere in Love is no where near the movie classics stage and will fade with time. It's a shame \\"Oscar\\" had to be degraded. Go back and see Elizabeth, and even Saving Pri.

The major actors turn in fine performances (Judi Dench's Elizabeth is a small but sparkling gem) and the wry but reverent look at Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet-- cleverly entwined with the love story of the film-- reminded me all over again of how wonderful Shakespeare's writing truly was and is.

I remember sitting in the movie theater surrounded by aspiring intellectuals laughing almost all the way through it... I don't remember a genuine laugh coming from me...however, I think I've been known in the past to have a sense of humor, lest anyone thinks I'm just a bore... movie seemed to be quite convoluted and I've seen many movies much more romantic and clever than this one, but like I wrote above, I am probably culturally illiterate and remain simply an ignorant simpleton...

That's all this movie is filled with. I cannot fathom the fact that this won best picture!!!!!!!!!!!! What were they thinking?

I actually \\"forgot\\" at certain times that she was in drag, and supposed to be playing a man. That's how unconvincing it was to me. You mean to tell me none of those guys actually knew \\"he\\" was a \\"she\\". At least make it real for the audience! And this won best picture!?! And as for Judi Dench's performance? Certainly not an oscar worthy. Her costume acted circles around her!All and all, this movie was a tasteless as a scone."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the singular works of western art.

I left the theatre in a state of amazement and utter rapture. I wanted to paint, to write, to love, to cry, to scream out loud, to hug everyone I saw.

It had a few moments of drama mixed with the comedical aspect. But the actors pulled off this movie with such confidence and ability in their own characters that made the fans of the movie believe in their acting ability. In my viewpoint Shakespeare, Poe, King, and Patterson are my favorite authors to read because the words they write move you as you read the stories they wrote. But for the movie itself it was very moving and touching, and if you need a good comedical movie and powerful acting by talented actors and actress then pick this movie up and watch it when you get some free time away from work then call your friends over or watch it with someone you care for. The movie itself has comedy, drama, and romance elements. So watch this movie least once during your lifetime for mutiple laughs and maybe a tear falling and make your heart pump for the romance scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not as great as the awards reflect","review":"Wasn't as good as remembered it to be; it won seven (!)

You continue to be entertained and find yourself discovering elements of the plot and aspects of the characters that you missed on previous viewings. Shakespeare in Love, with its clever plot and rich writing, meets that criterion. You have to keep your eyes and ears open to catch all the fun. Even background players in the street scenes shout out inside jokes, like lines from Shakespeare's plays. Anyone who enjoys Shakespeare will love this film.Production values are excellent, scenery and costumes lush, sound and score fine. The cast is more than up to the task of creating Elizabethan England. You'll find Gwyneth Paltrow a wonder. What a delight to find a young American actress, aside from Meryl Streep, who can handle an English accent convincingly.I rarely buy films on DVD, but I had to own this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Transfer to Blu-ray","review":"Without a doubt, one of my favorite films about the theatre - and this transfer to Blu-ray is utterly gorgeous.The film, filled with wonderful theatrical \\"inside\\" jokes and sight-gags, features a brilliantly witty script, gorgeous costumes, and utterly delicious acting.Not to be missed, this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down, repeat, what a let down!","review":"If ever there was an over-hyped show that does not live up to expectations it is \\"Shakespeare in Love\\".

Could Shakespeare really have been so incredibly stupid as to have sex in very public places, with all odds of getting caught, with a girl dressed as a man, (a woman acting at this time was a crime, in which she could be severely punished--if he really \\"loved\\" her, wouldn't he care more about her safety?). This wasn't love--just pure and simple lust. They never really have any conversations, only recite lines from his play and then jump into the sack.

She look fabulous in her beautiful dresses that's what was good about her, her acting was not great, just okay. I usually like her she is a good actress but this time her acting was boring.Also seeying all the time Shakespeare and her in bed reciting some part of the play was boring and sometime they both get really much in my nerves.I don't say don't rent the movie, you may like it, it was not that bad but I was pretty disappointed by it, I thought it will be much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever!","review":"I totally agree with the viewer from Phoenix, AZ. We rented this movie to see what all the fuss was about and we couldn't get into it. The acting was horrible and the accent on Gweneth was much to forced and foolish sounding. I can't understand how she won the best actress Oscar for that year and how the movie was best movie of the year. If you want to see a movie that is well worth watching for a couple hours, Life is Beautiful. That movie should have won the Oscar for movie of the year. After about an hour of torture, we had to turn the movie off because it was just so bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly Disappointing","review":"I was anxious to see this movie, considering the great reviews it received.

If you are already one, you will enjoy it even more.The movie tells us how William Shakespeare was inspired by the muse Gwyneth Paltrow to write his classic \\"Romeo and Juliet\\". From the beginning to the end, the film is a sheer delight. It is extremely funny, especially if you know the text of \\"Romeo\\" since some of it is used in the screenplay. Director John Madden has managed to gather an outstanding ensemble cast whose standout is Geoffrey Rush. Paltrow does a fine job, but she she wasn't the best actress of the year 1998. This honor goes to Cate Blanchet.\\"Shakespeare in Love\\" shows us that films about historical persons needn't be dull. It might not be on par with Milos Foreman's \\"Amadeus\\", but it is nonetheless one of the best of its kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this a lot, but not everybody responds to it...","review":"This is, in my view, a funny, well-acted look at what might have happened to Will Shakespeare if women were to act in his plays way back in the day...one of them might have looked like Gwyneth Paltrow, and they might have fallen for each other. Perhaps one has to be open to Shakespeare, interested in acting, attracted to the England of 400 years ago, and have a patient ear for archaic English dialogue to really love it. If that describes you, don't miss this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Ado about a great movie.","review":"This movie smoked \\"Pvt. Ryan\\" for the best movie oscar. It had to compete with another period piece \\"Elizabeth\\". But,those movies had to compete with a cast multi-layered in talent. Not to mention compete with \\"Willie Shakes\\" himself. I like the way the movie brought in Christopher Marlowe, who was once (And I hope they have given up on the idea that Shakespeare was anybody but the \\"William Shakespeare, Bard of Avon\\")thought to have written many of the plays attributed to the bard himself. The setting is great and young Mr. Fiennes fit right in even after I had seen his brilliant role in \\"Elizabeth\\". Judi Dench was a cinch to win the oscar. She is marvelous as always. Great movie, one I will hopefully see many times over."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Witty Movie","review":"I did not know who playwright Tom Stoppard was until after viewing this movie. Now I know. This movie will define his work in future years for all students of film. It is a very subtle satire of the life of one of the greatest writers who has ever lived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slick love","review":"There are enough of your typical drama student jokes to make this film amusing, and the anachronisms are great, but the romance in the movie is just too slick. There is no questioning of love as the characters simply move through the motions. They meet, immediately fall in love, society prevents their love, and they are forced to separate. An enjoyable if not very thought provoking movie on love. Shakespeare's original had more to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"NUDITY NOT NECESSARY!!","review":"An entertaining, but somewhat offensive look at what \\"might have been\\", but I was disappointed that it had so little depth. It's called a comedy, yet wasn't all that funny. Also not enough substance to be classified as a drama. The many references to other \\"Bard\\" works does NOT transform it into a fantastic, artistic masterpiece. The sexual relationships could have been IMPLIED without spelling them out so unnecessarily, and the acting, although good, wouldn't go down in history as exceptional if it hadn't been handed an Oscar for Best Picture. When you compare it to classics in the past (of different genres) such as It's A Wonderful Life, High Noon, North By Northwest, Ben-Hur, and Chariots of Fire; Shakespeare in Love just doesn't begin to come up to those standards of great films. It's entertaining, and amazingly enough was awarded Oscars, but for all but its most ardent fans, this one will fade into the past as just another entertaining, but not GREAT, movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this movie","review":"I thought that this movie was romantic and funny. I admired the love that the two characters in the movie shared for one another. It made wish for that kind of love with someone.

What is it with this woman and acceptance speeches? It's getting to the point where she can't even unwrap a Mars bar without bursting into tears and thanking her parents for giving her the courage to do it.

It will insult your intelligence. Period."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give this horrible movie no stars, I would!!!","review":"I was shocked when Shakespeare In Love won Best Picture and Best Actress. This movie is good enough, I suppose, for a cheap chick flick, but where's the chemistry? Where's the grace and artistry that Gwyneth Paltrow was supposed to possess in abundance? As a fan of the Elizabethan era, I can only hang my head in shame that such a film was produced. Trust me, if you want a movie that truly shows the Elizabethan era and is worthy of all the Oscars it was robbed of, try Elizabeth. Cate Blanchett was absolutely stunning in this film, more convincing in her demanding role as Queen Elizabeth that Gwyneth Paltrow could ever hope to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"What I saw of it.....","review":"I can't honestly review this movie because I didn't see it all. It was too boring to watch. I rented this movie because I wanted to see what all the hoopla was about at the Oscars. After the first half hour or so of this movie I had to hit the \\"OFF\\" button. I cannot understand for the life of me the appeal of G. Paltrow. There are so many better out there. I can see after only a half hour of this movie that Saving Private Ryan was ripped off when it lost the Oscar."},{"rating":"1","title":"At Least I'm Honest","review":"First of all, I don't like to watch movies about dirty people. Dirty, (needs to take a bath kind of dirty), rotten teeth, do I want to go to the movies to see that? So this movie was supposed to be so funny, so clever, so original, so witty. I found it to be mostly repulsive. And for romantic? It was people lusting for each other like two high school kids with over-active hormones. There wasn't much \\"romance\\" in here for me.Just for the record, I enjoy the plays of William Shakespeare. I love to read his sonnets. But as for this movie, much ado about nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Picture????? GIVE ME A BREAK!","review":"After watching Cate Blanchett's performance in \\"Elizabeth\\", I couldn't wait for the release of \\"Shakespeare in Love\\". What a disappointment! The movie is predictable, boring and just plain SILLY. What a waste of talent! It is hard to believe that this bit of fluff actually won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Although Gweneth Paltrow and Julie Densch's performances were good, in my opinion they were not \\"oscar worthy\\". I've seen better performances on Masterpiece Theater.I appreciate William Shakespeare and his play \\"Romeo & Juliet\\", but it's really a shame that they were in any way connected to this mess of a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bread and circuses taste is well served","review":"Perhaps it is a great movie for those who actually know very little about Shakespeare, literature, history and art in general. I am sure it won the Oscar becuase it's so revoltingly simple and unsophisticated, but unfortunately, it profanes a serious subject of art and lets an ordinary person think that now he is familiar with something more subliminal than his everydy chores. I guess it has an appeal to masses, otherwise it's hard to explain why it wins these rave reviewes. All in all, it's a soap opera at best, and even the sonnet they selected is the most beaten up Shakespeare's piece. The film shows what happens when a theory that art's purpose is to entertain working people is implemented live... By the way, Saving Private Ryan is even worse, in my opinion - a totally fantastic story good for elementary scholl kids..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame and overwrought","review":"How did this win the Academy Award?! I guess because it is a movie theater people and the Academy is composed of theater people? The script is predictable and formulaic. Fienes's performance is unbearably earnest."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the academy likes","review":"Another made for the academy movie, truly boring. Group of friends and myself turned it off halfway through. Soooo Sooo witty, give me a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Of The Year","review":"One of the worst, most contrived movies of the year. Could Gywneth Paltrow look into the camera for approval any more often? Predictable and lacking any originality I am ashamed of the academy for even considering the farce as a legitimate movie. Considering the comic appeal (or lack of) this movie is no better than the Bruce Willis farce \\"Armageddon.\\" Once the absurdity of the juvenile humor settled in, the pedantic plot drags the view from one tiring scene to the next. In the history of film this piece of trash will be long forgotten while \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" (a film that should have won) will live on as true cinematic art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pablum for the pseudo-literate","review":"The allegedly ingenious and highbrow humor of this film is based almost entirely on the gimmick of contriving to have \\"real life\\" references for things ultimately stuck in Shakespeare plays, and then a cute idea in SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO TOWN. Here it just seems stupid. What really drove me nuts was certain members of the audience were laughing hysterically every time it happened. Yet there is no real cleverness applied to the technique, merely the humor of recognition. I felt the audience members were laughing excessively in order to prove how \\"literary\\" they were for recognizing the HAHAHAHAHAHA !!!! You see WE know NOW that it became Romeo and Juliet ! Get it ? And it was MARLOWE ^V who might have written Shakespeare's plays - who gave him the idea for the final title. Get it ? GET IT?Neither do I."},{"rating":"2","title":"For The TRUE Romantic","review":"I LOVED this movie and was fortunate to have Santa bring it to me for Christmas. Gwyneth Paltrow was excellent, but it was Joseph Fiennes who stole the spotlight as the passionate Shakespeare who leaves his wandering ways to spend a few days with the love of his life. I wish it had a happier ending, but love sometimes happens like that. The humor was excellent as long as you understand it... I like when a movie makes you think about how funny it is. Overall I'd have to say this is one of my top ten favorites of the nineties!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a classic!","review":"Writing doesn't get much better than this, and the ensemble cast, especially Dame Judi Dench (who deserved more than 6 minutes) and Joseph Fiennes bring this to life.After this movie, and Rosencrantz and Guildestern are Dead, I cannot wait for Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman's next work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shakespeare in Love","review":"When I saw this movie for the first time in the movie theatre I was not impressed. I thought it was a good movie, but I did not think it was the greatest movie ever. I saw the movie again this past September. That is when I fell in love with this movie. I really paid attention to the subtle lines in the script and to the enormously talented actors on the screen. After that viewing I ordered the soundtrack (which I also highly recommend). Everything about this movie is good and that is why you should watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better then the movie everafter and I loved that one too.","review":"This film was beautifully written. Not like some shakespearian movies where you can not understand them at all. I fell in love with the characters from the beginning of the movie. The music and the wonderful scenery were breathe taking. It captured my full attention from beginning to end and I highly recommend anyone to rent or buy this video I sure will be buying it for my own movie collection. Give this a two thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun romp of a movie","review":"I enjoyed all the beautiful language and the (contrived) storyline. Gwyneth is so fun to watch. Wonderful costumes and groovy sets."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Boring-okey satire","review":"This is almost perfect but for a couple of dreadful scenes especially the ending it's quite not that good baby. So if you want a nosensible movie see Shakesphere In Love ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Belongs on that long list of overrated garbage...","review":"The concept of \\"Shakespear in Love\\" may have its compelling points: Shakespeare writes his tragedy \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" while falling in love with a \\"forbidden\\" woman. Unfortunately, a 1990s flavor spoils the beautiful sets and costumes. Romance and love are reduced to a string of lustful sexual encounters (and the courtship is short). Viola shows all of the modern attitudes that Rose did in \\"Titanic\\" - horribly out of place, and downright depressing. Shakespeare is portrayed little better. Despite \\"Shakespeare in Love\\"'s moments of clever comedy and the very well acted \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" scenes (maybe enough for 2 and a half stars), the shallowness pours from the movie and sinks it. Another example of why the Oscars are most often a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ending suggests love was in fact a fling","review":"The last few very disappointing minutes of this movie breaks from the comparison of this couple to Romeo and Juliet, making it neither tragic, satisfying, clever, nor romantic. That Juliet could walk away from Romeo, and that Romeo would let her, is just flat disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forsooth, it doth give love a bad name","review":"Am I the only person in the world who found this movie less than enthralling/endearing! Perhaps Miramax, as part of its astounding marketing blitz, turned everyone else into pod people and only I am left to sound the alarm? Although I tend to be a purist when it comes to films of Shakespeare's plays, I'm not utterly closed minded. But this \\"romp\\" was too cutesy by far. Fiennes was pallid, Dench and others were wasted, and Paltrow ... argh!: the start of the appalling Gwynethmania of the last couple of years (although I liked her in \\"Sliding Doors\\"). . . . much ado about nothing, if I may coin a phrase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shakespeare in Lust","review":"Well, its not Shakespeare, if that's what your expecting. Its more like a movie production of a cheap romance novel. The name of the greatest writer of the millennium is used to give legitimacy to a piece of fluff. Women can get their hormones going under the ruse of experiencing high art. Its a chick flick, nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drab, Dry, Overall the Worst Film Associated w/Shakespeare","review":"I don't feel it was clever or witty. In fact, the humor was a little off base for me, personally. I often drifted off in thought during dialogue. The only joy I recieved from watching the film was the direct words of Shakespeare's poetry (aka. Romeo and Juliet). The characters were plain, the plot slow and lacking clarity. Also, the character Rosaline was irritating and grotesque. Sexuality in female characters has been polluted enough with poor and ugly symbolism. Why continue to keep it so unnecessarily crude? Gwen is sweet and Shakespeare comes across as a naive, weak, confused and uninspired character. Purely heterosexual, ofcourse. I was expecting more depth and originality. But, it is nothing but plain, old mainstream entertainment in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome","review":"Incredible movie, I just dont know how can be people so stupid that can give 1 or 2 stars to the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I can not show this DVD to my students but love watching it for myself. Costumes, dialoge, setting-- all worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Love Story of All Time","review":"This movie is so clever, so wonderful. The acting is superb, the sets and costumes are divine, the dialogue is perfection. Shakespeare himself would be delighted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shakespeare: Passion Flies","review":"I really enjoy this film; but the heavily, passionate sex was not necessary in order to create a great film. I'd love for my 11-year old son to watch it, for he would enjoy it greatly; but for the sex, I cannot allow it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shakespeare has many colors","review":"This is one of the best movies that I've ever seen. You want to be inside of it. So many people miss it but the movie introduces us one of the biggest player of our time, Joseph Fiennes who is a new breath to the screen. Shakespeare in love has many colors with wonderful players and amazing screenplay."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best movies I've ever seen","review":"I'm astounded that this movie has anything but 5 stars from everyone! The editing between the \\"live\\" action and the play and players is brilliant. The screenwriting is superb, and the characters are engaging, personable and loveable. It's as nearly perfect as a movie can get, with bright, witty dialog and tremendous aesthetics. I've seen it 6 or 7 times and I'm still enthralled at the craft of the actors, writers, producers, cinematographers, costumers, etc. Fiennes deserved best actor nomination at least for his part. Wow! Get it and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining but with a glaring anachronism","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this film--the acting, the sets and costumes, and the attention to period detail. The fictional unfolding of \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" was brilliantly done. However, I was shocked when Colin Firth referred to his \\"plantation in Virginia\\" and, again, at the end of the film, spoke of going to Virginia with his bride. This film supposedly takes place in 1589 and the first English settlement in Virginia was in 1607 (Jamestown). And, it was a good many years after that before there were any established plantations. Somebody goofed on this one!! Aside from this, wonderfully witty and entertaining film."},{"rating":"1","title":"it not hard to hate this film","review":"Banal in all aspect, increasying stupid as it goes on, S.I.L is more of an Embarrasment to shakespeare than any kind of respectful showing. The acting is across the board awfull. Paltorw bored me to tears in a no brainer , borad caritured role. A role which was more to show off her\\"ravish\\"( more like aneroxic and fake) beauty than any real acting talent. Paltorw ranks in the very bottom of all actors and cant hold a candle of to her british counter parts. THe films dialogue is akward and clunky and complety devoid of wit. There is no romance or intrest to the story at all. And the now the sotry telling, over use of the paning camera, the visual style is uneven. Basicly and awfull film in all respect. THe reason why the film won some many oscars is this $"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shakespeare does Titanic...Ta-Dahhh!","review":"Like so much Shakespeare I've seen on stage or screen for the last 40+ years, this is not William so much as it is Earnest Shakespeare, with little magic in the handling of the language but plenty of big music, spectacular costumes & lots of nyah-ha-ha acting. A pity because every generation seems to become more distanced from the real poetry that should be there. Today, it all seems to have become_show & tell, you-are-there, reality-tv presentation. Interesting that Stoppard was involved in this and 15 Minute Hamlet which was far more in the spirit of the Bard."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm so sorry I can't give this movie any minus stars!","review":"Lots of Oscars...How?

(Let's face it, this film is grossly overrated)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shakespeare In Love","review":"This movie looks very attractive before seeing it, but it is actually boring to tears.

Sure, it was romantic, but it wasn't funny.I like to think of this movie as SCREAM for the intellectual set.

This was just a lame adaption of ROMEO & JULIET."},{"rating":"1","title":"True Tragedy","review":"I saw this in the theater, and while semi entertaining, did not move me. I watched it again day before last and though I appreciate the costumes (some discrepancies), the music, and the ending which truly saved this movie from being absolutely rancid I still cannot get past the fact that this beat out Saving Private Ryan as Best Picture.Saving Private Ryan stuck with me for days, weeks, and now years, I forgot this drivel an hour after I watched it. Forget Romeo and Juliet, forget the heartbroken 'Will' Shakespeare, the only real tragedy was that this movie won Best Picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romeo & Juliet is the best part","review":"Well, who even reads these things? But maybe I can offer a little counterpoint. Sure it's dull. Sure, it contains every Hollywood cliche (follow your dream, don't let people get in your way, sex between people is good as long as they are attractive). Sure it panders to people who would like to look intelligent while they knowingly chuckle at the in-jokes. This is Titanic for the I-graduated-from-college crowd. Doomed romance, lots of creeps in the way, a passionate man (so passionate he abandoned his wife and children) and a ditzy female who looks great naked. And yet, the portions of R&J (carefully edited so we never see the early portion of the play where the dingy Romeo is smitten with Rosalind) are exquisite, making me realize yet again why Shakespeare is a writer for the ages and Stoppard is not. Every good line in this film is Will's."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"This movie was sooooo bad. I had to fast forward through half of the movie because i was falling a sleep.It was really pathetic!! The only thing i liked in this movie were the costumes. Totally skip this movie!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious and arty","review":"This movie will certainly be popular and rate with critics. However, it is pretentious and arty in the anticipated Hollywood manner. Furthermore, it takes too many liberties with a historical personality. We know little about the life of Shakespeare, and we certainly should not read his plays autobiographically. But one thing we do know from his writings is that he valued marital fidelity. If he ever violated this standard, he was certainly shamed by his own conscience. He would never have celebrated his lawless love. It is too bad that millions of folk, forgetting that this oh-so-serious production is fiction, will get their lasting impression of England's prime cultural hero here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stooopid (what I saw of it between zzzzzz's)","review":"This is the best movie they could come up with without blowing stuff up? I was hoping for something fun or perhaps a sweet romance...slim pickings here. Annoyingly full of itself and quasi-subliterate. The actors looked dumb, too --that Fiennes guy, especially, bored me. This is a movie that thinks its all that & got a lot of 'mo-spaiens to nod along but hasn't got much there there.

The lead singer really belts out the lyrics with passion and gusto, as any Rod Evans fan should. As then other writer pointed out, there are evidences of Arthur Brown influence through out the lp, along of course with Deep Purple sounds.I wondered for years where could this band be from, since there is no info on the lp jacket where it was made or when.

There are exactly two outstanding tracks on this release, the catchy summer tune She Will Have Her Way and the spooky Sinner. Most of the rest lacks the spark that Crowded House seemed to produce in their sleep. A few tracks are even hardly b-side material.

Losing his brother Tim's atonal, and somewhat chaotic, edge definitely freed up Neil's tunesmithing abilities. On Whistling, he cuts accessible, harmonic tunes with varied and edgy arrangements which makes the whole album haunting. The result is one of the best albums to come out in the last year. Faster Than Light is a great cut."},{"rating":"2","title":"June/July Blue","review":"I have over 1,000 peices of music in my collection and I like to ask my astute music loving friends if you could take only ten cd's with you to the moon, what are the titles. I think I might have take ten copies of this because it may be the best one I own. The lyrics, vocals, arrangements, playing and production are all equal or better to what Lennon would be doing if he were still alive. I listen to the title track and 'Addicted' the most, but could play straight through as much as anything else in my collection. I saw him in Boston and was hugely disappointed that the crowd was littered with people who knew Eddie Vedder was his special guest. Here is hoping he tours with his brother Tim following the upcoming release of his new effort. \\"as if you were deranged\\" Indeed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can do better . . .will do better.","review":"So much bollocks is written about Neil Finn and his prowess as a songwriter. I was delighted to hear that amongst the two or three really memorable songs, there's an awful lot of padding. It just proves that the man is mortal. His next solo offering will be the one to judge him by. He may have then dispensed with some of the 'studio toys' which render some of these songs as mildly irritating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best CD available today","review":"After seeing his concert on this tour and not really knowing which Finn brother I was about to see, I was blown away by this performer's music. It's a combination of listening and feeling. I found myself being pulled by the melody and moving with the rhythm all the while entranced by the story: \\"I'll walk this earth like some unforgotten soldier\\". If you buy only one CD this year...buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long overdue solo effort!","review":"Neil Finn's best album since Temple of low men. It's no where near as boring as Together alone or as popy as Woodface. One criticism would be it's a bit too long and a few songs not up to the standard of the rest could have been left for b-sides, namely, \\"Souvenir\\", \\"Loose tongue\\", \\"Astro\\" & \\"Dream date\\", this would solve the problem of where to go after \\"Twisty bass\\" because at the moment the album tends to go through a bit of a lull (with the exception of \\"Truth\\") before the excellent final two songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nearly Perfect Album From A Nearly Perfect Songwriter","review":"Neil Finn comes closer to perfection in his craft then nearly anyone writing music today. When he is on, he is DEAD ON. Penning lovely melodies with lyrical content to match. This, his first solo effort, is a collection of his latest gems and with it he reminds us of why his fans love him. It also, however, nudges some to wonder what he does with all the rocking stuff he writes, as this album only comes close to moving your feet once (My Loose Tongue). As far as I'm concerned, that's more than enough as this is close enough to perfection for me. Keep 'em coming Neil."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most listenable albumn I own!","review":"First impressions of this albumn certainly do not do justice to incredible beauty, depth & sheer imaginative genius of the songs contained here. I have to agree that every single track is an absolute gem - a fact which will only beging to make it'self apparent after repeated listenings. This is the one albumn I can play over & over - back to back and simply NEVER get tired of hearing. Worth considerably more than it's weight in gold!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great album Terrible product","review":"This is one of the best albums I have ever heard by Neil Finn, as good as anything he did with Crowded House. My original copy was lost and so I decided to get a new one. This re-issue is very poorly made and the sound was like a cheap MP3 copy, it even looks like something you'ld buy in Chinatown. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy shoddy - shame on the record co!","review":"Was given this great album for my birthday last week, and sad to say must return it. Shoddy mastering, just awful. You'd think at least, with an artist of this stature, they'd remaster, but no. Great album, pisspoor run."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of my money and time","review":"After reading all of the raving reviews of Try Whistling this (and also seing him live at the Theater Royal) I went out a bought my self a copy. What a Disappointment! Apart from a few good songs, the rest, I'm sad to say, was fairly boring and uninteresting. Now, dont get me wrong. Im a HUGE Split Enz / Crowded House fan, but seing him live was far better than this album. He also done lots of really good non album tracks, such a 'Tokyo' and other cool songs which I cant remember. The songs here lack life on the whole..... often starting in a fairly plodding fashion forcing listener to fastfoward to when the singing starts..... and the lyrics are a bunch of corny twiddle. Basically....... this album SUCKS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly, a snooze","review":"Wow. Only two songs out of this whole album even approximate Neil's customary brilliance (\\"Sinner\\" and \\"Truth\\"). This is the very least-involving CD he's ever made, further testament to the fact that comfy home and hearth often make musicians very dull boys. Almost makes me wish he would have another falling out with his brother or stray from the marriage bed again -- such terrible events seemed to light a fire under him (e.g. \\"Temple,\\" parts of \\"Woodface,\\" \\"Together Alone,\\" \\"Finn Bros.\\"). Tsk, tsk."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a disappointment","review":"Michael Bruce was an essential part of the Alice Cooper group. However his attempt at a solo album falls flat! The CD seems poorly produced & mixed sounding very weak & tinny. It does have it's moments \\"Lucky Break\\" & \\"If the Sky should fall\\" are good but songs like \\"King of America\\" and the title track are sickening to listen to. It's an ok disk but anyone hopin that Michael recaptured some of the magic that was the Alice Cooper group will be VERY disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest film ever made without Clint Eastwood.","review":"Fear and Loathing is most certainly one of the greatest films of the decade. Johnny Depp is the best actor of his generation and puts in a stunning performance that is only matched by Christina Ricci's beauty. It remains as true to the book as can be done and captures its escence and message with skill and humour. The Oscars should be punished for ever because of their inability to give this exceptional film its due rewards. I advise all to read the book and see the movie - you will struggle to match it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fear and Lothing in Las vegas","review":"Dude, how can i describe this utter masterpice,humm.... BRILLIANT. Yes it is absolutely fantastic film, it has really, really funny dialogue and a trippy plot. I laughed so har that I couldn't hear what they were saying but it didn't matter anyway because i knew it would be hillarious. BUY THIS FILM NOW. A definate 5 star review."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a waste of time","review":"When the book came out it was ahead of it's time and had some good moments. This movie is a different story. Although Depp tries hard to save this movie it is so contrived, banal, and boring, that it is a waste of time and money. No wonder there are so many used copies for sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Hours That You Will Never Get Back","review":"I will preface this review by stating that I have never read the book upon which this movie is based. I purchsed this DVD based upon the list of actors. I was truly disappointed with this movie in that I kept waiting for something -- anything -- reasonable and sensible to happen. Alas, it was not forthcoming. The continual narration by Depp's character did not work for me as it really did not add anything close to approximating coherency. The cameo by Bussey was good; however other than that watch this movie only if you are familiar with the book and have an extra two-hours of your life to spend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's Grow Old and Fat and Drunk and Stoned Together","review":"I was \\"treated\\" to Johnny Depp and Benecio Del Toro in \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\" on DVD. Based on the late journalist Hunter Thompson's book, this one had a few very funny moments, and the not-so-subtle message that real-life in Las Vegas can be as hallucinogenic as a drug trip, but spent too much time showing us how people on drugs walk funny and trash hotel rooms and rental cars (without paying their bills, of course). It was a step up from Bill Murray in \\"Where the Buffalo Roam\\", an earlier attempt to bring Thompson's antics to the screen, but still a pretty low step."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fearful and loathsome","review":"I've never seen anything as repulsive as this. It is supposedly a gonzo, drug-induced, stream of consciousness romp through Las Vegas involving 2 dysfunctionally stoned and crazed individuals. It is a waste of time, altogether missing whatever mark it set. If you must see it, do so on an empty stomach. One reluctant star for the authentic 1971 look of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheer torture","review":"Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas remains the only movie I have ever walked out on at the theater. I like the actors (Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro), I like the director (Terry Gilliam), and I also understand there was not supposed to be a \\"plot\\" per se, but more of a stream-of-consciousness approach dealing with how drug trips can seriously mess people up. Despite all this, I absolutely HATED this film. It was painful to watch - an utterly wretched affair of bizarre confusion and mayhem. Watch if you must, but you have been warned. I would recommend seeing some of Gilliam's other (very fine) films, such as Time Bandits, 12 Monkeys, or Brazil instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in Space","review":"First of all, I expected to like this movie. I loved the book, I think Depp is one of our best young actors, I was in Las Vegas at the time the book was being written, I admire Terry Gilliams's visual techniques, etc. But ...This was one of the worst movies I have ever sat through, on every level. Flashy visual effects and snippets of decent period music don't make up for a one-trick pony plot, seemingly off-the-cuff improvised acting, mumbled \\"dialogue,\\" endless closeups of wrecked rooms and people and the detritus amongst them. It was painful to watch this movie, and at the end of it(blessed relief!) I wished that I had spent two hours doing something more meaningful, like watching Batman & Robin TV reruns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have to be on drugs to enjoy this one","review":"Let me start by saying that I am a Gilliam fan, and that I have nothing against 'trippy' movies, but I couldn't stand this one. Even the dazzling effects couldn't hide the fact that there was no plot here, no story, no character development - all I saw was the same stupid drug-jokes over and over. Ha ha, look at the man in the funny hat stumble and force his way in to see Debbie Reynolds. Whatever..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a lousy rendition of a classic","review":"I have had my copy of Fear and Loathing for over 20 years, its dog eared pages re-read umpteen times. While the book is hysterically funny, the fact is that not very much actually HAPPENS in this story, other than wandering around Las Vegas in various states of mind and paranoia. Hunter Thompson's strength is his phrasing and power of observation which the movie tries to capture with Depp's voice-over but it just doesn't work. Maybe another voice would have worked better.Unwatchable."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS MOVIE TOTALLY SUCKED. ITS ONE OF THE WORST EVER.","review":"This movie was horrible. It was just like being around really annoying drunk people for too long. There was no point to this movie and nothing happened at all. Only for those people who do hardcore drugs. Very dissappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's trash another hotel room...","review":"OK - so I understand that Hunter S. had these wild, drug-induced experiences and then experienced amazing moments of clarity which he was able to write about most eloquently. But other than that, so what? This film was so redundant - the overkill of the hotel trashing and partying literally made me nauseous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow I've seen more entertaining turds in my toilet. . .","review":"This is, without a doubt, the worst, most disturbing movie I have ever seen. If you are goning to waist your money on this, you might as well buy some cheap liquor, get hammered, and you would get the same stupid effect, but then you wouldn't have the tempation to blow your own head off while suffering through this crap heap. If I could have, I would have given it negative 5 stars. Anybody who buys this movie deserves to be hit by a car, then pumped full of acid, shot in the knee caps, have their genitals blown off with dynamite, and then have their bloody carcasses fed to starved alligators. My recommendation: don't buy this movie (if you couldn't tell that sentiment from the rest of my review)."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE OF THE ALL TIME WORST MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN!!!","review":"I find it difficult to believe that anyone in their right mind would find this movie entertaining. You couldn't pay me to watch it again. It has no story, no plot, and no dialogue worth listening to. It is a huge zero with nothing worthwhile to offer. Actually, it is below zero...way below! I liked Johnny Depp in \\"What's Eating Gilbert Grape\\" but after seeing him in this piece of crap, I will never watch anything he does in the future as he has proven to me that I can not trust in his judgement to choose a decent script. There are so many good videos available, don't waste your time on a garbage movie like this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm amazed this film is getting good reviews","review":"This had to be one of the worst films I've ever seen. For the most part, I'm a big fan of Terry Gilliam. I thought Brazil and 12 monkeys were two of the greatest films. This movie, however, is for blind diehards. It was just one visual of drug use after another. It was not funny, nor was it interesting in the least bit. I actually watched it a second time hoping to find some saving grace for the film, but sadly I could not. If you are considering buying this film, I urge you to rent it first otherwise you will be disappointed..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"Well, maybe it's just me, but i couldn't see any plot whatsoever in the movie. You know, that little thing usually included in the movie that makes the movie worthwhile. So anyway i was watching it and nothing at all happened in the first hour or something (time moves so slow when youre bored). It was like an entire first part of the movie on an acid trip and that got old fast. So i turned it off and rewound it and went outside and that was more entertaining than the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Stapling my head to the carpet every morning for the rest of my life, would be better than having to sit through this movie another time. It was the worst piece of garbage movie I have EVER seen. I strongly discourage anyone from wasting their time...really...it's not worth the three bucks. Taking a lighter and setting those three dollars on fire in the middle of your living room would be more exciting than this sorry excuse for a movie. Go watch Forrest Gump instead. And that's all I have to say about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is funny...","review":"...for the first half-hour. After that, everything that Depp and Del Toro do is just dumb. You want the movie to go in some direction but it doesn't. Instead you are forced to watch Depp fall down, again, and again, and again. The short movie seems like hours, mostly because it takes the two so long to accomplish simple tasks. If you still really want to see Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas, then at least use it in small doses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goddamned Mescaline, why cant they make it alittle less pure","review":"By far this was one of the greatest movies I have ever had the pleasure to read, it is an intense rollercoaster of drug filled missadvenures, in a town where excess is expected and to some extent inored. five stars is definitly not enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hallucinating in HD","review":"I was let down the first time I watched this movie, since it is sort of a cult classic, I've heard many positive words for it. Upon my second viewing though I found it to be favorable and actually really good. Hallucinations should only be viewed in your head or in HD, and everyone should know it. Plus, you can't beat the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure ...","review":"I'll admit, my expectations were pretty high for this one. The book is an absolute classic, and one that still makes me laugh 25 years after I first read it. But this movie is a mess. Boring,pointless, and rarely funny,this film's chief claim to fame is a seemingling endless hallucinatory scene, which has Terry Gilliam written all over it. Johnny Depp gives another great performance, but nothing can save this train wreck.Too bad Alex Cox left. I think his sensibilities are better suited to the adaptation of this book. Even the Bill Murray comedy \\"Where the Buffalo Roam\\" is a better take on Hunter S Thompson than this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorites.","review":"i have seen a lot of reviews saying you will only enjoy this movie if you are high. thats the farthest thing from the truth. almost every review i've read says its just a movie about drug use with no plot. apparently a chestnut is watching the movie, because there is an obvious plot. saying this movie is only about drugs, is like saying fight club is only about guys beating the crap out of each other, requiem for a dream was only about drugs, american history x is only about black people hating nazi skinheads, and pulp fiction has no plot.if you can only focus on the violence/sex/drug use in movies, you should stick to watching the many adventures of winnie the pooh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic film","review":"I only own a hand full of HD DVD's. But this one is by far the best looking of the lot. Great picture. Very clear. Amazing colours. Fantasic film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hunter S. Thompsons greatest book comes to life in a Movie","review":"Jonny depp and benico dela toro do an excellent job acting in this i mean if you can act like your triping on acid that good then they should have won an oscar. The movie is about Rauol Duke which is played by Jonny Depp and his attonery Dr.Gonzo which is played by dela toro to go to Las Vegas and cover the MINT 400 which is the super bowl of dirt bike racing, although the movie only spends 15 mins at the races it is also alot about two friends on drugs in Las Vegas and that makes it a movie to watch. This movie was written by Hunter S. Thompson the greatest journalist in the late 60s 70s 80's and 90's. You can find some of his columns at espn.com. To prepare for this role Depp spent monthes at Hunters cabin in Coloardo to figure out what it is like to be Hunter S. Thompson and he puts in a great preformance in this movie. If you like this movie you should take a look at Where the Buffalo Roam."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOO MUCH ADRENAL GLAND!","review":"This flick is incredible. You need to watch this more than once to understand the subtlties. Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Torro are absolutely unrecognizable in these two characters.My favorite scenes:1. Throw the radio in the tub when White Rabbit peaks.2. Get my golf shoes.3. Dr. Gonzo trying to kiss Christina Ricci.4. Meeting the photographer.5. Any room service scene.6. The adrenal gland!This film is loaded with incredibly articulate and fast moving scenes. Try it with headphones!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"This is a first class interpretation of Thompson's book. Pure Gonzo Journalism set to film. Johnny and Benicio's portrayal of Duke and Gonzo are seamless. It's a real tribute to them that they BECAME Hunter Thompson and Oscar Ocosta. There is no doubt that the chaos is real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good DVD","review":"Good DVD. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas isnt a movie for everyone. Its a very crazy movie about what happens when people decide to do a lot of drugs for many days"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Criterion Collection makes it all worthwhile","review":"Of course, Terry Gilliam's adapatation of the novel was brilliant. The great thing about this DVD are the extas, especially the 1978 BBC documentary of HST goint to LA to work out a screenplay adaptation of his book. Here we can see what the real HST was like in the 1970's. An interesting character is person as well as in literature!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film","review":"Great Film.

But I did like the whole bat country thing. The book is soooooooooo much better and easy to get and easy to laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Definetely Bat Country!","review":"This movie is the funniest movie I have ever seen. However, if you have never taken psychedelics or entheogens, then don't even bother renting it, because you'll hate it. This movie is the epic portrayal of where open-mindedness, curiosity, intelligence, adventurousness, and madness, all meet, here where they've always met."},{"rating":"2","title":"own this!","review":"This is the most hilarious and scary drug movie that you will ever see! Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro are fantastic in this as a writer and his agent! Christina Ricci and Tobey MacGuire make appearances in this!

I think it is hilarious and extremely quotable. Also, I think this may be one of Johnny's finest performances. He has Hunter pinned; he even sounds like him. I love it! Anyway, I highly recommend the film...I couldn't stop laughing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Irreverence and decadence!","review":"As all of us are aware about Terry Gilliam's border limits scripts, the repercussions and tendencies that occur, product of a progressive crumbling of the human mind; there us a visible breakthrough respect the established order, and the way to respond before this anomaly vary according the case.In particular, this movie may disturb most of viewers, in case you are not totally immersed in the spirit of that age, plenty of absolute lack of respect and negation of basic premises. Don't forget the famous French May's ideological emblem: \\"Forbidden to forbid.\\"Caustic, acidic and uncensored gaze around these outlaw period of a recent history, that now is part of the anthological retrospective.All the cast was absolutely superb; and the movie reflected with absolute veracity the essential profiles of its hallucinating characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"missed the point, entirely...","review":"hunter s. thompson's novel is by far one of the best reads i have ever had. so when i found out a movie was being made, i was very excited. i was not disappointed. i do not think that thompson was trying to string together a story that would fit any sort of traditional structure. the movie follows suit. as far as adaptation from book to screen, this movie remains one of the purest out there. the text of the novel and the movie follow along quite well.people not familiar with thompson's work are probably going to put off by this movie. but i suggest seeing the film anyway. it is a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insanity at it's best","review":"After watching this film I didn't know what to think.This movie is a truly wicked angle in the lives of two drug users in Las Vegas. At first they are supposed to cover the motorcycle event that is taking place there. After that takes place, the movie goes straight to hell.This is simply a view of what these guys do when they're under the influence of drugs. And it can be knee-slapping funny, whether the humor is intentional or not. Even without a coherent plot, the movie keeps the viewer interested in what the main characters will do next.Johnny Depp is excellent, especially his narration. And if you want to see a very well-off Benicio Del Toro, he's all here."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Dream","review":"This is not a drug movie. This is a movie about a modern day genius.

We go on with our every day 9 to 5 lives, and consider a man like HST irresponsible.When in reality he is doing exactly what all of us want to do but are scared to.I say hats off to you MR. Thompson and thank you for inspiring me to do EXACTLY what I wanted to do,which was get back with my X wife and my 3 Kids. HST FOR PREZ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"---","review":"the idea occurs to me that this movie is meant to make you laugh as you watch it and think on it afterwards. it's not just about senseless cheech & chong indulgence and stupidity, it's more of commentary on that era. The scenes from vietnam, the continuing military allusions, and the despondent overtones are there on purpose to make you think again about vietnam and the aftermath. the vague motives for being in vietnam parallel the search for the american dream since we were supposedly fighting to protect it. and its no mistake that every reference to the american dream is accompanied by some decrepit image is saying that the american dream is just as real as the lizards in the bar. the quote at the beginning also has some bearing on that.so if you gave this movie a bad review because didn't get past the first layer then that's credit to your mental fortitude."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"just another freak in the freak kingdom\\"","review":"this film is a masterpiece. a great satire of the american dream and its own moral and spiritual destruction seen through the eyes of a drug addled journalist. director terry gilliam created a coherant vision from this \\"unfilmable\\" book. johnny depp and del toro ARE the characters..depp lived with thompson and got into the man's head. the film is layered to seem like a funny drug film. then it devolves into a social commentary and descent into madness. the dvds are loaded with commentaries and docs about this fil, book, and madman!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Trippy","review":"Each time I see this movie, I notice something I'd not seen before.

As long as you are a fan of Hunter S.'s stuff of course ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great piece about an American legend","review":"This movie is exhibits one of Depp's finest performances and proves that he is a top rate character actor. His performance is dead on to the Hunter S. Thompson footage that I have seen.This movie brings to life the 'death of the american dream' aspect that Thompson worked on through out much of his writings. This is not so much a drug movie as it is a brutal look into what America had become after the 1960's.I suppose that to really appericate this movie, one would have to be somewhat familar with Hunter S. Thompson. Any one claiming to have any sort of knowledge of contemporary American litrature surey would though. It is by far a breakthrough movie and more than worthy to be apart of the Criterion Collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best overlooked films ever!","review":"This is quite possibly one of the funniest movies I have ever seen in my entire life! Raule Duke and his attorney Doctor Gonzo set out to report on a motorcycle race and end up in search of the American dream. Depp and Del Torro give the preformance of a lifetime. I still watch this movie to the day and pick up on something that I missed the previous time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it or Hate it, Depp is awesome.","review":"Yes, yes. I'm sure you have heard it a million times, but either you love it or you hate it. In this case, I LOVE IT. Johnny Depp makes a brilliant performance. This movie is drop down hilarious and is a total trip. If you love this movie, you will watch it over and over and over until you pass out. It's an experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flippin' lizards, man!","review":"Did the Amazon.com reviewer watch the same movie I did? I have to say that Mr. Shannon is completely wrong in his assessment of this film. This is as close an adaptation of the book that you could get and it's pretty darn near perfect. Johnny Depp is thoroughly convincing as Raoul Duke and Benicio Del Toro is just plain gonzo as the all-consuming lawyer sidekick. Their desert hijinks served as nothing more than brain candy and a cult rite of passage for college kids everywhere. Gilliam does an admirable job at interpreting and visually representing what can only exist in the imagination of the warped and depraved. For that he should be praised.A definite must see for all Gilliam, Depp and HST fans out there. Don't let Amazon.com dissuade from a truly uniqie cinematic experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visionary","review":"What a perfect equation. Add the off-the-wall prose of Hunter S. Thompson with the visionary direction of the legendary Terry Gilliam, and you have a movie that cannot, and does not, fail to entertain and amaze. While reading the book, and having some first-hand experience with the subject matter, definitely aids in the experience, the film stands pretty well on its own. While a bit of a shift from Gilliam's other fantasy-world movies, it still carries that frenetic frantic energy that makes Gilliam's other films so enthralling. Definitely a prefect mix of drug-culture insanity and practically flawless film-making. Further proof of Gilliam's genius, IMHO."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Fear and Loathing. . .\\" shows it doesn't pay to do drugs!","review":"It sure doesn't! For anyone who has ever vowed a drug-free life, but wants to know what they feel like, \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\" is for you! The extreme camera angles, the blurred, intense pace, and the trippy (and actually, humorous) naration by our \\"hero\\" Raoul Duke make this movie an unforgettable experience. Yes, it't true, the plot is a little hard to follow, and the characters are hard to sympathize with, but that's what makes the movie such a head rush. You see Raoul Duke and his lawyer, the frightening Dr. Gonzo, as they inhale, inject, and smoke what seems like every drug known to man into their bodies. Probably the best thing about this movie is how unpredictable it is. You don't know what these two druggies are going to do next, and that fact has you on the edge of your seat, frightened more than a person on an acid trip. \\"Fear and Loathing...\\" Is one wild ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psychedelic and drug crazed, very true.","review":"While not filmed for the conservative members of our culture, the movie, touches a humor that only those who have experienced the madness of a \\"drug bindge\\" could understand. The movie does not \\"promote drugs\\" as many would like to say, what it does is show them from a different perspective. Glamourized or not, this is one of the coolest films I've ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made for the Thompson fans (and I'm one of them)","review":"Basically, this films functions best as a companion to the book. After reading the book, you can see the film as a collection of moving illustrations and images that help make the book more real. As a film alone, this movie is funny and well made, but generally incoherent if you haven't read the original. Bottom line: Read the book, then see the movie. The movie works best after you know what the hell is going on. And since I did, it worked like a trippy charm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"This movie had so much potential I can hardly stand it. After the first ten minutes, I thought I was in for a hilarious 'trip' the whole way through. Unfortunately, the amusing reactions to the various drugs and the equally amusing narrations by the Duke himself, were replaced with disgusting, drawn out scenes of vomiting and attempted suicide.

It is filled with gibberish and incoherant nonsense. The plot is as nonexistant as the dialogue. It's too bad Jonny Depp got dooped into doing this movie. It's a waste of the casette it is recorded on. That was two hours I will never get back. If I could, I would have given it a 0 star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and Boring","review":"Long on loathing. Boring, I fear. This trip was at somewhere I've never been, and I don't want to go there. A place beyond the event horizon. Who could care less about these people? Great title for a book, or a film, though. For some reason I've given it an extra star. I don't know why. Perhaps because it definitely belongs in anybody's collection of bizarre movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a long bad trip it is","review":"Hunter S. Thompson was a major figure in the 70's. His original publications in Rolling Stone helped draw together a counter culture. This film, however, is nothing. Zilch. Zero.If a 0 was a choice, then this movie deserves a 0. There is no redeeming value. Social or otherwise.The man whose life became immortalized in Doonesbury, here turns into a cartoon character drawn by a drunken idiot. Perhaps that was Hunter's life. But as a movie it is unwatchable.Save your money. Chug a bottle of booze. And sit with your head in a toilet. You'll be more highly entertained than watching one moment of this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Is Happening Here?","review":"Does anyone understand this? I watched with my cat and my cat fell asleep. I think the movie is a tricky joke by the bald man with the half-hair on his face sides (is he the teenager police from Telemundo Jump Show?) No movie would have a toaster in the bath. Why does the half-hair face man talk out of the side of his mouth? Why do they like riding horses that are not real? This movie has silly hair and sneaky talkings; I would say not to watch with any animals, especially sleepy cat."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor adaptation of a good book","review":"This, as many before me have cited, is probably one of those stories that should never have left the stark pages of a book. It's nearly impossible to turn a drug trip into something you can actually film, but success is not impossible. Just look at \\"Trainspotting.\\"The book is good. Not great, but it does leave a resounding feeling behind, which is, for the book, the way to go. You're left with questions, fears, and some wicked humor.As a movie however, the compelling story is reduced to a cheap, Halloween party. People parade around in stupid costumes, making you wonder \\"am i laughing at Johnny Depps performance, or the foam rubber lizard next to him?\\" It's something you just can't help but feel sad for: \\"This could have been so much more...\\"The sole reason to see this movie: Johnny Depp. His performance is good, is an insane way. Just don't go see this if it's high-class humor you're after."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie...defective DVD","review":"I went through 2 copies of this DVD, and tried them on 2 different DVD machines, one having been purchased a month ago. While I love the film the DVDs both stopped tracking properly at what I assume was a layer shift during playback, approx. 58 minutes in. Tremendous pain in the bat, I sent the first one back to Amazon, and when the replacement was no better, sent it back for a refund. I also wrote Criterion and was told they accept returns of defective product no matter where it was purchased so long as it's in original packaging.

The main character, Raoul, as played by Johnny Depp comes off as an annoying little twerp. The story seems to go nowhere. The scene where Raoul is checking in to the Vegas hotel while tripping is well done. The creatures moving in the carpet is a good representation of acid visual distortion. I liked Where the Buffalo Roam more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unengaging.","review":"I am a person of sound mind and wit. I did not like this film one bit. There was not anything about it that I found particularly memorable, I disliked the characters immensely, it all seemed like an overscripted drama at a nearby theater. This film is considered as a cult classic and yet I happen to be of the cult that doesn't quite dig this. Johnny Depp is one of the most over-rated actors in the industry. I can't help but blame him for how lackluster and robotic his acting made this. I do not recommend this film at all.The Blu Ray probably has a better detail level so when the actors are tripping on dinosaurs and dim lights, there is better detail to zero in on how boring the film really was. I'm a big White Rabbit fan but they ruined the song in this unfunny roller-coaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes its mindnumbing but its funny too.....","review":"I completely understand those who think after awhile this movie just knaws at your brain in the painful way redundacy always does.

A weird, drug-crazed trip through Las Vegas... you just have to see it to really understand.

I've seen it dozens of times, and was so excited when it was released on blu-ray. In terms of the quality of the movie, it's a terrific movie with great performances. I highly recommend it. The only problem I had with this blu-ray is that there are numerous sound effects missing from the audio track. Maybe I had it on a wrong setting or the blu ray i purchased is the only one having this problem, but if the blu-ray is in fact missing audio elements from the original cut, I find it very disappointing. I'm not sure if Criterion Collection plan on re-releasing a blu-ray version of this movie, but If they do, hopefully all the audio will will be included in tact. Bottom line: I'm fairly irritated I spent the money on an incomplete transfer."},{"rating":"2","title":"You gotta","review":"This was a terrific addaptation of Hunter in the midst of one of his works.Not for the family or faint of heart,but for us truly twisted turds,this will make you laugh till you piss yourself.Depp & delTorro knocked it out of the park."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nearly captures the greatness of the book","review":"The book upon which this movie is based was a classic of American 1960's literature. If you're interested in the time period and like to read, run out and get the book right now. If you prefer movies to books (no judgements), or already read the book, then this movie is a worthwhile adaptation.Director (& screenplay co-writer) Terry Gilliam is a genius in his own right. Watching him interpret the book is a joy. The movie captures the intensity and mood of Hunter Thompson's work: hilarious in places, terrifying in others, and always surreal. It will make you want to get back in touch with your inner drug-addled anarchist.Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro's performances are outstanding. If nothing else, the movie can be savored for those alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"This is a really good movie, Johnny Depp at his best. This is definitely not for everyone, if you find drugs or drug culture offensive, this is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most literal translation of book to film","review":"By professional critical standards, there's probably not many redeeming qualities this movie possesses. There's not really a story, no motive to propel these characters onward, and there's no moral tied up in a bow at the end. However, this is the most literal translation of a novel to film that I have seen, and it's one hell of a ride. Johnny Depp is outstanding as Hunter S. Thompson/Raul Duke, complete with crippling paranoia and hand gestures. As usual Benicio Del Toro is great, and the revolving cast of thousands never tries to steal the show. The movie slows down during the second half, but it doesn't diminish the fun that derives from watching these fictional (?) exploits. If you want a fun movie you don't have to think about, you may have found your match."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twisted stuff from a twisted time.","review":"A great movie that captures the feel of the great book. The Fiendish humor and excessive drugs of this movie define the early seventies. The book by the amazing gonzo journalist Hunter S.

If your a huge fan theres also Where the Buffulo Room and the 1983 documentary Hells Angels.\\"Don't take any guff from those swine\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearable","review":"I have to agree with the reader from san diego this movie just plain SUCKED!! maybe you have to be tripping to enjoy watching this film, but since I am not into drugs I would'nt know.

Besides the fact it had no plot, no direction, and didn't explain the whole monster outfit thing it just didn't make any sense. Although I'm sure that was the point the director should have had at least a little more consideration to his audience with alot of things. So for all those reasons I say this movie SUCKED."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fear and Loathing was what I felt for the director","review":"Not since my 1996 Root Canal have I had to endure such pain as sitting through this film. What a disjointed, unfulfilling piece of crap, and to know on my death bed 40 years from now, I could have spent those 2 hours doing anything else, will haunt me. Flushing the three dollars, and watching it swirl down the toilet would have been more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you only miss one movie this year make it this one!","review":"I love movies and I'm willing to accept films that are out there but this movie wasn't just out there it was just stupid. Everything had been done before. The way they treated drugs and the effects of them was at least a little on the mark but it never captivated even a little bit of my attention. I was so sad that I had paid money to watch it. I finally got fed up with it and turned off the tape 3/4 of the way threw the film. Therefore it may have some quailites in the ending that I'm not aware of but I think that the rest of the film is so terrible that it couldn't possibally be worth it. If you like J.Depp, as I do, then you would be much better off renting one of his other movies. If you are interested in the effects of drug abuse you could do much better by viewing almost any other movie with the same subect matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"No stars waste of time","review":"I started watching this movie and kept telling myself (and really hoping) that it was eventually going to build a plot or storyline.

I had my doubts... the haze of drug-addled minds and the chaos of long, drugged-up scenes in no way appeals to me. I approached this film with a cautious but open mind. I did manage to get through the film in which Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro are both brilliant. Still, the story in no way interested me. That is not to say it would not be entertaining for some people who enjoy this kind of \\"storytelling\\". The drugs, after all, are integral to the story and how events played out. Watching, though, makes me rather... ill. In light of Hunter S. Thompson's recent suicide, I would suggest that interested parties read his works rather than watch this. Maybe you have to be on drugs yourself (or incredibly... imaginative?) to enjoy this fully."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"God, what a cult film that doesn't deserve it's status. A few friends of mine clamored over this, saying \\"dude, you have to see it, it's freaking great\\". For the first 20 minutes, I was right there with them. Great visuals, rolling into Vegas and whatnot. Then they tripped out. Again. And again. And again. And it's not funny. We're just as bored and confused as the characters, sitting in their hotel rooms, trying to guess what they did. Wow, that's a great way to spend 2 hours. A lot of people love this for the drugs, and well, if you're into that you'll probably enjoy it too. If you like to pretend your into it, it'll be even greater for you.The only thing that saves this from a 1 star rating is Depp's performance, who I must say atleast narrates well."},{"rating":"1","title":"yeah yeah yeah","review":"I lasted 10 minutes. At times, I believe Hunter S. Thompson was able to write. This was not one of those times. His gonzo humor was just over the top, not funny, and stale to these tired eyes.

He probably wrote it that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with the book","review":"I bought and read the book after the movie came out. I loved it and couldn't wait to see the movie. Then I saw the movie. I know the movie never meets the expectation after a book, but I really didn't see a shaved head Depp when I read the book. The lines come from the book, but they sounded very forced or fake to me. Maybe it was because the best parts of the book come from what's going on in his mind, and that is hard to translate to a movie.

Thompson, I hadn't yet read the book, or any of the articles he wrote, the more I learn about Thompson, the more I love this film. The Portarayal of Hunter S. Thompson (AKA Duke)by Johnny Depp is truly amazing. If one compares footage of the actual Thompson with the Thompson brought to life by Depp, one can immeaditely appreciate the acting skill involved and that alone should be enough to watch this film. The film avoids becoming a watered-down version of the book. I read the book and watched the movie and they are very much alike.This film is truly in the unique Thompson \\"Gonzo\\" style.

This movie is plotless and pointless with Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro on drugs and visiting Las Vegas for no reason at all and have hallucinations. The movie soon turns into one unwatchable mess with odd camera angles and some pathetic scenes that make no sense at all. A bunch of well-known stars Tobey Maguire,Cameron Diaz,Penn Jillette,Flea,Ellen Barkin,Christina Ricci,Mark harmon,and Harry Dean Stanton appear in wasted cameos and the two role leads(Depp and del Toro) are wasted and give some of the worst performances of their careers. The movie's author Hunter S.Thompson appears in a cameo. This one dosen't deserve one star or a Criterion Collection DVD. Please don't waste money or time on this mess because this isn't even a so good,its bad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dosen't Even Deserve 1 Star","review":"This unwatchable mess is by far the worst movie of the 90s. Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro give some really bad performances and director Terry Gilliam directs with odd camera angles that this makes it an unwatchable blunder. The main flaw was the lack of coherent plot so the movie features to druggies in Las Vegas doing drugs,acting stupid,and one sees weird hallucinations(a bunch of lizards in a lounge) and the other character acts crazy and pukes a lot. The cast is good and the movie wastes their talent and each all-known cast member makes a cameo. The movie could have been better if it had a decent plot and if it made sense. This dosen't deserve a Criterion DVD or 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and stupid!!","review":"If cameron diaz appeared more often, i would rate this movie five stars! but you only see her during 59 seconds, there is no story don't buy this unless you collect Cameron's movieslike I do.u"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Movie","review":"This is pretty much the only movie I can watch anytime without being bored by it. The acting is done so perfectly and the aesthetics used for shots, colors, sounds, and transitions is done better than I've seen in just about any movie. It's equal parts social commentary, humor, horror, excitement, and rudeness. The criterion is worth the price, the extra documentary, photo galleries, and artwork is all fun to look at.I drove all the way from L.A. for the show. I'm friends with Debbie, I used to romp with her.Do It."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goofy look at 1971","review":"Any old hippie from 1971 will wonder why they wasted their money on this unusual and weird flick. Although the pace is mind boggling and Depp is a great actor the voice overs are distracting and absurd. The bad acid trip sequences belong in another movie.

Basically about some drug addicts who explore las vegas with every drug you can think of and spend lots of cash during the 70's. Where is the storyline?

Thompson, you'll love this","review":"Let me be frank and honest up front about this: you HAVE to love Hunter S. Thompson or you will NOT enjoy this movie. I see a lot of reviewers saying that the movie is trash - I counter by saying that they probably haven't read this book or any of his other works. This is an incredibly faithful adaptation of the book, and captures the Gonzo feel of the writing. It's really a testament to Terry Gilliam's directing ability as well as Johnny Depp's range that made this movie the masterpiece it is.The blu-ray is beautiful, the sound is amazing, and it is completely worth it in every way."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"We can't stay here, this is bat country!\\"!!!","review":"This movie is a masterpiece, and also very very funny. It is a near perfect adaptation of Hunter S Thompson's novel. The book was based on the true story of a drug crazed self proclaimed doctor of journalism and his sidekick turned loose in Las Vegas to cover a dirt bike race called the mint 400. Thompson, known as Raul Duke (Depp) and his attorney Oscar Zeta Acosta known as Dr.Gonzo (Del Torro) run amok in their desperate search for the American dream. Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Torro are absolutely great in this movie. And the cameos are great: Flea, Lyle Lovett, Gary Busey, Christina Ricci, Tobey Maguire, Ellen Barkin, Cameron Diaz, Steven Schirripa, and even Dr. Thompson himself all make an appearance in the film. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a savage journey into the heart of the American dream.

Anyone who is a devout Hunter S. Thompson fan should look into getting this DVD.

A must have for any Hunter Thompson fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"ENERGY POURING FROM THE SCREEN","review":"The reviews I've read only confirm my belief that most great works are either adored or loathed. Either you got the whole message and loved every minute or you couldn't wait for it to be over. It would definitly help to read and enjoy the book before watching the movie. I doubt anyone could have hoped for a better transfer from book to screen. There is so much energy in this movie if your eyes are pointed the right way.Some fans only seem to appreciate F&L as a drug-culture flick, but it really goes alot deeper than that. It's about two guys desperatly searching for the world they once knew and attempts to tear down alot of the \\"hippie\\" ideologies that many were stuck with after the summer of love. A real masterpiece from both Thompson and Gilliam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Featuring Jimmy Page??????","review":"Jimmy Page is a guitar god and legend. Peter Puff Daddy is a freaking joke!

To be honest, this song makes me sick. If your gonna do you hip-pop thing Puffy, stick to it, but please don't butcher classics such as this song. I am completely surprised that Jimmy Page agreed to this crap. Stay away from this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Led Wallet Indeed...","review":"OK, first he completely stole the the Police's \\"Every Breath You Take\\" beat and didn't even change it one bit for his dedication to the late rapper Notorious BIG. That made me mad, but it was for the late great MC, so you got to let that go.But this is just horrible. First, the song isn't that good because Puffy CAN'T RAP. The lyrics aren't good. I think Puffy is the man, but he's the man when it comes to being a businessman. Stick to that, and don't try to be a rapper when you're not one.To completely rip a song like \\"Kashmir\\", which is one of the greatest songs from the greatest band ever, is a crime.

Hello people, any of you who think this is creative or groundbreaking don't get out much. Any of us can take a song, remove the lyrics, and rap over it.

From the pictures it looked like a great learning toy. Since it is a puzzle each piece comes loose so it is near impossible to try and button, zip, etc. even if they did work.

It is very difficult to perform the individual tasks (botton, zipper, etc) because it is a puzzle and the pieces obviously come out. Even if you take each pieces out and try to perform the task, it is impossible to keep the pieces stationary/still while trying to tie or button (as the task itself requires two hands). My child is a very independantand wanted to be able to it himself. However, it is impossable as it takes a 2nd person to hold the pieces steady so he can practice tying, buttoning, etc. That being said, all three of my children enjoy the puzzle aspect of this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I got this puzzle because I love every other Melissa and Doug puzzle we have ever had and I thought it would be great for my son to practice using some of these skills. I was SO disappointed with the quality of the parts. The wood and puzzle part is fine, but the parts like the zipper are just cheap. I have a hard time getting it to zip - there is no way my preschooler could do it. Also the plastic clip is really hard and the button hole is not big enough to get the button through easily. On top of all the parts being hard the idea of having all of these things on a puzzle piece so it is not fixed down on a surface makes it even harder to do. Don't waste your money - you can find fabric books that have these skills on etsy.com or at craft shows that are so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"I thought my kids would love this one, but the buckles and snaps were too hard for them to do.

If the pieces were attached permanently to the board, it would be much easier for him to use. I even have difficulty working with the pieces. As it is a puzzle, my son ends up asking me to hold them so he can attempt to try the skill. This means he can't work on them solo and ends up very frustrated when he tries. The big chunky plastic zipper doesn't zip smoothly and you need more than 2 hands to do it. The button cloth is tight so it's difficult to bring the 2 pieces together to button. Same goes for the clip. The sides are too short & barely reach each other. The snap is flimsy plastic. etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"puzzle and activity board in one","review":"Each activity is on its own piece and can be removed from the larger board like a puzzle.

One person suggested taking the pieces out to do the tasks, but then there is not enough bulk to provide resistance. The clip was so difficult I could barely get it undone.

It's a bust. He doesn't use it because the functions aren't secured to the base. It's difficult to teach these skills when they're not stationary. And it's large, heavy and cumbersome for him. Being a puzzle just adds to the confusion of its function. I'm going to glue the pieces into place and mount the board to a wall. I think this will turn it into an investment rather than a waste of $[...]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moronic Design","review":"I originally bought this because my twin daughters needed to learn the basic skills of tying laces, buttoning, etc. But the fact that it's also a puzzle just confuses things--it's almost impossible to perform these tasks when you already KNOW how to do them if the underlying surface is not stationary, let alone learn to do them. I cannot BELIEVE the idiocy of this design. Whoever did this does not have children, was never exposed to them, and did not think about what they would probably do with this. Instead of learning new skills, as I had hoped, they immediately scattered these useless bits of wood about our house, as I knew they would as soon as I opened it. Who didn't see that coming? I would never have purchased this if I knew it came apart, but it was enclosed in tight cellophane and didn't say. I thought it was a solid board, and really, that would have made sense.

My daughter is 3 1/2 and has had no trouble in using each of these items seperately. She has fun getting the bear dressed.If anything I would say that this toy is so much better than one of the stuffed animals that has all of the zippers/buttons/shoe laces on them because with this toy there is only one task at a time and a child won't get so distracted easily.This is a heavy duty, quality toy that I think will last a very long time.

I've never read a thriller with such a compelling and realistic rendering of faith and the trials that challenge it!Jael faces obstacles that would push any of us to the brink, if not over the edge, and yet she pulls strength from her faith to keep her feet planted firmly beneath her.I'm giving ALL THINGS HIDDEN to all the booklovers on my gift list!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ways with watercolors is a classic","review":"Ted's watercolor book has helped artists and some of todays biggest names have learned from him.

First of all I wanted to hard mount it to my dash, which the ad copy said was OK and a bracket and a spring clip were both included. A mounting bracket was included but it must have been for something else. It wasn't even made for the fan it came with, plus there were no diagrams or instructions. I'm an engineer and I couldn't make the bracket work. So, I made my own and securely screwed it to the dash. When I mounted the fan to the bracket I found that the plastic shaft the fan head was mounted on had tons of clearance and the whole fan wobbled around like crazy whenever I drove, and it rattled when it wobbled.Really poorly made. Might be suitable for mounting in a shop where the base never moved, but why would you want to? This is a 12V fan and should be suitable for mounting in a car or truck.

The story follows him on Trajan's two campaigns against the Dacians where Maximus gains accolades for hunting down the Dacian King, Decebalus.

A great combination to complete a masterpiece of fiction that no book shelf should be without. Proulx makes the reader feel the anguish of her character Veronica in such a way that simple words can not do justice for. It simply must be read. Though short in stature this piece of fiction lacks nothing and carries the reader on a journey through the eyes of Veronica and her plight for normalcy in a chaotic world of vampires. A must have and a must read! Two enthusiastic thumbs up to Proulx!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark and Enticing","review":"Proulx writes a dark and enticing story full of twists and turns which kept me entertained throughout. I really enjoyed reading Puncture, I'd seen it mentioned on a blog and knew instantly that I wanted to get my hands on it!! Her writing is full of emotion and meaning which really adds to the story and makes it somewhat more gripping. I would have liked a bit more of a love story to have entwined its way throughout, and I would have most definitely liked it to have been longer. Apart from that Puncture is an excellent book and I defInitely recommend it to anyone interested in the undead and their way of life!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!

My opportunity came and I had a chance to open the first page. I could not put it down!!! I read this book cover to cover in less than 24 hours!! Definitely not JUST a vampire novel.

V3 has the latest allstars including Carmelo Anthony, Baron Davis, Lebron James, Vince Carter ect. in this game.In V3 you can customized your player. you can change his sneaker and give him a hair cut. Although you can customized there many features to deal with. There is a limit to the player you can have in your team. Nintendos allstar's Mario, Luigi and Peach are in the Nintendo Gamecube edition . But the allstars move very slowly when they dunk,do tricks and shoot.NBA Street V3 is the best NBA Street game so far. Although V3is a good game it can't match with NBA Live 2005.

The problem with this is, the cars don't LATCH together (they don't click into place) - they just set one car upon another. This means that when the child tries to pull the cars, he or she just ends up pulling the front car out, dumping the Winnie the Pooh character on the floor, and swinging the front car in the air. The ONLY way to get this to roll along on the floor is to pull the string along, parallel to the floor. The only child you could convince to do that would be older than 2, if not 3. And at that point, this toy is a little beneath them.Terrible, stupid design.

It helped with easing my hips and upper body pain and I love that it uses a ball and resistance band! I took my time researching prenatal DVD's and found Patricia's to be the most suitable for what I was looking for in a workout... I have tried other DVD's that expected a pregnant woman to do exercises that were uncomfortable and not suitable. I love that Patricia herself is pregnant while doing her workout and not just in her first or second trimester. She has an understanding of what we can do and what helps makes us feel good during the workout. I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD and highly recommend it! I even wrote to Patricia on her Belly Beautiful page on Facebook after my first workout to thank her for such a wonderful DVD.

Admittedly, I am one of those people that hasn't found a prenatal DVD that they think is enough of a challenge and a complete workout but I truly found this DVD to be boring and easy. The only highlight in this workout is the 11 minute lower body workout. My buns did get a good burn in that section. I don't think that 11 minute portion is worth spending money for though. You can find some better prenatal workouts. The ones that I do think give an okay workout are: Suzanne Bowen Long and Lean and Summer Sanders prenatal workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"In pain after ward","review":"I got this dvd so I didnt get fat every where, but when I tried it it was very difficult.

It did not feel good, was too easy or too hard in some parts, and some moves were annoying/uncomfortable. I liked the section on pelvic floor exercises. I did not care for the style of the instructor (too bubbly?). She also did not seem to be in as good of a shape as other prenatal instructors. I much rather prefer the Perfect Pregnancy Workout by Karyne Steben - perfect pace, sequencing, makes me feel great and energized.

Although most anti-polygamists were against the institution primarily for religious reasons, Paddock was equally, if not more, concerned about the rights of women. Paddock's didactic narrative is able to transcend its now outdated anti-polygamy, anti-Mormon morals and stand as an early work in the feminist tradition.In addition to being a classic example of anti-Mormon sentiment from the late nineteenth century, this book will enthrall students of Utah and Mormon history who will enjoy the small details which creep into the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sara Bareilles Careful Confessions","review":"I'm a very big fan of Sara Bareilles,I think that her CD Careful Confessions is excellent album,all 11 tracks on the CD sound great there really cool songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carefull Confessions Album","review":"Delivery time was way earlier than expected and the album was in perfect condition.

Best investment you could make - buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this book if you like problem based learning","review":"I have had the pleasure of using this book during a biostatistics level two course this year. The book is structured to assist in the course work in statistics using STATA. It is user friendly and gives mathematical explanations when appropriate but without losing the reader with too many equations. The book's approach uses problem based learning along with explanatory text which I found essential in learning to navigate STATA along with learning and understanding logistic regression, poisson regression etc. The best aspect of the book is the STATA output to assist with the problem solving. The book is a very good choice as an interactive tool for understanding advanced statistics using STATA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book for learning STATA or methods","review":"I decided to buy this book since this is a new book on teaching how to use STATA on advanced statistic methods. After I browsed this book, I do not think that this is a well-organized book. It does not show you how to use the latest and easiest STATA procedures to do analysis. Theory parts of statistic methods are hard to be read and even not as good as the remarks of STATA Reference. I am totally disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"great reading","review":"I bought this book for my wife. she will receive many blessings from it.

Thoroughly enjoyed this one even though the murder came late. I love how Miss Marple fades into the scenery and does her observing while no one notices her. Bertram's sounds like the perfect London hotel that I never found.I fell asleep reading last night, but awoke at 3AM to finish the book and set my clock ahead! Unexpected ending, but I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast-moving","review":"This is a fast moving mystery where murder takes second place to a whole series of robberies. An intriguing story, though I was disappointed that I had to delve through 80% of the book before any murder took place. Miss Marple herself also plays second fiddle to some Scotland Yard detective. She renders help, but it is not clear that the cops couldn't solve it without her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impoverished Christie/Not Worth a Gander","review":"Lacks suspense. Plausible characters are far and in between. Not as horrid as Passage to Frankfurt which is unreadable. That's a plus. But the whole finale is ridiculous. That Christie uses this novel to reminisce about the loss of of England's traditional ways is endearing, but not a vital enough element. Clearly, whenever the old gal starts trying to address bigger crimes, she loses her way. This one has a train robbery and a crime syndicate and much below par writing. If this is anyone's first Christie novel, it will no doubt be their last."},{"rating":"1","title":"A weak outing","review":"One of her weaker Marple books. Christie's crime syndicate plot rings false. Not as good as her usual formula. Not enough Marple. Too much time spent on characters that seem cartoonish and false. Overall pretty unsatisfying book."},{"rating":"1","title":"well......not the best","review":"I've loved every Christie book I've read. This one kinda stunk. Miss Marple may as well have not even been in it. It's as though she was added as an afterthougt to the story. The writing, as always, was great and engaging. But the story itself was DULL as dirt and totally predictable. I love Agatha Christie books because they always find a way to surprize me and this one simply didn't fit the bill. I didn't find it overly complicated like some other readers mentioned, but I read it quickly and didn't give myself time to forget who the characters were.Very dissapointed that I paid that much for a sorta crappy book :("},{"rating":"1","title":"I am never visiting this hotel again.","review":"I am shocked, but I must admit, that I have come across an Agatha Christie that I did not enjoy at all. It is dull, confusing, and the ending is poor, but it was impossible to figure out the ending.

Save this one till the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miss Marple and mystery","review":"One of the best of Agatha Christie's later mysteries. Miss Marple has found the perfect spot to stay for her vacation. Nothing ever seems to change at Bertram's Hotel, everything is just as it was before the war. But is this all this charming gentility merely a facade for something far more dangerous?"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Like A Movie","review":"This novel by the ever wonderful Agatha Christie is very exact and detailed. It had a twisted plot and suspicious characters. But! It was also from several people's point of view. The scene kept changing so you had to say \\"Okay, who is seeing this and what are they most likely to think\\". In other titles by Christie the story is from one point of view. The entire story is based around one person's story and mode of thinking. That is why I give Bertram's four and not five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Letters Come to Mind: P and U","review":"This gets two stars because it's Johnny and the boys, but getting two just for showing up is not enough.

It leves out some of the details, and sometimes skips ahead to a different area without telling you how to get ther. I could eventually figure out what they were saying, it just took a little while. I didn't really like the order they put certain things in, and most of the minigame things that you do (like collecting heart pieces) are in the back, unlike some books, where they tell you if there is a heart piece or something.

Good stuff, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality and fit","review":"Yikes! The quality is awful and the fit was just bizzare. Skirt is absolutely nothing like the picture; it is very short (doesn't even pass the crotch of the bodysuit). The bodice fit nicely but the sleeve holes were so tiny you could barely fit a marker through them much less my daughter's skinny little arm. Sleeve and skirt material is super flimsy. After the sleeves tore to shreds when we tried it on, I managed to cut them open and trim with ribbon to open the arm holes and fix the damage but the material is so shoddy it would barely hold a stitch. Then I had to sew on a full skirt so my little girl wouldn't be trick or treating in a bathing suit! Also had to cut off the extremely tacky and dented plastic brooch on the front. If we had more time I would have replaced it; it ended up looking okay but for all the work I put in I could have made one from scratch. Just awful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Built on Practice","review":"Dreyfus is able to write one of the strongest intros to Being and Time because of his background: instead of spending his entire career trying to work out the esoteric details of this text, as many history of philosophy professors do, he as appropriated his understanding into his own unique and important work on modern technologies. The result is that he is able to relate this understanding, although of course it will have its personal emphases (as any intro does... the only text that lets you know truly and fully what Heidegger is up to without a slant, is Being and Time itself), clearly and effectively; other scholars let their specialist debates overly influence and complicate their introductory work.The only work about Being and Time that deserves five stars, however, is Being and Time... and even though this work is notoriously difficult, please do try to read it primarily and then use these aids for clarification if you ares stuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"I was assigned this book as part of a Performance Coaching\\" course...it is by far the most confusing book I have ever read. I get Heidegger's theory and believe in it but Drefus's take on it, in my opinion made it way more complex that it needed to be. I read the whole book and at at the end felt that it was a complete waste of my time. I was not alone in this thinking as we had to discuss our monthly assigned chapters within our small groups and the consenses was the same for all...we had a difficult time discussing something no one understood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the first choice.","review":"Even the Professor himself in his podcast lectures advises to get the William Blattner version first.

The third is Bachlorette, an upbeat tune that even captures Tori's laugh at the end. You know she had fun singing this particular song. This single is one of my fav's.

Earlier that week, she almost tumbles to her death on the stairs. The only witness to that earlier attempt is a fox terrier named Bob. What follows is another delightful PBS and A & E Agatha Christie adaptation in which Hercule Poirot must solve another strange murder. As always, David Suchet is the definitive Poirot, combining humor and humanity in his performance. Hugh Fraser is solid as his befuddled sidekick, Capt. Hasting, and the dog in the title role has loads of cuteness to spare. A must for any Agatha Christie or murder mystery fan. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mikasa Wine glasses","review":"I needed 2 wine glasses that matched the 2 I had broken.

The difference between this and other sitcoms is that the humor is generally fairly low key and conversational (plus no insulting laugh tracks that try to prompt laughter from insipid jokes).

The high point for me was the first season episode where the gang enables underage drinking and tries to relive high school as \\"cool kids\\" rather than losers. This episode was disturbing, complex and very funny. When Danny DeVito comes on board, the show quickly devolves into lots and lots of shouting matches as a substitute for comedy (not DeVito's fault, but more a problem with the writing). Too bad. I give the first disc three and a half stars, but the second one is hard to watch - hence the two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was skeptical, but it really is that good!","review":"There had been a few months where I kept hearing about the show \\"It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia\\", and I had avoided it, because I frankly don't have time to always keep up with shows. Fortunately I eventually relented and decided to watch, and I've been very happy I did. To begin with the show is really about the owners of a bar in Philadelphia and the misadventures the gang has. Now that would be good and dull, except the characters are all incredibly rotten, self-centered people, which ultimately is one of the reasons why this show is so great. The characters will do rotten things to others and each other all for the benefit of themselves, and hilarity ensues. This show is just fresh, and while I haven't been as big a fan of the more recent seasons, The first four I believe are exceptional. I would pick this up to start your addiction if you haven't already, and be sure to keep going to season 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"great purchase","review":"this was a great purchase, quick shipping and reasonable pricing for these seasonsrecommend this seller anytime great gift for anyone who likes its always sunny!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost As Good As Curb Your Enthusiasm","review":"This show is almost as good as CYE. That is saying a lot. Both are tightly plotted and wickedly funny. When Sunny was airing on TV, my biggest complaint is that they had to cram too much plot in during last few minutes. CYE had the benefit of a full 30 minutes on HBO without commercials. Now with this show on DVD, the problem is solved, somewhat. Regardless, I'll be watching Season Three on TV soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting for it to be funny","review":"Our college-aged kids told us how funny this series is so we started at series one to catch up.

When the kids came home they admitted it didn't get funny till Danny Devito comes on the scene, which is NOT on the first CD. False advertising on the jacket with his face the biggest? I guess it serves as character background.

I'll admit, it's not going to be for everyone. If you're looking for a show with substance and meaning, this one isn't for you. But if you want some great original comedy, maybe something to marathon watch on a lazy weekend, this is perfect. Each episode seems to push the boundaries being outrageous further and further. With the earlier episodes you see each character finding their identity with the show, but by the second season they seem to have found their nitche. I'm sure most reviews will compare it to a darker ruder Seinfield, but it's more then that.

If you are a fan of rough chuckles and are a haver of poor taste, this is a winner.One bad thing: 2 of the episodes on the Season 1 disc I received wouldn't play on the DVD player in my living room. I tried it on a couple other DVD players and had no trouble, so I assume the issue is with my player, but that was kind of a drag.

I had heard of the series previously but was only convinced of buying it after seeing an intervewi with the actress. What a suprise: this is a somewhat lesscorrect version of Friends meets My Name Is Earl. I agree that this may not be correct at all since this series has no respect for conventional moarl issues such as lying about having cancer, discovering a friend's grandfather was a nazi.

The charaters are weak, shallow, emontionless, idiotic and lifeless. The sexual episodes lack passion and it appears as if this book was written in a hurry, without any thought behind it, the dialogue was flat and stilted. The so call heroe of the book Jordan Prescott, Viscount Romney was indecisive and naive. The heroine, Margaret Gray, weak and gullible for someone who lived with an evil woman like her aunt Lavinia Gray. and a selfish cousin like Penelope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's Just Relax and Have Some Fun--4.5 stars!","review":"The other reviewers may be taking themselves a little too seriously! This author has a fabulous talent at creating MANY interesting and multi-layered characters we want to know more about, gives us levels of both villians, demi-villians and star-crossed lovers all to enjoy. This is not a deep, emotional family saga that spawns generations--heck, no! We have a male and female lead we care about, the reality of economics for women in 19th century England and acceptance that the most \\"moral\\" person in the crowd may not be the one who truly steals your heart. This is an easy, afternoon or two of reading to leave with satisfaction and a smile for the winning of true love and the punishment of those mean and deserving."},{"rating":"1","title":"What WAS She Thinking?","review":"I can't remember the last time a romance novel was full of so many mean, nasty characters. I usually enjoy Cheryl Holt's books, but I could barely finish this one. The heroine is certainly far more forgiving than I would have been in her place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, unsexy, boring mess","review":"This was my first time reading this author and this is my last time reading this author. The main characters were nasty pieces of work. The male, Romsey (can't remember his first name), could have been written better and given better qualities but the author relied on his non -existent sex appeal. The heroinne was supposed to be the sweet one, but that mess she said about not caring about Romsey's brothers and sisters totally turned me against her and she could not be redeemed later. Romsey's father was a pervert/pedophile and the sex/rape scenes described between him and the 16 yr. old Penelope was disturbing and disgusting. The only good part of the book was when she had his old 54 yr. old perverted butt jailed. Penelope's mother was one of the most evil characters I have read about and she deserved everything she got. Cheryl Holt's writing style is boring and solely relies on her uninteresting, untempting, disturbing, perverted version of erotica."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haven't we read this before?","review":"I love this author, and read everything she publishes, usually a good read. This one not so much. I would swear I've read this already, and had to check the published date to see if it was a reprint. The plot, characters and just about everything else are not an original for Ms. Holt, and I was disappointed to that regard. Still, an entertaining read for a couple of hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Female degradation and sodomy - gross","review":"I'm not picky. I just want some romance, erotica, and a decent story. This book was offensive. Repeated \\"sex\\" scenes that were actually rape, including tying up a young girl (who is a 'villain' but come on) and sodomy. I'm liberal, I'm forgiving, but this book was unforgiveable and just gross and icky. Felt like I needed to take a shower (or 3) after reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot","review":"Despite the popularity of the author, I was not impressed. The romance scenes were some of the most unromantic I have ever read. Relationships appear and disappear without any true warning or any idea what the relationship was like. Most of the characters were rude and did nothing to deserve a happy ending except the main female character.Towards the end the timeline is impossible to follow. Suddenly months go by and the main female is livid at the main male. Then another year passes and the characters, who we had no idea what happened to them, were changed and behaved nothing like the characters who we became attached to. I love character development and believe that they should learn from what happens in the book but these characters were suddenly and dramaticly different with no hinting as to their thoughts or how they became this way. I was not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Convuluted Plot and weak characters","review":"I struggle to find a good romance novel these days. Between the vampires and other paranormal creatures, there aren't many publishing houses printing contemporary or historical novels for the devoted romance reader. When I read the book jacket, I thought I'd discovered a nice steamy historical novel. Unfortunately, I discovered a novel with contrived characters who related to each other for the sake of sex. The heroine was weak, the hero unlikeable and the secondary characters ranged from twisted to evil. In a disfunctional world, I search for strong family relationships, which this novel lacked. A mother who used her daughter for personal gain, a son who hated his father, and a daughter who was self centered she lacked any morals at all. The book was too contrived to finish. I don't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"No developement of plot or characters. Some of the dialogue about how sex is performed is taken almost word for word from some of her other books. Instead of one villian, there are three, which is two too many for this story. I didn't care what happened to any of the characters. No fire, no sizzle, just blah."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book. I have read several of Cheryl Holts books and for the most part enjoyed them. Like most people who read romance novels I enjoy the love scenes, however, there were no love scenes in this book. There were plenty of sex scenes but most of them dealt with degradation of the female and several times they talke about rape and included a scene where an old man ties up a young girl (you don't like her but still..) and rapes her. Even the main characters have sex basically for sex's sake. Not until the end of the book do they even talk about love. I wish I would have just quit reading when I was tempted to in the second chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't waste your time","review":"This is one of the worst books that I've read. The characters are lifeless. The dialogue among them is dull and illogical. The relationships between the characters seem rushed and unexplainable. I could not see where the \\"love\\" developed between the main couple. The sexual relationships were not romantic and were very boring.

Lange is truly a great movie. Lange, a young publishing clerk with too much imagination, pens laughably awful American Westerns in his spare time. His friends at the firm include a beautiful set of quirky and diverse characters. Together, they oppose their corrupt and lecherous boss in a none too subtle political message from Renoir. With an appropriately tender style, he paints light humor and poignant emotions as the workers struggle together."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT MOVIE!","review":"It is a wonderful movie for the whole family.

There is not a person who won't like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pictoral book of Sweden's royal palaces (Swedish/English)","review":"This cocktail table style book presents a number of nice photographs of royal palaces and manors in Sweden. An excellent text of architectural discourse is included in both English and Swedish. Additionally, you will learn much of the royal family heritage, traits, and history. A thin book of only 100 pages with 50% Swedish text. Mycket bra!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it, ASAP!!","review":"I realized that my local radio station kept playing these great songs, and finally put together that I was hearing one voice, Patty Griffin. I looked up her album Flaming Red and found all these terrific songs were on one CD. She is wild, talented, thoughtful, and so far from the stuck-up world of pop! I love every song on it, and I've passed the CD around to a lot of my friends who all agree (an unusual thing among my friends) that she's made a great album. If you got the $$, buy this and treasure it. Your ears will thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another \\"Days of future Passed\\" album","review":"I bought this album based on the song \\"Change\\" that was featured on a free album obtained from a Best Buys store promotion. This is without a doubt another album that is impossible to surpass. Much like the Moody Blues album \\"Days of Future Passed\\" and Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\". I love Rock & Roll from the past, but Patty really brings rock fans like myself into the 90's and soon the millenium. She is one fine talented superlady that deserves recognition and a \\"Grammy\\". Shania Twain, Sheryl Crow, Maddona etc. should look over their shoulder at what is coming! Patty Griffin has arrived! Every song on this album is terrific. I can not remember when I have been able to say this about any album since the well documented & recognized classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful stuff","review":"\\"One Big Love\\" aside, there is something impressively sad about most of these tracks. \\"Tony\\" is particularly poignant, \\"Blue Sky\\" and \\"Christina\\" also have good melodies, and the title song is frantic but pleasing. \\"Wiggly Fingers\\" isn't so hot, and \\"Go Now\\" is an interesting but failed experiment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have for Patty fans","review":"For a long time this was the Patty CD I listened to the least, but now it's become my favorite one to listen to over and over again. It's also so different from the others that it's really the only way you'll hear Patty rock out, since she doesn't usually travel with a rock band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey Tony, what's so good about dying?","review":"This album is incredible. However, the gem on this...and honestly on any Patty Griffin album because it's THAT good...is Tony. When I first got this album, I fell in love with the whole thing, but it's the only song I wanted to hear. The way she belts the line, \\"I know that story, I was sitting right behind you\\" makes my hair raise because it's so amazing. Get this album for every song, because they are all so good. Listen to Tony with special attention, though. It is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have","review":"The first album in years that I can listen to from beginning to end, over and over. The bottom line in \\"Wiggly Fingers\\" hasn't sounded this hot since Hendrix himself did it in \\"Foxy Lady.\\" Everything else on the album will carry you to its own little corner of the universe. Anyone who cares about music will have this miracle in their collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A big change, but a great album!","review":"While the screaming guitars and driving drum-beats of her new album comes as quite a shock to fans of her debut, Living With Ghosts, Patty Griffin gives us a new side of her music that is just as satisfying. Her lyrics and vocals translate well from her all-acoustic norm. I haven't stopped humming \\"One Big Love\\" since I bought the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"This has to be the record to break out Patty Griffin....","review":"Flaming Red is a great record. Songs like \\"One Big Love\\", \\"Change\\", \\"Wiggley Fingers\\", and especially beautiful \\"Mary\\" showcase a very different Patty Griffinthan what was heard pryor to this studio outing. She suretakes some new directions but she is a natural firecrackerand I love the way she takes risks for her art sake. Nopainting or book should be made twice, Patty isn't \\"ripping\\"any other singer off, I'm sure she will be doing the acousticthing very soon, but hey this has some awesome songs thatshould have made Patty a star but it did get her attentionof the BIG GUYS I'm sure. What ever she decides to do its alwaysfirst class, love this singer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply MARVELOUS - wow !!","review":"I know I'm way behind the times but just stumbled upon Patti Griffin's Flaming Red cd. This woman is uber talented. Why she is not a super star is beyond me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patty Griffin is a genius! A true poet.","review":"This album just blew me away. I never thought I would find an album so complete and consistent with greatness. Her lyrical genius is evident in every line of every song. I'm amazed that she's not more well-known than she is. Everyone should hear this album and appreciate true musical genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection","review":"I think Patty may be most talented singer-songwriter making music today, certainly within the female folk-rock category which I love so much. Her lyrics, melodies, voice, guitar, and arrangements are all impeccable. I won't compare \\"Flaming Red\\" to her other albums because each is different, but each is brilliant. Flaming Red is (mostly) electric, rocking Patty, and it might be the best adult rock album of the 90s. In fact, I'll go out on that limb and state that it is! Patty takes you on a musical and emotional roller coaster on this album -- fast and loud, slow and quiet, happy, wild, achingly sad. Play it at high volume and give it your complete attention. Again and again. With each listen you'll discover a subtle musical gem you didn't notice before."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am a newfound fan!","review":"I had never in my life heard of Patty Griffin until I saw the commercial for MXG ONLINE. I heard the song \\"Blue Sky\\" on the commercial and HAD to know who sang it. I did a lot of research and finally found out who sang the awesome song. I am a singer myself so it looks like I've found a new inspiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indescribable Beauty","review":"There is something so touching, so harrowing, so profound in these songs that you simply cannot describe them. Patty Griffin has more than proven herself with these brilliant songs and this gem of an album. \\"Flaming Red\\" is a true diamond in the rough. Listen to any of the tracks, namely \\"Tony,\\" \\"Change,\\" \\"Carry Me,\\" \\"Christina,\\" or \\"Mary,\\" and your heart will soar and sink faster than you can believe. Please trust me on this: this album will change your faith in the tragic beauty of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, Rocking, and A Completely Different Sound","review":"OK, let's all say it together: This album is different from Living With Ghosts! This is mostly a rock album, and yes, slightly overproduced, but it's still Patty's amazing voice, beautiful tunes, and cutting lyrics. I love this album more each time I hear it, and I can't wait to see her live again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Johnny!","review":"I've got a great tale to share with music lovers and concert goers throughout the world. We all know how rare it is to see an opening act that is actually better than the headliner. This was the case when I went to see Johnny Lang perform recently. This woman, Ms. Griffin, blew me away! Her voice carried like an echo across a still lake and her songwriting was very eclectic. She blew Johnny Lang out of the water, the artist I went to see in the first place. While Johnny was running around acting like an idiot, all I could think about was Patty's performance. Buy this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait for her next album.","review":"Every now and then the musical gods figure it's time to send down another gift. Patty Griffin is an exceptional song writer and musician. Her musical variety is on par with Lennon/Mcartney. Yes that's what I said."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must have CD!","review":"I was not sure I was going to enjoy this CD as much as Living with Ghosts, but in fact, I can't stop listening to it! The song \\"Tony\\" brings me to tears every time! I truly think she spread her creative wings and flew with this one, don't miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Patty Griffin evolves and succeeds","review":"If you own Patty Griffin's debut \\"Living With Ghosts\\" be warned that \\"Flaming Red\\" is quite a different creation all together. While her first album is an intimate acoustic collection of emotionally intense songs, \\"Flaming Red\\" showcases an entire band and an electric take on newer songs. Patty's soul is still on the table in the album, it's just a different take on the production and arrangement. I love this album, especially the heart-breaking \\"Goodbye\\" and the amazing \\"Blue Sky,\\" but I think her first album will always be my favorite because of its unique intimacy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely different than \\"living with ghosts\\"","review":"I bought \\"Flaming Red\\" unheard because I absolutely love \\"Living With Ghosts\\". After playing it, I double checked the CD case to be sure I bought the right artist. I miss the calmer emotion from the first album. This one was too loud and not at all what I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much production","review":"If you enjoy singers/songwriters who can carry tunes by themselves (or tiweht minimal assistance by other musicians), go elsewhere. This one is so different from \\"Living With Ghosts\\" it is very difficult to make a comparison. In effect, the folkie genre disapeared on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment.","review":"\\"Living With Ghosts\\" was such a great album that this followup is a huge disappointment. Many of the songs are just loud and distorted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is this?","review":"I first heard Patty Griffin singing on the album \\"1000 kisses\\". Since Ive heard more from this talented singer, and liked what I heard. However, when I put on this disc, I acually had to check and see if I had put in the wrong disc. This album is much louder, with heavy guitars, and an aggressive approach to the songs. That mighyt be OK for some, but I prefer the acoustic type-country flavored songs Ive heard from Griffin. Im all for artists not doing the same thing over again, but this disc just doesnt sit well with me. I like having Griffins voice as the main focus of her songs, and on this disc you dont get that."},{"rating":"1","title":"GHOSTS ARE BETTER","review":"It's a shame that she had to go electric... her first album was so great and now it's a nosedive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flaming ripoff","review":"...of PJ Harvey, but I suppose imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. I'll stick to the real thing, thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Book For Understanding the Foundations of Economics and Proving that Econ is Intresting","review":"This book was hard to put down once you start reading. The syntax and diction bring the points through clearly. The examples that Wheelen gives to support his statements are easy to understand and Wheelen poses the questions that we want to see answered and informs us enough to come up with answers to those challenging questions. The book tackles why there are poor nations to basics for investing in stocks and so much more. I highly recommend this book to anyone that wants to learn about economics in an ways that are not confusing. Really enjoyable read and clever subtitles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, informative, and no so Freakonomicsy","review":"Enjoyed the book. An enjoyable read that was required for my econ 110 class. No graphs = a pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Want to See What Economics Looks At?","review":"I took several economics classes in college (in fact, my major - not used later though), and they were uniformly boring and irrelevant. My profs and the texts taught the math and the basics, but not how to use economic reasoning to look at economic, fiscal, public policy, etc. problems. This was published before the current recession, but the analysis helps to understand what's going on.This book will not help a student pass a class - no propensity to consume graphs, for example. However it is great for the layman or younger econ student to get a good overview of economic reasoning they will not get in classes. Easy to read and funny in parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a pleasure","review":"The best part about reading books by journalists is the readability. In a book on economics, which I neglected to study in college, this is the most important factor. Wheelan breezes through developmental economics, monetary policy and the various aspects of the stock market in about 8 hours of reading. My understanding of economics has been greatly enhanced by this quick read, great in clips of about 60 pages at a time. I've wanted to read a book like this for about 3 years and have truly benefitted from the experience. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Read It Again","review":"I gave this book a bad review in 2006 when I first read it. I just read it again and I kind of feel bad that I did that. Mr. Wheelan did put a lot of work into this book, and I sure as h*ll couldn't write something this good. This book is a good introduction to economics spoken in plain language. It gives numerous real-world examples, things that happened just a few years ago, so it is very current. I guess I expected a more formal treatment of the subject, but I should have just looked at the cover and the title and realized that the approach would be casual and humorous."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG!","review":"This book should be used for nothing more than a popular-definition economics dictionary/paper weight. It's deceitfully clever, and fundamental wrong, wrong, wrong, in so many ways I don't even know where to start. Free trade, the best of ALL possible worlds; the glorious benefits of NAFTA; the WTO our benevolent, selfless, economic overseer. I urge you to read, or at least read the Amazon reviews of \\"Free trade doesn't work what should replace it and why\\". Amazon only has one copy left so you'd better hurry, the truth is in limited supply."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This book is strongly influenced by liberal left ideas. For those who have an interest in learning more about economics, you're better off reading books by Mark Skousen for clear thinking, common sense, and straightforward explanations that are easy to understand. Also, Economics in One Lesson by Henry Hazlitt is excellent. This book is a good one for environmentalists and the politically liberal who believe that markets are best served when managed by the government. The author holds an MPA, the professional government bureaucrats degree.This book should be a big hit in Europe or for out-of-touch central planners, but it's not for the reader who is interested in acquiring knowledge and understanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Village Idiot","review":"This guy thinks it is a good idea for our government to tax everything that has to do with carbon dioxide. We exhale carbon dioxide every time we exhale a breath of air. Global Warming is occuring on Mars. Does that mean that our pollution has affected Mars? lol It will destroy our economy. Why would you want to raise taxes when businesses are already struggling? And if he does not grasp this simple common sense policy, then why would you buy this brain dead authors book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended!","review":"The best book I have ever read about economics. Easy and entertaining to read and at the same time deep and world view changing in its impact. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really wonderful and easy read on economics","review":"Very interesting, simple and funny book that explains the fundamentals of modern economic system. Highly recommended for anyone interesting in reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Econ Intro","review":"This is a great book for anyone who has just casual understanding of how the economy works. Wheelan does an excellent job of connecting the dots of different concepts and institutions that you may have heard of but don't really understand. The chapter on the Fed is especially enlightening. He does a great job of breaking down some of the basics of one of our most powerful institutions. And throughout the book he does better than just aptly explain basic concepts -- he breaks them down in a way that makes them relevant to our lives and interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes ECON an easy and fun subject","review":"I took Macroeconomics my senior year, and I hated it. But when the teacher recommended this book for Extra Credit, I actually got hooked. It's an easy read, and uses high school, or real life examples so anyone can understand. ^^,I'd recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for those who feel the need to comment on ecomomic matters","review":"If I could give one book to every US Senator and Congressman and make them read it, this would be the book. It is amazing how many people do not understand simple concepts like supply and demand. This book put economics in words even a politician could understand. It is a must read if you find economics confusing. It has no math or statistics. I would call it Synoptic Economics."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent read","review":"i highly recommend this title for anyone interested in economics-- from the individual who completely lacks an economics background to someone who already has a strong grasp of the science."},{"rating":"1","title":"Class Reading","review":"Bought this for a class that I would eventually drop. The book was horribly done in my opinion, and found that the Undercover Economist was a much better book reading for the class"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent economics primer!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I congratulate the author on writing a book that educates the reader while delivering an entertaining read. I found the \\"Development Economics: The Wealth and Poverty of Nations\\" chapter most enjoyable. As a math enthusiast, I wasn't sure an economics book without charts and equations would be worth reading. I was wrong, and would recommend this book to anyone wishing to learn about the science of economics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining","review":"I was advised to read this book for one of my classes at grad school, and really enjoyed it. I found it really enlightening and helped understand economic concepts much better. It was also an entertaining read, which is obviously surprising as it's all about economics!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Anecdotes! Spectacular Intro to Econ!","review":"Charles Wheelan's Naked Economics is a great introduction to the world of economics in an easy-to-read, fun non-fictional account. Packed with anecdotes gathered over years of working as a journalist, Wheelan's book won't let one paragraph go by unread. From dormitory diets of pineapple and ice cream to pirates in the Malacca Strait, Wheelan shows everything can relate back to economics. You won't find any supply and demand charts: Wheelan says this book is \\"economics for smart people who never studied economics.\\" The only thing it's missing is a cheat-sheet of important definitions for those \`smart people' to now talk economics with their economy-buff friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Naked Economics","review":"This book is an excellent buy and a great read. Everyone should read this book as it makes concepts of economics easily understandable and interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice introduction.","review":"This is a pretty good introduction to economics for the lay reader. Economics presents a peculiar problem, which tends to complicate any 'explanation' of it: any exposition of economics will tend to include normative economics. This book in no exception.The author, when he sticks to topics that are mainly descriptive, like Comparative Advantage or role of subsidies in impacting international trade or inflation on economic growth, is quite lucid and those portions of the book make for informative and entertaining reading. When the author tackles topics like sweatshops or inserts his opinion of the right policy consequence of a certain economic principle, then he veers into commentary best left out of an expository work. I don't disagree with all of his views, but maybe he could have chosen a different model to undress."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very interesting read","review":"I have been interested in learning economics with the objective of applying it in practical situations and this book was a very good read. There were many concepts which were introduced without \\"buzzwords\\" and it was very easy to understand. Particularly, the parts about policy making and governance were very well explained.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to get an introduction to economics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good and balanced economics intro","review":"This is an entertaining book that does a good job introducing economic concepts. What I liked most about the book was how balanced it was. It is hard to find a book on economics or political economy that is even close to balanced. I think the reviewers who complain about the bias in this book (conservative or liberal) are professing their own bias."},{"rating":"1","title":"Musette from Des Moines","review":"If you're looking for some ambiance music for your French restaurant in Iowa (especially if you have french fries on the menu), then this is the CD for you.

Truly, this CD is about as close to Paris as Wonder bread is to a baguette."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incorrect","review":"The product description for this is incorrect.The package includes 25 stiff DVD Case Inserts, and the LabelWhiz software (and a one page \\"Quick Guide) - THAT's IT!

The story seemed to be thrown together. The dialogue was not believable. The characters were underdeveloped. Melanie Griffith was terrible, Rachel Leigh Cook was terrible. The only worthwhile quality this movie had can be summed up in three little words: Hugh Dancy Naked. He's the most believable actor in this movie. He really does all a person can do with such awful dialogue, but this isn't his best performance. If you're not a Hugh Dancy fan, don't waste your time with this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Stars Merely for Mr. Dancy","review":"This movie is so weak I can barely explain how it has damaged me. It seems to rest somewhere between mainstream and indie styles, but in either genre it is a hollow movie. The only good thing about this movie is Hugh Dancy. I love him as an actor (and it doesn't hurt that he's attractive), but I am horribly disappointed in his choice to participate in this film. Bad Hugh. Slap on the wrist and let's all move on, okay? If you need me I'll be in my room, crouched in the fetal position and whimpering softly to myself. Need.....developed.....script.....NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie is not up to speed","review":"An interesting, but predictable twist centers this film. The three big name stars that are in this film - Melanie Griffith, Rachael Leigh Cook, and Hugh Dancy - all act mediocre in this film.

We're sticking with the print edition.When comparing the Kindle version and the print version, one can see that the only articles in the Kindle version are the ones written by the Houston Chronicle writers. That makes sense, but without the Associated Press content and content from other papers around the country it translates to a tiny fraction of the print edition. We had no idea that the Chron produced so little original content outside of the sports section.We liked the layout, formatting, and ease of use of the Kindle version.

As discussed in the other reviews, there are no syndicated columns, comics, or photos. However, it goes deeper than that. This version of the paper only includes content written directly by the Chron staff. Unfortunately, what that means is while local news is adequately covered, national and world news is not covered in any detail and Texas news is covered somewhat haphazardly.I've had the paper for about a week now. On the typical day, there are anywhere between 1 and 3 articles each in the National and World news sections.

I bought both the paper and kindle version of the sunday paper. I did not recognize the kindle version. I was not concerned about the fluff in the sunday paper but even the news was missing in the kindle version. I worry that selling the kindle version of the chronicle as a newspaper will ruin thekindle reputation. Kindle should not market this as a newspaper with an established name.

For example some of us still like the local writers' columns, and the entertainment items . The content is mostly that sent out from the non-local corporate headqquarters. Wonder if it will survive as a newpaper, either in hard copy or electronic?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Effort","review":"Obviously, with the Houston Chronicle being owned by Hearst, they do not have much of a financial driver to see that Kindle is more successful than another reader they have invested in. It certainly shows! The Chronicle doesn't carry much content, it will switch to Spanish, or even a random alphabet, in the middle of an article and downloads are not reliable. Compare the Chronicle on Kindle vs iPad or the actual paper and it is night and day. I am disappointed the Chronicle and Amazon have not made any real effort to improve the product because I like both Kindle and the Houston Chronicle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the serious news reader","review":"This is the second time I've tried the Houston Chronicle on the Kindle. I canceled the first time due to lack of news content. I thought they made changes and tried again. Still, it has not changed in that regard. The consistent clear winner in content is the sports section. Business is a distant second. So when it comes to local, national, or international news, a lot is left to be desired. Even if Reader's Digest were to do a version of the Houston Chronicle, it'd have more depth that what is published for a Kindle. I'm waiting to read reviews where this serious shortcoming has been corrected."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have an alternative to this skimpy, worthless version","review":"I too have found the content on the Kindle version of the Houston Chronicle to be severely limited and NOT worth the time or the money.BUT you do have a simple alternative if you want a full, electronic version of the Houston Chronicle. Simply sign up at their web site [...] and you can read the full version on-line whenever you like.Another alternative is also available on the newest Kindle. It has an experimental web browser available that works surprisingly well considering it's limitations. Navigation is a bit tricky since you have no mouse and the web site response time is a tad slow but overall it does work and is usable if you want to read your newspaper on your Kindle instead of your PC."},{"rating":"1","title":"unhappy subscriber","review":"After 30+ years of The Chronicle I find myself out of the delivery zone and tried the Kindle version. I find the Chronicle on Kindle has too many errors and is way short of useful info. Articles do not match the headlines, paragrapghs are repeated--sometimes whole articles are repeated under different headers, incorrect hyphenation, isolated characters and inappropriate symbles all make it difficult to read. It gives the horoscopes and lottery results but not the sports scores or the Dow Jones averages. Then of course--no comics!

I then went through it and there was no Content in the Paper. Not even a single article on the Presidents address the previous night. Then I find out that it will go to one kindle so I would have to order 2 copies on for myself and one for my wife.If all of the articles were available I would love to get this without the paper waste, but as it stands this is just digital waste.Wake-up Hearst and look to the new generation and what we will purchase.

But George Clooney should stick to E.R.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lopez and Leonard","review":"Elmore Leonard wrote the book. Which means it's somewhat unusual. Jennifer Lopez proves she's more than a cover on Entertainment weekly. Clooney proves why he should stay on E.R.When this was released the ad campaign was dismal. Obvious plot line. Obvious chemistry. Obvious poster. Obvious, obvious, obvious.But the DVD is worth it for two things. Watch the film, with the scene between Clooney and Lopez in the trunk of the car. And then watch the extra scene that shows an alternative filming of the same scene. Very illustrative of how mediocre can become good, and how chemistry can be created by camera angle, dialogue, and innuendo.Whoever decided to make Lopez into the Cover Star she's been depicted as has done her a great disservice. This film shows a subtle actress, not some Latino Jenny McCarthy.One of those discs where the extras make the purchase worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"You know what they say....first impressions last!","review":"This is not to say that I liked this movie. If your friends recommend you to see this movie, it's probably because of the fact that Jennifer Lopez is a total HOTTIE! It's best if it's OUT OF SIGHT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clooney, Lopez & Soderburgh are Out of Sight!!","review":"This neglected film noir by Elmore Leonard and excellently directed by Steven Soderburgh with a fine script by Scott Frank still didn't quite make it at the box office despite great reviews. Some breakout performances by Clooney and Lopez plus their chemistry and a great cast (Don Cheadle, Albert Brooks, Ving Rhames) make this one a winner. Clooney plays an escaped thief who while escaping from the pen, falls in love with government agent Lopez. Their characters provide the heat but the rest of the supporting cast provide the color. It's been reported that Lopez & Clooney didn't get along while filming this but you wouldn't know this from their scenes together!! The HD DVD transfer of this neglected film noir is excellent and also a bargain at a price under $10.00!! So if you still have an HD unit and haven't abandoned it do get this one. It is definitely OUT OF SIGHT!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch At Your Own Risk","review":"I did not like the film. The believability of it just wasn't there.

The action was minimal, the scenes too long, and the theatrical trailer was no where to be found on the DVD! Believe me, Get Shorty was 3 times as good,and if you want a great crime caper, see L.A.Confidential. Otherwise, don't bother with Out of Sight. I can't believe I bought this."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a disappointment for me!","review":"If you had liked 'Unforgiven', you will probably like 'Out of Sight'.Personally, I found the movie very boring and it is one of those movies produced intentionally to be liked only by movie-commentators."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven and Boring","review":"Good cast wasted on unlikable characters.

The relationship between Clooney and Lopez was phoney and totally unbelievable. I could have cared less if either one was blown off the screen. The premise is stupid. I can't believe it received good reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"unfortunate critical hype","review":"unlike the films critics usually appreciate and rave about, Out Of Sight has no depth, no character development, a laughable plot, and dismal acting. From George Clooney this is expected: the head-bobbing, smugly-grinning has now delivered many a bad performance since leaving the comfortable TV drama series ER. This is a disappointment for Jennifer Lopez fans, since she made a rather strong showing previously in Selena. In the end, this movie leaves you with a feeling that no chemistry was possible between anyone in the story, as well as feeling that nothing has happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible movie","review":"This movie suffers from bad acting, lack of character development, and an insipid plot.C'mon - Jennifer Lopez a federal matshall? Then George Clooney is always George Clooney - nice looking but he's the Frank Sinatra of modern cinema - he never gets beyond who he is.Then there is the plot - which didn't even rate as high as typical sitcom crime story. Sure, the characters almost kill each other and then they fall in love. Right. Happens all the time.I can't believe that Soderbergh made this after King of the Hill, which was a very beautiful movie. Making this must have been to pay some bills or some debts or something that would make him do something totally stupid.At best it is a good example of how Hollywood takes insightful, original, talented filmmakers and gets them to make the typical trash movie, completely comprising their integrity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and shallow...","review":"I don't how this movie got **** so far.

No exciting whatsoever. When I watched it, I tried to feel appreciate like people who bought this movie before me. BUT IT IS NOT THERE. I especially hate the ending because I don't understand. It is like it needs your self-imagination to end it. This is not really the purpose for me to invest on this movie. Or probably too high level for me to get it. Ask me if it is worth for this price. No way. I rate 2 stars for they get good actor (actress). The story is poor (say it one more time)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of Sight - A Fun Watch","review":"Here's a fun, entertaining crime/comedy that's sure to have you jumping and laughing. George Clooney, a pro-bank robber named Jack Foley, gets caught when his old car breaks down in the parking-lot of a bank. Jack gets sent to jail, and from that sparks a wild adventure of avoiding the cops and other criminals. This flick is highly enjoyable...has some drawn-out romance with Clooney and Jennifer Lopez - whether or not that's a good thing or a bad thing, you can decide on your own. If you liked Get Shorty, Pulp Fiction, or Jackie Brown, I bet you'll like this one, too. Based on the Elmore Leonard novel.OUT OF SIGHT is rated R for violence, a scene of gore, language, and some sexualtiy."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES I'VE SEEN IN A LONG TIME !!!","review":"This film was wonderful because it was so different. This film was funny, yet it kept you on your toes to try to follow it. Usually I don't enjoy films that are a hard to follow, but this one was the exception. You will be glad you invested the time to watch. This was like \\"PULP FICTION\\" with all the humor and wit ,but without the unnecessary graphic violence. I loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cool movie","review":"out of sight is a very cool movie.george clooney is becoming a very cool actor.and this movie helped him."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Caper","review":"I was really surprised by this movie. When it first came out, I didn't know what it was or what it was about. I first saw it on television about three years later, so I decided to rent it. When the credits began to roll, I wanted to watch it again because it was so good. The movie was well acted, well written, and well directed. Jennifer Lopez and George Clooney had real chemistry. Scott Frank is one of my favorite screenwriters, and this movie proves it. The cameos of Micheal Keaton and Samuel L. Jackson only spice up the flavor of this well-crafted film. A must for any movie fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of Sight, not out of mind","review":"I should preface this by saying that I am by no means old, so I don't mean to come off as snotty when I describe this film. But this is a movie I would not have liked when I was younger and had less patience for a film. But as time goes by I seem to be able to better appreciate movies that take their time developing the relationships with the characters. This is a fairly slow moving tale, but I do not mean that as a negative. I very much enjoyed the leisurely pace and in the end appreciated how everything unfolded. This is an excellent movie for those of us with patience. Anyone else may be better suited with another title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Detail","review":"I had never seen this film, but had read good reviews of it so I thought I'd give it a shot.It was a very entertaining film, but that's secondary to the fact that the picture quality on this HD-DVD is ASTOUNDING. I wasn't expecting too much from a more obscure title like this, but the clarity and detail is top notch.If you are looking for an entertaining \\"crook and police officer fall for eachother\\" type of film, and you've got an HD-DVD player, you can't go wrong with this title.I found the movie did drag at a few points, which is why it gets 4 stars instead of 5. In terms of the quality of the presentation and the disc itself, I'd give it 5 stars across the board!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, not great","review":"One of the fine aspects of this film is its unpredictability, expressed without self-consciousness or artifice because the surprises are credible. Foley is a character with nuance: Although smart, he does foolish things - like robbing a bank on a whim with his own car for the getaway. The commentary is good too. Picture quality and audio are average. I give 4 stars each for the movie and the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie for multiple viewing","review":"I saw this movie for umpteenth time just recently (my seventh, I think). George Clooney (Good Night, Good Luck,O Brother, Where Art Thou?) is delicious in it, Jennifer Lopez (The Wedding Planner, Selena) proves her rising star power, and Steven Soderberg (The Good German, Ocean's Eleven) as a director manages to delight, as always. This movie never ages and the jokes never become old. I could watch it over and over and be entertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't get it!","review":"I don't know what the big deal was.

CLooney and Lopez are predictable and mumble a lot. Clooney's character is just too smarmy - you love to hate him. For an Elmore Leonard story, astonishingly, this film scored minus 2 for style."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very poorly done movie that's not worth buying.","review":"I was very disappointed in the lack of direction in this movie. At times, it seemed to try and be a comedy, then a drama, then an action film. But in the end it was none of these! I was so disgusted with the fact that I had spent the money for this disk, and couldn't return it because I had opened it, that I threw my copy in the garbage can rather than have it take up space in my DVD collection! Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money either"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something ?","review":"I'm sorry but I thought this was the most over-rated film of 1998. Every single review I read harked on about how great it was so I convinced about five of my friends to watch it at the cinema with me.

When it finally finished I was lucky not to be beaten up in the car park by my former friends. In a word, terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big deal!","review":"After reading rave reviews of this movie, I rushed to my video store and plunked down my money for the DVD--I rushed right back the next day to get my money back.

Time wasted viewing the film, at least I got my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of a Silly Comedy/Romance","review":"Florida bank robber Jack Folely (George Clooney) plays a genteel game of cat-and-mouse with Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez) a stunning federal marshal he meets in the trunk of a getaway car. The Director is Steven Soderbergh (Traffic) who inserts freeze-frames, time-shifting, as well as a hip jazzy-soul music soundtrack.The movie is enjoyable and not too bloody or gory. It focuses more on the romance between Jack and Karen as they go through the cops and robbers chase. More than a bit silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed.","review":"Deadpan, dry and bland.

Watch it if it comes on free tv if you want, but do not buy it for a first viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of 98!!","review":"This movie had it all, great acting, superb editing, and marvelous directing. This movie, yes I love Get Shorty, but this captured the wispy essence between the characters, and how they play, yes play, with each other.

George Clooney, George Clooney, George Clooney."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clooney tries on the Pulp Fiction persona.","review":"This is a 'little' movie, missing the special effect set pieces and explosions of the usual 'Saturday night thriller'. There are some similarities to Pulp Fiction (jumping the timeline for starters) but it's played to low-key perfection by an excellent cast. At last super-slick Clooney is in a role tailor made - the chemistry between ex-ER doc and Lopez is very genuine.Audio and visual reproduction are superb, and special mention must be made of the wickedly hip soundtrack. Bonus materials are very worthy additions and make this thoughtful movie a definite collector's piece. The outtake of Clooney and Lopez in the boot (that's trunk to my American friends) is mesmerising.So go ahead...add some class to your DVD collection that's most likely busting at the seems with asteroids and action men!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"George Clooney is the best actor","review":"I'm a big George Clooney-Fan.

Every time she wakes up she's like \\"Oh darn it. He's gone again. Guess I'll have to start over\\". Critics were paid to give this movie good reviews; there's just no other explanation.

But after reading so many positive reviews, I'm going to start listening to it more. Maxwell is truly a talented and gifetd artist and I wish him much continued success. MGD"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Smooth and Dreamy Listening Experience","review":"Embyra is one of best discs of the year! No doubt about it! It is a solid and completely satisfying listening experience. While the overated Lauryn Hill preached and teached all over the airwaves, Embyra was a warm and welcomed retreat for me! Maxwell has proven that you can be sexy, spiritual, and sensitive without being obnoxious, and self-righteous. This disc succeeds because it lets you FEEL, and be drawn into its warmth. People who want some DEEP, and HEAVY emotional \\"diary entry\\" music should go listen to Alanis or something. Embrya is strictly for those who love innovative beats, mellow vibes, and luscious arrangements. Not to mention a voice as smooth as BUTTER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Max is one cool cat","review":"If any artist is capable of sparking an R&B renaissance, it's Maxwell. Like your dream girl, Embrya is sexy, sublime, sophosticated and lyrically elusive. But you'll keep coming back for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"someone hand this man a rose","review":"Maxwell sure did not let me down. Im glad that the man can experiment with all sorts of sounds and melodies. After all that is how our music evolves and becomes more of an expression of our souls. I am now more sure than ever that talent is before us. Im glad for now I know im not the only hopless romantical head out there. Maxwell has tought me that through his music."},{"rating":"2","title":"QUINTESSENTIAL SOUL!!!","review":"Maxwell has done it again!!! \\"Embrya\\" is one of those rare CD's that you will play from beginning to end, without skipping a track. Wonderful!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love in all her disguises...","review":"What can I say? I love this man's music.

AT LEAST I ALWAYS GET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP AFTER LISTENING TO IT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused the hell out of me","review":"With his first album, Maxwell had the potential to be one of the greats and he almost lost all of it with this album. I do give Maxwell credit for attempting to be different however on this album he confused with the odd song titles and overall mood of the CD. Maxwell wants to be so much more than just another soul crooner, but his gifts become obscured the more he pushes them forward. Maxwell does have a remarkable voice and he can write really good modern soul songs -- it's just that he has a tendency to think that's not enough and then he overstuffs his songs with ideas that lead nowhere which is why this CD floped so hard. Luckily he reedemed himself with Fortunate in 1999 and his thrid CD NOW in 2001. Because this CD almost destroyed a promsing carrer."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Album Stunk Up the Joint","review":"This album was terrible. Imagine soul without the soul. Maxwell passed up the opportunity to make quality music, and opted for pretension. SAVE YOUR MONEY, PEOPLE! I used to be a fan but not anymore. He needs to go find Terrence Trent D'arby and share sophomore slump stories with him."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT?","review":"I LIKE MAXWELL BUTTHIS ALBUM WAS BLENDEDTOO MUCH YOUCAN BARELYTELL THE SONGS APARTFROM ONE ANOTHERTHAT'S WHY I GAVE ITONE STAR IF ONLYTHERE WAS SOME DIVERSITYHERE WITH THE TRACKS I WOULDHAVE GIVEN IT 5 STARS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best since Anita Baker","review":"A true delight to listen to. Maxwell has taken soul music to a level we women have long waited for. The music and lyrics are sophisticated, sensual without being too mushy. He allows the talented musicians to have their jam-session and doesn't allow just his voice alone to be the medium that conveys his emotions to the listener. Sheer liquid poetry. His voice envelopes you both mind and body. Thanx Maxwell!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Album Rocks","review":"After hearing Fortunate, I immediately ordered the the single and this album and needless to say it was not a disappointment at all. I am hooked on Maxwell for life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maxwell is Brilliant!!","review":"Embrya is one of the best I think.. Unfortunately the charts didn't seem to appreciate this album, The best song on Embrya is Submerge in my opinion because he is basically living in a fantasy world about a woman that he wants to be with in the future sexually. To me Maxwell as a person has very good carisma and he doesn't care what is in he just speaks from the heart through his music and personally I feel that artist should take notes from Maxwell..."},{"rating":"2","title":"HE HAS DONE IT AGAIN!!!","review":"MAXWELL MAXWELL MAXWELL! HE HAS DONE IT ONCE AGAIN. THIS BROTHER IS SO DEEP, SO SMOOTH, HE IS SURE TO BE AROUND FOR A WHILE. EMBRYA IS A VERY SMOOTH LAID BACK CD. THIS IF DEFINATLEY ONE FOR THE COLLECTION. EMBRYA DOESNT GRAB YOU RIGHT AT FIRST, BUT ONCE YOU LISTEN TO IT A COUPLE OF TIMES YOU WONT BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH WITHOUT HEARING IT AGAIN. THIS ABLE IS VERY SMOOTH. THE MUSIC IS VERY SOOTHING. EMBRYA WILL PROBALLY APPEAL TO AN OLDER AUDIENCE. HIS LYRICS MAKE YOU BLUSH BECAUSE HE IS SO IN TOUCH WITH HIS FEELINGS. IT IS SO REFRESHING TO HAVE AN ARTIST EXPRESS IN SUCH A DEEP WAY. \\" I LOVE MAXWELL\\" LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT RELEASE. PUT IT IN YOUR COLLECTION!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Had to have it!","review":"I knew immediately when I heard one track on this album that I had to have it. Maxwell has done it again, I fell in love with *Urban Hang Suite* and it's Unplugged version, with *Embrya* the love affair continues and deepens. We have found our Marvin Gaye and Teddy Pendergrass for the 90's. For all the men I know trying to dis my man Maxwell, they need to chill and take a few lessons in sensuality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, but not as good","review":"I preferred the previous album to this one. I do definitely like this release but not as much."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was expecting better...","review":"I love Maxwell, I really do, but this album is going way out there. WAAAAAAYY out there. He still brings the same sweet groves that make you want to melt (including whispering Spanish over an enchanting beat) but it doesn't seem to have the same energy as his previous albums. But.... I will always be a Maxwell fan. The album is good, but look for a slight change in The 'Fro to sound a bit different. Still the same sexy grooves that made you love him in The Urban Hang Suite, definately worth the dough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cyrano who?","review":"The title says it all. In a world preoccupied with \\"ice, dime pieces, and whips,\\" we can finally celebrate the birth of cognitive soul. Ten seconds after I pushed play, I knew the album would take me to a world of unlimited possibilities - the mind. Maxwell has taken the burden off those who agonize over the \\"right words\\" to express their joy, their pain, their love, even pure lust. You can pop in the CD, dim the lights, and speak from the heart - without uttering a single word."},{"rating":"2","title":"refreshing","review":"I wasn't a big fan of Maxwell. After listening to this CD, I was amazed at the level of tranquility Maxwell's music provided. All of the songs were new and without comparison to any previous music I've listened to. In life we all need refreshing and this album provides just that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SENSUAL, SENSUOUS AND DELICIOUS TO THE SENSES","review":"Since the dawning of Urban Hang Suite, MTV Unplugged, Luxury:Cococure The Syndrome and now Embrya, I have become a true \\"can't go to sleep and can't wake up without my Maxwell\\" fan. Maxwell's music is the type that wraps you in a blanket of warm sexuality, holds on tight, and is good to the last drop. The lyrics and music is smooth, sensuous and envelopes you in a cocoon of sensuality, peace and tranquility. Whether you're relaxing in a luxurious bubble bath or spending time with that special someone, Maxwell's music surrounds you and soothes was ever ails your heart. Maxwell is not afraid to express his sexuality, spirituality and anything that's in between. I hope that we will continually be blessed with evidence of his musical talents. And that he will continue to grow in himself as well as his music and not subside into what others what him to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maxwell is One Of A Kind","review":"I must admit that I was skeptical of this CD. I didn't care too much for the \\"Somethin-Somethin\\" remix on the Love Jones CD, but boy boy boy. This CD will keep you mellow and still high. The instrumentals are even \\"Maxwellish.\\" I love this CD, and I can't get enough of the Max."},{"rating":"2","title":"This albulm really takes you to a higher place of sexuality","review":"On first hearing this albulm, I felt a little let down. I think I was definitely expecting \\"hang Suite\\" part 2. But what I got was much more subtle, sweet, and sexy. a fan of Maxwell's since the Summer of '96, I have been awaiting this albulm's arrival. \\"Embrya\\" is nothing less than a gem: refined and beautiful. I can't say that I recommed one song over the other ( I ,of course, have my favorites), but \\"Cococure\\" and \\"Shouln't Know\\" are ones that inspire me. Maxwell's effortless falsetto and tight and subtle musicianship should never be overlooked. If you want to seduce anyone and appear to be smoothe, confident and nonchalant about it--check this albulm out. He is definitely, the bomb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maxwell's House: Good to the Last Drop.","review":"\\"Embrya,\\" the followup to Maxwell's \\"Urban Hang Suite,\\" is a traffic-stoppingly beautiful collection of soothing soul that's as much a masterpiece as his debut. The album plays like a dreamy sequence of moods and events, all woven together by relaxing rhythms, seductive vocals, and well-done arrangements. Most sophomore albums disappoint by lazily rehashing formulas that already worked before. Not Maxwell's. \\"Embrya\\" is a confident step forward, and while the sound is definitely his own, the vibe is much more mellow and laid-back this time around. Tracks of note are the lush and elegant \\"I'm You: You Are Me,\\" the sensual love jam \\"Submerge,\\" and the hypnotic ballad \\"Know These Things: Shouldn't You.\\" In my school of music, \\"Embrya,\\" like its predecessor, gets an A."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maxwell, the King of Neo-Soul!","review":"Maxwell is the sexiest singer on this planet. I love all of his CDs and his songs are SO deep in meaning. You can't go wrong with \\"Luxury:Cococure\\" or \\"Gravity...\\". Keep inspiring us with your music Maxwell, I'll be the first in line!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great overview","review":"the graphic bible provides a great easy to read overview of the biblical geography and story line intermixed. it helps provide a frame work for which to place further biblical reading. even though the text is old and current scholarship my question some of its details, i still rely on this text as a great book for new bible readers from children to adults. the maps really help you understand the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angels in Savannah -- A Modern Day Fantasy","review":"When I first read this book I felt a sense of poetry and mysticism that appealed to me. I knew that Savannah was the backdrop, but the story had a universal appeal. Condon clashed with good and evil in a city filled with ghosts.We have a twin in heaven and that twin aids or hinders us through life. This book is a solid addition to a library -- a great read and fine second book by this author.

The music is simultaneously inspiring, relaxing, moving - a joy to the ear. Classical, yet not overbearing; traditional, but not stuffy. Elegant and fun.

In fact, information is duplicated throughout the book as if to fill empty space. It seems at times the content serves as a commercial for the timeshare industry, and the ARDA association.

Not worth my reading time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A photographer!?!? with questionnable intellectual honesty","review":"I meant to give a rating below 1 Star but since this is the lowest, I hope that potential readers won't throw away their hard earned cash in buying this book. If you still want to buy it, go to your local bookstore as you will have a greater chance of finding a DUSTY copy of this book: ... ... G.P. Barbieri is without contest a good snapshooter if one judges it from the TECHNICAL quality of his work. But where he fails is in his intellectual honesty: How could ... a book [like this be about ]Madagascar if it only contains mediocre nude or semi-nude works done at few huts at the shore of Madagascar? I think and agree with many readers ... that not only exploited and disrespected his subjects by including them in the wrong publication, but he has also made a disservice for all photographers out there who at least have the decency of intellectual honesty and respect to the art.

Despite the departure of Glenn Hughes to Deep Purple this still rocks! Mel and Tom Galley together with Dave Holland, who would move to Judas Priest down the road, have an excellent selection of music and lyrics here. Great tracks are \\"Midnight Flyer\\", \\"Turn It On\\", and \\"Back Street Love\\". This is a little different sound than earlier works, but a great breath of fresh air with a driving beat. Try it! You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top shelf","review":"I love this album.
