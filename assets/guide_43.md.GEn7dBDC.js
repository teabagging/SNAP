Hundreds of misfires on the OBD2 counter. Searching the internet revealed I was not the only one having problems with bosch plugs in explorers. Just to be sure, I also cleaned the MAF sensor and checked for vacuum leaks. Replacing these with autolite APP103 cured the misfire. I suspect the \\"no gap required\\" is not a hot enough spark.

San Quentin is great, but the prisoners call for an encore and Johnny obliges, but why put it on the album? Has this ever happened before or since? I kept thinking 'maybe a riot will break out or someone will get shivved mid-song' but no, it is virtually the same. If I were locked up in San Quentin for twenty to life then I would happily sit through it forty times, but on my record player if and when I want an encore I can just lift the tonearm back a quarter inch. The version of Folsom Prison Blues is basically just Johnny thanking everyone then he sings the chorus once then leaves the stage. Ripped off - one of my favourites. Instead of San Quentin twice, Folsom once would have been great.Ok rereading that now, \\"extremely disappointing\\" is too harsh, the versions of \\"Walk the Line\\" and \\"Boy Named Sue\\" and \\"San Quentin\\" Version No. 1 are must haves. \\"Annoying\\" is more accurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value, excellent product","review":"I purchased this product after a great deal of research.

I've gotten on and off a few times in the space of a minute and the readings were always the same.The Escali is a high capacity scale, when others top out at 330lbs or 350lbs - a plus in my case. But better than that, this product was relatively cheap compared to other scales from Weight Watchers/Conair, Tanita, Health O Meter, and LifeSource. Many of those brands with high capacity were up in the $100+ range.If anyone wants an economically priced, high capacity scale that does exactly what it advertises, then this is the scale for you.It is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleak Design","review":"Well designed product with a solid build.

Having used this scale for about 3 months now, it's time for me to add to add to the negative reviews. When it works, it's great (note that we were not looking for the body fat/water analysis - only a good quality high capacity scale). However, we seen it eat through batteries as some of the other reviewers did (I think in 3 months we've had 4 or 5 sets - I lost track) - we actually have resorted to taking out the batteries when not using it. Also, we have had numerous problems where the scale continually cycles through \\"setup\\" mode when you tap it to turn it on - when this happens, you can't weigh yourself. This symptom started out happening infrequently, but now happens most of the time. Today was the last straw - I tried for about 10 minutes to get it out of this mode before I gave up - will buy a new scale today."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it!","review":"WE got off to a great start when it told me I weighed less than our old, doctor's office type scale.If one actually bothers to read the directions, it is very simple to use and so far seems to give consistent measurements.Unlike some scales, it doesn't jump around if you don't stand stock still, but settles in on a consistent weight.It can be a bit unstable, so older folks may wish to think twice if they have balance probs. Or if they need a scale with grips.. this is beautiful clear glass or somesuch and might be slippery if you have wet feet.Other than this caveat, it is recommended.One thing which could be better is remembering the weight and body fat measurements from last time... it doesn't do this.UPDATE: Almost 3 years later, it is still working.

New batteries last between 1-2 weeks. The last set only lasted 3 days. Definitley something wrong. Its not worth shipping back for repair. I bought a new scale with less features.

The only problem is the reading varies by 10-15 pounds a day. Hey man, I don't vary that much in a freaking day. I'm not eating entire sides of beef. Crikey, what gives with this thing? Now, granted, there is variance with meals and evacuation, but not THAT much.Yes, I'm a big boy at 6'1\\" and 340 (according to a real reading at the doctor's office) but despite the fact that this thing has the capacity to handle even the biggest buffet experts/heavy hitters, it's pretty much useless for getting an accurate weight reading.Skip this and buy the Bigfoot Scale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"First of all, you can hardly read the weight because the number changes so fast. It's like a blur. All you can do is watch them change and try to come up with some kind of average. Also, it's a PITA to use - the \\"interface\\" - where the buttons are - are hard to find and hard to reach and hard to use. The manual is terrible. I never had any idea what mode it was in or how to change it. Confusing as hell. And most of all, if you're a fat person like me (and why else would you buy a high capacity scale?) the design is TERRIBLE because you have to lean forward to read the numbers, which throws the whole weight off. If you're like me and can't see your toes without leaning forward (which is why I bought the scale!), definitely skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A reliable, durable scale","review":"Finally after running through many scales that have a different weight each time you step on them, this scale has exceeded my expectations. My larger husband is able to get accurate readings! My weight does not change! It's large enough to stand on comfortably, even for a somewhat larger person. I haven't used the other features beyond the first week or so, but I am satisfied with the purchase for the accuracy and capacity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really inconsistent weight","review":"Review update: After 7 months, this scale no longer works; it does not display a weight, only slashes across the screen. Previous review: I do not recommend this product. I've had the scale for around 6 months. I was really excited to get it so I could measure changes in my weight and composition. While I really like the features such as having your own user settings with height, age, weight, body fat %, and water %, I find that the most important part, accurate and consistent weight, is missing. Today I weighed myself 6 times: 191.4, 192.0, 190.6, 193.0, 189.0, 191.6. I can probably guesstimate by throwing out the outliers and using the average of the others, but who would want to weigh multiple times and average them together each time? The inconsistent weight has a more dramatic effect on body fat % than on actual weight, so it's hard to get a consistent reading on it. I say first and foremost, choose a scale based on weight accuracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unstable and unsafe and complicated","review":"This scale is classy looking with a glass surface and feels smooth.It is not easy to set up and complicated.It is also unstable and wobbles and could cause a fall.If you are wanting a pretty scale that you must use caution when weighting this would be good but it flips up when stepping off the scale if your not careful.I did a search for talking scales and this one came up.However it does not speak and has many modes and selections to choose from and is very difficult to use.I would not recommend this for someone who was at a risk for falling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this scale!","review":"Very easy to use scale and well worth the price.

The functions are sufficient and correct (I compared to my old scale). I do wonder if one really needs 10 different profile settings and if they could have instead put more detail into how you access the fat&water measuring part? I find myself a little clumsy getting it right but it may just be me. What really annoys me though is that it is apparently not water-proof according to the manual. I was going to place the scale in my bathroom and I believe that would be the most common place for a scale. However the manual says to keep the scale away from moisture. So I don't want to risk it. Also, it does not work on carpet, only on a hard ground like bathroom tiles....Now I have to carry my scale from my bedroom into my bathroom when ever I want to use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Scale","review":"This is the best scale I have ever had.

When you step on it, it can very suddenly flip up resulting in a twisted or broken ankle. I would never give this to an elderly person or anyone without quick reflexes. In fact, I would never give this or recommend it to anyone at all. For the do it your selfers out there and those that insist on living dangerously, I would highly recommend attaching a rubber or vinyl self adhesive door bumper on the underside, both sides. Since this is an electronic scale and not mechanical, doing so won't interfere with the performance. If this isn't an option, always step on the middle first and slowly shuffle your feet to the contact pads. I'd also recommend holding on to a safety bar when using this. Better yet, don't buy this at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got 2 Lemons In A Row","review":"This scale was off by about 25 pounds. My wife and I have been dieting recently and we were discouraged by our weight after we first got this scale, since it seemed kinda high.Well, she went to the doctor the other day and her weight was 25 pounds lighter than what this scale was telling her. She went to a friends house and tried that scale as well, which agreed with the Doctor's scale. So, we sent it back in.The second scale we got reported the same off weight as the first one; 25 pounds difference in the 5 minutes it takes my wife to weigh herself at home and then weigh herself on her friend's scale.Don't buy it unless you enjoy subtracting 25 from everything it tells you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"Unfortunately, I have been very disappointed by this product.

It looks and works like it is worth more than I paid. Some negative reviewers complain about its operation but they must've gotten lemons or the company has since fixed the issues, as I've had mine since 2010 and have not yet changed batteries and have had consistent operation throughout. The body fat reading helps me to still see particular progress between diet, (taking in less fattening stuff) and exercise, as I tend not to show as much weight loss through exercise alone because the increased muscle weight. I am no health expert but this scale has been a motivator for me to stay on it. I plug my info into my iphone \\"Runkeeper\\" app and this also keeps me going. I am sure there are other scales that do all this but this one looks great too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misadvertised maximum weight capacity.","review":"This scale has 4 sensors at each of the feet which hook into the main computer; it averages the weights of these scales to determine the users weight however the rigid glass construction does not allow for even distribution of weight among the sensors which causes one or more of them to go over-weight and error out. Below 380 pounds the scale is accurate but over that it craps out. Unless you are perfectly balanced you will not get an accurate reading.I purchased this model to replace a Tanita HD351 which worked up to 460 pounds; I have gone from 550 down to near 400 and have weighted myself on everything from Gym scales to the industrial kind you find in a warehouse to doctors office scales. What makes the Tanita work is the large platform; you place your feet near the center and the metal top distributes the weight evenly amongst the 4 sensors; it's the difference between balancing on a metal ball and a balloon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after 7 months of use.","review":"This scale has quit working despite the fact that I only used it on occasion.

I use the pre-portioned packs and it does make great popcorn ... the question I have is for how long.I am just finishing up my second case of popcorn (48 total portions) and both levers inside the unit broke off within a week of each other. These breaks are not caused by hard use, but due to the heat causing the plastic to become brittle and crumble. I now must use a hot pad from the kitchen to keep from burning myself in a very tight space. In figuring the amount of popcorn I've popped, I consider mine still a new appliance.

I think it took me longer to unbox the unit than it did for me to get the kettle in and start it up. I used the Great Northern 4oz packs, which were great.Only thing I wish was that the kettle was easier to access while putting in the oil / kernels / flavoring, and easier to clean.

Jeter also doesn't seem to be upon the Bladerunner side as in the novel he openly mocks the question of Deckard being a replicant.No, if you want a true sequel for the Bladerunner movie, instead try to find the Bladerunner PC game from the mid-90s. It feels like Bladerunner much more than any of Jeter's dreadful novels.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent, but inconsistent. Doesn't live up to Scott or Dick.","review":"BR2 was, overall, an enjoyable read. It succeeded in keeping me guessing what exactly was going on, but left me disappointed with it's resolution.The book draws heavily on images, characters, and dialogue from the movie, with a little help from Dick's novel. As with some of the Star Wars novels, however, this feels like a mantra used to evoke something without full justification. It also seems to be asking for someone to make a movie sequel out of it, being writen in an almost cinematic style.Blade Runner (the movie) and Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep both had their amazing qualities, and the creation of BR from DADoES was an impressive feat. By trying to reunite the two, Jeter does both a disservice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blade Runner 2: The Edge Of Human.","review":"This book is the sequel to the movie not a sequel to Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?, for being what it is it's a very good continuation, there are a couple of things that bothered me but were background elements, not anything to do with the story itself, I would really like to know what other people think about this book, not many people have reviewed it even though it's selling. I don't suggest you to read the third book, unless you are a hardcore fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great.","review":"This is the 3rd installment in the Bladerunner series.

Some scenes seem very similar to the premise of Bioshock, the new highly acclaimed game for the XBox 360."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I have ever read","review":"I purchased this book hoping for an intelligently written sequel to the \\"Blade Runner\\" movie. Instead, I got a terribly thought out and unimaginative piece of trash that I couldn't bring myself to bother finishing. In the movie, Sebastian is killed by Roy, and Pris, a replicant, is killed by Deckard. But wait, in the sequel both Sebastian and Pris have miraculously survived; come on, please, let's be a little more unimaginative. Also, we're supposed to believe that Pris wasn't a replicant, or at least the body that was found wasn't. Another flaw is that at the end of the movie we are lead to believe that Rachel's life span isn't like other Nexus 6's, it is more ambiguous and not defined, but in the book that is throw out the window.To quote Dorothy Parker, I believe, \\"This is not a novel to be put down lightly, it should be thrown with great force.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"I was extremely impressed by Jeter's sequel. The essence of the film and paranoia of PKD was repackaged very well. Like Dick's works (of which I have been a rabid fan for a decade and a half), EoH has stirred up some pretty polarized opinions. It's highly creative, despite resorting to resurrections of (actors) character images, if not particular examples. Umm...did somebody say Hollywood? I've heard this called the Grisham syndrome... but I digress. Like PKD in the 70s, each new encounter turns the tables on everything the protagonist has been told. Fabulous. Now, if only the next book wasn't so flawed..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"Mr. Jeter did a good job in presenting Ridley Scott's gloomy \\"feel\\" of the futuristic Los Angeles.

It was an awesome combination. The Treo 90 Leather flip case is about next to useless. It barely holds anything (2 credit cards, 4 if you really want to cram them in, a few business cards and 2 dollars bills if you fold them up real small) and it about triples the thickness of the Treo. The billfold case for the Visor did the same thing but it would at least hold 9+ credit cards and a bunch of cash and papers in the money section. The Treo 90 Leather Flip Case is not worth it. The problem is, there really isn't anything else available as of this date (10/2002) that can used as an alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Case is a bad fit","review":"This case didn't fit well at all. The bottom left of the unit kept popping out and when I forced it in the unit popped out at the bottom. Also it comes in a plastic sleeve that you have to cut with a scissor. This makes returns very difficult. Save your money and wait for a slim bi-fold case."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay.","review":"The wallet adds girth to the handheld, which takes away from the best feature of the treo 90 - its puny size. It's a good case to store the handheld in for a backpack, or a briefcase, and it has spaces for credit cards and memory cards, but you have to remove the protective cover to use the wallet. The buttons, which are usually protected from being pressed, are not protected in this wallet. The flap folds down over the screen, but it's not a great design. I own this and also the sports case and I usually only use the sportscase. Althought the sportscase is too large to keep it housed in and fit into your frontpocket, I just carry around my Treo90 out of its case as it's so small anyway and is protected by its cover window. When I return it to my backpack, I keep it in the sportscase. I wouldn't recommend this wallet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great product","review":"I bought this product regardless of the poor reviews it received. I have not had any problems with the case fitting. My treo 90 fits snugly in the carrier and snaps easily. You can shake it or whatever and it stays in place. The plastic cover must be removed before using it in the leather case, but the cover isn't necessary once the treo is in the leather case. I'm not sure if Handspring has improved the case since the other reviewers bought one, but I did not experience any of the same problems they had. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to protect their treo 90 with a compact, high quality case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Fit","review":"Looks good in the picture, but this case was a huge disappointment!! I agree with the other reviewer that the case does not fit well with the treo 90. It's supposed to be custom fitted, but it's not. When I placed my treo into the case, not only was it NOT snug, but there was A LOT of extra room on the sides. I think Handspring did a very sloppy job at measuring this case. Also, you have to remove the flip lid, which I particulary like, in order to use it. The Treo 90 is a wonderful product. This case, however, is not worth the money. Please wait until an adequate case hits the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius and a true artist","review":"Attila was a my former teacher, and a close friend for many, many years.

Coupled with Amazon Prime, I received the discs relatively fast and spent no time before opening them to begin enjoying.The first few seasons of the series have a bluray quality that is not so advanced as newer movies and TV shows but I am assuming this is because of earlier high definition technology not being as advanced as it has become in the past few years (first season was in 2006!).

Initial charater development is next to nonexistent, and following character dialogue is somewhat akin to finding one's way around a corn maze at midnight. He uses what seems to be an alsmost experimental approach to dialogue, and no two are formatted the same. Sentence structure is immature and disjointed. Its either incredibly simple, or so complicated it becomes difficult to follow. Some character situations are wildly implausible even for sci-fi, or underdeveloped to the point that they seem so.

Fortunately, I rented the game before I bought it, so only a few dollars wasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the first Sonic Rush","review":"I've been playing Sonic games since the original came out, but I feel like the DS versions really give you the sense of speed that you should feel when playing Sonic.I like this better than the first Sonic Rush because the music is not as annoying.It also has stages where you have to ride ships to get to a destination (in 3D) but I don't see myself playing those again for fun anytime soon.The replay value is high though - there are lots of challenging missions and its hard to resist the urge not to get an S rank in every level.Also two playable characters - Blaze and Sonic - keep things interesting enough.The reason I like playing Sonic games is because they give me a break from the often slow-moving RPGs I play, and this one gets the job done. You can clear levels ridiculously fast, and that's why I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sonic has returned!","review":"This game brings Sonic back in the way I remember. It's FUN. Sonic begins his adventure when an Australian-accent wielding girl raccoon (yes, I said WIELDING, because her accent is written out on the screen, and it's slightly annoying at times) finds him and Tails on the beach. After a little chat with the girl, The game play begins, and you are given smooth controls, awesome tricks, quick directional changes in movement for fast-paced action, and lots of hidden secrets. There are many unlockables, like new vehicles, secret levels, missions, and even stuff that's kind of cheesy like a statue of Sonic. There's so much in this game that I can't say all of it, but everything about it is fun! I highly recommend it to any fan of Sonic or of going FAST."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"I recently purchased these along w/ the original 5 piece measuring spoons.

This Bat House well made, it is important to buy from certified organization, because it is like buying animal cage - 1st of all it should be safe.

I contacted seller to no avail. Hard to believe it is actually made of exterior grade plywood the way that it disintegrated.

It is pretty heavy. It is very sturdy also, but I have one problem. There is some cosmetic damage on the metal area that is close to where the plastic area begins. I think it's ok but I hope there is nothing wrong with it. This is my first professional buffer. Another thing is that when the buffer spins down I hear some grinding. I don't know if this is normal.

It falls very short of the mark.True, in its pages you will recognize all those people who hem you in or hold you up. But you will perhaps also recognize what I did: deep bitterness. I'm 3/4 through the book and have been almost stunned at all the examples of, asides about, and ungloved swipes at movie industry people. Other blocking personalities are treated with a bit of remove and wry humor. But when JC launches on the movie-industry-specific examples, her venom and bitterness seep through.

Their are subtle jokes laced within jokes throughout the record, my favorite of which is a pizza order attempt in one skit that is tied into the Nick Danger piece later on.Also, \\"The Further Adventures of Nick Danger,\\" the longest installment of this character on record, is over 12 minutes of absolute rediculousness, in the best possible way.Although some bits are less funny for those such as myself, who weren't alive when it was recorded, it is an excellent buy. I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stream of consciousness is funny for 30 seconds.","review":"I suppose if you're really really stoned, this is funny.

Yet, they do not necessarily pass the \\"classics\\" test, that is, the reaching out and grabbing of audiences with the current day mindset. Any popular history of America, especially in the chapter covering the 1960's, has to give the Firesign Theater its due.

I had to read this for my History of Western Civilization class in college. I thought it was going to be boring and dry, but soon found myself consumed by it. It's hilarious, fast-paced, romantic and thought provoking. What impressed me most was that a person of today can easily relate to the way Apuleius thinks and acts. I had always imagined Greeks walking around in togas endlessly philosiphizing in white marble temples, but here we are presented with the how similar our thoughts and daily activities are to how theirs were. It allowed me to see historical figures in a new way. I think that being able to laugh (heartily) at the same jokes is indicative of how alike our minds are to theirs. Again I recommend this to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 1/2 stars.","review":"there's a line of thought that's been floated out there that big brother & the holding company were not up to par with the talent of janis joplin. bunk. while nobody is going to accuse them of possessing any amazing facile grace on their instruments, the fact remains that ms joplin made her most powerful music with these boys. CHEMISTY here trumps technique. big brother's raw sprawling sound perfectly compliments janis joplin's wild vocals. she sounds possessed by some spirit of liberation at times here, shrieking a juxtaposed answer to the musicians fury. her performance seems to draw an energy from the wicked sounds being produced around her. this entire album is a wild rock and roll ride, and a must for all collections. the work she produced after big brother & the holding company seems tame in comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"A must-have if you love Janis.

If you like rock and roll you must hear it. If you like it, check out Etta James, who Janis Joplin owed a lot to--a good place to start would be Etta's \\"Her Best\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Sister!","review":"First of all, fantastic lead guitars from James Gurley (chaotic noise) & Sam Andrew (melodic noise), both inexplicably overlooked despite being perhaps the finest, most radical guitarists on the '67 Frisco scene, including the overrated Jerry 'Captain Trips' Garcia himself. And only one singer could hope to compete with & even dominate all that glorious noise, and here she is! Now if I could only decipher the words to \\"Combination of the Two\\"...Finally, a little note to that music fan everybody's ganging up on, the one who thinks Janis \\"couldn't sing\\": There's a difference between SINGING and VOCALISING. Whitney Houston (or Mariah Carey, or whoever) is a vocalist, with a truly incredible voice. And you can keep her, 'cause she ain't no singer. And Janis was. (Aretha too!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Continuation of previous review","review":"Well, unfortunately, a reviewer of this CD has missed the entire point of Janis Joplin's singing style. I say, good for his dad for listening to a classic album, the #1 psychedelic album of all time in my book! And believe me, Manson, King, McLachlan, and Nicks know nothin' about the blues when compared to Blues Mama Janis!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic.","review":"I feel this is one of the best albums by Janis Joplin, Big Brother and the holding comp what a great band. A must for the collection of 70s music."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Like a Ball and Chain...\\"","review":"A classic release, that must be said. Big Brother & the Holding Company was a passable group at best, but Janis Joplin was something different entirely, singing every word like her life depended on it. Okay, we've established Janis was a great singer. But how's the material? Awesome. We all know and love Piece of My Heart and Ball and Chain, easily the two top songs on Cheap Thrills. But two more songs get the highest possible rating. First is Summertime. I've never really liked this tune, but the way Janis belts it out, I make an exception! Turtle Blues is a great blues song, again with Joplin's fine vocals. But every song on Cheap Thrills is strong, making this a must-have for sure"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of Janis Joplins great songs","review":"It is Janis Joplins group, Big Brother and the Holding Company, Janis Joplins songs are now taking off. Her career is cut short by a drug overdose while on a concert tour. Many of our singers and sports stars cannot handle the sudden influx of a lot of money and we lose them to drugs and airplane crashes and car crashes."},{"rating":"2","title":"PRETTY GOOD BUT ITS NOT A JANIS JOPLIN ALBUM","review":"I got this CD for only 8 bucks I Think and its a pretty good album from the late sixties and all the bonus tracks are great. but in catalogs I see that under this album they say \\"Cheap Thrills\\" By Janis Joplin. That just pisses me off. I know Janis Joplin is in the band, but the band has a name and its not Janis Joplin. I mean you don't call an Amboy Dukes' album Ted Nudget or a Humble Pie album Peter Frampton. Anyway its worth your money if you like the acid/psycadelic sound of the late sixties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uck","review":"I love the voices of Shirley Manson, Carole King, Sarah McLachlan, Stevie Nicks, and yet you rank Janis number ONE???? Her voice is so awful and it takes her a whole minute to go through one sentence on most of her songs, and she's probably a hick. This album wasn't good at all. My dad listens to it all the time, and I think the songs weren't thought out right and that they didn't fit together. and then, JANIS! Misewell put me in a rubber room if i have to listen to that God-awful voice. ARETHA FRANKLIN is a good voice, not JANIS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got Janis?","review":"I recently revisited this album (my edition pre-dates the bonus tracks, but even so), and I was pleased to find that it still hasn't really aged all that much, considering the material is nearly 40 years old (and in the case of \\"Summertime\\", considerably older!).The case could be made that Janis never really made what you would call a 'perfect' album. And although the critics at the time of its initial release hated Big Brother as the backing band, I have to say that they suited Janis' style perfectly. Not that they could work with any other performer, as Janis wasn't a strict \\"blues\\" singer, nor was she what you'd call \\"polished\\".\\"Combination Of The Two\\", \\"Summertime\\", and \\"Ball And Chain\\" still sound great, even after all this time. Eschew the overpriced box sets and buy this album instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grab that gun","review":"I was reminded of Morrissey while listening to this. A female version that is. Definitely a good cd musically - lyrically it blows starting with song three. The first two songs are absolutely amazing.

I would definitely purchase another album by them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parallel Lines North of the Border","review":"OK, I'll bite -- every generation deserves its Parallel Lines and, my God, how the Organ does sound like Blondie from that era.

There is nothing original or daring about this release, and the songs aren't that great either, and all sound the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get digitally remastered version","review":"Knowing there was a problem in CD sound quality, Streisand's sound engineer John Arrias did a remaster in 1994. He used the video master as his source. This CD can be identified by a one inch square white sticker on the CD case that reads, \\"Digitally Restored From The Original Master Tapes Digitally Remastered\\". (See also customer image.) One cannot expect digital state of the art sound from an analog original in 1968, however, the vast majority of listeners should be pleased. The ambiance from recording outdoors, the audience involvement and emotion of the performance are all there. For more information Google \\"John Arrias Streisand Central Park\\".I don't know whether all current CD's are the improved version. You have to check that out before you buy, or send it back if you have return priviledges."},{"rating":"2","title":"clothes hamper","review":"The hamper was pretty much what I expected.

It was worth the price, particularly based on others I had seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced and VERY LATE","review":"I waited several weeks for this item--far longer than most Amazon orders--and when it finally arrived, I found the quality to be just average. Yes, you can sit on it--IF you are careful and IF you aren't too big--but it is not so sturdy the older versions of this hamper. To make matters worse, I saw the same hamper (albeit in white only) for $40 at Bed Bath and Beyond. So go to B,B & B and get a fair price for the hamper and also you won't have to stand in line so long as I had to wait at home!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned item","review":"Not what I expected. Too small and the wicker would crack too easily if any weight was placed on top. A few pairs of jeans would fill the hamper.

It could have been enjoyable, but unfortunately it comes from a genius in introspective, turbulent, political and emotional statements. Dylan just doesn't know how to be cheerful without also being thoroughly irritating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dylan's Worst Albumn","review":"Dylan's Nashville Skyline is simply disasterous. It contains boring melodies, unoriginal lyrics, and Dylan for the first time sounding unintentionally commercial but commercial. The lyrics are trhe main problem. Going from the lyrics of Desolation Row and It's Alright, Ma to Lay, Lady, Lay and Country Pie is not a very good idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"...still lousy after all these years....","review":"My god this is crap! I bought the LP in 1969 and hated it then...after eight great albums (not including \\"Greatest Hits\\"). Dylan's annoying vocal affect on \\"Nashville Skyline\\" is just the tip of a shallow effort. I believe his transcendant, song-writing magic was actually passed to Townes Van Zandt around this time. And for the reviewer who stated it was the first country-rock album, The Byrds w/Gram Parsons released \\"Sweetheart of the Rodeo\\" a year earlier (1968). Back to Dylan: this album marked the beginning of a steep decline. Only \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" and \\"Time Out of Mind\\" measure up to early work like \\"Freewheelin'\\" and \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" and \\"Blonde on Blonde.\\" (Before I get a verbal jabs for the Beethoven thing, I also listen to music ranging from the Stanley Brothers to Charles Mingus to Tim & Jeff Buckley to Howlin' Wolf to George & Tammy.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if you like his voice on this one.","review":"This cd is very unessential in my mind. I've heard a few sound clips and his voice is very weird. I would like to have this because country Dylan sounds like a good idea but he messed up things when he changed his voice around. On lay lady lay I think he trys to sound to much like Johnny Cash. So then before buying I would listen to a few sound clips because this is not normal Dylan.Peace out to all my freak out friends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dylan churns out another classic.","review":"There is one thing for sure. This is a very different Dylan from Blonde on Blonde. Here we see Bob Dylan feeling lighthearted and carefree, and proving his worth as one of the inventors of country-rock. He has even changed his voice to reflect more of a countryish croon, which is no less effected in fascinating the audience.While it is a given that this is not Dylan's songwriting peak, as a performer he is no less than magnificent, and he still manages to pump out some classics. (Tonight I'll Be Staying Here With You, Lay Lady Lay, and the groundbreaking Johnny Cash duet Girl From the North Country) ... this is a classic that fits nicely into your budget. So if you enjoy great country rock, and are prepared to hear a very different Bob Dylan, but no less brilliant this is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dylan does it again","review":"I love this album. The medlodies are lush, his voice is perfect and the songs are great. Yes, \\"Country Pie\\" or \\"Peggy Day\\" are rather silly songs, but even Led Zeppelin released such drek as \\"The Crunge\\" and \\"Hot Dog\\" amongst their more serious work. This album is a step down in the message and pretension departments. The songs evoke a wonderful world of family, love and the simple life instead of the internet/mad rush world society keeps telling us is so important. Pour a glass of your favorite drink, sit in a rocking chair and enjoy. In fact, the only complaint I have of the album is that it's too short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dylan Goes Country","review":"I like the country effect on this Nashville Skyline release. Bob Dylan actually sings on this album(as opposed to the usual grumble) and quite well I might add. A nice blend of ballads, shuffles, and country rockers. The duet with Johnny Cash is beautiful although I tend to prefer Country Pie and To Be Alone With You.I will admit there is a littel less substance on this release than on prior Dylan tunes. Blonde On Blonde has more poetry than this batch. In addition, the songs are a little bit too short here. Heck, the whole album is under a half hour. None the less, Dylan's vocal tone and ligh hearted attitude makes it a fun listen for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Achieves Its Purpose","review":"No, \\"Nashville Skyline\\" is not Dylan's best work. It's uncomplicated listening that--under 30 minutes--is little more than fluff. It is, however, instrumentally lively and lyrically solid. And that voice... Let's not even go there. Can anyone put a thumb on this man? The only problem I have is with that opening duet with Johnny Cash. This thing sounds like two drunks howling at the moon. It would have been better on \\"Self Portrait.\\" But as a 'country album' and testament to Dylan's chameleon image, \\"Nashville Skyline\\" hits the mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"the first country-rock (and one of the best)albums","review":"I mean come on, the greatest songwriter ever teams up with the second best songwriter ever on the first track, and it just gets better from there. Dylan obviously understands country music (he says his first idol was Hank Williams) and uses his prolific talent to make one of my favorite albums ever. All the songs are good, however I like the Lay Lady Lay version on Hard Rain Better. Buy this CD and you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Country-fried Dylan","review":"Dylan in full southern swing. Completely different than any of his previous work. And his voice! He is true country on this one. I really don't care for country music, but this is a good-time album that begs to heard. Not politally oriented, or deep, but just old fashioned fun. If ya like Bob, buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting reading that makes you think","review":"I like to read about various subjects, philosophy is one of them. This book is funny, and at the same time critical. At times I think it's too critical, it's not fair when the one being criticized is not there to defend his ideas or himself (note: himself, some ad hominem attacks are being stated). The title is too ambitious and pretentious, but then again, so is philosophy as a whole.This book certainly is not for beginners, though it doesn't cover all important philosophers in depth, it is still not the best read if this is your first or second philosophy book. I enjoy the book from start to finish, and recommend it to anyone interested in a critical not to deep philosophy book (but only if you too are a critical reader)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good durable mag pouch","review":"Good durable mag pouch...a little long for a Kel-Tec .380 magazine though.

I have read many holocaust books, but this one touched me the most. The personal accounts of the two sisters provide an incredible insight into the hardships they faced for all those years. My father is a holocaust survivor who never spoke about his experiences of the war years. Somehow, when reading this book, I felt as though it was speaking for him as well. In addition, the author touches on her feelings as the daughter of a holocaust survivor, which I could really relate to. An excellent book for anyone interested in reading about the holocaust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"My husband and I bought this set since it had so many ways to check a baby's temperature. When we opened it home, all the thermometers either had low batteries or did not work at all. I didn't feel I could trust the readings with the thermometers that did work since their batteries were low. Replacing all of the batteries will probably cost us as much as the thermometer set did. I am not sure if this product was sitting on the store shelf too long or not. But I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate and Useful","review":"I received this set as a babyshower gift and am highly satisfied. My only gripe is that the paci therm does not fit in the case very well and takes a little too long to register for my liking.These thermometers have been within half a degree of much more expensive thermometers and the good part is I'm not afraid to break them. Because there are 5 different types, I can choose the thermometer that works best for the moment. A screaming child isn't about to accept a pacifier, and an underarm would be easier to use while holding them, etc.As for the disgruntled reviewer below, did you use the thermometers properly? A rectal thermometer is for rectal applications only..."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 Thermometers and 50 different readings?","review":"I agree completely with the review that gave product 1 star also.

So I go to check her temperature, so I can tell the Dr. what it is.. 101.9 holly cow, so I wait a few minutes and re-take it 100.2 okay, then a few minutes later 97.8.. Okay something wrong here, so I use a different one same thing and I even tried it on myself.. Needless to say the best route even though this way seems easier is the old fashioned thermometer..

I am astonished about his current readability, it's like it was written tomorrow. His preoccupation with nuclear holocaust aside, the works are fresh, not to politically correct so as to be consciously annoying. I love short fiction but sadly most of the new stuff out there leaves me bored, disappointed or I just don't finish it. Honestly NOT his best but still way ahead of a lot of other people out there. SF readers forget that there is a strong heritage for this genre.It's a shame it's goes to waste. Like an author? Find out who influenced them and you will be in for a treat. That's how I found out about Bester, through J Micahel Strazynski (sp?)honoring him on B5 with a character name. I'm eternally glad he did.

And several of the stories from the early 50's are thinly veiled diatribes against the paucity of original thought in \\"classic\\" science fiction. (Bester makes the wholly convincing argument that most of genre is little more than adolescent power fantasies, but fails to provide stories that provide a meaningful counterpoint.)Stick to the novels - THE STARS MY DESTINATION and THE DEMOLISHED MAN, Bester's best work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.

I'm a lover of almost all music genre's because I'm a musician and respect creativity and talent.

But the one thing I hate about body powder is the cloud of it in the air and that I always end up with the taste of it in my mouth. With Honey Dust, this isn't a problem. Yes, there is a small cloud of it around you but what's different is that it is sweet tasting, not chalky. It comes with a great feather duster that feels good. It doesn't clump up in the \\"niches\\" of your body. The scent is very soft and does not interfere with your perfume."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLEGH!","review":"Why is this a \\"Karma Sutra\\" item? It smells great, works well if you just want a shower to shower body powder, but why on earth is it sold as a karma sutra item? It tastes just like deoderant.

I produce DVDs using the best, Verbatim printable DVD-R, Memorex case inserts, etc. Not caring to spend any more of my life on these, I threw them in the trash. I guess that says more than the title.

Seller told me these don't have that smell, and I guess these don't stink as bad as some, but someone used to make ones that don't have that burnt smell at all! I can't find them.Suspicious circumstances, too. Seller I bought them from was Linkyo, (DBA SuperMediaStore, but didn't know that 'till I got the shipping label) - and now when I look back at my order, it says the seller was MyMor Express? What's up with that? Moving target is hard to hit, I guess. Definitely not 'premium' - flimsy and cheap and smelly. If you want a good cdrom (or dvd case) to go, look externally.

I orderd these from Amazon & I feel it is their responsibility to make the order right, whomever they have to contact. After I phoned the seller they told me the order I received was what Amazon requested from them on their PO. LinkyoExpress was the supplier & they said to return the Standard cases for a refund but they would not replace them with Premium cases at the price on the Amazon web page. So beware when you order this item"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely run-of-the-mill","review":"To put this very simply, if you want a black metal band that combines the elements from many others, this is it. We have similar drum production to Enslaved's \\"Eld\\", similar vocals to every other black metal group, guitar riffs that certainly lack in ANYthing resembling originality, and none of it done with enough power to make it in any way distinctive. Basically, if you're looking for black metal, you'll definitely find it here. If you're looking for original or unique black metal, best look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"My pretty, pretty poddle","review":"My poodle is a very fun little poodle.

The interpretations of these classic songs basically feature the signature riff and a lot of soloing, which means a lot of really hot picking! Also I like the harmonica played by Tom Ball. This is not traditional bluegrass album, since it features pretty much drums and electric guitar. Anyway mandolin, banjo, bass, acoustic guitar and telecaster twang blend very nicely on this album most of the time.You can't go wrong if you play a little bit of that Creedence song, and you probably can't go wrong with players like Jay Dee Maness (pedal steel) and Richard Greene (fiddle). The less-known multi-instrumentalist David West plays most of the instruments, like guitars, banjo, mandolin and bass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pickin on ccr","review":"The album is good! Nice instrumentals. I have listened to it several times and the quality is good as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible CD","review":"This CD is absolutely terrible. When each song starts out you think \\"Hey this sounds OK\\" and then in comes a pedal steel guitar or a hideously played harminoca run to ruin the bluegrass sound of the song. The banjo and mandolin players are not too bad but the guitar picker seems to be in a world of his own. He is eiter way behind or off playing something totally unrecognizable rather than trying to play with the other musicans.This CD is not true bluergass, nor should it be considered a tribute. An insult, maybe, but not a tribute.I have listened to other Bluegrass Tribute CDs such as the one to John Mellencamp, or the one to Dave Matthews and they are very good, however I wish I had not listented to this album, let alone paid money for it.

It was very exciting and never boring. There was a lot of action in the book, such as when there was a huge battle between the Above People and the People of the Underground.I think the type of reader who would like this book would be a fantasy reader because it talks about mythical creatures and a dream realm. It is a very enthralling book.Living in the underground world of the combs, a boy named Rej finds the body of the dead Doctor Esteemed Harfoot. Rej makes a vow to avenge his death and kill the murderer responsible for Harfoot's death. Meanwhile Above, an oppidian, a person who copies notes for the Doctors Esteemed, named Donna, is told to copy the notes for Doctor Esteemed Melagair.

The story makes no sense, the movie is very slow, the editing is terrible...just about everything in it is terrible. The one semi bright spot is the performance by LA area comedian, John \\"JJ\\" Williams. His performance is over the top, a bit hamhanded and borderline painful, but at least he makes you laugh on purpose.

ESPECIALLY if they love soccer.Cute & expressive pencil illustrations add to the fun. It even covers the thorny subjects of honesty and (obviously) being embarassed over the actions of a parent in language any second grader can understand.(Soccer Mom's will \\"aww\\" at then end...and their little players won't mind!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what was in the package!","review":"The product inside was a different style than described on the packaging....which is what I had ordered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blower motor","review":"It was not a direct fit needed modifications to get it to fit. was not as advertised as a direct replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Starting Point for S60 Programming","review":"I find this book pretty comprehensive in the breadth of topics it covers.

It covers as much as possible in limited 700 pages, from Symbian OS fundamentals, GUI design to more advanced topics, such as ECom, advanced communication technologies. It is kind of nice to provide tips and hints on how to avoid programming mistakes and how to design and develop applications for mobile devices. Last chapter even covers the testing and debugging, which is really useful. It will be better and helpful if example programs can be included in a CD along with the development enviorment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed by the Colorism","review":"Colorism is a within-race prejudice. It's when dark-skinned people of one race are deemed inferior to their light-skinned counterparts. I know Indians come in a huge array of complexions, but most of them are brown. In this work, however, all of them look European or Middle Eastern. Not a single person looks like Sanjay Gupta, M.I.A., Gandhi, or any other South Asian I know.For more than a decade, books and programs for children have tried to promote multiculturalism and diversity. These tales are diverse in origin, but they show the same faces and bodies that we've always seen. How no one can be brown in a cartoon about pre-colonial India is ludicrous and Eurocentric. I'd be very careful before I showed this to children of color.Besides, the animation was cheap and some of the tales have morals with wich I disagree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right up there with \\"Kind of Blue\\"","review":"This is Miles and two of his Quintets at their very best. The music that the bands play here is amazing. Coltrane and Stitt have very unique styles and thus add their own effects to the music. Coltrane plays fairly normally on the traditional songs, but on the modal tunes such as \\"So What\\" his playing borders on the free form that he would soon be getting into. However, he is only heard on the first seven tracks (the fourth of which is an interview with him), and Stitt certainly holds his own. In contrast to Coltrane's pseudo-avant-garde playing, Stitt plays very lyrically, weaving through excellent bop-style solos throughout the album. Miles's playing is beautiful as well, from his muted ballad tone on Green Dolphin Street to his hard swinging on Walkin'. Together, these 4 CDs contain over four hours of some of the best jazz on the market. I highly reccommend that you get these; if you like Miles's music then you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cooking Light 1989","review":"I'm sure the vendor is fine.

So it wasn't that it had fallen off or been misplaced, it hadn't been put on at all becasue according to the sheet there wasn't supposed to be one. The description stated it was a complete fez. Obviously not. I did end up not being able to use it as there was no time to procure another one in the two days I had left til I needed it. Mind you, with shipping it was only an 11 dollar investment. But still rather annoying.

A child can't really make anything three dimensional, as the slightest sideways pressure causes the magnetic rods to disengage from the spheres.The spheres and rods are also hard plastic on the outside, which means that even if the rods don't disengage, they slide around.If the magnets were considerably stronger and either the spheres or rods were \\"rubberized\\" this would be a much more fun and educational toy.

As many people noted, the magnets are not that strong. Who cares? We don't use them to create permanent structures, but we do use them for imaginative play.

Right now my 16 mo doesn't do much with it, but my 4 yo really likes it, and I suspect my younger one will enjoy it well enough when he's a bit older. The pieces are a great size for little hands, and while the magnets are not strong, they are certainly strong enough to build simple sculptures likes the ones shown.

It sounds to me like some bluegrass guys picked up a songbook (which just happened to have U2 songs in it) and started playing. Each song is true to the original, but the instrumentation is all mandolines, guitars, fiddles and banjoes.I was very pleased at the balance of this tribute. Too much improvisation would have irritated me, because the songs they picked can't help but remind you how much you like U2. (In a good way, you can tell they like U2 as well.)I was raised listening to my dad's bluegrass records on Saturday mornings while he made pancakes. During the week, my dad's friends would come over with their guitars, and we'd all sing. This tribute is great because the instruments and the band are both so close to me.My dad is not familiar with U2, but I am considering getting this for him. I think he will appreciate the sound, and it will be fun for me to share the music of a band I like so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must-have for any U2 fan","review":"Melodies and harmonies are true to the original, but conveyed through the lush and lustrous instrumentation of bluegrass music.

My favorite pat was that when the whoe thing is zipped up and buckled none of the pockets can be reached without unbuckling the bag so I didn't have to worry about pickpocketers getting into the bag while it was on my back in crouded streets, bus stations, etc. It held up very well for being packed very tightly and on the move for 2 plus weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNIQUE","review":"Je connais Pratiquement toutes les chanteuses de jazz actuelles, elles ont toutes des hauts et des bas: Melissa elle non, elle N'a Que des Haut et je n'h��site pas a dire que M��lissa Walquer est la plus grandes de toutes actuellement - Phrase impeccable, parfaitement maitris�� m��dium; chaude voix - Bref UNE GRANDE Parmi les plus grandes - Christian (France)"},{"rating":"1","title":"RICK SHAQ GOLDSTEIN SAYS: \\"THE NURSE SAID, THEIR HEART WAS IN THE RIGHT PLACE, DR.

I like being left to figure some things out for myself. I like,sometimes, to be left hanging. This book of short stories and intermittant word pictures does all that and more. I've read Peter Straub's \\"Ghost Story\\" and couldn't put it down. This book of stories moves slowly, at first and I COULD put it down-but I always had to pick it up again because of the disturbing moodiness of his writing. Each story stands on its own but the last, for me, was the best. It set an amazing mood(lush, green English countryside), told a great story (ghostly, mysterious past), kept me intrigued to the end (who's alive? who's dead?), and still left me hanging"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and overwritten","review":"This is a book of similarly themed short stories, half of which are short shorts only a few pages long. The characters are people whose lives are untenable. They come from abusive upbringings and are now feeling trapped in their lives.Straub is an excellent writer and creates vivid, if odd, characters. However, most of these stories didn't work for me. The short shorts were for the most part vague ramblings, not cohesive stories. Of the longer pieces, Blue Rose was the best. It's about an 11 year old boy who reads an old book on hypnotism and discovers he has a gift for it when he puts his younger brother under and something terrible happens. The story suffers only from a weak, anticlimactic ending. The Juniper Tree is a rote pedophilia tale that also ends poorly. The Buffalo Hunter and Mrs. God were both overwritten, going on far longer than was necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doors that go nowhere","review":"Initially, I was excited to pick up a collection of short stories by Straub. But, this has got to be my least favorite of all of Straub's work. Every story seems disjointed an incomplete. I never got a full sense of what happened by the time i finished each story. I kept reading the book, however, in hopes of finding a gem. I came close with \\"Mrs. God\\", but again felt let down on the outcome. Each story is too much buildup and not enough delivery.

However, the ends of the handles are so thick and heavy that if you leave them propped on the side of a shallow pot or pan, or on the counter, they are very prone to flip out of the container or off of the counter, carrying food with them to the kitchen floor. This happened to me twice while cooking thanksgiving dinner. I will not throw them away, but I would never buy them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awkward Shape","review":"This is a great set, and after 2 years of heavy use, have held up very well. Only problem is the large handle, while nice while you are cooking (despite the problem mentioned in other reviews where sometimes it falls out of the pan due to the weight of the handle) the large size handles make it hard to store in a kitchen with limited drawer space.

So it's a less varied mix, which comprises seven piano solos, an organ solo, a dozen of Fats & his Rhythm, and one of Fats with his Buddies. Sound quality is excellent, but in my opinion there are five numbers which do not merit inclusion in a selection which claims to be his best recordings. But if you want a \\"sampler\\" of Fats singing some of his best-known songs, together with some piano solos, then this should do nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arkansas cookbook gift","review":"I gave this book as a gift and was pleased with it when it arrived.

He also treated him that way because he wanted him to keep continue a strong family and not make an mistake to weaken the family.

It taught me many ways of the Ibo people in Nigeria. Many of their traditions and cultures were learned and taught as well as the effect of European imperialism. It tells a simple story of a man, Okwonkwo, and how he lived his life through many unexplanable emotions. Anger dominated him because of all the things that were done to him and his people. How many of the horrible things done to him to change who the Ibo were affected him. While telling the story Achebe seemed to put a profound and ironic way of how life was and still is for some of these people and what the domination of some men could do to other men and drive them to unexplainable things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best fiction book I ever read","review":"I don't like reading fiction at all.

It doesn't matter; they just don't want to be bored. In \\"Things Fall Apart\\" there's violence and a lot of action, never a dull moment. Teenagers love it, and by the end of the book, they've learned so much about the Nigerian colonization and the destructive path the Europeans burned right through their culture.

It reads like a spoken tale which makes it quite unique.Though some may have trouble understanding or sympathizing with the characters, as some of my classmates did, one must realize how much a culture affects its members, and that, were we in the same culture, would likely follow the customs as well.The end IS abrupt, but look closely--you will see why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consistent Greatness from Achebe","review":"I enjoyed No Longer at Ease more than this book, but it was still a very enjoyable and thought provoking read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye-opening read","review":"I read this for my English 201 class in college. This is a story about being who you were meant to be, about becoming blind from trying too hard not to be a certain way. Achebe wrote this because there was so much literature representing African people in a misunderstood way, to say the least, so he set out to write a genuine and real tale of the way of life in Africa. It's tough to read at times, there's sad moments. The characters are deep and intriguing. Although they are not perfect, I understand their decisions. It's also about equality, about doing things 100%, and standing up for what you believe in. Aside from being a tale about all these things, there's lots of culture and tradition woven into the lines, and while learning a thing or two about life, you'll also find out interesting facts about the life of the tribe described in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Informative, but Bad","review":"This book is just a fictional text book.

Just don't read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deceptively Simple","review":"Things Fall Apart reads so simply. The sentences are so concise and direct, attacking the reader. This novel doesn't seduce you the reader; instead, it forces you to put aside all of your prejudices inherited from your own culture, and the novel compels you to enter Okonkwo's own violent, beautiful culture. Then, once you are in, Achebe pummels you, making you feel a sense of destruction similar to that of a culture being destroyed by colonialism.The novel is simple, and at the same time, it's not. Things Fall Apart is much more than just an indictment of Western Culture. It explores complex questions about the clash of cultures. It explores the meaning of truth, and everything relates to Western culture itself as it is sucked into W.B. Yeats's gyre along with the Igbo. Things Fall Apart is one of the powerful stories of the Twentieth Century, and it is a novel which will stand far past the Postmodern era."},{"rating":"1","title":"i really wanted to care","review":"at the risk of sounding superficial i found the book awkward and trite. the characters were never whole so that i cared about them. there was plenty of gore but the shallowness of the individuals who caused it or were damaged left me uninvolved. the flatness could be attributed to the unsophistication of the tribesmen, but there was too much of the noble savage and too little humanity to involve me in their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book indeed","review":"This is the book for anybody that loves good story.

Very short, it only takes a few hours to read but the author still managed to paint a vivid portrait of not only the Ibo people but also of the politics of colonialism. When read from a more modern perspective, the phrase \\"global village\\" has alot of meaning. The most fascinating thing about this bit of literature is that is gives a completely unbiased view from the perspective of the Africans. (Sounds like an oxymoron eh?)

Achebe crafts a precise and very detailed narative setting forth an argument against colonialism that fails to consider anything that might lessen its drama. The perspective becomes self centered and biased and its realism dies. The book seems shaped around a view point so narrow and tunnelled that even the very real and human aspects of the tale are distorted and lessened. If his were the only argument against colonialism Achebe would have gauranteed its continuation - thank goodness it isn't!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the world's most overrated books","review":"I would argue that Achebe creates a violent and sexist main character who is little more than a stereotype of the African male.

True, there's a lot of symbolism and deep thoughts between the lines, but I was not impressed. It was, however, a great African look at an African life, which is unique.

It's wasn't *that* boring, but I still would have preferred to read something with more content and less inconsistancies.Achebe tries way too hard to insert symbolisism and make himself come off as a talented writer, when really, he's just pulling out tricks. Not to say Achebe isn't a talented writer. I've read a few of his essays and they are quite good, but Things Fall Apart is not one of the better book I've read.Okonkwo is an agressive, sexest and disgustingly manish man, and it's absurd that people can even suggest that he obtained hero status in this story"},{"rating":"1","title":"No better the second time...","review":"This is the second time that I have read Things Fall Apart and I didnt like it any better this time.

It shows how Ibo people lived and what happened when the English came. It is heart touching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not interested","review":"I read 3/4 of the book then stopped. The main character is driven by the need to succeed and in their primitive culture it is somewhat interesting to see how things unfold for him. The main point I took away is that in a stone-age culture there is a lot of randomness; maybe one day some one comes and says you must take in a 10 year old boy, then years later they come by and say he must die, or maybe a witchdoctor comes and takes your daughter for a night. The author has some skill and some of the folk stories were interesting, but I found I just did not care about the characters. So I stopped reading. I rarely stop a book 3/4 of the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"not terrible but rather dull","review":"I read this recently for a university African Lit class (though I am 40 yrs old), and found it rather dull and uninspired. I realize that its simplicity is parts of its appeal, but it felt overly simplistic to me. Some memorable passages for sure but the writing just did not resonate with me. The message is worthwhile but the writing not so much.In fact, this is one of the least interesting books I've read so far in the African Lit class. Much prefer Ngugi's \\"Grain of Wheat\\" and Mahfouz's great \\"Miramar\\" (though it's not sub-Saharan Africa)."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Drags","review":"While the story itself is useful in giving a student the right mindset for African studies, the story itself lacks much of the marvel of other historically-based books.

This book is better than sleeping pills because no matter how boring, confusing, or inane it happens to be, it can't kill you.

A classic? Not in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS is a classic?","review":"The higher the expectation, the more bitter the disappointment can be. This book proves it. Supposedly, \\"Things Fall Apart\\" is one of the three or four classic, must-read books of African literature. If this is a classic, I don't want to see the B-list. Minimal character development; no explanation for bizarre, cruel, impulsive behavior of the protagonist or others. I had no idea what made these characters tick. And so the story didn't grab me because I didn't have empathy or understanding for or of the people who were in it. The title is great; unfortunately, \\"things fell apart\\" after I opened the book.

I read Cornell's annual freshman book to stay connected with my alma mater.However, I don't get why Cornell recommended this 1956 book. It leaves one with the strong impression that native Africans are mysoginistic, anti-intellectual and savage. If it was trying to get Cornellians to better appreciate how those in the Third World think, it failed. If Africans still think the way the book discusses, than al Queda will have a never ending supply of recruits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful in its Fiction elements, just chronical interest","review":"I found myself studying the elements of this novel and, after a somewhat promising setup in the first chapter (when one is driven to believe the plot is made of Okonkwo's conflict with someone in his village or with his own personality), I could see the scenes dissolving into nothingness and losing any dramatic grip it could've had at the beginning. Most of the novel sets Okonkwo's issues apart and is focused in how the rites, ceremonies, marriages and feasts of the Umuofia village are being prepared. Anyone looking great Fiction entertainment, great characters and memorable conflicts should be dissapointed. On the other hand, some Historians or Anthropologists might find it resourceful of the lives in Nigeria's thribes before Colonialism."},{"rating":"1","title":"would rather eat maggots","review":"I was forced to read this book for my high school lit. class and I am truly convinced that the teacher did it for cruel and unusual punishment. It is almost impossible to concieve how boring this novel was. The main character was very annoying. He was arrogant and never interesting. you never got to get personal with the character's. It was like reading a quick obituary. The plot never got good and there was no humor. only flat meaningless words.I'm not the only one who felt this way. No one in my class liked the book and we complained everyday. my best friend was incapable finishing the book. if you're a kid in school don't even try it."},{"rating":"2","title":"things fall apart","review":"Things fall apart is book I recommand for people who will like to travel to Africa and learn the culture of the African people to read.It potrayS the culture and practices of the people of Nigeria in West Africa before the colonial rule.It also teaches that people who live in glad stones shouldn't throw.It talks about Okonkwo who was great and wealthy man in his village.As a result of this Okonkwo thought the whole world was his.After returning from exil to his village after five years at his mothers village,Okonkwo comes to find out that the \\"white man\\" had come to occupy his village with their rules.Out of his pride okonkwo wealth he vowed to fight the white man to the end.Unfortunatelty the white man was more powerful than okonkwo.Finally okonkwo had to commit suicide by hanging himself to avoid tne embarrassment he was to go through in the hands of the white man after taking the law into his own hand and by killing one of the white man's messengers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored to death","review":"Not something I would read if I didn't have to.

The language of this book is hardly worthy of being read in middle school, let alone high school. It flows as if a fifth-grader had written it. The plot? Nothing more than a collection of rigid, cardboard figures who can't seem to care about anything but growing yams and beating their wives. Toward the middle of the book, we see the emergence of the 'evil' white men who brought that horrid religion, Christianity, into tribal life. Oh, the horror! I am always perplexed as to why public schools always find it necessary to force the students to read works that only make whites sound as if they were an incarnation of Satan.Bottom line: This book is a complete waste of time. Hopefully you won't be forced to read this dribble as I was. Try something that will actually expand your vocabulary and open your mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God For Missionaries","review":"An interesting look into tribal life.

Overall the book was very poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"All you never wanted to know about yams... and other such things.","review":"I had to read this for my high school advanced English class. I regret ever having picked it up. I feel very lucky that my brain was not fried after reading The-book-that-should-not-be-named. In short, if you want to read a bizarre book about African people and yams, then read this book. If not, go read something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the worst book I've ever read!","review":"This is probably the worst book I've ever read. It's very difficult to follow and leaves out much which could explain to the uninitiate the point of the book. As someone who has read thousands of books (literally!), I found this one stilted and forced, unreadable, pointless, unpleasant, poor character development, etc. ad nauseum. The only reason I read it is that I couldn't believe my 8th grader when he said the teacher who assigned it said it was a bad book (and, yes, she assigned it anyway!). It is an excellent example of how not to write a book you want people to read. Avoid this one like the plague, unless you've read every other book on the face of the planet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okonwos Story","review":"I really didnt understand the book.

I saw yams for twelve straight hours. I thought I was a yam. I stripped down naked and called myself Ikemefuna, I thought my roommate was Okonkwo coming to kill me. I banished myself to the linen closet which I thought was the evil forest. Except I couldn't fit my three wives in there with me, so I beat them and sent them to the neighbors house their motherland."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excruciating","review":"Being forced to read this book in 8th grade- was horrible. My teacher has it stuck in his head that we'll understand it, and that it'll be a quick read, but it's not. You have to think about everything, and I mean everything, after every sentence. This makes it excruciating and a slow read. Assigning five paragraphs a night-- is too much. I suggest getting the Cliff Notes version, much easier to understand and shorter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read, but requires patience and insight","review":"I read this book for my high school English literature exam. At first I found the use of native words mixed with English rather perplexing (which is a bit odd considering I grew up in E. Africa).On the 2nd and subsequent reads, the tragedy of this 'hero' unfolds. Okonkwo's fateful woes work against what would have been a great man's destiny. He allows fear to rule his life and this eventually leads to his sad demise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific","review":"This is a transcendant book about the culture, mores, and primitively beautiful ways of a place and people most of us will never get a chance to experience first-hand. The prose is terse and close, but worlds of emotion -- agony, love and surprise -- shine through at every turn. Above all, perhaps, the story is wildly interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a book. Yeah..... I could groove to it.","review":"Well everyone, from a socio-cultural standpoint, the book is quite worth reading. It is by no means a book that I would choose to read on a recreational basis. The diction is dignified yet simple and the book can be read in a day. The novel is a critical account of British colonialism inflicted upon an African tribe. It is fascinating and evokes solemn emotion. Things Fall Apart is used to broaden knowledge, an extremely important component of modern African Literature. Perhaps it is profound, read to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its better than you think","review":"This celebrated novel is far from the best book I've ever read but at the same time provides some serious insight into the Imperialistic movement in Africa both at the time the novel was written and now. True, Achebe can drag out descriptions about the customs of different tribes etc, but lets afford him that because he has the obligation to not only write great prose but also provide a little bit of the African culture to the Western world as an ambassador of African literature. The novel is frighteningly vivid in its descriptions, well thought out in terms of political ideals, and a valuable piece of evidence in the argument about the clash of cultures in Africa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking through the eyes of the strong","review":"Things Fall Apart gives a great out look on how we as today view our world. From the views of Chinua your able to see the darker side of our world. Our beliefs in our culture should be looked at then asked. Have we made all of the correct human decissions as to how we live today with religon. I admire how strong the tribe keep their cultures intact. In the end some tribe memebers did convert over,however, this would allow some diversity. This is a good thing, reason being that it gave the tribes more of a challenge to be different yet still the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"One man's struggle...","review":"You can feel for Okwonko in this book. On the outside, he is a hard man, but on the inside you can see that he cares for his ward (who ended up having to be killed) and his family. He is a man who values hard work (which is more than can be said for many lazy folks today) and as a result is a highly respected person in his village.So when he loses it all because of a accident, you can't help but feel bad for him. He and his people also have to deal with the intrusion of the white men and their church and the BS that they give to the whole village.I was disappointed in the ending, but at the same time it made sense to me that he did what he did. Overall, it was a powerful book, and I am happy to have read it. It also gives you a nice insight into African culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cultrual Conflict Exposed","review":"If you are just looking for a good book to read, you will enjoy this one. And if you are seeking an understanding of African culture, this book could help. But this work by Achebe is focused clearly on revealing the conflict in most culturally mixed societies today. The problem is not one of values but of the expression of those values. This is a great book to help the reader understand people of other cultures by seeking to understand their values and the expression of those values in comparison to those of the reader. Being able to see the values of others aids in bringing people together to create a healthy living environment by reducing the conflicts often manifest in value expressions. This book was a required reading in a Cultural Anthropology Class and an enjoyable book to read. I highly recommend it to people of all Religions and Cultures."},{"rating":"2","title":"African classic","review":"I was recommended to read this book. It explained alot about their traditions but incorporated the arrival of Christianity and how it affected them. It wasn't a complicated book to read and easily understood, I found.

It opened my eyes to writers from other countries; especially Nigeria and Ghana. The diction of Chinua Achebe is short, yet flowing and meaningful. He writes only what needs to be said, and yet his descriptions make you feel part of the background, looking in. I read all of his other books after reading this one, and also started reading Nadine Gordimer, from South Africa. If you appreciate short, meaningful fiction, with a timeless message, than this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant work by Africa's most important writer","review":"Things Fall Apart is the sort of book that teaches you something different regardless of the number of times you read it. It's opened a lot of western (and indeed, some African) eyes, to the ancient traditions of Africans, which for political and economic reasons have long been denigrated by the western media. Things Fall Apart shows for all to see that in ancient African societies, there existed Order were the west spoke of Chaos, Poetry were the west spoke of 'disjointed, grunting sounds' eg in Joseph Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness' , and sophisticated political organization (as seen in the age-grade system, Umuofia's Council Of Elders and the ancient judicial system of the egwugwu), were the west reported 'savage barbarity of a kind not much higher than that of monkeys'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Understanding Cultures","review":"I read this book for an anthropology class and it helped me to understand a lot more about culture, taboos and the myths of other cultures.

He does so and the reader is acutely aware of the \\"civilization\\" and complexity of tribal life. His goal of altering Western perception of tribal Africa is realized. However, it was as if I was reading a history book with someone interjecting with stories of tribal life, African vocabulary, and mined cliches, rather than a novel with strongly developed characters, dialogue, and plot structure. I teach this book in my 12th grade class and I must admit, I was as bored as the students. Pick up a documentary on tribal Africa instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"things fall apart","review":"This book had a good cultural outline, but was extremely boring. The story didn't really pick up until the end, but I wanted to put the book down way before then. It was well written, but too dull for my liking."},{"rating":"1","title":"A stultifyingly stagnant excuse for a novel","review":"Last year, I read Things Fall Apart from cover to cover. I would not advise anyone else to make this deplorable mistake. Labelled as 'great literature' by many imbecilic pundits who think calling something 'great literature' will automatically make them connoisseurs of some sort, thus elevating them to the highest levels of society, Things Fall Apart appeared to me as more of a juvenile attempt at a sixth grader's first novel. The author seems to have some sort of infatuation with yams, because the entire book revolves around idiotic descriptions of yams and characters struggling with their declining yam output. As for the characters, they are developed poorly and not very likeable, thus, when the tragic downfall of the protagonist happens at the climax of the book, instead of experiencing the catharsis that the author probably intended I would, I felt nothing but sheer joy because the book was over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenile and lacking substance","review":"I was forced to read this for a college intro to lit class and it was terrible. Not only is it written in a Juvenile manner, but the characters are annoying to read about. This story could have been told in about 20 pages, but streches out into a full book that finally makes a point in the very last pages. Achebe's work needs some fine tuning."},{"rating":"1","title":"become more convinced that these tribes are backwards","review":"Gnerally, I am extremely open-minded about other cultures, in fact learning about other people's countries is one of my favorite things today. No conversation is more interesting than one that opens your eyes to a different culture. So I read this book by Achebe hoping to dissolve any stereotype that I might have regarding tribal african societies. In the forward, it seemed like this was not too much to expect since that was exactly Achebe's purpose, but everything I had ever heard about the primitive nature of tribal society and the backward thinking was reinstated instead of eliminated. Perhaps I am more disappointed to find that these people truly are illogical and backward than I am in the book itself. But if you are reading this hoping to extinguish any prejudices about African tribes, this is not the book you are looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"I read this twice for college lit and I can't stand it.

I can't believe that I was forced to read this book. The language in this book was too confusing, and I can't even believe that anyone could enjoy reading a book like this. You need a translator for every single page. This book is way too confusing for the average reader (I am an honors student) and even the more advanced reader would find difficulty reading this book. If I could rate this book with no stars, I certainly would."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful story with compelling characters, simpley written","review":"The prose is simple an unpretensious. The story is very moving, with complex characters and plot elements. What I most appreciate about this novel is that it is so well balanced. It is not a diatribe against English colonialism like it could have been. Achebe doesn't romantacize Ibo life before the English came, nor does he condemn the changes which were wrought after. He objectively descibes the transition of a society when elements of another culture are introduced to it. For some like Okwonkwo the effect is devastating, others such as Okwonko's son welcome the change. He leaves it up to the reader to decide what is good or bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIT CONFUSNG AND \\"OUT THERE\\"...","review":"I was to read this book over the summer for a Social Studies Honors class. i am actually in the process of doing so at the moment.

By the time you see any trace of a continuous story line you will realize you're already more than half-way through the book.

Her \\"Half of a Yellow Sun\\" is excellent.And so when I saw that \\"Things Fall Apart\\" on a \\"100 Best Books List\\" (The Guardian) I decided to borrow it.It is very rarely that I don't finish a novel, but I despaired of this one and returned it when I was about 70% through.It was after this that I looked at the Amazon reviews. I might borrow it again as a few people have written that it gets OK towards the end.But for at least 70% it's all about a tribal strong man beating wives and killing a child. From other reviewers I gather that this is meant to show there WAS \\"culture\\" in Africa before the white men came?IF that was the novelists intent, all I can say is that it failed miserably."},{"rating":"1","title":"its a sleeper thats for sure","review":"Pretty darn boring for first part, it gets a little better after the first 100 pages or so.

I had no idea the reader on the CD would be talking so very slow. A 5 page chapter (keeping in mind, the font in the book is probably a size 14) would take 30 minutes to listen to. I only played about half of a chapter for my students before I picked up the reading. It was \\"okay\\" in the fact where I could listen to the pronunciation of the names the night before, so that I could read it to my students. Next time I get a book on tape, I will sample it first. Now I have no use for a 6 disc book on CD. Maybe I'll try to sell it and get my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was ok","review":"In my opinion imperialism hurt the Ibo people. I think this for many reasons, one being it turned the Ibo people against each other. Anther reason is imperialsim totally destroyed there culture, the Ibo people now lived under worry about there religion and not as they had for many many years.An exaple is when okwonko was driven so far that he killed himself. Because his people were being ruined he went as far to kill himself.Another example is the fight between the Ibo people who wanted to stay a tribe and the Ibo people we wanted to go along with the imperialism and not fight it.All and all imperialism in my mind a very negative spin on the Ibo people and other tribes. Although who knows what africa would be like today without imperialism, it had to happen evenually its just a human instict to improve and to get as much power u can get by taking advantage of others"},{"rating":"2","title":"Things Fall Apart","review":"This is a beautiful book following a tribal member as he lives his life and tries to look after himself and his family. It is written extremely well and although the language is poetic and beautiful, I have to say it didn't move me or emotionally involve me in the story as much as I anticipated (hence the 4 stars). Never the less it is a perfectly pleasant read and kept me engrossed for a few days and the ending was perfectly in character and a fitting conclusion. You feel anger and shame at how African nations were treated by colonial powers and it is interesting to explore it from the Africans point of view rather than from a historical or political analysis angle. Overall a good read and worth the time it took to read.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is two-faced - I like it!","review":"This book is special because the meaning doesn't actually hit the reader until moments after putting the book down. Chinua Achebe seems to spend a lot of time ostracizing Okonkwo, the main character of this story. He spends less than half of the book on he colonization. When I had finished reading this book, somehing hit me - Okonkwo was a tragic hero. We learn his idiocencrecies and at first he annoys us, but then Achebe adds an obstacle so great into Okonkwo's path that diminishing such an obstacle would place Okonkwo in the hero status. Anywa, I've talked too much. THis eas a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pre-Colonial Life without the Rose colored glasses","review":"Achebe is one of the best writters of all time, without any doubt. \\"Things Fall Apart\\" follows the not so perfect life of Okonkwo in a not so perfect Ibo society in modern day Nigeria. A most interesting aspect of the story is how Okonkwo is well off, and a nearly perfect protagonist, but still ends up going through un-told hardships. The feeling of this book is further completed with the use of the native religion of the Ibo being real.This book makes one question colonialization in a different light as well, because the book shows how the process of colonialization was slow but largely unstoppable... and scary in a sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Colonialism...Good or Bad?","review":"i wouodnt say that i really enjoyed this book a lot but i would say it enlightened me to what colonists did to the African Culuture. they took away what they thought important and implanted their own ideals. all in all i appreciate this book for the truth and partially a realistic vision."},{"rating":"2","title":"a real novel!","review":"Some reviewers have made comments that they did not like the first half/three-fourths of the book because it had no plot and it was mostly just cultural filler. That is true, except it serves perfectly as the basis of the form of a true NOVEL. The whole opening is to show you exactly how alien this culture is. It also paints one of the most richly drawn characters ever, Okonkwo, into a vast canvas full of tense customs. Everything is looking up for both the main character and the tribe, Umuofia (the second most important character). Then things just fall apart, hence the high arc of the story. I really liked the way this novel took everything like a grain of salt. So much happens, and yet it is all just tiny additions to Okonkwo's and the tribe of Umuofia's tragic life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Things (don't) Fall Apart in this book","review":"What a great book! Achebe draws out a wonderful picture of African customs and beliefs. As the book advances, you don't know who to root for. You have Okonkwo, who is battling demons from his past and takes out his anger on his three wives and many children. Then you have the Christains, who are trying to do good, but don't understand the tribe's culture. Only four stars because the story is kind of slow in the beginning, but a very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A moving, simple story","review":"This is one of my favorite books. The writing and story seem very simple but the impact is remarkable. I find myself recalling parts of this book long after reading it. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Starts a Little Slow","review":"This book was a required reading for one of my college history classes. It does start a little slow, but once it picks up, it is almost impossible to put down. As with \\"The Clockwork Orange\\", I wrote a little reference card on a notecard, just in case I forgot what one of the words the book used meant, I had my bookmark/notecard to look it up on."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent introduction to African Culture","review":"Chinua Achebe displays his commendable talent in the colorful and ironic tale Things Fall Apart. This masterpiece introduces the unique characteristics of African culture. It begins with the periodical life of the African people centered around the strong and fearless character Okonkwo. Through the description of his struggles in life, Achebe defines the many features of African rituals. Achebe also introduces the affects of clashing cultures. Okonkwo, a strong and fearless man, is affected by the European's domination over their culture, resulting in conflicts. Okonkwo's life lead by his brave character simply falls apart. Things Fall Apart is an excellent display of the negative results clashing civilizations have on the unrivaled and colorful rituals of cultures."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"This book reads like a folk tale, however don't let the simple prose fool you, for like any good folk tale there many layers to be uncovered. This tale touches greatly upn such issues as family, and loyalty, and heritage, and pride and ignorance, and loss, all interwoven quite nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense, fascinating","review":"Hello,Awhile back this was \\"recommended\\" to me by Amazon. I read the summary, it seemed interesting, and the price was right, so I ordered it. For about a year I tried to read it, but found I'd lose interest, leave it down, and end up coming back a few weeks later and starting all over again. Then about two weeks ago, I picked it up and couldn't put it down. Read it in two days. Must have been the right time because I found the story caught me. The writing pulled me in and made me forget that I was reading. That's always the best!As for the story, I was conflicted - I wanted to identify and support the tribal customs and lifestyle unconditionally. As a person born and raised in the U.S. I struggled with some of the tribe's cruel practices. Well, cruel by my sensibilities. Consequently I found myself a little pleased that some of the characters chose Anglican church beliefs and practices.Sincerely,SR"},{"rating":"2","title":"Things Fall Apart","review":"My son needed this book for school and we received in time for school.

When Christian Missionaries bring their strange religion and customs and laws, Okonkwo and his fellow villagers are first amused, then frustrated. In this heart-rending masterpiece, Achebe brings to life a powerful, though flawed, protagonist who fights for what he believes is right."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting book","review":"I read this book because I wanted to become familiar with African literature, as all the books that I have read so far were written by European or Latin-American writers. I have also seen this book in many of the 100 Best books lists.The book is well written and the customs of the people of Nigeria in the 1800's are described with very good detail especially those related to the food and respect to traditions.However what I think is the main value of this book is the sad ending of the main character, Okwonko, who seemed to rule his life with the only purpose of not being like his father by keeping always what he believed was a \\"manly\\" demeanor. Sadly, I did not see any change in his attitude throughout the book as many decisive events happen in the course of his life.As a Mexican I cannot keep from finding very parallelisms with the coming of the missionaries to Nigeria that is described in this book, with the destroy of the Aztec empire by the Spanish conquerors"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars for holding my attention","review":"Things Fall Apart is an interesting book, but I would not call it ground-breaking or legendary. While it gives a very interesting account of an African culture made obsolete after the appearance of Christian missionaries, it is hard to sympathize with Okonkwo, who cannot adjust to a culture that does not involve murdering twin newborns. Perhaps Achebe's flaw is his truthfulness; his brutal honesty in describing the culture led me to see Christianity's arrival in that land as a blessing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish reading it - too painful and dull.","review":"This book is too painful and boring to read period. I cannot believe that some people praise the language or sentence structure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the plot?","review":"Whilst the novel lacks a good storyline for such unique cultural and traditional content, it sends a powerful message for their colonizer. From historical and cultural perspective, the book rebelliously claims that they have an abundantly well-respected culture even before they were colonized and the new government didn't affect these people--but it actually did. Yet, it doesn't deny the power of the colonizers despite the dweller's rebel.Aside from the message it held, the novel is pretty boring and bland and sexist. It doesn't have an interesting plot to follow. It is a bunch of information about the tribe's culture, ritual, historical background, the colonization process and dweller's reaction to this movement. However it delivers a certain message: when something better comes along, (some) people would take advantage of it even if it means to leave their tribe or custom. Above all, the good news is that the main character fought for what he believed till death."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was very boring","review":"Throught the book the auther keeps bringing in new charecters that have almost the identicle spelling of another and it gets very confusing"},{"rating":"1","title":"A textbook, not a novel!!!!!","review":"I had to read this book for my freshman world geography class.

So I will not be reviewing it at the present time."},{"rating":"2","title":"insightful with universal themes","review":"After reading some African proverbs and learning about the rich tradition of oral storytelling in African culture, this story simply illuminated so much for me. The main character, though certainly flawed even in the eyes of his own tribe, carries his pride and hubris at a breathtaking pace. Though some may not care for such character development, I appreciated the author's style in illuminating even the secondary characters as each piece fell into place when the diffusion of colonialism took place. Fiction such as this is even more powerful when one takes time to get background knowledge about the Ibo of south Nigeria and their aspirations for preserving their identity - not only in the face of Christian missionary zeal, but also in the face of conflict and tragedy with the central government of Nigeria as seen in the Biafra civil war of the 1970's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting!","review":"I am a sophomore in college and was assigned this book to do a short review. At first, like many books I've read in the past, it started out very dull. After getting through the first four chapters, the book started to become more interesting. This is a story about real life, although in another culture. It touched me in so many ways. I would suggest this book to any scholar!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap product","review":"A friend of mine bought this set for our Memorial Day picnic. We played two games with it and two of the mallets are now broken. Both broke when someone tried to knock somebody else's ball far away, but this is a normal tactic in croquet so it wasn't really excesive usage. In fact, one of the people who ended up breaking a mallet was a 9 year old kid, so it didn't take that much strength. The handles are made from a very light wood, and they were brave enough to cut ridges into the handles that weaken the material even more.This is a fine set if you don't want to spend that much and a bunch of beginers are going to use it and not be that aggressive, but if you're serious about a croquet set, spend a little more to get something that can hold up to the sport."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok for a cheap game","review":"The set is not really full sized, in that the mallets are short; however, adults can still use them, and small children can also. The balls are lighter weight and so don't roll well in grass. One of the mallet sticks was too small and so would not stay screwed in to the mallet head and had to be glued. For a family outing where you don't really care about the game but just want something cheap and portable, the set is fine. The price was certainly right."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for adults","review":"I was unable to tell by looking at this online, but it is a very small set and more appropriate for children than adults.

I can't zip it shut, but can close the Velcro on the top, I wanted to be able to carry all of them! If I wanted to carry all the mallets in the case & zip it closed, I would have to unscrew the mallets from the handles each time after using them, then I would have to worry about stripping the handles. What a bother that would be!We did use them & I agree for the price, the set will do, but next time when designing the case, take the someone should take the length into account please!

Many scenes from the original, such as the knight's plot of revenge, were removed. The author claimed such cuts were made for the sake of a more 'performable' play, which may be true, but in this, and other instances, I felt the material cut was crucial to filling out the plot and improving character develop throughout the story.

Also, the rocking base makes it a little harder to stack for younger toddlers, but they will get the hang of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choking hazard","review":"Like all Melissa and Doug toys, this is beautiful and well-made. My 13-month old son loves stacking and shape sorting, and plays all the time with the Fisher-Price plastic version of this. He received this as a birthday gift and we were really excited......until he promptly popped the top blue ring into his mouth and started zooming around the house. I don't think it is big enough to swallow ordinarily, but if he were to fall I think it could become lodged in his throat and would be very hard to grasp to remove as the edges are all very smooth. We tried just taking that ring out of the set and putting it up, but then he did the same thing with the top red ball so we have put the whole toy away. Bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Educational but dangerous.","review":"My son loves stacker and sorters. Nothing but good ol' fashion toys that require thinking and development but the base is dangerous. It can puncture and requires supervision.

We ended up sticking to the Fisher-Price stacker and cup stackers even though my son was as interested in them (this makes noise)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I worry about the stick!","review":"Once all the stackable parts are removed, what's left is a narrow stick.

There are no strong points of the book which I can say make it worth buying.

It portrays every Christian in the story, except for the heroine's boyfriend, as rabid, hate-filled sadists. It's equivalent to portraying every German during WW II as sadistic murderers, which we know is not accurate. This is an extremely unbalanced view.A high point of the story is the heroine's bitter denunciation of the priest who has failed to protect the Jews in his church.Considering that Christianity is the last minority that intellectuals in the US now feel justified in attacking, I would not give this to a teen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"Without a doubt, Scott Slapin is an amazing violist. His transcription of Bach's Sonatas and Partitas are magnificent. The fuller tone of the viola plays well with these violin pieces. Although Slapin maintains a good tone throughout all the pieces, there are many areas where you can hear him strike other strings when crossing to another string. I often overlook these minor details simply because Mr. Slapin plays with great passion, and this is one of the only viola transcriptions of the Sonatas and Partitas that can be found."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!!","review":"I've been sewing for many decades, including professionally, and this is one of the handiest techniques I've encountered in years.

My dad, who is VERY mechanically inclined and my husband spent half an hour trying to figure out how to even unroll it. Then, they spent another hour trying to figure out how they were going to rig it up so it would work with our stairs. We have the carpet covered baseboards and then a chair-rail like trim. Even with the extra installation kit, it was going to be a HUGE challenge. But, the deciding factor in my sending these back was how hard they were to open. I have elderly in-laws and several different babysitters who were ALL going to need to use these to go up and down the stairs several times a visit. It was just too hard for me to try to remember the 3 steps it took to open them, let alone asking all those other people to do it. I sent them back and ordered an accordian style gate instead. We'll see how it goes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud and awkward!!","review":"I love the idea, but the implementations of this has some drawbacks....It is LOUD when it retracts. Very loud.

I love the fact that when the gate is not needed (at night when we are still up)you do not see it at all. I hate the look of those cage gates and this is so great. I also love the fact that there is nothing for my son to grab onto. He forgot the stairs were even behind that magic curtain. THis is such a great product. I only ordered two for the bottom of our two staircases but I plan to order two more for the top. I had wanted to try them out first before committing to them. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well for Banisters","review":"This was the only gate I could find that would fit on my spiral staircase that was metal. I had to buy the kit, but it fit on the stairs without drilling holes or hardware. It is a little difficult to operate at first, and nealy impossible to do it with one hand, but I guess that makes it more difficult for your child to operate. Would recommend it if you have to put a gate on stairs where there are banisters and no where to mount hardware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 6 months of use","review":"The spring in this gate broke after 6 months of use.

It is aesthetically well designed and flows well in the house since it rolls up nicely. However, it is not practical for a high/moderate traffic area of the house. We have it covering a large opening from the kitchen and constantly end up with either the top or the bottom hook attached but rarely both.The problem with the install is not complexity but rather precision. I finally got the install right after 3 holes in the wall. It is tricky since you really have to accurately line up the hooks in order to get good tension on both the top and bottom. If you don't have a level and measuring tape you will end up with a few holes in the wall/door."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice looking gate","review":"This is defintely the best looking gate around. We have it right by our front entrance and love how it disappears when we don't need it, and it even looks nice when it is out. It was very easy to install, but it's not as easy to use. There is no way my 9 month old is ever going to be able to climb this or get out, but it's difficult for me to open or close with her in my arms. It is also noisy if you open it one handed. For a location where you don't have room for a swing out gate, this is the best option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected in a text book for education","review":"I had expected this text to be a collection of teaching ideas and suggestions for students preparing to teach language arts in school. There are some useful ideas for educational majors. There is also a ton of unuseful, uninsightful and personal ramblings of an apparent devout feminist who obliviously would more comfortable wrting about societies ills with men in charge, instead of useful educational ideas.

He seemed to find it impossible to believe that such an attractive woman of God could have a brother capable of committing murder. Perhaps a better title for this book would have been, \\"This Man is Innocent, His Sister Said So.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to follow","review":"While it is true that I only write reviews of the books I DON'T like, I was happy to see that others had the same reaction. The story had all the elements of a great story: under-achieving, philandering husband; well-loved but sloppy wife; powerful people involved in less than respectable behavior, and highly divided families. Why he couldn't make the story more focused is beyond me. It wandered way off point, with meaningless information that I did not think added anything to this story. This is a must miss. In fact, after reading a third of it, I vowed I wouldn't read anything else by this author. Alas, I had already purchased another one of his titles: \\"Afraid of the Dark.\\" Please see my review of that book."},{"rating":"1","title":"One sided.

The face is large because of the vibrating motor, not a problem. What is an unacceptable problem is the band is no where the length needed for a 5yr old, which, even according to the company selling it, is a very common age for wearers of this watch.I called the company, PottyMD, and they say too bad, spend more money on a new band!Even my son's doctor says this is a common complaint.I wish a maker and seller of \\"sick\\" children's watches would think about the children.thanksfrustrated parent"},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid but....","review":"I know nothing about baseball but I still manage to enjoy this hilarious, witty and well written satire.

In all these years we still have not had a single major league player in any major sport come out while still actively playing.The sad reality is that if two major league players were in this exact situation today, it would still be huge news and many people would react the same way.But even discounting the social relvance of the book, it is still funny, enjoyable, and beautifully written. That's why I keep coming back to it time and again. Rarely do I find such engrossing material to read. I live and love each moment every time I read it.

If it doesn't say 'Special', you bought wrong! Amazon has the paste, too. Most hardware stores don't carry it. Another blog says don't fix leaks with tape dope, should a loose piece of tape make its way into the gas valve, etc. Using the tester's knob for adjustment of the beeping frequency is super easy, not an issue as one blogger complained.

I'm working on the sequel now and have read another of hers between. Kim's writing style is incredibly fluid, smooth, entertaining and believable, all at the same time. I enjoy a good story, but the most important element in any type of fiction (for me) is the characters. If they become real to me as I move through the story, and stay with me after it's done, the author has done their job. Summer, Peter and Thomas blossomed into very real people, gaining my sympathy right from the start. Thank you, Kim, for a lovely story and heartwarming characters.

It is easy to fall in love with the gentle giant Peter Ollenburger. And I grew with Summer through each test and victory.If you thought there wasn't a fresh twist on the prairie romance, think again.

Christian sounds phenomenal here as always.While Guiffria is credited with \\"keyboard production\\" with over 1,000 cds and still a substantial vinyl collection I don't believe I have ever seen this line used before, seems just like an excuse to have Gregg's name on the disc?

I only give it two stars instead of one because I agree with Vasquez's beliefs concerning humanity's violent tendencies. However, there are plenty of other works (ex: The Lord of the Flies) that convey this very same message with skill and originality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only For the Strong Minds, But A Gorey, Enjoyable Read","review":"I cannot begin to explain how humorous Jhonen Vasquez can be while penning in blood and gore. Johnny the Homicidal Maniac (aka: JtHM) is only for the readers who can stand looking past flesh and bone and inside of Jhonen's mind. Lots of blood, but some laughs. Johnny has an unknown past but his present is open to the reader. I reccommend that anyone, who is strong enough to read gore, who sees this in stores (Hot Topic most of all) to purchase it quickly! You WON'T regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just killing","review":"JTHM starts out as a dark comedy about a deranged psycho who goes around murdering people for various reasons, of course the book will also make you laugh yourself stupid even though it sounds so creepy. But in the later parts of the book it becomes very intellectual with an involving plot. Johnny is kind of like one of Shakespeare's great tragedies.

THIS is Jhonen Vasquez at his greatest, in my opinion. JTHM is filled with (very) dark humor that definitely isn't for everyone. Especially children.Through all of the violence and killing and blood, though, there are times of seriousness. My favorite quote from the book is:\\"SometimesYou can cry until there is nothing wet in youYou can scream and curse to where your throat rebels and rupturesYou can pray, all you want, to whatever god you think will listenAnd, still, it makes NO differenceIt goes on, with no sign as to when it might release youAnd you know that if it ever did relent...It would not be because it cared.\\"Even in serious times, though, usually something happens to make it comical again. It is full of satire, especially refering to gothic culture.This is a definite must buy for any morbid, dark person with a sense of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"Okay, let me make this very simple.Buy this book.Just buy it.Seriously, don't go ruining the ends of the awesome stories reading a bunch of reviews.Just...

It has some good points:- excellent artwork- occasionally extremely funnyHowever these are not enough to make it in any way worth reading. It is extremely violent, way past the point of being funny or interesting. It's really quite sick and seems very bitter about little things too. It takes a lot for me to not finish a book, and only American Psycho and JTHM have that honour. It's sick, vicious, over-the-top, bitter, pathetic, unfunny, and at times downright evil. Only finished half of it, and would not recommend to it anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"..JtHM..","review":"Well, Ive been a HUGE fan of all Jhonen's work, and I must say..this is by far his greatest achievement.

He's got issues, BIG ones. But somehow, anyone who reads this can relate to him in some form or another. There is lots of gore, blood, and just plain horrific brutality. Sounds splended, right? Oh,yeah..and he kills people- a lot. [This book is a collection of all 7 issues of JtHM.

Mr. V. is a genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly philosophical.","review":"Johnny is a \\"flusher,\\" a metaphysical sponge who soaks up all the negative emotion generated by the world. He also keeps a demon at bay by keeping a wall wet with blood to imprison it. In his depiction of Nny's quest to rid himself of emotions, rid the earth of jerks, and keep this demon at bay, Jhonen Vasquez makes you question what is real and what is simply a hallucination produced by the deranged mind of a sometimes-suicidal homicidal maniac, as well as poking and prodding the social norms and mores of common society. In all this thought-provoking whatsit, hilarity continuously ensues alongside very graphic- and inventive- violence and randomness far exceeding that of Invader Zim, one of Vasquez's other creations. I recommend that everyone who can take a joke and who can stand a little violence buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"This graphic novel was amazing, I feel as though I can never focus on books and I always tend to lose interest in books even comics but i managed to stay involved with this one. I honestly have to say this book isn't for everyone. If you are an older fan of Invader Zim and you just wished it could be more gory.. then this graphic novel is probably for you! It has the same great humor you would expect from Jhonen and it has plenty of quotable situations, I'd read it again and I've already read it twice since I bought it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnny now and 4ever!","review":"Wow! JTHM was truly a work of art. Once u pick it up u won't be able to put it down. Jhonen Vasquez was a pure genius with this book. He blended the seriousness of Johnny with humor and killing. But that's what Johnny is all about.The illustrations are excellent and the plot superb. There's no focus on the killing, but also not on Johnny's problems. It mixes well together and the characters are great. If you are debating on Squee or JTHM, get both, but JTHM first!"},{"rating":"2","title":"JTHM","review":"I must say though violent, gorey, and strewn with cursing, I ABSOLUTLY LOVED IT! The art is splendid, and the plots are wickedly funny. anyone who says otherwise is just plain WRONG! i noticed though it has many admirers, it also has people who despise it. in my opinion anyone who says that the art isnt good should just TRY to draw as well, and anyone \\"offended\\" by the comic has no sense of humor and should realize that its just a comic book, no one is really killing anyone. and if that realization doesnt help their tiny brains then they should just shut up about it and go elsewhere to be entertained. i only give it 4 stars because of much unnessisary cursing. but if you enjoy Jhonens other masterpeices or just dark humor, i recomend Johnny The Homicidal Maniac ^_^"},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnny! It's Johnny! Bow down!","review":"Johnny the Homicidal Maniac is by far the best comic book ever to grace the earth. Some of the best drawn artwork I have ever seen is in this book. And so is some of the most gruesome deaths I have ever seen too. YAY! This book is the first seven or so episodes of the JTHM series. Johnny (or NNY) is introduced in the first one, duh, as he really wastes Squee's (his next door neighbor) teddy bear. Johnny lives in a small house that goes hundreds of feet under the ground, where he takes some of his victims to torture and kill them. He usually only kills the people that piss him off. Usually jocks. Once again...YAY! But, I think that in some cases, the killings are justified. Johnny has to paint a wall in blood so that a giant creature on the other side doesn't bust through and destroy the earth. Giant creatures...YAY! I recommend Johnny to anyone that enjoys nice, violent artwork and a laugh a second."},{"rating":"2","title":"MMMOOOOOO!I fling PEAS!","review":"A friend purchashed this book for me for my birthday, from here at amazon from my wishlist as a matter of fact.I am a long time fan of Jhonen Vasquez's works.This D.C. of JtHM is great, though its missing the \\"Meanwhiles\\"(JCV put those in the d.c. of SQUEE!), it makes up for that in old sketches, early comics skits of NNY,random comic strips, and an interview or 2, plus explinations of what was going through Jhonen's head while painting the covers for each comic of JtHM, what he was trying to capture.This is a MUST BUY for any Jhonen fan out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"much better than american psycho thats for sure...","review":"people misjudge johnny, yes hes insane, yes hes of a sick mind but its a book. a comic book about taking out anger on people that push your buttons. its humor... american psycho was written and the world praised it. that book had no humor in it whatsoever and it was the story of a rich little yuppy who you want dead not just because hes a mass murderer but because your tired of hearing him talk and rattle on. hes anoying. the book \\"american psycho was a waist of paper and i dont know how it got published. johnny is just, i dunno, sick twisted and all together funny..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damn! This was a great book","review":"This is by far, the BEST book of any kind I have ever read.It has a high intellectual thought provoking text about it. It is not just a blood book like some think. But, I think every one who needs to read it, needs to read it.Read it if you answer yes to one or more of these:a.I like Invader Zimb.I have no problem with cussingc.Enjoy intellectd.If you can read.I like this book better than the SQUEE!'s though. Happy Noodle Boy is my favorite ::Points at Noodle Boy shirt::. I don't like Anne Gwish much.Also, BUY THE FILLER BUNNIES."},{"rating":"2","title":"Z?","review":"A beautiful addition any book collection. JTHM has the perfect mix of graphic violence, mindless nonsense, insanity, and storyline. I adore this book, and Jhonen's art oozes a kind of style that many artists would drive themselves mad to accomplish. Honestly, I find it hard to set this book down any time it's near me.My only complaint is that I couldn't find the hardback version here on amazon. I'm not exactly a \\"light\\" reader and find it hard to keep the book in \\"new car\\" condition. I keep the book in my backpack when I'm not reading it, and unfortunately the front cover has bent, creating an unsightly crease. So if you're looking for something to keep in your creepy stalker shrine to Jhonen V, I suggest you search the interwebs for the hardback version.But for the price I paid for the paperback, I find it money well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still good....","review":"I used to read these comics in High School and I thought that they were amazing. The material is still pretty good years later. The only part that I don't care for as much any more is the Happy Noodle Boy comic sections... maybe I just grew out of them, but the randomness just doesn't work for me. You could miss entire frames and not miss anything from the story of the comic (if there happens to be one). All of the gore is just as brutal as I remembered it and still amuses my sick sense of humor. One thing that I did find annoying with the book, however, is that there is SO much unused space on some of the pages. I wish that they would have used the extra space to expand the frames instead of just leaving these ginormous white blocks on the top and bottom of the pages. Over all, it's a good book and I'd recommend it to any friend with a special sense of humor. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Z?","review":"Yes, this comic is full of gratuitous violence. It is an exercise in unrestrained id, an opportunity to give the viscious little monster inside us all a pat on the head and take it for an outing.Full of biting zingers on social normalities and abnormalities, Johnny the Homicidial Maniac chronicles the life and adventures of Nny, a reclusive psycho who blends in disturbingly well with those around him. Nny keeps mostly to himself except for his bloody encounters with idiots, a-holes or both.Johnny the Homicidal Maniac will neve be for everyone. The frank, tongue-in-cheek treatment of intense violence is only for those with a strong stomach and a cheerfully warped sense of humor. For those who fit that category, its a gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christ, what a waste of time!","review":"This is a sick, unfunny, poorly-drawn collection of gruesome murders, scenes of torture, and so on. It offers no insight into why someone would kill, and it's just completely NOT FUNNY. No way is this worth reading; go read Ghost World instead. I'm a BIG fan of Vasquez's Invader Zim, so this loser was a BIG disappointment. At least I got it from the library rather than shelling out the bucks. The people giving this five stars need to read a real book occasionally.I suppose if you're under 25 you might find this appealing in a psychotic, anti-social sort of way; if you're not, definitely skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seriously Messed Up","review":"...Oh well. The first time I read \\"Johnny,\\" I thought it was awful. Sick, offensive, and just plain wrong. Then I became a fan of Jhonen Vasquez' after watching \\"Invader Zim\\" (his now-defunct Nicktoons show), and I gave \\"Johnny\\" another try. And loved it.To enjoy \\"Johnny,\\" you have to realize that Jhonen has a very twisted sense of humor. He holds a funhouse mirror up to the dark side of life, and somehow makes it all funny.You just have to accept Jhonen -- and \\"Johnny\\" -- for who they are ... and be happy neither one of them is your next-door neighbor."},{"rating":"2","title":"All bow down to the Greatness","review":"Oh my god...this is the greatest book ever its like the supernatrual greatest ever its about a guy who goes around killing people *made by the creator of invader zim* it shows that every one has a evil side to them and of course its fun to dement peoples minds haha k thats it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical Ideas","review":"Excellent book with full retreats (day and weekend) planned.

I am now back on this page, trying to figure out (1) where to buy screws (and whatever other equipment is necessary for mounting) that will definitely fit in the holes, and (2) whether the product description mentioned this lack of mounting hardware. It *does* say that the hardware is NOT included on the box it came in, so the hardware wasn't unintentionally omitted.However, I cannot see any mention of the fact this mailbox does not come with mounting hardware on the product description page, so I am leaving my first review on amazon ever to warn possible future purchasers that this mailbox doesn't come with any means to mount it to a wall.

The story wasn't all that bad, pretty original, but it seemed kinda stupid to me. I mean, Confederate soldiers reincarnated as a biker gang. Not really all that far-fetched, but why would the Crow wait that long? I mean, let's look at our past Crows...one year, months, weeks, days, same day... I guess, revenge requires a sense of timing too, though it really didn't work for me. I also didn't feel a lot of the emotion I felt with O'Barr's story. I guess, I'm so used to the lyricism and poetics of the original, that anything less just seems like crap to me. Anyway, this book is work a look, but I honestly do not think that any Crow comic will ever be as good as the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second best","review":"It was not as good as the first book.

However, the preparation instructions are perfect, and Keller does a rarity here - for every technique he uses, he will tell you exactly why it is being done that way. It's little things like tossing a salad with oil before adding the acid to protect the leaves and how big pot blanching helps with colors.

Knowing that these recipes are ones that Thomas Keller, being such a perfectionist, perfected himself is a wonderful reassurance that you are not going to turn out a mediocre dish. So much care and details have been the focus of Keller's work and it shows through this cook book. Of course being from the country's top chef, these recipes are not the simplest, and you should expect to see sub-recipes.

The harmony from all members is incredible and blended. The guitar work of Jim Messina is as should be, very placed. Timothy B. Schmit's bass work is right in the pocket and his harmony has never been matched by any in my view. Richie's writing and take charge vocals lead the band through some very tight songs both country and country rock. I had the pleasure of seeing them in concert right after the release of this album and the song (Nobody's Fool/ El Tonto De Nadie, Regresa) was done in it entirety, with a masterful drum solo by George Grantham. Every sound is duplicated by Rusty Young on his amazing pedal steel guitar played through Hammond organ leslie speakers. His sound on the pedal steel has never been done before, sounding sometime as an organ and then hitting such high notes and turning it into a trumpet.

I had to read these chapters two to three times to fully absorb all the knowledge that's jam packed in there.Even though the images used are great and demostrate some of the instructions or concepts, the book does lack images when it comes to describing how each individual should be posed with words, supporting images would have helped greatly in getting the image accross faster!

I love how it is exactly the lamp from the movie Aladdin. It is plastic and is lightweight. It makes a great toy to go along with the Aladdin toys we have. It looked great on display at her party along with chocolate coins, bangles, plastic rings and other treasure looking items we had out. Our table looked like the cave of wonders. It was awesome! The only reason why I don't give this item 5 stars is because I was actually hoping the lid was attached, but it's not and there's a little tiny pin that goes through the lid and attaches it onto the lamp. This pin doesn't stay in and so after having the lamp for only a day, the pin is already lost and so now the lid wont stay on. I hoped it was just a solid lamp because it would be less little toys I'd have to pick up all the time and that way it wouldn't get lost from the lamp...

There'd be no Prince, no Michael Jackson, and most of all no disco. The music changed the world as we know it, and put revolutionary politics into funk music. And unlike many other \\"essential\\" albums, this one more than lives up to its hype. The music itself is some of the greatest dance music ever recorded. The band has incredible harmony. This is certainly a mixture of the music of the past and the future. Sly took R&B and soul, made it heavier and psychadelic with more random tempo changes, which paved the way for 70s funk and disco. The songs also had political messages. \\"Don't Call Me Nigger Whitey\\" and \\"Everyday People\\" both are anti-racist songs. Before Sly fell into drug addiction and medocrity (post-\\"Fresh\\"), he made some fantastic music.

You can read beyond Margaret Castaneda's words and intent (which is not bad) and focus on whatever area of Carlos Castenada you might like to accumulate additional information. While there is not a lot there, what does stand out is that Carlos Castanda, like M.C. Escher, Eric Satie, and a few other harbingers of modern consciousness, was able to wrestle from his life a bridge for all of us to walk upon, his heart a highway for this generation. It matters not by what legerdemain he accomplished this feat, only that he by the force of his will, he did create this window for us beyond time.

For some reason Sony decided the only buttons that should repeat when held down are the volume up/down and the VCR rewind/forward buttons. As far as I can tell, all other buttons (particularly the up/down/left/right arrows) will NOT repeat when held down. This is a major problem if you want to scroll e.g. your satellite channel listing via the up/down buttons (or any \\"learned\\" buttons for that matter). This remote could also use larger buttons for guide, menu, exit, tools, and tv/video buttons which are way too small, but that's a minor gripe. Otherwise this is a really nice remote. Alas, I can only give it one star because it really doesn't come close to replacing a satellite or cable remote because of this issue. YMMV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy and great-just one complaint","review":"This remote worked as advertised. I needed a learning remote to use with a new Olevia HDTV, since other remotes have no codes for it.

The thing that I love about this remote is it's capability to \\"learn\\" button functions from other remotes. I had to do this for an old DishNetwork DP301 satellite receiver and a new Toshiba DVD player, both of which I couldn't find the correct codes for. My only gripe is that the remote lacks specific \\"named\\" buttons that correlate to functions on my DVD player and flat panel HDTV that are nowadays pretty comon across the different brands.

TV, Sony CD Jukebox, Onkyo Receiver.The big drawback, is that I cant get it to work with my Sony Blu-Ray player! I tried all Sony codes listed, scanned all codes, looked for tech support on the sony page, and tried to have it learn some of the functions. Nothing worked. It seems that the Blu-ray player has some new type of code/signal- I would figure using a Sony DVD code should work- I cant imagine soemone keeping a Sony DVD player in the same setup as a Sony Blu-Ray player... Oh well- If you have a Sony Blu-Ray player and get this remote, you may be stuck using 2 remotes.. I'm looking again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to beat","review":"The Sony RM-VL600 does exactly as described in the product description. The device picked-up my TV without programming. My amplifier was in the program book. The satellite receiver and the DVD player required manual programming. Although some original function buttons are not available on the RM-VL600, one has several unused buttons to choose from. The \\"Learn\\" mode is very easy to use. Programming was complete in about 20-min or so. This inexpensive device replaced four devices and it works with no problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"I love this remote! I can use it alone instead of fumbling with 3 or 4 remotes for various components. The learning feature is great! Just point the OEM remote at this one and press a few buttons and, presto, this remote learns the function from the OEM remote.It also has buttons you can program to send multiple commands. For example, I have one programmed to turn on the TV and cable box and then set the channel to the one we watch the most. Fantastic! Then I can press the same button and turn off both the TV and the cable box. Icing on the cake.I haven't figured out how to use this remote to program the cable box (DVR) to record programs, but I will try to figure it out when I get some time. My wife usually is the one setting the DVR anyway and she just uses the cable box remote."},{"rating":"2","title":"WORKED WITH 8 DEVICES - EXCELLENT VALUE","review":"I was looking for a universal remote to control 6-8 devices (2 Toshiba TVs, 2 Tivax digital converters, 1 Insignia digital converter, 1 older Pioneer receiver, 1 Magnavox DVD player, and a Panasonic VCR/DVD recorder). It was easy to program the Sony RM-VL600 using the manufacturer codes, or where those didn't work, to \\"teach\\" the Sony using an existing remote to transfer the latter's functions to the Sony. If you've taught the Sony remote and made an error for a particular button(s), i.e., if the button doesn't function as you expect, you may have to erase that button and re-program it, which is quite easy. It's also possible to search for the code for a particular device. Instructions and procedures are clear and detailed. I trusted the 300-400 positive reviews and was not disappointed. Excellent value. Claimed battery life is 6 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Remote","review":"I have been using this remote for a little over half a year already and this is great and macro actually works!

And the price is sure right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing....","review":"I purchased this remote to replace the remote on my tv (ProScan, from approximately 1990) and my two vcrs (Sonys, from the lat 80s). All had quit working, and none had replacement remotes available from the manufacturer.Well, this remote SORT of works, but not enough features to be useful. I can turn the TV and vcrs on and off, change stations, and adjust the volume. That's all. No programming features are accessible.Pretty disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best remote EVER!!!!","review":"This remote is called a COMMANDER for a reason!!!! I read other reviews, crossed my fingers, and ordered it. I was skeptical at first. I was in for a great surprise. I no longer have to fumble through 4 remote controls!!!With other universal remotes, all the functions would not work, and I still had to keep the other remotes handy just in case I wanted to access special features. NO MORE!!! This remote learned all the features from my other remotes!!! Best money I've spent in a long time! I can't get over how inexpensive it was too!WOW! Buy it, you won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't cover all TVs","review":"Be careful before you buy this that it has a code for your TV. It has no code for Norcent TVs, nor can it \\"find\\" one. All my other universal remotes either came with a code or found one with their search function. Also the code search function on this remote is tedious and gives no feedback, so I spent a half hour pushing channel up-power off with no results and never any feedback.I bought this remote because the mute button died on my old remote. The remote did successfully learn to mute and adjust volume up and down. But it's soooo not worth it to have a third remote just to be able to mute my TV! I tried programming it to work on my other TV of a different brand, but also an older model, and sure enough, despite having a code for that brand, it wouldn't recognize that TV either! My $5 Magnavox universal remote found it immediately.This is my first Sony electronic item and my last for sure. Definitely NOT worth the money or effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"This was a good buy. I was able to put my old TV, roku, and digital tuner by inputting the controls. However, I couldn't find the codes for combination dvd vcrs. While I was able to teach individual keystrokes, I'm not patient enough to transfer the whole remote so we use the original for that. However, I am pleased that I can control most of my video items with this one remote. It's also big enough that it doesn't get lost as easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"straight forward-not","review":"Pretty good for the low cost. Able to set up a few macros. Very poor tactile and visual feedback, as the buttons are all the same (just about) and the button light up only when pushed (that's when your finger is on it, so you can't see it).Anyway, still four stars, because it programmed all I wanted to program (ATV, receiver, DVD player) and works as advertised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complicated setup, but perfect functionality","review":"It takes a good amount of concentration to set this remote up.

I bought at christmas for my son, he is now 4.5 months (2 months later) and teething, puts everything in his mouth and sucks on everything. Well the wetness caused the wood to crack on three beads, I noticed it in time, a small bit of pressure with my fingers and was able to break all three beads into pieces. I am so glad this didn't happen when my son was playing with it, easy to choke on these pieces. If you use this item makes sure to check often for cracks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not for a baby that chews","review":"This pacifier chain is great-looking, but it does not hold up to lots of chewing/sucking. My son is 4 1/2 months old and puts everything in his mouth. I checked on the chain after he chewed on it for a while and noticed that 2 beads were cracked! I ended up having to throw it out since I was afraid the beads would break and become a choking hazard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possible Choking Hazard","review":"This is a really neat pacifier chain--great colors and shapes, holds our child's interest, makes the pacifier VERY hard to lose, and no worries about the product being made in China. That said, I am sad to report that after only five months of use, the yellow bead closest to the pacifier is splitting down the middle. Our child does put the chain in his mouth a lot, but he has no teeth, so my guess is that there's an issue with getting the beads wet (bad design flaw if that's the case) or we happened to get an item with a defective bead. In any case, I hesitate to recommend this item without reservation, and would suggest that if you DO order this item, keep an eye on it for splits in the beads."},{"rating":"2","title":"BLOOD, SNOT AND TEARS","review":"Jake Kilmer is on a mission.

As a consequence, characters are no more than placeholders, and there is practically no plot; just a long (and often boring) sequence of conversations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shaman's Crossing","review":"As the second son, Nevare is destined to be the soldier son. He accepts this fate with aplomb, doing his best at the Academy. Yet, once there, no matter how good he is, Nevarre is handicapped by his background, facing prejuidice that is impossible to overcome. Even his kindest actions have the potential for career suicide. Yet, his course was determined by his birth, and Nevarre can not be other than what he is.** Though billed as fantasy, other than being clearly set on some other world, there is really no magic to this book. The aborigine like people Nevarre encounters might have some magic, or it could be simple shamanistic superstition, much like the druids practiced once. The author has presented a highly detailed account of military training that will appeal to those who want to know more about that sort of thing. However, beyond that, there is little plotwise. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soldier Son trilogy","review":"I have read the other Robin Hobb trilogy's and was looking forward to a new one.

The main character goes from what you think is going to be a tough guy and turns into a whinning loser. He does nothing but complain throughout the whole book and made me wish he'd just get killed off like a character in one of Martins book.

This book is just boring. I've read alot of fantasy books, and this is one of the very few that I could not finish. I made it 200 pages before I gave up. It's written in the first person and it just goes on and on about what the extremely uninteresting character is seeing and thinking, but nothing actually happens. It seems like pages and pages go by without any dialog, and I found myself constantly skimming ahead. Pages would go by that I thought I had read, but I had no idea what had happened because my mind was constantly wandering. The book just could not pull me in. I kept thinking, \\"OK, that's out of the way, now something interesting is bound to happen\\", but it never did. I have read and re-read the author's Farseer and Tawny Man books, and they are amazing. I can't believe this is the same author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as past series","review":"I read Robin Hobb's Ship and Tawny Man books, so I got this at the library.

Knew nothing about this author, never heard of the trilogy, but I do enjoy reading fantasy. (Guy Gavriel Kay, Brandon Sanderson, Tad Williams are favorites.) When it comes to audiobooks, I generally stay with mysteries, but, boy, am I glad I took a chance on this! I went back to get parts 2 and 3 the next day. Great story, fantastic narrator.

I also enjoy her work as Megan Lindholm. So when I bought this book I was ready for a fantastic novel. What a disappointment. I hate the main character. I hate the world. I hate the plot line. I hate the pacing. I just can't finish this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Testament to her skill","review":"It's a testament to Robin Hobb's skill that I finished this series, even though I did not like it. I didn't like the main character or any of the supporting characters. By the time I got to the end I found that I didn't like a single character in any of the books. I found the prime plot situation of the main character actually repellant. Yet, I read them all. I had read the the Farseer and Fool and Liveship Trader series before, and very much liked them. I have not read or re-read any Robin Hobb books since finishing the Soldier's Son trilogy this March. I will probably try the Rain Wilds books later."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disapointment....","review":"Normally I love Robin Hobb's novels, and I was very excited by the prospect of a new triology.Unfortuantely this new series was just not that great. I did finish all three books, but unlike the Farseer Books that I read over and over again, these I would not read again. I admit that it's largely because I like your typical fantasy books with romantic heros and heroines, and grandesque storylines of intrigue and power struggles.These books are entirely different. Not bad, not poorly written. Just different....unfortauntely just not the kind of different I happen to like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ambitious!","review":"This is a well-written tale launching a new series by Hobb. Typical \\"first in series\\" issues noted by other reviewers are far outweighed by the writer's ability to craft an engrossing and thoughtful story. There's quite a bit here for the reader: a coming of age story augmented by themes such as environmentalism, sexism, racism, and class conflict. It will be interesting to see how the author parallels the protagonist's awakening to these issues with the conflicts they create in his society in future volumes. Fans of Linholm/Hobb's other novels should enjoy Shaman's Crossing, as should aficionados of Ursula LeGuin, Sheri Tepper, and Robin McKinley.As a service academy graduate, I also give the author credit for her accurate portrayal of a military academy. She nailed the feel of the first year experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow ? Slow ? we didn't read the same book...","review":"I loved it, Robin Hobb is my favourite writer, and the story of Fitz was my favourite one. Then i read Shaman's Crossing and it is better than Fitz, not much, but better anyway. I can't wait for Forest Mage to be released... Thanks so much miss Hobb."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissapointment","review":"I found this new effort from Hobb sadly disappointing and dull.I appreciate her efforts to explore a new setting, but what she does with that setting is ...not much. The central character fails to engage, and the novel moves at a snail's pace. I really found it hard to reconcile this plodding story with the verve that characterized Hobb's previous work.In the end, I had to force myself to finish Shaman's Crossing and could only consume it in tiny chunks to avoid giving up altogether. There may be the roots of a good story buried here, but unless the pace picks up considerably, it's hard to imagine this series ending up in the same lofty realm as the Liveship, Assasin and Tawny Man books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop now.... not a great series.","review":"Like many others, i went into this series on the heel of Hobb's OUTSTANDING past efforts. But this book was a chore to finish. Dry, boring, no real plot. None of the characters appealed to me, the story was vague and confusing. I won't be reading any further."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little to recommend here","review":"Shaman's Crossing is a slow read for the simple fact it is devoid of drama, action, romance or humor. I gave it two stars rather than one for the fact the author has at least went to the trouble of placing the narrative in a world that could have been interesting were there a story to tell or people to care about. I recommend reading the plot summary on wikipedia as it covers the books few highlights in a couple of paragraphs rather than almost 600 pages of useless script in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll try a different Robin Hobb next","review":"Although I've been reading SF and fantasy for 30+ years, I hadn't ever read anything by Robin Hobb so I was looking forward to a good read. Unfortunately I picked Shaman's Crossing, which now that I have read more of the Amazon reviews I understand is not one of her best. The protagonist is overly stereotypical and although very well described is not a sympathetic character - shallow, chauvanistic, and without original thought. I managed to finish it, but I have no interest in reading the remainder of the series, instead will try another one of her series. Somehow I kept thinking of Harry Potter, and how the description of a school year could be interesting, instead of a dry and boring narrative of the absolutely forseeable food eaten, boots polished, and military hazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"is this even a robin hobb book ??","review":"my dear fellow readers.i have all 9 of our fabulous writer in paper and in e-books as well. i am an avid reader. when this book came out i got it stright away. fast shipment...as i read the book i became astoished. this book is actually boring. weak, frail STRANGE carecters with no \\"meat\\" on them -roam this book aplenty.no serpents, no dragons, no fool/golden/or even a skilled magician no beast magic here no skill (double meaning...). just strange efany or what's here name... no magicship here...time and time again i turned the pages to find more boring un-even plot.again and again i found myself woundering if this is even a book robin hobb even looked at in her spare time.who wrote it? i can say it's not the same hobb woman...i got to page 50... and died from boredom..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasure to read","review":"I enjoyed this book.

David Eddings had two excellent series with the Belgariad and Mallorean, and now writes totally unreadable [...].After reading Shaman's Crossing, I actually wondered if Robin Hobb even wrote this book. It is the polar opposite of the Royal Assassin trilogy. Dull, empty, retread characters in an even duller setting of thinly veiled political sentiment. What the hell happened to the quality? Maybe these authors have taken their profits, settled on a nice island, and hired ghost writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"I've never read Robin Hobb before, but I thought this was a pretty good book.I'll keep an eye out for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good","review":"would recommend to anyone.

I re-read the Liveship series after this just to make sure I enjoy the author. I do. For me, it really plodded. This is a departure from Hobb's other works an is paced much more s.l.o.w.l.y. Even knowing what I was getting into was not enough for me to enjoy this trilogy. If you are sophisticated enough to have enjoyed this, please take the high road and refrain from trolling, this is my opinion and one shared by many others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best effort","review":"I really enjoyed all of Robin Hobbs' other books. This book, however, is a very slow read. Yes, tbe shaman twist is something different, but the vast majority of the plot has been done so very, very many times. I don't think I'll pick up the next book in the series. Too boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Robin Hobb's worst book","review":"As a fan of Robin Hobb's Assassin series, and a slightly less enthusiastic fan of her other trilogies, I picked up this book expecting to at least be intrigued by her imagination. Unfortunately, what I found instead was a detailed description of a boy growing up to be a soldier with a background full of possibilities that fails to ever achieve its potential.The disappointments in this book include a less than sympathetic and rather whiny main character, only a few chapters being devoted to advancing the story while you wade through endless chapters of minute detail of military school life, and typical characterizations for all the other characters. In fact, those chapters that are devoted to the plot almost seem out of place in this book.Recently, I read \\"Ender's Game\\", an older sci-fi book which has all the elements of this book, but delivers much more satisfaction. If you are interested in this book, I suggest you read \\"Ender's Game\\" first. This one will pale in comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"A by the numbers fantasy that doesn't really grab you.Much the same as Tad Williams' latest effort.This could just be your everyday book about a soldier with very few changes.

Hope she can come up with another series after this that is more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Waste of Time","review":"DO NOT bother reading this series. Great author, awful trilogy. This book and the following books are a punishment not a joy.The main character has virtually no redeeming qualities, and is totally unlikable.

After reading the Assassin series and the Liveship series, I was truly looking forward to another Hobbs series, but this is a book to read only if you have trouble falling asleep at night. The sheer boredom will work wonders for insomnia. I almost felt like I should force myself to finish it. After all, it's Hobbs, right? Or did someone else ghost-write this one? A real disappointment that I finally gave up on before I'd gone a hudred pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get FAT with Magic!","review":"I loved Robin Hobb's Assassins books and the Liveship trilogy. I was hoping for more of the same (epic fantasy of course, with great characters) and this trilogy does NOT deliver. This first book is horribly boring, as the main character, Nevare is dragged along by one of his father's former enemies (a dreaded plainsmen) to try and teach him some life lessons. He ends up on some spirit journey that will have later repercussions. The latter half of the book deals with his life at the soldier's academy. Unfortunately none of this is written in an entertaining manner, with Nevare musing over everything to the point of repetitive boredom. None of the characters in the world are intriguing, much less Nevare himself, who is too properly raised to be of any interest at all (he is shocked that women have thoughts other than \\"women's thoughts\\", oh whatever Nevare!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"sorely disappointed","review":"I was only able to struggle through the first 200 pages.

Even the scenery is boring.Well at least until page 200 or so, where I sadly had to decide to find something more interesting.Maybe I should start to believe Amazon reader reviews. I read and ignored them this time before buying the book. Won't do that again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It","review":"I am a long time fan of Robin Hobb, but I hated this book. The story was slow and very repetitive. The main character was boring and the one character that was interesting was taken away.

I think, unfortunately, that these books suffer by being written by my favorite author. This trilogy just doesn't stand up to the others.The setting is a bit odd....a confusing mix of old and new, but completely foreign. The politics and situations between the races I found interesting, but a bit confusing, and rehashed way too many times. The plot seemed to stop and start unevenly.I think my biggest disappointment was that I didn't find the main character all that likeable. He seemed nice enough, but I just didn't GET him. Somewhere that development that was so great in the Fareer and Tawny Man trilogies just got lost, and I ended up with a kind of bland main character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too idealistic as usual","review":"I can see the same flaws as the Farseer and Tawny Man trilogies. Characters who are so innocent that they stink. Then a coming-of-age which is being portrayed as an exploitation of that innocence. Then add massive amounts of pathos, guilt, shame, idealism, self-pity.....On the whole, you would feel like banging your head against the wall and pulling out your hair when you read her books. Avoid at all cost if you want to remain at peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this book. We don't always get what we want.","review":"Honestly, I wasn't too thrilled with this book. Some of the designs aren't bad, if a bit simple for my tastes, and the instructions are pretty clear. However, the pictures are not particularly well done. The editing of the book left much to be desired. Overall, the book itself did not strike me as being of particularly good quality. While some of the designs weren't bad, I didn't find them very inspiring. I was really excited about receiving this book, but I was rather disappointed. If you're interested in the fabulous concept of turning hardware into jewelry, I heartily recommend Nicole Noelle Sherman's \\"Making Designer Jewelry from Hardware, Gems, and Beads\\" instead of this one. Personally, I enjoyed it a great deal more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicted to jewelry; love this book","review":"I LOVE jewelry & easy little creative projects and I love this book. I wear the washer-earrings all the time & always get compliments on them! The designs are really good. These are 'urban chic' but have good, clean lines so they're elegant as well.

I'd recommend this; it makes a good gift too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip if you're an adult","review":"Very simplistic designs: earrings made by tying a knot in one strand of nylon rope, a necklace made out of two L-brackets, a chain necklace made of S-hooks and jump rings, a coupling nut stung on a cord.

Exam Cram 2 (2nd edition) has enough factual mistakes (such as referring to \\"the five knowledge areas\\" of \\"initiating, planning, executing, controlling, and closing,\\" when these are actually process groups, and there are nine, not five knowledge areas) that I don't completely trust the other information I'm reading. Another example is that this book sometimes uses the terms \\"process tool\\" and \\"process input\\" interchangeably, although they are completely different concepts under PMI. And one potential answer to a test question about Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs was \\"self acquisition,\\" which I think was a spellchecker's attempt to correct a misspelled \\"self actualization.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this one","review":"I tried three books getting ready for the PMP.The Rita Mulcahy book was the best by a long shot.

It is without a doubt the best written instruction guide I have found. Robert Chambers is one of those guys who seems to be able to explain complicated tasks in a very plain english kind of way. This makes it very easy for somebody like myself with no experience in logbuilding to be able to step outside and try some of the techniques on practice logs. He covers the very simple to the very complex and if you take your time and read it carefully you will understand both. If you are hiring someone to build your home this is still an excellent book for you. It educates the reader on where and how to look for good craftsmanship in a log building.

We are very careful pet owners, double-checking every ingredient in anything that they eat (in the same way that we watch our own food). Unfortunately, I fed first and checked later (something that I have NEVER done before and will never do again)!Imagine my dismay when I found menadione sodium bisulfite in this product. This toxic, unapproved ingredient has no business in our pet food. Its use is prohibited in many European countries, and our own FDA won't approve it.We have requested that PETCO discontinue the sale of this product immediately, until the manufacturer removes this poison.If you love your cats, you will not feed this product to them.

Mine started malfunctioning (that is, the switch and thus the light) after regular usage for about 6 months. The problem is, the switch rubs against a metal plate and eventually (and inevitably), the plate will wear down to the point where the switch no longer makes significant enough contact with the plate. Poor quality choice on the part of Coleman and impossible to fix on your own unless you're a electrician and have the right tools (not sure you could actually replace the plate though since Coleman does not offer a replacement).

When charging, it doesn't really tell you when the charge is full, however; so I'm not sure how long it takes to charge all the way up. A single nominal charge (of about 2 hours charge time) is worth about 45 minutes of light. So if you're camping, you'll need to have access to an outlet. Note that the lantern will not turn on when it is being charged (unless mine is defective). Overall, I prefer a propane lantern which is not much heavier and lasts days.

When tested professionally, the battery is fine, but the wiring of the lantern is faulty and defective. The night light option is now the only part that works. This was a very expensive night light. I will not purchase another Coleman product, because they do not stand behind their warranties, and their customer service is deplorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"No battery replacement available","review":"I have two of these lanterns. Unfortunately I have to throw them away while they are still practically in new condition. I mistakenly did not keep enough charge in them while they sat and now the batteries will not accept a charge. I looked on the Coleman website and they do not offer new batteries in their list of available accessories for this item. What a waste! If you are not able to plug these lanterns in at regular intervals, don't bother! Keeping them charged is too much trouble for me since I only use them seasonally and they get packed away the rest of the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"lantern","review":"What a piece of junk bought this about little over a year ago kept the battery charged but when I needed it during a power outage it didn't work test the battery it was ok bought new bulbs still didn't work. next stop the trash can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coleman Retro Camping Lantern","review":"Lantern is heavy but, perfect for vehicle camping.

GO TO THE COLEMAN WEBSITE AND READ THE REVIEWS!!! Virtually every purchaser of this product has had the same issue with the lantern failing after about a year or two.

Contrary to other reviews, Coleman has a stock of bulbs (Feb 2013) and I ordered 2.To access the bulb, there is one screw on the red trim below the clear section. Then you have to unscrew!! the clear section and lift off the top. Not obvious. So the switch was not defective and I'm happy with my rechargable lantern.Also- the bottom of the lantern unscrews to access the hidden car charger- again, not obvious since the wall charger is separate.

All in all it has 101 tracks on 4 CD's. The price is an awesome value...Also notable is all four disks are in individual jewel cases, stored neatly in a box.

It is the same mould as the original Tarantulas, but it has a far better colour scheme and contains clearly the \\"Predacon\\" symbol showing his allegiance!Tarantulas has two modes; a tarantula and warrior robot. The robot form has an alternative \\"mutant head\\". The transformation process is rather clever but easy to do.He contains a handheld gun concealed in abdomen. This can be spring loaded to fire a grapenel with string attached to his back, like a grappling hook. Some of the spider legs on his shoulders can be removed and fired from his gun as missiles.The toy has a striking image, the joints are flexible but not too stiff. This makes him good for both play and display.

It was my accent that always gave me away. However, having done the exercises in \\"Lose Your Accent in 28 Days\\" people no longer ask me about my origins. I learned in a very easy way the proper pronunciation of those critical sounds that posed difficulty for me.

Overall, I'd go as far as to say that this is the DVD to get if you are a Cradle fan. You get a live concert, a few extras including music videos, how can you go wrong if you're a fan? You can't. I'm very happy with this DVD, the live concert is fantastic, and some of my favorite songs are performed. The Sifting through Filth documentary is an excellent addition to this DVD as well, it takes us into the lives of the band, which they live pretty normal lives. But the jewel of this DVD is all of the music videos, two versions of Scorched Earth Erotica and Born in a Burial Gown. Great stuff. The worst thing on this DVD is the Blair Twit Project, it just follows them into the night as they walk through forest, stealing signs along the way. Another great aspect about this is that everything is introduced by Dani himself. Overall, this is a great DVD, worthy of you're collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent DVD by an excellent band","review":"This DVD shows Cradle of Filth playing a great live performance in England, as well as behind the stage stuff, interviews, music videos, a Cradle of Fear trailer, and other things that any Cradle of Filth fan should appreciate.

It tries to cover both the history, meaning and current context of Easter and I think it's too ambitious. It jumps from topic to topic and while it's on a topic, the book meanders.The conversational tone felt strange to read aloud since it's not the way that I would normally speak to a child. It felt a little too falsely bright. It asks the child to respond to questions like, \\"do you think...?\\" etc. and I was left hanging because the kids weren't interested enough to respond.I'll keep looking for a book that explains Christ's place in Easter for the preschool set."},{"rating":"1","title":"the law of the higher potential","review":"This is not the entire book it is only an excerpt of one chapter.

I bought this stethoscope while my Littmann Cardiology II was being refurbished. It's a bit heavy to wear around your neck all day, the tubing is pretty stiff, and minimal rubbing of the tubes while auscultating adds a fair bit of distracting noise, but the sound quality is clear and loud, and the materials are decent quality. All head pieces are interchangeable, and the kit includes adult and peds metal diaphragms, a plastic bell and three sets of ear pieces (hard small, soft small, mushroom). Considering the price, it's a great option for those who don't need the precise clarity of a cardiology stethoscope. A tip I followed: when the stethoscope arrives, the tubes will be stiff and bent. I recommend gently heating the tubes with a hair dryer while pulling them straight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfactory","review":"Many of the reviews on this item were complimentary. However, I can not hear anything with this stethoscope! I passed it around to my classmates, nobody else could either. Changing the bells is next to impossible without breaking out the pliers.

I wouldn't use this product if somebody gave it to me for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprisingly good","review":"I have an electronic stethoscope, have owned the master cardiology series by Littmann. Because I teach physical assessment and I am in and out of labs and wards, the idea of a serviceable, inexpensive stethoscope appealed to me.

I bought this scope because I realized that without a scope I'd spend my career borrowing scopes off of other nurses. While the quality of this scope isn't perfect (one can hear from both the diaphragm AND bell no matter what setting it's on, even though the settings do muffle one or the other) it definitely gets the job done. I've compared it to the much more expensive Littman's that several of my fellow students use, and I honestly couldn't tell any difference. For work that requires a high quality scope, like cardiac, then of course this wouldn't be the scope to go to....but for those that need a scope for regular use, this is the way to go.

If good looks are what you want, that's a valid decision. This scope is very solidly built. The head is heavy, sturdy, and shiny, the tubing is nice and thick, and the eartips are really not as uncomfortable as the other reviews say. But unless you only play a doctor on TV, you'll be disappointed with the sounds you hear through it. It's relatively quiet and the high frequencies have a hard time getting through to your ears. The artifacts from the tubes rubbing together are very real, and sound louder than the heartbeat unless you are standing perfectly still. You might have read that stethoscope review where this scope got a 10/10 score on clarity; don't you believe it! I have a cheap scope from a $15 blood pressure kit that sounds louder and clearer. If you want cheap, go with that one.

As with the lower priced scopes, most of them are very uncomfortable for the ears if worn at great length, and this one hurts if worn for more than 5 minutes. I can't imagine anyone would be wearing it for longer than that anyway...just an FYI. It's a bit heavy but not too heavy. The attachment selection is great also.If you have a pet, it's very important to listen to their heartbeat as it is your own.

Still, the author of this very small and lightweight book has only limited information and experience with the C# language and it shows.While I am not an expert on C#, I do know enough about it to know he skips important features of the language or doesn't emphasize features that should be emphasized (like versioning). All in all he simply doesn't do a great language justice.The book to get is Eric Gunnerson's \\"A Programmer's Introduction to C#.

After putting the CD into a random pattern play, I sat back to listen. After a few tunes had played, I began to scan the list of titles as I had yet to recognize anything. I was astounded to learn I had been listening to old standards--Begin the Beguine, Someone To Watch Over Me, etc. Not one song had I recognized. Improvisation is wonderful, but not to the extent of wiping out the entire melody line. On the positive side, \\"House Party Starting\\" was fairly benign, and the rhythm section sublime.

I thought there was no way any book was going to help me get her to sleep in her own room, but it was my last resort. My DR had said to put her in her bed, shut the door and let her cry...that didnt work, it only hurt us to hear her crying knowing that if we brought her to bed with us she would stop.

The book contains no more information than the pamphlet - it's just supplemented by personal accounts and obvious suggestions such as the need for parents to get exercise and sleep.

I am disappointed because I needed real, substantive coaching on this transition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good tips but not that gentle","review":"This book offer the same general advices that most baby sleep book offer, like keeping baby on a schedule, establish a bed routine, be consistent. The method suggested for teaching baby to sleep on her own is certainly more gentle than the ferber one, in that at least the baby is not left alone in her room -but it still is a crying it out method -at least for my baby. My 9 motnhs old has problems with night fears and this book didn't offer any advice on how to deal with it.

From day one, my baby has not been a napper. She is four months old and we've finally gotten to the point where we can get her to nap (at all) without being held, and her naps are still only 40 minutes, a few times a day - and she only will nap (GASP) in her swing! In my opinion, it's ridiculous for the author to insinuate that every baby falls asleep in the same way and that every baby sleeps the same number of hours each day. While there may be good tactics in this book, which could be helpful in getting your baby to sleep longer and fall asleep more easily, her attitude of what you should and should not be doing is very condescending, as if rocking your child to sleep will scar her for life..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned in a hurry","review":"Other reviewers described this book as offering conflicting advise and I should have listened!

I was completely against letting him \\"cry it out\\" (I have a major guilt complex, for one) so the advice from this book fit the bill perfectly. I started implementing the techniques and advice immediately upon reading it and within two weeks he was sleeping a sound 12 hours a night! He is now 22 months old, sleeps an average of 11 hours a night and gets approximately two, 2 hour naps daily. And while there are times when he gets out of his routine because of teething, illness or travel, we are always able to get him back \\"on schedule\\" within a couple days by repeating the tips learned from this book.

Other reviews summarize the content so I will not repeat here. My biggest issues with this book are as follows:- the ebook has no table of contents, therefore you have to flip through page by page to find what you want. This is a humongous pain in the neck.- whoever did the formatting for the ebook should be fired. I suspect that in the hard copy there are insert text boxes with anecdotes and highlighting specific points, but in the kindle version this format does not work well. The anecdotes sometimes start in the middle of a paragraph, making reading difficult.- the suggestions for each age group are essentially copied and pasted with very little age-specific modifications. The book is very repetitive, and could probably be about 40pct shorter and still convey the main points.Overall, not worth the price in my opinion. I would not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"I finally get my sleep at night!!!!!!!!!","review":"At 5 months my son would only fall asleep in our bed, with pacifier in his mouth and me holding his hand.

This book basically advocates crying it out for all ages. Her suggestions for soothing a baby are saying \\"sh-sh\\" and rubbing a baby's back. Well, that doesn't work when a baby is frantic and doesn't understand why you are ignoring her cries. After following some of the advice in this book for one night only, I feel I now have to work to regain the trust of my child. Yes, my child did not cry alone as in other methods, but there was still nothing gentle about it. Do what feels right to you as a parent.

I highly recommend for anyone who wants their child to sleep all night and does not want to let them \\"cry it out\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sleep book","review":"I have read 3 sleep books, counting this one, and I liked this one the best. It offers great suggestions for how to get your child to go to sleep and sleep through the night without having them crying or going through a major ordeal. Unlike other books, this one offers suggestions for older children as well as younger children and babies. It also offers much more in depth advice and things to try than the standard \\"have a routine.\\" This is great for people with younger babies, older babies, toddlers, and preschoolers who already have a routine and need more help.My son is two years old and we have been trying various methods for a long time, but nothing seemed to work for us. If I had it to do over again, I would buy this book and read it before my son was born."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that works","review":"Our toddler was throwing a fit every time we put him to bed. Desperate for help, my wife purchased this book. Thankfully, the book is divided into sections based on your child's age. My wife read the section about children our son's age. We followed the recommendations, and in about 10 days, he was going to bed without crying. This book was well-worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved us!","review":"Very simply, this book saved us from the confusion and sleeplessness into which we were quickly sinking. Just wish we had gotten it sooner. GREAT baby shower gift!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great for twins","review":"i picked up this book because it was mentioned in a review for sleep training twins. while there is a sections for twins, it is essentially the same method except for going back and forth between the 2 babies...it really works. at 9 months, i started sleep training my boy/girl twins. the first night they cried for about 25 minutes. the second night - half that much. the third night, they started getting used to the routine. while it did take the full scheudule to really get them used to falling asleep on their own, it is a skill that well worth learning. and so very awesome for the parents!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended","review":"We were convinced that we would be able to get our daughter to sleep through the night and this book helped us achieve that goal - by the time she was 5 weeks old! Of course you have to tailor the suggestions to your personal situation and use some common sense, but all in all it is a great resource. I have recommended this book to many friends who have also had great success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleep solutions that work!","review":"If you're looking for sleep solutions that work for your child and leave you feeling good too, this is the book for you. Ms. West's book is easy to follow, and, particularly in the case of our first-born son, who had slept in the family bed from Day 1, it worked like a dream.As predicted in the book, three weeks was all it took to get him out of our bed and sleeping on his own, in his own room. In the past, we had \\"Ferberized\\" him, eventually letting him cry it out upstairs in his room while we cringed downstairs until he fell asleep.Her methods also worked with our second son, although he started out in his crib and was only in the family bed briefly during a move -- i.e., he was easier to handle.There are also great sleep tips from Ms. West that will help your kids and you. All in all, an excellent buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL BOOK, AWFUL STRATEGY","review":"Save yourself months of trouble and DON'T read this book. This strategy = waste of time, energy and lots of unnecessary tears. The idea is to quell your child's tears but after struggling with this theory I learned that tears for one or two nights without mom are far better than tears for weeks with mom in the room. HORRIBLE STRATEGY!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old, tired, advice","review":"This book is the cry it out way. If you don't mind listening to your baby cry, or more accurately with this particular method, WATCHING your baby cry then great, get this book. But if you have a sensitive, attatched, and slow to self sooth baby then this book is not for you. I would suggest The No Cry Sleep Solution by Elizabeth Pantley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will continue recommending to my clients (and myself)!","review":"I work with infants/toddlers, and have recommended this book to many of my clients, however admittedly, I had never read it. After a brief vacation for me, away from my family, my typically good sleeper fell apart. she couldn't fall asleep or stay asleep. I read the book, focusing on the steps for a 2- 1/2 year old. I had tried the techniques, but appreciated the detailed tips on how to really use the system. The book was quite helpful!!!!! It's a straight forward, gentle approach. The book is well written, easy-to-read, and includes several \\"real life\\" stories, which I always enjoy. I will recommend this book to others, and use it if/when we struggle with our other children!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally - a practical and reasonable resource for parents!","review":"Most of the books available to help your child sleep well are radical one way or the other: either walk away and let your child scream, or do whatever it takes to keep your child from screaming. Kim West's book is a great, balanced guide to setting up healthy habits from the get-go. I especially like that she has such extensive clinical success, and has herself practiced what she preaches. A MUST for any new parent or parent-to-be. A great baby shower gift!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Want an easy baby?","review":"This book delivers! It's a true lifesaver for tired, frazzled parents. For the first three months, we did whatever necessary to keep our daughter calm and quiet. By the time I ordered the book, we were swaddling her, using a pacifier and bouncing her to get her to fall asleep; most of the time the bouncing was 40+ minutes. After the first day where each nap/sleep session entailed around 40 minutes of crying, our daughter got with the program. By the third day, she would be asleep in as little as ten minutes.It's been a couple weeks now and my husband remarked yesterday, \\"You know what? We have an easy baby!\\" This would not have happened without the guidance from the book. It took our not-so-easy baby and transformed her into an easy one.I appreciate that Ms. West actually says your baby needs x hours of sleep and y feedings. As a first time parent, I was nervous that my baby was hungry all the time. The schedules that she gives as examples really, really help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Better Sleeper!","review":"Wow, this is the third book that I read relating to sleeping. I got some results from other books but this one has tremendously help my son sleep better through the night. She puts the information in a gentle manner! I really enjoyed the information and I also enjoyed sleeping through much more of the night!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Start your new family out right and truly enjoy your children!!!","review":"I used this book with both my children; implementing the guidelines as soon as they were born. I cannot recommend it enough!!!! Our children thrived off the predictable routine and maximum sleep time. They were fantastic sleepers and still are. At ages 7 and 4 both children have been sleeping (in their own beds) from 8:30 P.M. till 8:00 A.M. without waking up since they were about 9 months old. I cannot tell you enough how great it is to have evenings to yourselves and happy children during the day. If you do exactly what is outlined in this book, you will have a success! I have recommended this book to many of my sleep deprived friends! I even acted as a sounding board to them when they wanted to cave and slip back into old habits. But because they too stuck with it, their children are now fantastic sleepers. Read this book!!!! Get your life back!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best sleep book out there!","review":"I LOVE LOVE this book! After reading practically all the books on the subject (an obsession in my son's first three months!) this book came out as the voice of reason between all the view points out there. Kim West really knows her stuff. I found myself always reaching for this book for advice as my son grew through each of his stages and as a result, he always seemed content and well rested. Kim helps you decide what's best for your child and makes you a confident parent in the process. Covers newborns to older children. I would recommend this book to everyone!!!! Great shower gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD NIGHT, SLEEP TIGHT","review":"THIS IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE BEST BOOK ON THE MARKET FOR NEW MOTHER'S. ALL THREE OF MY DAUGHTERS SWEAR BY IT, AND THEY ARE PHYSICIANS! I BUY IT FOR ALL OF MY FRIENDS WHO'S CHILDREN ARE EXPECTING. EVEN THE HUSBANDS LOVE IT!!MADDIE"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"This book wasn't for me. I think she wrote it for younger babies. My son is six months old and there wasn't that much help in the book for that age group. Also I was not able to handle letting my son cry, It just caused me more stress and even less sleep. But every child is different and every parent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 under 2","review":"I like the idea of this book but it is not workable with a 19 month old and a 5 month old. I can't take the time to sit with the 5 month old to let him get to sleep on his own while the other one is getting into everything that isn't and is strapped down. Maybe when the hubby has time off we can give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"This method works","review":"I must admit that I was skeptical at first, but I am happy to say that Kim West's methods really work. I was very pleasently surprised. Our baby has gone from waking up a minimum of three to up to six times per night to now one waking at around 5AM. And I think there is still room for improvement on that as we are still in the middle of our \\"sleep training\\". I would encourage you to give the book and methods a try even if you are a skeptic like I was. Just be prepared for things to get worse for several nights before they get better... but it is well worth the sacrifice for a week in my mind.It is also worth mentioning that our baby was not able to fall asleep unless she was feeding. The feeding calmed her down, which is natural, and eventually soothed her to sleep. This is the only way that she knew how to fall asleep. Now she can fall asleep on her own without having to be feeding to do so.Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This Book","review":"Kim West saved me from sleep deprivation, worry, stress, and chaos when I bought this book 3 years ago when my oldest son was 6 months old. Now she's doing it again as I use it to get my second child into good sleep habits. It's extremely helpful for newborns up to 5 year olds. I have referred to it over and over again for both of my children. I have given it away for baby shower gifts and purchased it a second time for myself after a neighbor borrowed it and moved away without returning it. I just couldn't be without this book. I purchased many sleep books before this one. This is the only one I kept because it is the only one that worked."},{"rating":"2","title":"exactly what i needed!","review":"What an excellent and helpful book! My eleven month old FINALLY began sleeping through the night and napping excellently after I implemented the strategies and tips in this book. I recommend it to all moms (and dads!)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the version I wanted.","review":"I love the first movie, and the second one is fun to watch just for the badness.

I have an NVIDIA DualTV card, and that one works... this one only gives me one tuner output. It's garbage, and the company who sells this card on Amazon is garbage too. They wouldn't take my return."},{"rating":"1","title":"Card only supported on Windows XP based OS","review":"This card wasn't horrible when used on Windows XP MCE. However, Windows XP MCE was horrible. This card is completely incompatible with either Vista or Win7.I purchased it not long before Vista shipped so the complete lack of Vista support has led to it being replaced. I still check to see if there are any drivers every couple of months but still to date there is no driver passed the XP MCE driver for this card."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant in some ways?

Prescription medications didn't do much and I heard about Vick's, but that didn't do much either. Then I read that because Vick's is petroleum based, it keeps the nail moist, which isn't good and it's this one ingredient in Vick's that really works. We have both been using Amoresse Thymol for quite some time. It cleared my nails up completely and highly improved my husband's. I just use a drop every few days. Yes, it smells like Vick's, but I don't think it's that unpleasant compared to the results it brings. This stuff is very inexpensive and well worth it, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT WORKS!!!","review":"I have been using this product for about 6 months, 1-2 times a day (but i did skip many days because i would just forget or get lazy) and I have seen results all of my nails. 8 of 10 nails are healthy now, still working on 2 more nails but the improvement is visible. I would say that for the worst nails, the improvement has been about 60 percent. I am buying my second bottle now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ineffective product and terrible customer service","review":"I purchased this product with great hope that it would be effective for my nail fungus; I ordered two bottles, however, when the product arrived one of the bottle's cap was loose and 1/2 of the contents had leaked all over the packaging! I contacted Dermadoctor's customer service on three separate occasions, and they NEVER got back to me! So I used the other bottle that I ordered without any positive results. I saw no change in my nail fungus (I did see progress utilizing Vics previously), and because of their non-existent customer service I was really discouraged. I finally contacted Amazon, and they graciously refunded my purchase amount. Thank you Amazon, no thanks to Dermadoctor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amoresse","review":"I've been using this for about a month and haven't noticed any changes so far. Very aggravating. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Nail fungus medication","review":"This product so far seems to be working well to get rid of a nail fungus. Seems to be a great alternative to the more aggressive medications that can have serious effects on the liver."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good!!","review":"Bought this for my husband who has had an unknown fungal problem for 10+ years. He's a stubborn one (shocking!!) so I can't get him to go to the doctor so am constantly searching for OTC meds to try and help. This is the first one where we've seen an improvement. He has only been using in about a week and half, but the nail bed is already lightening in colour! Looks really promising, will update this review once he's finished the bottle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!!!","review":"I have had a fungus type thing under my toenail for about 20 years now. The doctor gave me meds that did nothing. I read online that if it is a bacteria and not a fungus, then the meds won't work but Thymol might. Well, that was completely right! I have been using the Thymol twice a day for about 3-4 weeks and my toe looks almost normal (it used to be slightly raised because of all the stuff growing underneath, and kind of thick looking). In fact, I started noticing a difference after about one week. I can clearly see a gap under my toenail where the stuff has just disappeared. It is for sure an individual thing, but the Thymol is reasonable enough price-wise that it's worth giving it a shot. It is also easy to use because you just squeeze it on under your toe with an eye-dropper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an effective product","review":"I used this stuff for a couple of months (two or three times a day) and saw no indication that it was having any effect whatsoever.My guess is that it is mostly denatured alcohol with a little bit of thymol in it to make it smell like it should do something.... And perhaps it would do something... The same way that rubbing alcohol would do something!In the meantime, I started using 'Thyme (red) Essential Oil. 10 ml. 100% Pure, Undiluted, Therapeutic Grade.', and after two weeks... I see IT working..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amoresse Thymol","review":"Once I started using this product there seemed to be a resurgence in the fungal infection in my toenails. I was not able to discern any odor of the product ingredients - Thymol). I ended up purchasing Thymol and 99% percent alcohol and mixing my own 4% Thymol solution which was more effective. I would not recommend this product for purchase because I am not convinced it contains the proper ingredients (in effective amounts) as listed on the label."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT WORKS!","review":"I've had toenail fungus for almost fourteen years. I tried Lamisil with very little success. Using the thymol solution twice daily is helping! Warning: you must be diligent in usage, and the progress is slow.

For best results, nails should be buffed thin so the solution can soak in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopeless","review":"I was very surprised at the writing in this book--very difficult to follow because of poor grammer and syntax--I am surprised it got through the publisher--save your money --"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest..","review":"..dance mixes of all time!

The first 7 pages is about Anna Thomas experience on the Titanic and that's about it. If you have read the Titanic Hearings and have any knowledge at all concerning the Titanic this book is not for you. All the pictures I have seen before and the last pages in the book has the passenger list. If you are interested in biographies in general you may like this book.

(Though I think we can all agree Yoda couldn't jig his way out of a wet paper bag) Frankly I'm shocked that Hartman would release a film with such low calibur acting. I mean the fish aren't even wearing makeup for many of the scenes, and you can see that the female bass in the fourth catch is very anorexic. I look to Hartman's producer Big Mouth Billy Bass \\"the singing sensation\\" to recruit some talent for his next work."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"After paying almost [$$] for this \\"fishing\\" video, I put it into my VCR only to find that it has some of the most offensive content I have seen in any tape of its kind.

I suppose you could argue that it was fairly tastefully done, but I had hoped to show this video to my children ages 3 and 7 - far too young for this kind of material. As a fishing video for making babies, Mr. Behroozi is sold on \\"Best Catches,\\" and I suppose that Mr. Carver was really eager to \\"hit the bass pond\\" (don't think too much about this one, I'm warning you!) after watching the tape, but for those of us who just want to catch something rated PG, I wouldn't touch this video with a ten-foot fishing pole.

For this reason, and this reason only I give this album 2 stars. For those of you who DO like pop, then I'm sure it's great- catchy songs, high chart positions (in the UK), etc. But I could never listen to this music myself as in my opinion (everyone's is different), I would feel guilty about them being so much about image- maybe if they played the instruments that I know they can play in the songs, I could give them more credit. But aren't musicians about musical talent- hence words like MUSICianship and MUSICal instruments. This album is most definitely not about music- it's about having a good time and basically making you smile. If this is what you want from a CD, then this album is perfect. If, on the other hand, you want intellectual, thought provoking music, DON'T buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"utter tripe","review":"i have listened to this album whilst up in my sisters bedroom one morning and was completely disgusted with it. terribly simplistic back beat, badly sung vocals, and the most incredibly annoying melodies in history. If u want some real music go by a cradle of filth album, or somathing by dimmu borgir. stay away from the terror of steps"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album but................","review":"This US version of 'Buzz' is a good album. As with the earlier two albums 'Step One' and 'Steptacular' has a good mixture of Pop, Dance and Ballad tracks. But for those who have heard either the UK version (15 track) or Australian version (16 track) will know why the US version is only a good album and not an excellent album, like the UK and AUST versions. The UK and AUST albums have some great tracks ('Better The Devil You Know', 'You'll Be Sorry', 'Paradise Lost', 'Turn Around', 'If You Believe' and {AUST-only}-'Human Touch')on them that are sadly missing off the US version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy Now!","review":"True... it is missing 5 songs that were on the import version. But this album is still a great collection of pop treats from one of the worlds greatest bands. I wish they would finally get noticed here in America. Their record label is totally messing them up. They are huge in europe, and they probably could be here too. If you like the whole Britney/NSYNC thing, you'll love STEPS. Its a breath of cool fresh air in the pop music industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well deserved repeat","review":"The Duke Blue Devils had, in 1991, overcome significant odds to knock off previously undefeated UNLV on their way to the title. In 1992, the big obstacle was in the regional final against Kentucky, where Christian Laettner hit a turnaround jumpshot at the buzzer for a one point win. They would get to the title game against a Michigan team led by the \\"Fab Five,\\" who were all freshmen. But Jimmiy King, Jalen Rose, Ray Jackson, Juwan Howard, and the superb Chris Webber were no match for the determined Blue Devils, as Duke pulled away late for a twenty point victory and the first repeat for any team since the days of the John Wooden coached UCLA dynasty."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointing","review":"the book contained too many generalities ie. gunpowder development, gun fit ,. and not enough specfics concerning serial numbers and their dates of manufactuer .Very little information concerning Bertta high grade guns ie what were the predessors to the So, 5,6, and 9 when were they manufactured, and why were they discontiniued ,what were the changes? the same for other manufacturers. A great deal of the book was nothing more than a catolog available at most gun stores. the section on engraving was excellent as were the photographs.

Reading this book is a sheer pleasure. The photographs are about the best I have ever seen. It has been said the Italians make the best shotguns. This book explains why and how. Not only are they mechanically perfected, but they are works of art. To see Bulino style engraving is to think you have been transported to another world, where art, form, and function have come together. For those who enjoy firearms, own an Italian shotgun, or desire to this is a book you must possess. Sadly, one of the manufacturers listed in the book, Vincenzo Bernardelli, is no longer in business. They went belly up awhile back. Pity, as they made very nice shotguns for those who couldn't afford to buy something like a Piotti. A very well written book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice fitting collar","review":"Some collars seem to rigid and I refuse to use a choke collar on my dog.

The buckle is not secure enough it pulls right apart. It looked very comfortable on him but it definitely needs a stronger buckle for medium and large sizes. Wouldn't recommend for bigger dogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice collar","review":"I bought one of these collars for my dog because his original collar was too large. This collar is quite soft and my dog seems to like it. I have not observed any irritation or other problems from this collar, though I never saw any problems with his old collar.Unlike some other collars I've tried with nylon straps, the plastic clasp does not slip.I've had the collar for several months and it is holding up well. It seems better about not loosening up unlike some other collars I've tried on my active dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"This collar is sooo lame!","review":"There is a serious design flaw with this collar. Since they do not offer a small in the fleece lined collar, I ordered a medium which says it will fit my dog's 12 inch neck size. The collar is sooooo huge it could fit an elephant and if made small enough to fit the dogs neck, there is no fleece even touching him, it's sooo stupid. So, I do like the look of the collar and the fleece is soft, that I decided to cut the collar to my dogs size and sew it. The buckle is really big and made out of cheap plastic!!!! I don't understand why they dont offer more sizes considering the point of this collar is to have the \\"COZY FLEECE\\" against your dog's neck. I have no idea why I kept this collar to be honest, it was a waste of money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice collar","review":"I'm very pleased with the fit and feel of the collar for my lab.

The fleece lining was very cozy but I had to give it one star because one of the plastic clips broke after only one week of her wearing it. Now it is completely useless. For the price, I expected better quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This was soft, nice looking, eco-friendly. But what's the use of a dog collar with a plastic loop for the leash that snaps at the first rabbit that crosses the dog's path? My 50 pound mutt easily broke the plastic loop when she was at my friend's house. She had to be tied up for safety while visiting because he doesn't have a fence-- when a bunny showed up she busted through the loop instantly. Thank goodness she came right back but it could have been a tragedy. Don't let this happen to your beloved pet. Get a collar with a metal loop for the lead. You never know.On the plus side, Amazon was great with everything about the return, including funding return shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comfy but flimsy","review":"I was looking for a comfortable collar for my dog, and selected this one after reading the reviews. First the collar is plush feeling and soft, however it's bulky and at first glance the latch does not look sturdy. How true this turned out to be. On a walk with very little tension on the leash, the latch un-hinged and the collar release from around my dogs neck. Good thing I have a dog that is always right by my side, and wouldn't bolt out into the street. This item is bulky and flimsy, and I will be returning for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply Made, Do Not Recommend","review":"I got this collar in blue for my puppy last October. The soft fleece is really nice, but that's the only good thing I can say about this collar. The blue dye started to fade immediately and is now just a dingy pale blue one year later. The fabric frays too, I find myself clipping stray threads weekly. I'm just glad the cheap plastic buckle hasn't fallen apart, but it probably would if my dog continues to wear this for much longer.Save your money for something that will last! Hippies beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cozy yes, but it doesn't stay on.","review":"This is probably a very comfortable collar. I say only probably because it is quite thick and though the dog doesn't seem to mind, it looks to me what it would feel like if I was wearing a thick scarf wrapped around my neck all the time.But that aside, what I really don't like is that between yesterday when the collar finally went on his neck to this morning, it has already fallen off once. The clasp is just too easy to push, and when the two dogs wrestle - as they do a lot! - one stray paw push was enough to unclasp the collar. That's just not acceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"planet dog cozy collar","review":"I bought this so my dog would have the cozy side next to his neck. Well, this collar is grossly mis-sized, to the point where by the time I adjust it to fit him the cozy side is no longer next to his neck.Also it was supposed to have a chrome clasp and arrived with a plastic clasp.Nice collar otherwise Just be careful with sizing. I have a large breed dog and the large was too big for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"No size to fit my dog?!? :(","review":"Who knew shopping for a dog collar could be so difficult??

She then attacked another dog and by city regulations had to be put down. I spent money, time, and energy on this animal for a faulty piece of equipment to be the cause of her death. I don't get it. You have a metal piece for hook up the leashes too. why not take the extra time to make all the pieces metal to secure the collar.

I ordered a medium for my 35 lb basenji and a large for my 80 lb german shepard mix. They are both VERY hard on their collars, and I don't even like to get them adjustable collars because they break too easy, but I thought the metal might be tough enough, at least for a while. I was so mad when I opened the wastefully huge box Amazon sent the collars in (which was damaged) and realized that there were two collars with wimpy plastic clasps.

It is very well made and soft though. Since my dog needs a large but since she also doesn't have a St. Bernard type neck, I also cut the end and sewed it back up so the soft part is actually on her neck. She seems to like it and it now is quite secure and fits perfectly. For the sale price, I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dylan's Darkhorse","review":"Move over Blonde On Blonde and Bringing It All Back Home. Self-Portrait is a gem of self-indulgence, an icon-smashing downhome perversely honest take of Dylan and not-Dylan tunes that are individually more endurable than some of the so-called \\"immortal\\" Dylan classics (\\"Rainy Day Women\\" and \\"Times Are A Changing\\"--ugh!). \\"Gotta Travel On\\" is pure Dylan-roots and he pulls off a smooth, masterful rendention of tjhis old American faithful. And not even Gordon Lightfoot does a better version of \\"Early Morning Rain.\\" The recording quality of of this CD is superb and does what Dylan does best--stun his expectant fans and shatter their own self-indulgent Dylanesque-illusions! Disregard the negative reviews--run out and buy this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Worst Album Ever Made","review":"At the time this album came out it was mercilessly slammed by everybody, but the expectations on any new Dylan album would have to be pretty high after he had raised the bar again and again on making classic albums. This is just an album of a guy with a raspy voice singing some of his favorite songs along with some originals that he probably didn't have to take too long to write. Did it have to be a double album? Was he trying to break his contract? Not the worst album ever made, by any long shot, but worth at least a listen for any Dylan fan interested in where his head was at at the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"For all the brilliance of Bob Dylan in the 60's, this may have been his first major misstep. This album has nothing to boast of save Days of 49, a rocker with raw energy and gritty style. Unsuspecting Dylan fans beware. Check out Highway 61 Revisted, Blonde on Blonde, Blood on the Tracks and Bringing It All Back Home instead. That's my two cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was Bob thinking?","review":"To say that this album is uneven is actually giving it more credit than it deserves; it's uneven like the Titanic plunging stern first into the Atlantic. Yes, there are a few noteworthy tracks, but for the most part it's a forgettable collection. Dylan must have really been at loose ends to put this one together."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst albums ever","review":"What was the event that told us the '60s were really over? Was it the election of Richard Nixon? The Kent State murders? Or was it 1970's Self Portrait? The first song, in which Bob doesn't even bother to make an appearance, consists entirely of women singing the phrase \\"All the tired horses in the sun / How'm I supposed to get any ridin' done?\\"--14 friggin' times. Incredibly, unthinkably, it goes downhill from there. Pick your own favorite low point: Ours is the cover of Gordon Lightfoot's \\"Early Morning Rain.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusual album","review":"This record differs from other Dylan ones in that, sadly, it is boring. Some of his records are great. Some of them very good. There are some mediocre ones. And only a few turkeys.

This is his only boring one."},{"rating":"2","title":"the real bob","review":"a self-confesional album of sorts--revealing in the selections and delivery. dylan is from minnsota--as am i --this is a real look at a man--not posing, but being real."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bob's worst album","review":"Lately there's been a lot of revisionism concerning this album, with many fans coming out of the closet and confessing admiration, but I have never revised my opinion after all these years. It's still as bad as I knew it to be when it was first released. Maybe today it can be appreciated as a novelty item, but coming as it did after a series of masterpieces like \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" and \\"Blonde on Blonde\\", it was tremendously disappointing. All the revisionism in the world will never cover up the fact that there is nothing more to this album than scraps of failed attempts to produce an album of covers, most of which are truly awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frighteningly bad","review":"Dylan has produced so many albums that he is allowed a few bad ones. This is one of those. It sounds like he didn't give a damn when he made this one. Only for collectors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch...","review":"Don't get me wrong, Bob is, quite simply, The Man. But nobody's perfect.In my mind, Dylan was kinda drifting from after the bike accident until Blood on the Tracks. He had sorta lost it, I guess. When you consider the best Dylan could offer during this period was mediocrity, especially after putting out SIX awesome discs in a row (Freewheelin'; Times They Are a-Changin'; Another Side of; Bringing It All Back Home; Highway Sixty-One Revisited; Blonde on Blonde) is disenheartening. To make things even worse, there are two good songs on this album, out of 24, no less. Quinn the Eskimo is the obvious highlight, plus It Hurts Me Too is a good blues cover. Then there are some of Bob's WORST SONGS EVER. Little Sadie; Take a Message to Mary; All the Tired Horses; I Forgot More Than You'll Ever Know, The Boxer, Copper Kettle... you name it. Bob's put out mostly good music, with emphasis on \\"mostly\\". This is NOT an example."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"A terrible album by Bob Dylan. There appears to have been very little thought put into it. Many of the numbers sound like they were thrown together in 30 minutes or less. The production has no consistency and everything about it sounds slapped together. Some of the worst covers imaginable. Many copies of this album were sold to fans of Dylan. Most of them, I bet, were relegated to the back of the bin where they are still collecting dust and have been forgotten. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful variations!","review":"I love putting this on, without telling friends who the \\"crooner\\" is...his voice is touching, smooth, and friendly. I love the way the album changes from track to track....I can picture Dylan, a few years have gone by, and he's back in England....what must they now think, when he starts, \\"Ooonncceee upon a time...\\" with that voice, so different than just a few years ealier?This album begs the question: Was there anything Dylan couldn't do? I am so glad to have this on disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Dylan's Masterpieces","review":"It ages well. I remember how reviled it was as a kid. I recently listened to Bringing it All Back Home and imagined how incredible it must have sounded to unexposed years in 1965. The music and poetry are incredible. Likewise Self Portrait is just a Dylan album and a great listen. Dylan had removed himself from the turmoil and was enjoying making American music. Finding himself like all of us do. A great chapter in the life of an incredible artist we are lucky to have experienced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Dancing Album!","review":"My father always said this was a great dance album.

After having skimmed through the book three times now I have still not seen any mentioning of Atlantis. Why skimming?

I could re-hook it but it came undone with the slightest movement or pressure. When I contacted the company directly, they sent me a new bag. Of course, I had to pay for shipping but at least I have a new, more importantly, USEABLE bag. I like the bag very much and hope that I have better luck with this new one.Now, after less than six months, the clasp is coming apart again.

It is just the right size for me and the color red is smashing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strap attachment ripped off in less than 90 days","review":"I think this bag is great to look at. A little more dressy than clunky school days and hiker backpacks. I never stuffed it full. After using it for a total of 35 days traveling one of the strap attachment points ripped apart at the stitching. No longer can function as a backpack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just big enough","review":"I bought this because I loved the idea of a SMALL backpack bag that did not look as though I was out for a hike in the woods. While it may not hold as much as a tote bag, it is perfect for wearing around town. I always carry my keys, a small wallet, checkbook, cell phone, iPod, notebook and pen, a squishy cosmetic bag with lipstick and compact, and often a small water bottle.This might not work for you if you have to carry a lot of items every day, or if you carry your lunch in your bag. It did cause me to be selective about my daily necessities! But the trade-off is its slim profile and light weight. I do wish it had a larger zippered pocket on the inside.My original Urban Backpack is a year old and it's been everywhere with me, and shows only minimal signs of wear (some scuffing on the bottom). I have really been pleased with it. Just bought a new one in a different color!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Urban backpack","review":"This is a great bag.

I didn't use the interior credit card and checkbook pockets and found them annoying when I tried to find a pen at the bottom of the bag. The bag doesn't sit up well and falls over. After only 9 months of everyday use one of the straps is broken at bottom. I'm really disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Biggest Little Bag","review":"I wanted a backpack purse to take with me on vacation so that I could bring along the things I need, and still have my hands free. This bag is feminine, not bulky, spacious inside with lots of compartments. I LOVE this bag and want to get them in all different colors now! the zipper runs almost all the way around so that I can easily see everything in my bag.the magnetic flap on top makes the zipper ends discreet so I don't worry about someone coming up behind and opening it. The inside pockets hold my cell phone, ID, credit cards, and money securely. I also like the smaller separate pockets on the front and back side to hold my car keys. The first time I used this, I was also able to comfortably fit 2 bottled waters, my camera, lipstick and face powder. There was plenty of room for everything I needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"too small due to extreme taper","review":"I purchased this so I could carry a little netbook PC, a paperback, and my wallet/cellphone/keys around town and the netbook all by itself didn't fit.

I wound up returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but not a lot of interior space","review":"If you need to carry more than a guidebook, jacket, and bottle of water, look for something bigger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abundant in form but not in function","review":"I purchased a Baggallini UBC227 Urban Backpack in dark olive crinkle nylon. The quality of the material and the craftmanship were excellent. The color of the bag was as pictured. Unfortunately, it was not as spacious as I'd imagined it would be, given the physical description. Length and height were just right, but depth was lacking. It was not possible for me to fit all of my daily necessities in the bag at one time. Since I only carry with me what I really need, it's important that everything I need fits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baggallini Urban Backpack","review":"Perfect! I switched from carrying a small leather organizer purse by Fossil which I've carried for years, to the Baggallini Urban Backpack to ease some shoulder discomfort. This is just the right size (about the same size as my small organizer purse) and light weight (compared to my small leather organizer purse): 10 slots for credit cards, 3 inner pockets (1 zipped, 2 not zipped) for cash, change, cell phone, 2 outer zipped pockets, magnetic closure, small handle at the top for carrying plus strap separates to carry it as a backpack. I'm giving it a 5-star rating although I think some small improvement could be made to the strap. The strap is not adjustable and separates by means of a zipper converting it into a backpack style. However, I am a small, short person and the bag is the right size and falls just at the right spot on my back so it's perfect for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Ideas for High School or Possibly College Coaches","review":"There are a lot of good ideas in this book. The only drawback is, most of the ideas are geared toward high school or college programs, so many of them are not useful for most coaches.For example all 3 ideas for \\"welcoming new team members\\" involve freshman-senior interaction.

However, I was doing a fair amount of long commutes when the audio of Comes a Horseman caught my eye, so I thought I would give it a try. Looking back... I wish I'd read the book instead.I agree 100% with the previous reviewer... the reader was about as exciting as a sugar-free gelatin snack without the flavor and color.Pure monotone throughout... impossible to focus on the different characters... no change in vocal inflection to dramatize climactic events.

Hogan's work I could get my hands on, and he is one of my top two or three favorite writers. This is non-fiction, but it reflects the same clear and interesting style of his fiction. I would say that this book is not for a casual reader, nor was it intended as a textbook, though at some points it may seem that way. Artificial intelligence is a very interesting and widely misunderstood subject, and perhaps the greatest value of this book is in exploding some of the myths about AI.

Anyone who has been sufficiently exposed to the general public doesn't need to be reminded by the disclaimer that this film was inspired by actual events in order to believe that yes, people really CAN be that stupid. Spending the better part of 90 minutes getting beaten over the head most relentlessly and artlessly with that point wasn't exactly my idea of a good time, but perhaps someone out there might actually enjoy it. This movie is very much an answer to a question that nobody asked. What was the point? It wasn't entertaining, nor was it thought provoking. The only thoughts it provked in me were ones of disgust and contempt. I truly regret wasting my time watching this sordid piece of trash, and would encourage others to avoid making the same mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compliance Movie","review":"This is one interesting movie!

The concept was different, but hardly believable. I have a very difficult time believing anyone could be so gullible. The fact that nothing was questioned by any of them is certainly suspicious - I know I would have been asking questions. The young girl, the victim/thief, is the only one I could possibly forgive for being so naive; the adults...I'm not buying it. The acting was rather dry and boring, and none of the characters were even likable, so you sort of go through the entire film not really caring about any of them. Odd little movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly done, wooden","review":"Wanted to like this indie film, based on the reviews, but it looks bad (appears to have been shot in video in some generic suburb that's never identified but is probably in Canada), acting is wooden, dialogue ridiculous, situations unrealistic and not believable, even if \\"based on true incidents.\\" To be fair, couldn't get past the first 40 minutes or so.

I do not believe it is worth the time to repeat it as I do not think this film deserves a lengthy review. There may be people as gullible and stupid as the characters in this film, but to find so many in the same location is such a stretch that it makes the film annoyingly unbelievable. The total absence of common sense exhibited by the characters is so unlikely as to taint the message of the movie. It is a shame the filmmakers had to go so far with the circumstances as to render the film worthless and virtually unwatchable by a person of average intellect. This film should make you even angrier with its exaggerated voyeurism than your waste of time and effort in viewing it. A good bit less gullibility and stupidity by the characters may have made this an excellent film.

When fast food restaurant manager (Ann Dowd) gets a phone call from someone identifying himself as policeman, she springs into action. Young Becky is accused of stealing from a customer. The assistance of the manager and others in this matter grows until it becomes inane. The film brings light to the problem of serial strip search crank calls...something I didn't know existed but sounds like it would make for a fun date.The film acting was okay. There is a high perv factor whenever you force a young girl to be stripped searched. Unfortunately this is pretty much the entire film as there is no real subplot to entertain us. This is one of those pervert films masquerading as something that makes a statement such as \\"Shame.\\" Watch it. Enjoy it. Disturbing? Thought provoking? Oh Please.

I now use them only when I have to leave the house, whether it's errands or a day trip, and my 3 dogs expect this treat when I leave.

DO NOT RECOMMEND!!","review":"We bought this to repair a very light scratch that was causing the DVD player to skip during playback,Looking back we should have done a 'test run' with a dvd we don't use because it COMPLETELY ruined our DVD, (it buffed off the surface LEAVING long skinny figure 8 imprints around the entire disk!) The disk is no longer useableWe took the unit back to the store we bought it with the damaged DVD, they were SHOCKED and HORRIFIED at the damage.My recommendation....keep looking and comparing reviews of other units, and if you decide to try this one, use a DVD that you do not care about to test it out!

I then borrowed the skip docotor that i had given to my brother as a gift and it as well did not repair any disk i put into it, and in every case made it so the disk was not readable by the systyem.

And don't kid yourself- you can't effectively buff these dvds by hand afterward, I tried. You will have to strip more, using up more of the wheel's precious grit, and your dvd will look like crap.

Another big downfall were the sanding disks. They have to be manuevered into the machine to the point your actually bending them to fit,as they are very thin. Thus, the disks don't turn strait. It looks like a bent bicycle wheel.The sanding strips looks like they were glued on to the wheels, after only a few uses, the strips came off were they were glued,with excess flap hanging off, while it was turning.

The area around the base of the toilet gets especially grimy, and mopping just doesn't do the job. We'd gotten down on hands and knees with a scrub brush to get it clean. That worked pretty well, but used wa-a-a-y more elbow grease than we were willing to use. We thought a blast of steam would do the trick with a lot less effort. Not so. The tile and grout were a little cleaner (about as clean as it would be had it been cleaned the regular way) but not as clean as with the scrub brush. Kind of wasted our money unless we can find another use for it. I wouldn't recommend it for this application, but it may be helpful with other cleaning tasks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay for maintenance, not for initial cleaning","review":"This is not something you would use to get to tough grime and spots without the use of chemicals, but it's fine for maintaining cleanliness once things are already clean. Tried it on my oven door which is a professional Viking without self-cleaning (dumb, I know) and it could not even touch the grease build up. What it did do was soften the baked on mess, but I still needed a cleaning solution and a razor blade to really get it clean. It was okay on glass shower doors, but even that is still easier with a regular bathroom cleaner. The best use for this is in the nooks and crannies that gather grime and junk...it will blow it right out and the leave the spot clean. We bought it for \\"greener\\" cleaning, but it's use is limited...go with a full-sized steam cleaner instad...maybe the Steam Buggy which we also use even though it's a bit cumbersome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Euro-pro Shark Super Steamer","review":"Love this product so much I purchased Qty.

He was able to get out of his car seat by releasing the harness himself. VERY DANGEROUS!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Money!","review":"This car seat is AWESOME!!! I wish I would have purchased this seat first. I didn't want to spend over $200 on a car seat so I purchased the Alpha Omega Elite, thinking it would be a good purchase. I couldn't have been more disappointed in a product. On the Alpha Omega, the buckle was so difficult to use and the straps kept getting twisted. In addition, my son's head kept falling forward whenever he was sleeping (in the rear-facing position). After doing more research I went back to Babies R Us and purchased the Britax Marathon. The buckle is easy to use, the straps don't get tangled, and my son's head rests comfortably on the back of the seat whenever he is napping. Plus, it fits perfectly in my Pontiac Grand Am. I wish I would have purchased this seat first. It was well worth the extra $100. Don't go cheap when it comes to a car seat. Spend the extra money to get a QUALITY product. You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Owner of Roundabout Loved it Moved to Marathon UNHAPPY","review":"We have had our son in a Britax roundabout since he was 3 months old. We LOVED this seat. We were happy with the reviews and he was comfortable and safe. We recently purchased a Britax Marathon since he is now 3 years old. He is able to reach down to the release and easily pull up on it and can make his straps loose without me even knowing he is doing it which is extremely unsafe !!The roundabout has a push button that he is unable to reach and press so that worked to keep him safe. I went to the Britax website and saw that this is a common complaint, WHAT???? It seems that we are to teach our children not to unlatch it by themselves... I have an overactive toddler and I cannot watch him while I am driving. I wanted a carseat instead of a booster so he could not unbuckle himself. I am now looking for a different brand reluctantly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Seat!","review":"I purchased the Marathon seat in February after a ton of research and reading tons of reviews. I was nervous to put my four month old into a convertible seat so soon, but he is a big boy and outgrew his infant seat quickly. I am very happy with my purchase it is a very safe seat I love that it has the impact foam as many seats do not. The straps are easy to adjust with my son in his seat. It is also easy to install I did it myself, but had the fire department check it which I reccomend just to be sure. The velcro that holds the straps out of the way while you are putting the baby in is a nice extra.The construction and fabric seem sturdy and is a nice color and design. My son used to cry a lot in the car until I got him his Britax now he goes to sleep almost every time. It appears to be very comfortable like a baby Lazy Boy recliner for the car. I know it is expensive but this is a purchase you will not regret, it is worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"rockin' pop, fun and slightly avant garde","review":"This CD surprised me. It's not like what you hear on the radio, but in a good way. I had heard about this band from a college friend of mine and since I couldn't see them live I bought the CD blindly. I was not disappointed! It's unique and original alternative rock.

It does not fit on a table & on the floor it looks ridiculious. It claim to have a full spectrum light which it did not include( it must be 20 watt full spectrum which stores only carry 27 watt so one must order from the lamp company) & it claim to have a floor off & on switch which it does not!!

While not The Great American Novel, this book is a solid 4 of 5 stars -- and Gann's wonderful characters are perfectly believable to anyone who's spent time in an urban neighborhood bar. The characters of Haycraft and Mather in particular were poignantly drawn -- I've known several men these characters could be based upon.Gann's writing is first-rate, as you would expect from somebody with his credentials. Nods to Cervantes's masterwork are purposeful and enrich the story. What the reviewer felt was disjointed worked well for me, namely narrator changes amongst the characters.I don't want to spoil the ending so I will merely hint at my opinion by saying I might have preferred a more jarring climax.Again, 4 of 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"AN EXTREME DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"This was a waste of money and time. I am a PGA Professional, and I don't have a clue as to why Andrisani (very well respected) wrote what he wrote. Tiger's swing is FLATTER and more ROUNDED now, NOT upright. Tiger credits Haney with helping him develop a better DRAW, not fade. He could not get the ball to turn over with the old swing (also a reason why he went through so many drivers a couple of years ago). In addition, Haney is the one who told him to make his backswing LONGER, not shorter, and also told him that it was ok to have extremely fast hips; in fact, he said to just let the hips go naturally.I also was not interested in hearing about Andrisani's criticism's of other instructors' teaching methods. Some of what he criticized are actually valuable teaching mantras from the likes of Jim Hardy (\\"The Plane Truth\\"), which coincidentally, is another book cowritten by Andrisani. He sounded more bitter at times, than objective."},{"rating":"1","title":"???","review":"I agree with another reviewer here, Tiger flatten his swing. I don't know why Mr. Andrisani think Tiger changed his swing to more upright. Anyone who compares Tiger's 2000 swing and his swing now would see that Tiger's swing has flatten out.Yes, I do agree with Mr. Andrisani and think that Tiger has a fuller swing now than his old swing, which is more of a three quarter swing. But it is obvious that Tiger changed his swing plane from upright to a more flat swing plane and the fact that Mr. Andrisani thinks the opposite really baffled me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"plane\\" swing","review":"I have had trouble with a fade on the follow through,especially with the driver. This is because while my backswing is outside, my downswing is also out to in coming across the ball, causing a the fade. The key is to have one back swing plane and one downswing plane. I'm working on it. The \\"new swing\\" is going to help me going forward Ron Goerler"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad beyond belief","review":"Andrisani brings new depth of meaning to 'superficial' in his latest 'instant' book.Content is, as with Andrisani's 'Hogan' book, misleading and wrong. For example Andrisani characterises Woods' old swing as 'rounded' and his new swing as 'upright' whereas, as everyone with the slightest interest in this subject knows, it is precisely the opposite that is the case. How do books this bad get published?Rubbish. Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"tiger's new...i mean old swing","review":"I completely agree with the previous reviewers.This is complete nonsense.Haney is very much closer to the Jim Hardy school of thought(one plane flat) than Butch Harmon is.In fact Tiger's woes with the driver have continued and it's interesting to note that for the US PGA he seemed to be back to a slightly steeper plane which,as we all know,he went on to win. This book makes no sense to me at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great addition to the Tiger Chroncles","review":"Sometimes so much is written and talked about a living legend, Tiger in this case, that it's easy to get lost in the endless details of events and lose sight of the bigger historical picture. John Andrisani always paints the big picture built on the detail of his well practiced observations. He has spent a lifetime chronicling the great players and the evolution of the game as an editor and author. He combines a sharp eye and savvy writing talent to give us many important contributions to the ongoing conversation we golfers will forever have about our favorite game. This book is like sitting around the fire with friends on a rainy Sunday afternoon as we reflect on the current challenges faced and overcome by the greatest golfer or our time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miami Vice-AWESOME","review":"I just recently purchased this Miami Vice-Prodigal Son Video. It was AWESOME AND INCREDIBLE Experience that I relived. I am remmbering how wonderful, suspenseful and highly charged series this was. I was captivated all over again. This was the 80's but a good series is timeless not matter how old it is. Good Directing, Acting and good plot series this was. No Cop or Suspenseful Drama show can even compare to the Miami Vice Series even today. I was a fan in the 80's in still will always be a Fan. I wish there were more videos regarding this series. Please go get the Video you will enjoy not only the music but the plots the twist the action and drama will keep you in suspense. I Love MIAMI VICE- The Series/The Movies.

I am not a Pullen fan and my exposure to Pullen is limited to his work on a couple of other Murray recordings (e.g. the exceptional \\"Shakhil's Warrier\\". So I cannot comment on how well the recording pays tribute to Pullen. However, this is varied and enjoyable set, and well worth getting for the chance to hear Murray and pianist D.D.Jackson together for a full release.

I strongly recommend not buying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stiff and labored","review":"This series has received so much hype (not just here but everywhere). None of AF's shortcomings have been mentioned yet: the stiff fingerwork, the tempo rushes, the missed chords, the lack of real dynamics. She sounds stiff and tense, and that's how these recordings come off. As for \\"insights,\\" I don't hear anything markedly different from her peers. Things aren't helped by the clunky sound and the too-close miking. (I know we won't get the rolled sound of a Steinway from a Bosendorfer, but these recordings, all of them, still sound claustrophobic). Volume eight comes off the best overall, but in the competition of Arrau, Schnabel, Levy (who didn't record anywhere near all of them, but who should be sought out nonetheless), Richter (ditto), Kovacevich, et al, these are lightweight. (Interestingly, she does a very fine Op. 109 on a BBC Legends disc that's probably out of print now, accompanied by a \\"Pastorale\\" sonata and a mixed-bag Op. 111. If you see that, you should grab it.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blackfoot Boy","review":"Well laid out book, runs from one scene to the next and draws the reader with it.One part, where he describes his fathers death, was a real eye opener for me.

But the tale takes many twists, and is reminicent of life in the sixties and seventies. Navy life with all its warts and discipline, at times hillarious, but always full of interest. Life after the Navy and once again on the road, through Europe and the middle east.The style is energetic and once involved I found it difficult to put down. A sequel would be an eagerly awaited event."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listening for Lost Notes","review":"Michael Ondaatje writes yet another stunningly original little book--in this case, a fictionalized meditation on Buddy Bolden, an unrecorded father of Jazz. Bolden remains throughout a tantalizingly ungraspable phantom, the central mysteries of his life, his art, and his madness remaining felt but never quite pinned down. Ondaatje's prose is at times startlingly lyrical, and as he chases Bolden through documents and scenes, the novel partakes of the very best sort of modern detective novel--one where the enigma is never resolved, but allowed to manifest in its fullness. More 'experimental' in form than either The English Patient, or In the Skin of a Lion, it's as good a read as either"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zippity-do-dah-crap","review":"I've been forced to wade through a lot of boring crap in my life: Thomas Hardy, Jane Urquhart's Changing Heaven, Leviticus, and this book was one of the biggest bores of them all. Nobody seems willing to admit to the fact that everything Ondaatje writes is tedious, self-indulgent and overdone. This guy sits around for 10 years with this thumb up his ass and at the end of it this is all he has to show for it. True, he's not bad looking for an old Sri Lankan guy, but that's no reason to let this guy continue churning this stuff out. My advice to him would still be that it's never too late to go into a new line of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it 0 stars I would","review":"This book was offensive to me as someone who has lived in the north and the south. It hit on every possible cliche regarding behavior. North is bad; south is good. Money is bad; genteel poverty is good. Homemaking good; career woman bad. The heroine was a doormat, the hero a judgmental jerk. The whole thrust of the story is that family should always be forgiven (no matter how awfully they treat you) and you should sublimate your ambition on their behalf.

Unfortunately for her she comes back to Walton, Georgia. Everyone in this book has a quip for our heroine. New York is the big bad evil city. New Yorker's don't take care of the homeless like we do in Walton. I haven't even started on the mysogny in this book, how dare our heroine move to NYC and have career.There is so much anti-NYC bias for me and it makes me sick. It almost seems as if Ms. White is trying to stick every sterotype into this small romance novel. Big City=Bad People and Small Towns=Great People. Really scary and sad.

Second, the selection of songs is absolutely horrible. It's compiled by two guys I've never heard of and obviously have no idea what Trance music really is.I know I'm taking a chance when I buy a cd online in which I'm not able to listen to track samples and most of the time it is worth the money, but this cd was just not one of those times.My recommendation?

While most introductory texts like \\"Introduction to Genetic Analysis\\" is 90% molecular biology and 10% genetics, this book assumes that the reader has enough background to skip the usual obligatory exposition on DNA and translation, etc., and jumps straight to topics such as designing mutagenesis screens and epistatic analysis. This book is particularly strong in presenting genetics formalism to new students, and concepts usually glossed over in other texts (eg. dominant/recessive alleles, complementation) are explained in great detail, and possible pitfalls in experiment or interpretation are frequently discussed.Researchers and students working on specific model organisms may find this book a little too general, but it is the perfect text for new grad students interested in genetics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a consistant album","review":"This CD does contain some good tracks but is not listenable.I find I skip tracks which is not a sign of a consistent album.One of Bobs weaker CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Morning","review":"New Morning being the 11 studio album and it was relased by Columbia Records in 1970.

I give him credit for the attempt. Not great, but nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY ONLY 2 STARS","review":"Why only two stars in a great Bob Dylan CD...the reason is that the album is not re-remastered, the sound quality is not as good as it could have been if the album had had the same tratment as Blood on the Tracks and Blonde on Blonde..... and the cd is also silver, without that red beautiful Columbia painting on it.... I guess we should have been warned that this CD, and also the others 2008 Dylan reissues is just it, a reissue, without any sound or grafic improvement.... disappointing for fans such myself, that for a long time has been waiting for a decent record........Marcelo Frota - Rio Grande do Sul - Brazil"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob had to set up the future gems","review":"I hate to read reviews that rip on this album. Peronally, while I agree that it is not Bob's best, I do always enjoy throwin' this one on. It is amazing to listen to this, and hear the shades of \\"Blood On The Tracks\\" and \\"Time Out Of Mind\\" that were yet to come. Dylan was hanging out in Woodstock when this one was released, and was very happy with the domestic life. Musically, I think this is a great release. \\"If Dog Runs Free\\" is one of Dylan's most unique songs, and the pure jazz musicianship on the tune, with the great backing vocals from Maretha Stewart and the piano from the legendary Al Kooper, are excellent. Kooper never came close to getting the credit he deserved. His piano on the tune kicks about any jazz pianist I've ever heard.All in all, this is a solid release from a legend.

There's just the one song called \\"Christmas in My Soul.\\" My personal favorite tune is \\"When I Was A Freeport and You Were The Main Drag,\\" which is admittedly a strange title, but it has a propulsive melody and beat that any Laura Nyro aficionado will appreciate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Xmas is a WONDEROUS piece of Nyro","review":"Christmas and the Beads of Sweat is just amazing. It to me, was a departure album from the first three Laura composed. I is a reflection of the very new 70s and the climate of her muse then. It sets the stage for a more contempory Laura, invested in the present, and more accessable than the earlier works, which to this reviewer were simply amazing as well.

I find it one of the most compelling albums full of a different turn from her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beads still satisfies generations later","review":"Laura Nyro had a voice which was as powerful and beautiful as any singer in musical history. In Christmas and the Beads of Sweat, she combined her vocal artistry, poetic lyrics, and unflagging sense of beautiful melody, to produce an excellent album. While perhaps not her magnum opus, (listen to Eli and the Thirteenth Confession), this CD is still top flight. Especially good is the song, Upstairs by a Chinese Light, which shows her poetic, vocal and musical talents to the fullest degree: The steam of china tea/You could hear the woman sing/In the soft flames of spring. Ms Nyro died at the age of forty-nine, but still left us a varied and great musical legacy to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"great find","review":"I am so glad to find this CD available at Amazon.com, as well as other vintage works by alternative artists.

I hate scummy shower walls, but hate cleaning them even more. I just finished cleaning the tiles in my shower and it took all of 10 minutes between setting up the Scumbuster up to rinsing out the sponge! The actual cleaning part took maybe 5 minutes! You could see the reddish mildewy dirt run down the walls. I used a much less toxic cleaner in a scent that I can tolerate (Method grapefruit rather than my ususal toxic smelling pine cleaner) and it got the job done. The tiles make a squeak sound when you rub your finger over them - and no more film! I'll probably clean more often now that i know it won't take as much elbow grease or time as it used to! Great $35 product!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Powerful","review":"My mom gave me one of these last Christmas. She's 64 years old, and says it makes cleaning easier for her. Well, that may be true, but I've found I can do a MUCH better cleaning job by taking the scrub disk off the unit and scrubbing off the soap scum by hand. The motor isn't nearly strong enough to spin that brush very fast, and if you push down too much to really get a tough spot it stops spinning entirely.I suppose if you're an older adult with a touch of arthritis like my mom this would be very nice to have, but if you've got the strength and stamina to simply scrub your bathroom the old fashioned way, don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was the bomb!!","review":"First of all I loved the title, it actually fit the contents of the book.

But the heroes are badly choosen for the task here. Spidey can only do so much aganist the Sentinels, the Green Goblin is knocked out of action, and the Punisher has to rescue Shield agents from a downed heli-carrier.

There is a real feeling of joy throughout all the songs. It has big, rich sound that really conveys the glory of the season. Although this is listed as a Mormon Tabernacle Choir CD, the Philadelphia Brass Ensemble and Percussion and Alexander Schreiner at the organ are just as responsible for the soaring quality of the music. The instrumental music is more prominent on this CD than it is on most Mormon Tabernacle Choir CDs.I wouldn't list this as among my all time favorite Christmas CDs, but if you, like me, think it's important to pause and remember the reason for the season, you will find all your favorite sacred Christmas selections here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great research","review":"I love reading about the Mormon religion because it helps me understand what my Mormon friends and co-workers believe and how it differs from my own beliefs.I've read other accounts of the bizarre Mormon temple rituals, and this account matches those. The author clearly states what his experience was like when he became a temple Mormon. Because it was such an unsettling experience, he researched the origins of the practice in-depth and discovered the roots were in Masonic rituals.I really like the combination of personal experience and heavy research that resulted in exposing the false nature of Mormonism. I strongly recommend this book to Mormons who want to know the whole truth behind their religion. It is also a good resource for understanding the Mormon religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe you be smart, but you be boring.","review":"Good example of a scholarly-type thinking he is so smart that he deserves to write a book.

On the Kindle it is useless for it's stated purpose of providing poems to read out loud. Many of the poems are in extremely small print. One cannot increase the font size. There is some sort of goofy system to \\"zoom\\" the font. Sometimes it turns the print 90 degrees and enlarges it, sometimes it doesn't. Even when it is of some help it only works for one stanza. Press \\"next page\\" and you're right back where you started with no \\"zoom\\". There are helpful comments about each poem, unfortunately they may be inserted in exactly the wrong place. In \\"Casey at the Bat\\" after Casey swings his first strike come two pages of commentary.

The performance brings us first-rate artists in all the roles and the thrill of a live performance is exhilerating to the listener.

I didn't make it past the first few paragraphs. The language was such a turnoff that I deleted it from my Kindle after turning to the second page. It's not that I can't handle reading a swear word, but there are many, many fabulous authors who can write a compelling story without resorting to foul language. The first few paragraphs alone contain four different obscenities, and that's if you don't count 'whore' as a swear word.If you like that kind of thing, great--I'm sure this is the book for you. I don't use that kind of language, though, and neither do the people I live and work with, and I'd rather not see it repeatedly in print.

The result sounds like a parody album. On some tracks, it sounds like a bad Karaoke performance.In particular, \\"Free the People\\" is painful, especially when compared with the Delaney and Bonnie original. Bonnie Bramlett, as idiosyncratic a singer as she is, still shows much better range than the famous Barbara.Likewise, the Randy Newman covers are vapidly done, with none of the menace or energy that Randy brings to his songs.This album is basically a form of Muzak. Live high energy music filtered and sanitized for the housefrau set.Barbra sounds much better when she sticks to corn and schmaltz.Fer cryin out loud, this piece of crap was in stores RIGHT NEXT TO THE ORIGINALS!Do yourself a favor and listen to the originals. If you can stand her versions, you might find something new to enjoy as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stealing from others","review":"This is a poor barbra album for a few reasons: She doesn't seem comfortable with the material and others have recorded much better versions of these songs. She basically steals Laura Nyro's arrangement for \\"Stoney End,\\" and she attempts to steal \\"Just a Little Lovin'\\" and \\"No Easy Way Down\\" from Dusty Springfield. Laura and Dusty's performances are much, much better. Compare the two versions of \\"No Easy Way Down\\" (Dusty's is on \\"Dusty in Memphis) and you'll see that Dusty internalizes the lyrics beautifully to evoke the sadness of the song, while Barbra struggles to evoke anything. Barbra sounds stiff and uncomfortable with many of the songs. I read in an interview that she said she had a hard time learning to sing on the beat while making this record. It definitely shows too. Now, before I get lots of hate mail, I am a fan of Barbra, she definitely has a voice. But this is one record in which the elements do not come together. Not everything that she puts out is like butter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Babs wants to cash in on the success of the Fifth Dimension","review":"This was her first contemporary album and it's so obvious she wants to cash in on the success the Fifth Dimension had with Laura Nyro songs.

I have followed Gregg since his start asa founding member of the Santana band in 1969 or so and his stint with Journey.The first cut, \\"Give it to Me\\" is fantastic and reminded me of the early sound thatI liked so much as a teenager.

I really think Gore-tex liners are unnecessary unless you like to hike in very rainy areas. I've replaced the insoles with Spenco Backpackers for extra support under load.

It is gruesome, horrifying, demented, perverse, and, very often, hysterically funny. As another reviewer indicated, the cover of the old mass-market edition is quite misleading and not indicative of what awaits the reader. Scenes of depravity are written with gleeful gusto. This is gonzo horror writing, sort of a mad synthesis of 70's and 80's b-horror movies, the sensibility of a Hunter Thompson or Douglas Adams, Animal House, and more. I also enjoyed the references to many of Lee's favorite imported beers of the time. Mr. Lee published three novels before Coven (two under the pseudonym Philip Straker), but I consider this the true beginning to his career--this is where his reputation as the king of \\"extreme\\" horror began. Used copies can be costly, but it's worth seeking out.

I finished it to see what he was going to do with these characters. The characters are very one dimensional, and I just do not buy how Lee plays things out. There is no story here, just some provocative scene sketches. This particular tale seems to have a lot of RAPE obsession thrown in, yet written so that the victims LIKE it. Yeah.

In my search there are better tea travel mugs with strainers, I discovered one in a store and didn't have to pay shipping charges.Also, may I add, it's not fun to return an item, you have to incur shipping charges and they charge you a re-stocking fee, yikes that's like paying for an additional gift that you don't have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"I had such high hopes for this travel mug. Sounded great with the large mesh basket for fresh loose tea. The lid is a push on type, it doesn't screw on and the darn thing leaks constantly when you tip it up to drink. I'm giving this an extra star for the basket inside. Don't buy this unless you like wearing your tea instead of drinking it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Plastic :(","review":"I didn't realize it was plastic.

I have 3 of these guys and I can tell you that winner they are not. First, the refills (kind of a basic feature) are from Fisher and are the pressure type and not very good. Every one I have blobs if I write a lot. Next, the gel on one leaked and made a mess in my wife's purse (she was not happy). And the design strikes me as a little crude in comparison to the high price. Not a great value and I'll never buy another. I think the idea has merit but the execution is still in need of some work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional, well made","review":"I found the bag to be just what I was looking for.

It fits nicely in just about any mix, with the notes being well-defined without having to be too forward in the mix. I replaced the stock pots with 500k's for a little more clarity on the high end and adjusted the neck for best action; otherwise it's stock and is a favorite among my dozen+ guitars. The only drawback is that the tops of the string saddle screws are uncomfortable against the heel of my hand; a repair shop can trim these so they don't stick up above the saddles (that's next on my to-do list)."},{"rating":"2","title":"same here","review":"please post this one too and quit replacing my nickname with \\"music fan\\", I want people to know who did the reviews"},{"rating":"1","title":"I dispise this video.","review":"I think that TLC is a very annoying group of scrubs and I also think that they are evolved around chili's voice because t-boz can't sing-she sounds like a man.

Just go to www.poetry.com and submit the worst poem you could ever write, and within a month or maybe two, you will receive a letter saying you're a great poet and a semi-finalist in their \\"contest\\". Then you'll be asked to buy books from them in which your poetry is featured. I was completely overjoyed when I heard my poetry was to be published by an official SOUNDING publishing company. However, upon receiving my book, I was disgusted to find what I thought to be a good poem that I wrote was no more than a way for this \\"publishing company\\" to scam me out of my money.

I also liked it because it was an adjustable collar. On the down side where I set the adjustment on the collar it constantly moves so I have to move it back which is VERY ANNOYING. I have never had a dog collar do that. Also it looks like it was made with cheap components which would explain alot. I have three dogs and went thru alot of collars, but this is the most troublesome one I have had. The only reason I got it was because it was a Cincinnati Reds collar and it was an adjustable.

With new characters Taylor and Volchok, things really got exciting. Though it had a few plain terrible episodes, there were a handful of great, season one-like episodes like The Game Plan, The Graduates, The Dawn Patrol, The Party Favor, The Aftermath, The Anger Management, The Cliffhanger, The Roadwarrior, The Undertow, etc. that make the overall season totally worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst season of the series","review":"Well, this is by far the worst season of the series and possibly the reason why the show lost so much of its fans. They try to reuse ideas that worked for season 1 and the second time around it seems old and boring. Personally, the character of marissa becomes extremely annoying and the series arc is dissapointing. But if you're an OC fan like me you'll probably still end up buying this season"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Less Than Perfect...","review":"Though the OC season three isn't as good as the first two seasons, it isn't terrible. The third season made a good transition from the second season. Sure, there were some bumps along the way, and the writing is not as good as before, but the OC is still a great show. The good news is, the fourth season is better than this season, the storylines revolve minimally around Marissa since she's no longer in the show. New faces have come to stay in the fourth season, mainly Taylor, Kaitlin, and a small appearance by Volchok. If you like the first three seasons of the OC, don't forget to watch the OC at Thursday 9/8 central on FOX."},{"rating":"2","title":"The O.C. continues","review":"The collection is beautifully packaged and the quality of the dvd's is very good. The 3rd season was a bit of a disappointment as there seems to be more and more \\"unpleasant\\" characters in the series and fewer of the nice and positive ones. The best part centres on the relationship between Summer and Seth, and Summer in particular proves to be the only shining funny and clever character of the movie. My teen-age daughter is a great fan of the series but I personally think that certain \\"stereotypes\\" should be avoided or at least become more faceted(the poor rich girl who faces great emotional problems and turns to bad companies...Marissa, get a life!). All in all, the series still retains a great visual impact and the \\"adult\\" characters are still fascinating and very well played."},{"rating":"1","title":"The O.C has gone down hill","review":"Compared to season's 1 & 2 this season is pathetic.. the story line drags on and it just isn't good.. i watched the whole thing waiting for it to get better but it didn't happen. i'm only buying this box set because i have 1 & 2 and i want to finish the set..

I bought this Season a few years ago from Amazon because I didn't want to wait any longer here in Australia! And I'm glad I did because the casing is much fancier than our local editions, here.I was a late bloomer with the OC, only watching it when a friend let me borrow his pirate copies once season 4 had already began on TV. That wasn't enough for me, I HAD to have my own legitimate copies and have not regretted my decision.The OC is dramatic, interesting and yet fun and humourous. The characters all compliment eachother and none leave the viewer rolling their eyes and fast-forwarding to the next episode in boredom. I've watched the series twice now and will watch it again down the track. There's something magical about this show, something that 'just works'.

Where did they get this stuff? I hated to do it but the writers and Producers gave us no choice. Obviously many felt the same as reatings dipped significantly and the show was almost cancelled.Ashame that a once great show took such a strong dip in quality.

The template set is NOT included but can be ordered (from the author) for $60, plus another $20 if you want a holder for them. The book relies on your buying the templates. It gives tracings of each in the back, so you could make your own, but as most quilters know, there is a big difference between homemade sheet-plastic templates and laser-cut plexi-templates, both in accuracy and safety.

If you can enjoy a more classic type of American movie type classical, you will enjoy this.I purchased it for meditation. It was one of the more effective for this with only one distracting track somewhere in the middle. I was able to manage around it but beginners might not.The sound quality lacks a little in the highs but if you purchased this CD you probably purchased it for it's relaxing content which supersedes the tonal imperfections for the relaxing \\"lover\\". It's definitely a change of pace, especially if you listen to the regular Mozart. The change of pace was good for me.The modernist would not like this CD because it's a little vintage. Four stars for relaxing, claming, vintage classical change of pace."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Only It Were Funny","review":"A play named Urinetown. An opening called \\"Too Much Exposition.\\" A story revolving around the right to pee for free. Sounds like the makings of a funny, funny show.Unfortunately, it's not. It's heavy-handed and preachy, which would be fine, if only the show were funny. I am amazed as I listen that this show does not even make attempts at real humor. I never laughed once while listening to this disc.There are some redeeming qualities. The cast is good, and the score's a refreshing homage to the classics of theater. But on the whole, I wouldn't recommend this show to any but the most devoted of musical theater fans"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...","review":"I can't believe this moved up to Broadway while [the far superior] Bat Boy never made it! Urinetown is, like it's obnoxious title, pretty awful. Usually, I enjoy a musical that dares to be different, so when I heard of Urinetown, I bought a copy of the cast recording without having seen the show before.Here's what I thought:As with most musicals, there are a couple of winning songs (Look At The Sky, Act One Finale) but the majority are barely listenable. I'm sorry but for me, a musical needs at least nine good songs in order to redeem itself, not just two or three. Now, it has an interesting plot but that doesn't make up for the BAD singing (with the exception of Hunter Foster), annoying voices (Jennifer Laura Thompson, John Cullum), horrible lyrics, and true let-down of an ending. I give this original cast album two stars for effort.Check out Wicked, Aida, or even Seussical if you want a musical that delivers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not sure I liked any of this score!","review":"I gave this score a couple of listens, but now it is relegated to the \\"never to be listened to again\\" pile."},{"rating":"2","title":"great music !","review":"I think I listened to this cd at least 10 times since I receieved it yesterday.

But, after listen to URINETOWN, I change my mind and both shows should winner the tony."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS Won a Tony?","review":"You could say I had a \\"Urinetown\\" birthday this year. I got both the CD and tickets to see the show at the Henry Miller in NYC. I have seen dozens of shows -- both on and off Broadway -- and this ranks near or at the bottom of the heap, though the performers were quite wonderful. The problem: music was wholly forgettable, in one ear and out the other. Since seeing the show, I have repeatedly played the CD, figuring it would grow on me. It hasn't. Meanwhile, I recently went to see \\"Thoroughly Modern Millie,\\" which, to my surprise, turned out to be one of the best, biggest musicals I have ever seen. How the Tony Award folks could honor \\"Urinetown's\\" book and music over \\"Millie\\" is a mystery. My recommendation: Skip this CD and skip the show when it schleps to your city."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"What type of musical is this?\\"","review":"After seeing the show I had to get the music. The worst part about the show and the music was the tile, as anyone will tell you. Yet the subject of the songs is not one that you talk about over the dinner table, ex: \\"It's a Privilege to Pee.\\" But that is also why the music is just so funny. The best part about the music is that it makes fun of everything and one including its own show. This show does not have a great score, yet the lyrics are fantastic. It is a fun show and if you don't like the songs, at least like the title."},{"rating":"2","title":"A musical called WHAT!?","review":"When I first heard that there was a musical in the works called \\"Urinetown\\" , I thought WHAT! Then I found out that John Cullum was playing the head bad guy,and I knew I had to hear and own it.What a hoot! And the kind of total suspension of disbelief and irreverence that we can all use right now. As someone said,laughter is the best medicine, and \\"Urinetown\\" is at the top of my list of cures. Cullum, as always is superb,and the rest thecast is too. If you really want to get away for a while, listen to this irreverent silly soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging, consistent, and thoroughly enjoyable performances","review":"Let me start by noting an aspect that's too often overlooked on cast recordings: clarity. First of all, the sound is beautifully crisp, clean, but also authentic (you really feel like you're in the theatre, not a sound studio). Secondly, this is one of the VERY few recordings in which you can actually understand every word spoken and sung. These performers -- with not a weak one in the bunch -- deserve major kudos for their excellence in both enunciation skills and their ability to clearly convey emotion with every syllable.Beyond this, I'll simply re-emphasize what others here have rightly noted. This score is hugely entertaining... witty, warm, clever, and just dang fun to listen to. You WILL find yourself humming / singing / tapping long after the the CD has finished playing :)Oh, and if you have a chance to actually SEE this musical... well, you gotta go (so to speak :D)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ingenuous and Surprising","review":"Who would think a musical about controlled urination could be so endearing, but Urinetown sure is. In a nutshell it's about oppression and lack of freedom (don't be put off, it is neither serious or preachy), but it is clever and very, very funny. The CD is delightful from start to finish, very melodic with fine performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exhaustive research?","review":"I was given this book by a friend who knows of my love for Caruso's music. The industry reviews on this page talk about the \\"exhaustive research\\" done by the author. I had to put the book down after page one: within three paragraphs, the author repeats one of the most preposterous lies about Caruso's life, that his mother had 17 previous children who died within a year of their birth. Then I flipped back to the dust flap, where it claims that Caruso performed \\"an astonishing 37 major roles each year\\" at the New York Metropolitan Opera. Newsflash: Caruso's mother did not lose 17 children: Enrico (Errico) was the third of seven children. And no tenor every performed 37 different roles in one year, let alone EVERY year. To accomplish the latter, the Met would have had to run performances 52 weeks a year, with Caruso changing roles every 10 days for 17 years. How can one trust a book that makes mistakes like that before you even get to page 2?"},{"rating":"2","title":"great for little artists","review":"We recently bought my daughter this for her 6th birthday.

After an introduction and review of notation, several basic models are introduced starting with the TLU and progressively presenting more advanced models.The book is not aimed towards computer science students, and also has in mind other backgrounds. It does however require a sufficient background in science/math (basic algebra and geometry, vectors)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very understandable introduction","review":"An excellent introduction to the subject. The author does a good job of presenting the core ideas in as intuitive a manner as possible without dumbing down the subject. Rigorous math is avoided making this an excellent introductory text for those wishing to grasp the fundamental concepts, and understand the power and practicality of neural networks.

In addition, the second half of the book is comprised of some nifty tennis poetry. A solid buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Hard Rock/Metal","review":"I have to agree with the reviewer who says this is one of the worst vocalist ever. He sounds like he wants to be Marilyn Manson but has too deep of a voice. Horrible voice, rediculous lyrics, and bad songwriting. Seems like the band has a little talent but they're not ever going anywhere unless they find a better singer. Oh yea, and gotta agree with the same reveiwer again, just sounds like a bad clone of other bands. I'm not the type to judge a band if they play the same kinda music a million bands have played before them, that makes no difference to me, you don't always have to be original, just stick to what you know....it's just that this happens to suck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad","review":"This CD is a disappointment. I thought the band was ok live. The singer was very stiff but the songs sounded good. I finally got around to buying it... The album sounds terrible and thin. The songs are boring and drone on. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A clone of Dope, and a bad one at that","review":"Dope are an original industrial metal band that mixes techno samples, party rythyms, jackhammer beats, and heavy music together and make a raging soundtrack. Dust to Dust is just a clone that uses slower music and one of the worst vocalists I have ever heard. It might not seem like enough to dismiss them, but it is. Making your band into a carbon-copy of another is all to common these days. Don't get this because you might as well just put on Static-X or Dope, who sound just like the guys... except Static and Dope are talented. Don't get this... it's not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Package in good shape but two of them came broken.","review":"Two of the items came broke, Ralf Malf s foot was broken off.

Could not tell broken until my Grandson opened the package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite superb treatment of Irish history","review":"This is not only the best available work on modern Irish history but a wonderful example of how to give impartial treatment to a highly controversial topic. Many myths surround the Irish past, but Foster successfully strips them away. He is not afraid to criticise the post-1922 Irish state and politicians such as de Valera when necessary, but he establishes beyond doubt that the record of British rule in Ireland before that date was patchy and unwholesome at best, ignorant and vicious at worst. He also illuminates the complexities of the Ulster problem, showing that it is easier to caricature the province's Protestant reactionaries than to understand them. One other praiseworthy feature of the book is its biographical capsules, which are separated from the main text and neatly summarise the lives of the leading personalities of Irish history. If you feel you have a gap in your knowledge of Ireland, you must start with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry, academic, almost unreadable","review":"I bought this book based on the reviews.

Ever since this song's introduction to the music scene, my boyfriend has been obsessed with it. He refuses to take me to Chinese food restaurants or wear anything other than Abercrombie and Fitch. Additionally, my boyfriend has racked up hundreds of dollars by text messaging the lyrics to his friend's and anyone whose number he can find. Some point out that its poignant and poetic lyrics help us to remember our tumultuous teenage years in a more positive and freespirited light. I however, am taken to a dark dark place when reminded of McCauly Culkin's repeated abandonment during the Christmas holdays. I will give it one star for giving accolades to the one and only Kevin Bacon. Who wouldn't love Tremors, Hollow Man, or Flatliners?!

It should be mandatory reading material for all parents. I could almost feel the pain and sheer desperation of the parents in this book. Empathy is too subtle a word to describe what I felt for the desperate, self-destructive main character Dan. It has been several months since I read the book and the last pages remain vivid in my mind. It is a book I will not soon forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"The author of this book intricately captures the emotional complexities that attach themselves to this distressing issue. Mills' journalistic experience combined with his outstanding ability to construct realistically flawed characters makes for an excellent read. Mills' true brilliance lies in his ability to eloquently describe the roles the media and law enforcement officials play in the world of pedophilia. The plague of sexual abuse would loosen its stranglehold on America if more people were willing to tackle the issue as candidly and ferociously as Mills does. Not often do you read a book where compelling storytelling and necessary discussion meet as one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard-hitting storyline","review":"This book has a wonderful hard-hitting storyline with actual statistical data woven into the fiction that stress the importance of the issue of pedophilia. It's a thought provoking story that takes you through all aspects of the problem of pedophilia in a very interesting manner. The fiction makes it clear that the tragedies and the horrors contained in the book are all around us. It vividly depicts a real problem in today's society and it was backed up with a considerable amount of statistical information. This book portrays the difficult lives of several interconnected individuals, including a child activist, the parents of a child who was murdered, a pedophile in therapy, and individuals in the child sex trade. All of these stories give the reader insight into the lives of these individuals and what drives them. The reader feels very strongly about the words and actions of each character."},{"rating":"1","title":"teh suck","review":"Okay, it's a pretty case. But it does not protect for[...].

Markham cannot decide whether Protestants, including Huguenots (who seem particularly \\"romantic\\" to Markham, as to the pre-Raphaelites), are villains or heroes. The same applies for his view of Catholics, which is quirky. The depiction of women is horribly sentimental and cloying. Who would collect this set for its historical value, as the romance takes over from the history? I can imagine a turn-of-the-century girl or boy curled up in a Victorian window alcove reading these stories. Not all \\"history\\" books are quite as interpretative as Markham's."},{"rating":"2","title":"R1 Great Macro Lighting System","review":"Length:: 4:14 MinsR-1 Macro Lighting Kit Great Kit for any type of Macro Photography!!

The drums sound as though they were recorded through a 30 foot steel door from six hundred miles away and the overall sound of the album suffers the same fate.Songs like Racetrack and Pretty Life (so vital in concert) are limp wristed and lard assed.How songs that sound so good when you see these people live can die such a horrific studio death is beyond me.I think THS should really think about changing producers or do something positive for the next release, because this is 12 tracks of bad news."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless.

The thermoplastic is terrible, it got holes in it when I bit down, and it was so white it didnt blend into my mouth and natural teeth at all. The fangs themselves were nice, but their fastening method with the thermoplastic is junk. It looked terrible once I molded them and yet they STILL were not secure. The Scarecrow ones may not have been the shade or shape I wanted, but at least they fit right, blended into the rest of my teeth well, and they are durable enough to last through two seasons of Dracula performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"terribly hard to fit","review":"these suck, and not in the good way, terribly hard to fit. and the \\"amazing\\" thermoplastic hardens so fast you cant adjust it at all..I do not recommend these to anyone, waster of 20 bucks and ruined my halloween"},{"rating":"2","title":"Custom Vampire Fangs that look real!","review":"When I bought these I was skeptical how real they could look.

After making sure the mold was set and dry, I took a razor blade to the access molding on the front of the teeth. They look completely real now! I can smile wide open teeth baring and you can't tell they are fake! These teeth molded so well, they are held in by very little of the molding stuff and will look completely real if you take your time and cut off the access molding.

Recently, I could not get her version of Me and Bobby Mcgee out of my head and so purchased the cd, with 4 bonus live cuts. They are not really necessary, but Try is nice to have. Janis Joplin could sing, but some times her histrionics left unchecked got on your nerves. That is why Cry Baby has limited appeal for me. But listen to A woman left Lonely, Me and Bobby Mcgee, My Baby, Trust in me, Get it While and you can see what an emotive and sensitive singer she could be.

The rest of the album is Janis at her best vocally and musically \\"Move Over\\" a song penned by Janis is the lead track and probably the best song on the record.

The booms and bangs of the Full Tilt Boogie Band are clearer than ever, the album is still a classic, but KOZMIC BLUES is still better. The bonus tracks, taken from Toronto and Calgary 1970, vary from good to bad. \\"Tell Mama\\" from Calgary is excellent, I think is just as good as the Toronto version. \\"Little Girl Blue\\" from Calgary is different, but is not worth listening to more than once. \\"Try\\" from Toronto is great, but \\"Cry Baby\\" from Toronto has Janis hollering and straining her voice, so is pathetic in my opinion.

I have tried his methodology and find that changes are possible with a minimum of effort on my part. I have to say, It Works. My only reason for downgrading my rating to 4, is that I find his writing style hard to follow. And, a little disbelief that suggestion can cure, or add to the cure in so many disorders.

That being said, it was also cheaper than what I could find locally. So better quality an cheaper is a pretty good combination; I just bothered me that I needed to adjust hardware on the doors. This does not come with a board - as I had three lying around, that wasn't a problem.I feel like I got what I paid for - not a deal, but an appropriate value for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Very disappointed with this item.

This product is crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing source for biracial people who feel alone!","review":"I received this book as a gift from a mentor in undergraduate school. It has brought so much to me in terms of understanding my experiences as a biracial person, especially growing up in a rural mostly white town. This book is also great for people who want to know what struggles we face as we try to define ourselves both as individuals and as members of society. There are also some wonderful stories written by parents of biracial and bicultural children that speak to their worries, fears and hopes for their offspring. I found those stories particularly amazing because they speak to the differences between children and their parents. Overall, this book is a collection of stories that unifies the experience of falling somewhere in between."},{"rating":"2","title":"Half and Half is engaging and insightful","review":"This collection of essays from well known contemporary \\"ethnic\\" writers takes the reader through myriad of racial and cultural \\"combinations\\" and the results of those combinations. For those who come from a bicultural or biracial background, you will find yourself nodding in agreement with some of the issues tackled by each of the authors. For those who are merely looking for a fascinating read, this book will open your mind to the issues that confront a sector of the American population which is often ignored or discounted. From the book, the reader senses how the need for us to categorize people neatly in racial/ethnic boxes can affect a whole generation of Americans who identify with 2 or more ethnic groups. This is a must read for people who want to stay in tune with the social trends of the ethnic potpourri that is the 90's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good start for a biracial-bicultural search","review":"As the mother of biracial children and as a bicultural person living in a country other than the one where I was born, I found this book a great help. It raises questions and possibilities about the confusion of biracial children, and also provides food for thought as well as comfort for those of us raising them. A good (amazing) variety of cultures is presented as well as a variety of different positions. It was a joy for me to be introduced to the writers in this collection and to find out that there is a body of literature in this field. (I've accessed this site today to order books mentioned.) Ms. O'Hearn is to be commended, and thanked, for the thoughtful, well-written essays, including her own. I'm looking forward to finding more \\"kindred spirits\\" based on the writers have been introduced to here."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wanted to Love This","review":"As a bi-racial woman, I am always looking for books about the multi-racial experience in America.

The subject matter alone was enough to pique my interest--and, man, was my interest piqued! As an avid erotica reader, I'm often disappointed by stories that are unoriginal and flat, with 2-D characters and lame dialogue. But this book features original, sexy, well-drawn female characters: a female pirate and her cabin boy (who's really a woman), hard-core punk rockers, brawny biker chicks, SF grunge grrls, an arm wrestler, hunky bodyguards, a [frisky] Middle-Eastern princess...

Besides the usual Thomas style claptrap, the stories bend over backwards to never mention the word Christmas and it is somewhat ridiculous. My family is not particularly religious but the strain to avoid any religious conotation to a religious holiday was almost embarrasing, definitely offensive. This is definitely one to avoid. The kids sort of liked it, but it didn't keep their interest for long.

I was a little disappointed to see that this was more like 4 small episodes instead of one movie linked but it was listed in the description as being that way.

The title should have been a red flag. The absence of the word Christmas is extremely obvious and awkward. Terms like winter star, winter decoration, winter celebration, winter tree, etc, is such a slap in the face to every Christian or person who is disgusted with companies afraid of offending muslims, Jews and other religions that do not celebrate Christmas.

Come on! Christmas may be a Christian holiday, but it is now being enjoyed by people of many different religious background; to avoid mentioning \\"Christmas\\"-- I assume so that non-Christians viewers and would-be viewers wouldn't be turned off or somehow offended--is rather ridiculous. \\"Merry Winter Holidays?\\" God, what a bunch of hipocrites!!!!

While the collection of songs in this book is impressive, I would recommend any other tablature book instead of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I've been playing guitar for 30 years and, as a hobby, I collect tablature. This tab book is simply the worst I've seen. Most of the riffs are not tabbed, none of the solos are. The basic chord structure is given and that's it. Heck, even some of the lyrics are wrong. The Iron Maiden Tab books that followed are excellent and very accurate. I keep hoping for new, revised edition of this book. No such luck, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"No solos","review":"If you are trying to learn the solos of the first four Iron Maiden albums (S/T, Killers, Number of the Beast, and Piece of Mind), this is not the book for you.

This has no solo arrangements and not all the riffs are tabbed. I enjoyed the interview and thats about it. I probably learned about 3-5 song but I couldnt learn the whole song cuz none of the songs are tabbed all the way through. This is not worth your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Tab Book Ever","review":"I've played guitar for 20 years and have a lot of tab. This is probably the worst book I have ever purchased.

It's got some nice pictures and interviews, but that's about it. I wasted my money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half-Decent","review":"If your looking for a basic arrangement of songs, then this book is decent. It is lacking in a majority riffs and solos. Do not expect to buy this book and get each song tabbed out entirely, or each song tabbed like it is played on the album. Its a good place to start, but overall I was unimpressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of c...p!!! Don't buy!!!","review":"As someone wrote, if Amazon allowed us to rate negatively, I would rate this book minus 9. This is NOT a real tab book. Contains parts of solos here and there. If the publisher would be serious, they would scrap this version and re-do it. It is bad because it contains the songs of the fist maiden albums. Give a try to these guys though 3W guitarrockpower. they sell on you know which popular sites. Their tabs are often very long (10 pages or so) but all the notes are there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for collectors, not for learning how to play the songs.","review":"If you are looking for a complete notation of the songs, this book isn't for you.

I bought this back in the mid 80's when it came out, and returned to the publisher. Terrible, terrible tab; at the time I could have lived without solos (as I was fairly new at guitar), but at least get the riffs right! It sounds like in the years since they haven't improved the product at all.Which is a shame, because I think there would be a real market for a tab book done well that covers the 1st 4 Maiden albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible tab book","review":"this tab book is not complete songs,with NO solos at all. do not buy this item.i sent mine back for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Excellent for parents in the instruction of children...\\"","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Dr. Gill's book, and its shortcomings have been previously mentioned. However, it needs to be emphasized that the author is Scriptural in his foundation-tenets, which make his recommendations all the more relevant.Yes, the format is somewhat academic--personally, I saw this as strength, not a weakness. Not everyone (obviously) will agree. But the tone and voice of the author are pleasing, and I cannot imagine one person not being blessed by the instructions found within. The contents would also be an excellent study for parents in the instruction of children.I can only recall one other book, \\"With Joseph in the University of Adversity\\", which spells out so clearly the things that make up character in the Christian life. While that book is more universal in its appeal and a significantly easier read, Gill by no means addresses a restricted audience. RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a student of Gill...","review":"David Gill's books can be a bit academic. At times you really have to want it to get through the books. But if you can do it, there is great wealth to be found.I have experienced Gill as a professor and in his classes his passion emerges. He also teaches secular companies ethics, so don't pidgeon-hole him as some theologian with no relevance. He teaches secular companies ethical models that have people coming to him afterwards asking where he gets his insights from...and are surprised to find they are based on the 10 Commandments and/or The Beatitudes. So also please don't write him off as some left-leaning liberal (as another reviewer has done). He takes Biblical principles to secular places; we should all be this good.Gill is a well-rounded man with irons of philosophy (esp. Jacques Ellul), theology, ethics, and secular reasoning in the fire.He is worth a read if you have the time. I endorse him heartily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful here, it sounds good but consider the source","review":"I had the chance to meet Dr. Gill while at college in Ill. While his prose is academic, but solid, it is not the book that is in question but the source. Dr. Gill is a relativist, a liberal who supports special interest political views of the left.While the title of building moral character is an admirable one, I for one question the moral character of the author himself. Known to pursue projects with naked self promoting ambition, these personal traits defy the content of the book.Accept the content, question the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last","review":"I purchased this, and it was unusable after a little over a month. The shaft has plastic holding the metal driving piece, and now that the unit is stripped, it doesn't turn.I contacted the company several times when this happened, and it took 4 months for someone to finally give me some assistance, but then the 30 day product guarantee had passed.You can buy a less expensive product that would last longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Quality","review":"The blender looked so old even I knew I was new. It was poorly made and had gaps on some parts (hard to clean once thing got in). One blade was bent. You could see many dirty spots.It was heavy (Hope it was heavy-duty).

You can stand up in the tent. I am able to lay my air mattress down on one side, and place my suitcases on the other side, and still have walking room. The windows provide ample fresh air. It is easy for two people to put together.Now, the reason for the low rating:I have used this tent for three years. The last time I went camping, two of my tent poles snapped as I was taking them down. I have attempted to buy new poles from the company, and Coleman has stopped making replacement poles. They gave me a special number to call a place that specializes in making custom poles. I called there to find out that it would cost about $45 to replace 2 poles! I only paid $100 for the tent!! I have decided to purchase a new tent, since the replacement poles are half the cost of my tent...and I am skeptical as to how long the remaining poles will last!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For the one who needs space","review":"Coleman loves to throw around quality guarantees and slap their huge logos on the side of their tents. After all, if they are sold to millions at Target and Walmart 2 days before Memorial weekend they have to be good, right ? No not really . Most people who pick these up on a whim think they need a tent big enough to fit two queen size mattresses inside it and all of their chairs and accessories and of course need to be able to stand up inside. Make the tent tall and roomy, but at the cost of flimsy fiberglass poles and second rate material to keep the cost down and people wonder why they fold under a gust of wind or collect leaks in the corners during a storm. Mean while the guy with the small 2 -3 man tent with the aluminum poles and cutting edge materials is snug in his sleeping bag laughing off the storm.

This edition has NO NOTES WHATSOEVER, no credits, no lyrics, and not even the original cover (it uses the cover of a cheesy LP reissue instead).

It now lays in the trash basket. The LEDs must have been hand-picked for emitting as little light as possible. Even with all 5 LEDS on, you get less light than a old-style filament single-bulb flashlight. To turn the flashlight off, you must click the on-off switch five times (3 white LEDs, white 5 LEDs, white LEDs off and three red LEDS on, three LEDs flashing (very dimly), off). Since the red LEDs are in the base of the flashlight, you need to check to make sure the flashlight is truly off. Seriously, avoid this one. There are hundreds of flashlights for sale on Amazon and there is zero reason to get this one. Maybe if it was $2 it would be worth it.

I heard the band live for the first time at the Down from the Mountain concert tour and was absolutely stopped cold by their extraordinary musical ability. I bought \\"Del & the Boys\\" before the concert was over (and so did the guy standing behind me) even though I knew I was paying more than I had to, and I haven't been disappointed. There are some real gems on this album -- particularly \\"All Aboard,\\" \\"Recovering Pharisee\\" (what a great lyric line) and \\"Goldbrickin\\" (note the Celtic opening)-- as well as 1952 Vincent Black Lightning. This is a real American sound. What great music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Del and the boys do it again","review":"As always Del, and the boys are up to their usual high standards of picking and singing. I love the mix of Del's soulful singing, and the Mccoury bands heavy Blues influence in their music. They also have picked out some different material. Isn't there a Sinatra song in there? If I was introducing someone who was new to Bluegrass music, I could never recomend Del Mccoury as their first cd purchase.(only because that high lonesome sound has to grow on you) If you like new material done in a traditional way...then I would highly recommend this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Explores all sorts of issues.","review":"This book explores all sorts of issues. The issue of family violence, the issue of sexuality, the issue of a troubled psyche. And we have the wonderful Detective Chief Inspector Alan Banks trying to find his way through the minefield. Inspector Banks is a wonderful character. He is very real, and he is such an ordinary guy. That is part of his appeal. This book is set around the Christmas season in the northern part of England (Yorkshire) where Banks has taken up residence. A young woman is found dead in her flat. She has been brutally stabbed to death and Banks and his team try to find the murderer. There are far too many suspects, and far too many motives for Banks' liking, but he does manage to get to the answer in the end. Mr. Robinson knows how to write a British procedural, and I really am enjoying this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sensitive policeperson.","review":"This is the first Inspector Banks novel, or indeed the first Peter Robinson novel that I have read. I found the plot engrossing, the characters well drawn. Inspector Banks is almost too good to be true, his handling of suspects is sensitive and compassionate. His relationships with his co-workers and family are well portrayed. I loved the musical refferences, in fact I will be looking for several of the pieces mentioned, especially the Vivaldi, you will have to read the book to see what I mean by this. I had figured out \\"who dun it\\" before the climax of the book, but that did not detract from my enjoyment. I will be looking for more books by Peter Robinson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely plotted police procedural","review":"This is the first of the Alan Banks books I've read, but it won't be the last. Solid plot with a nicely paced unraveling of information about the victim. Alan Banks comes across as a real person.

The ending is not a big surprise, but it was still a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Yet","review":"I'm happy that I discovered, serendipitously, P. Robinson.

The 20th century is a lot of fun. It takes a lifetime of reading to put together a book of this sort. Part biography, part confession, this novel is an intellectual's delight. Here are all the ghosts of the twentieth century, especially the juicy vignettes from the backrooms of the monsters' lairs. I love the opening between Fanny Kaplan, Lenin's would-be assassin, and Krupskaya, the put-upon wife of the beloved, blood-thirsty communist. The book has few of the literary tricks up its sleeve that one finds these days in so many unreadable works. This is old-school realism, a kind of historical novel of the Truman Capote school of \\"faction,\\" perhaps something Norman Mailer might of attempted, a literary working over of the encyclopedia. What distinguishes it is its erudition, high irony, and sly playfulness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring....","review":"Very slow paced book with (IMHO) way too much effort to describe each little shade of emotion.

The story could have been told in 400 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vollmann's Best Yet...","review":"Vollmann was always long on both pages and talent, but in his other works he often lost a reader's focus by over-investing in an image or metaphor that wasn't worth its weight, rendering his prose less satisfying than it should have been. In short, he needed to take the art of revision seriously, as someone like Tolstoy did. With Europe Central, he's done just that. By cutting some of the denser moments in the prose, Vollmann has crafted a novel that is, if not sparse, clean and clear in its lushness. Vollmann creates some beautiful moments and is capable of startlingly apt and original metaphors and images, but he does not overindulge in them as he did in the past, which largely accounts for the success of this novel. Bravo! Well deserving of the NBE and a wonderful example of anti-minimalism coming back into vogue (this reviewer hopes)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Son of Dos Passos?","review":"My first experience of William T. I found the novel too reminiscent in technique of EL Doctorow's RAGTIME - the constant kaleidoscopic cutting between different sensibilities, interspersed with undisguised authorial commentary and narrative. It works, but not as well - but then nor does Doctorow - as it did in their common parent, John Dos Passos. Read his shorter (than his great trilogy, USA) novel, MANHATTAN TRANSFER to see the technique exploited to give a very real sense of an entire society at a moment in time.The writing itself in EUROPE CENTRAL, dealing with a 'foreign' culture and age, is often too literal to really enthuse and affect and the background research seems 'dragged in', while the sense of the novel's overall design makes itself felt too evidently.I will try more, but this is not the novel with which to begin the study of William T. Vollman."},{"rating":"1","title":"An immature, uninteresting work.","review":"I started and did not finish the book, so my review should be seen in that context. I quit on it because I began to see it as poorly written, pretentious of a knowledge that seemed immature to me (I'm guessing the author read some parts of a fair number of books and called it research), and prententious of an intellectual heft that it most certainly does not possess. I was also more than a little put off by the style of composition. It seemed to me to be a shallow and shelf-cousciously affected revisit of modernism. And lastly, if it was intended to be seen as a grand Sholzenitzen-esque treatment of the aweful second, third, and fourth decades of the Twentieth Century in Middle Europe, it fell flat on its face. If that is what you want, reader, go to Vasily Grossman, Sholzenitzen, and any number of other works of fiction and history of that period and place. This book does not have it for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsense","review":"Thinking I was going to read some smart literature, I went out and bought a stack of Vollmann's books. Imagine my surpise when I tried to read this stuff. It is nonsensical and boring.

Worse still, I found myself re-reading sentences frequently to decipher the meaning.I thought maybe it would change and the later writing would be clearer, so I randomly opened a few chapters, and the same obfuscating style is used throughout.After a while I just had a headache and put the book down.

It's the biggest telescope that people thought was still easy enough to haul around and I'm going to have to agree there. I am glad we didn't go with the larger ones for that reason. The software that comes with the telescope is really great too, my children like it almost as much as the telescope and it makes locating things much easier than using a star chart in my opinion. If you want to look at the moon you really need to buy a filter to go with the telescope as it's too bright to comfortably view without one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice optics","review":"The telescope was well packaged but the installation instructions were a bit vague, especially when it came to installing the eyepiece.

I remember chewing this gum as a kid, it was my favorite gum because of its great flavor. After I had a taste for the gum again, I wanted more and I am 100 miles away from the nearest Cracker Barrel, so I checked on Amazon, my go to place. I was excited to see they had it and two separate listings. One for \\"original\\" and a regular flavor. The tub that I received is not the original flavor bubble gum, even though it specifically states that it is on the product listing. This is the plain, old, gross, generic flavor they changed to a couple of years ago.If you are looking for the cinnamon/clove flavor you remember growing up, this is NOT the gum you are looking for, you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the Fleer Dubble Bubble of old","review":"I bought this tub expecting the nostalgic Dubble Bubble smell and taste I loved as a kid. That gum was packed in the old Fleer Baseball Card wax-packs. Concord Confections bought the rights to the name from Fleer. (Subsequently Tootsie Roll bought Concord.) Anyway, The flavor formula was changed by Concord. It's now just generic bubblegum. Not only that, the size of the gum has been reduced. With clever packaging, it looks about the same size wrapped, but the gum is no longer a solid \\"barrel\\" shape. It is now a smaller barrel with gear-like teeth around it which holds the packaging out so it seems like a substantial piece than it is. The logo is misleading too. It says, \\"America's Original\\". Well the name is the same but the product is completely different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much flavor","review":"I ordered this gum and was shocked at how big a bucket of 380 pieces is. Its a lot of gum which is good. The flavor tastes great for a couple of minutes but I noticed that the flavor is gone in just a few minutes.

I have also bought multiple copies because I loan this out and sometimes I wind up giving them away. This book is one of the few mandatory reads I have for my children. It exposes the danger of New Age thinking and enlightens us as to why it is deadly. For example, it shows us the danger of sending \\"positive thoughts\\". We need to ask the Father to meet our needs and wants rather than calling on the latent power within us. He also explains what that latent power is from a biblical perspective.

I've been playing as a trader, and the dynamic economy is excellent. You aren't able to continually run between two or three places, as in some other games (Freelancer). I haven't played the story much, but from what I've read it sounds a lot like the story in Freelancer. If you were to play this as a solely a space combat game, however, it might get a little old. There are only so many ways you can dress up a \\"go here and kill this\\" mission."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont try to hide things on my PC","review":"In my opinion the Rootkit/Starforce copy protection goes far beyond copy protection and flirts with being malicious software that is hidden on your computer when X3 is installed.

I purchased my copy in February. Yes, it was initially buggy -- but 98% of the bugs have been fixed. I routinely let the game trade for me all night and I have not had a crash recently. I don't understand why people are complaining about the interface. It is complicated, but if you are patient you will learn it and even appreciate how logical most of it is. Documentation has been substantially improved since release, and there are large FAQs available on any of the forums. The graphics are fantastic, the scope is amazing, and the gameplay is very very deep. A great buy for space traders and armchair warlords."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"This game is a definite step backwards from X2.Not only does it suffer from an interface that was simultaniously developed for pc and console(meaning the pc version was\\"dumbed down\\")but it installs the most insidious version of StarForce.I had to reformat my computer after installing this load of garbage.Don't ever mention this problem on the official forums or you will have the moderators accusing you of being a pirate.The plot bites(what little I could play because of bugs and copy protection problems)combat is really boring and easy.Iwish I could give this misbegotten bundle of bad coding no stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"So many bugs. . .","review":"The game plays like a beta test. There's crashing and freezing everywhere, random glitches that stop the plot or keep you from doing things, TONS of features mentioned in the manual were never actually put in, many of the things in the previous game X2 were just omitted because they didn't have enough time, the economy bugs out after a few days, several different ships from different races share the same model, and this game features the worst character animations I've ever seen in a game. The latest patch improved frame rate somewhat and fixed the economy, but it also added a bug causing certain weapons to drop framerate to 1fps, and for many people, it randomly spawned hundreds of pirates and enemy ships (including destroyers and carriers) that would annihilate everything player owned.On another note, the graphics are pretty."},{"rating":"2","title":"X3: The Reunion - challenging but rewarding","review":"It has been said by some of these reviews that the game is difficult to learn. I for one require that in a game. I'm sick of mindless games that you can annhilate in hours, or spend years doing the same thing for little reward. X3 is a challenging game to learn and incredibly complex. That is the beauty of the game - I love how complex the universe and how much you cna do. There are some drawbacks in that it is not multi-player, and it installs a program on your computer called starforce that is pretty demanding, but if you have a good computer you should have no problems with it. I love the game because there are endless possibilities. Even once you 'finish' the storyline, you can continue on, and that, in my opinion, is when the game begins."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't understand why people dislike it","review":"disregard all the negative reviews, as 1.4 fixes all the bugs and problems everyone was complaining about. X3 is now an improvement over X2, similar, but bigger systems, more systems, more functions, etc. an expansion is also planned. if you are really concerned about bugginess, go to the forums at egosoft.com and see how no one ever seems to complain about the game, except occasionally for the fact that the publisher decided to use starforce. sorry, but I cannot write a review describing the game itself, but the X2 reviews can be consulted, and there is a demo at the egosoft site"},{"rating":"1","title":"That was the Doctor?","review":"Its been a while since I read this book and I had forgotten all about it until I stumbled upon it here looking for other Doctor Who books.

One review mentions that the Doctor wasn't featured prominently ... that he was just another character. I don't have a problem with that. However, by the time I finished the book, I felt I had just read a (uninteresting) story that had the Doctor Who name and some of the character names from Doctor Who applied to the book. Not once did I feel that any of the characters that were supposed to be tied to Doctor Who were. At best, they were some distorted alternate universe version of the characters, where, as I reacll, the Doctor wasn't a time lord.The book just didn't do much for me in terms of being a Doctor Who story.

The album has her intrepreting songs by more contemporary artists from that year. At that point in her career, she was known mostly as a broadway star, having only mild success with her music career. The album before this one, STONY END, was a nice comeback, and this album followed in a similar vein. She interprets songs by John Lennon (\\"Mother\\", \\"Love\\"), Carole King (\\"Where You Lead\\", \\"Beautiful\\", \\"You've Got A Friend\\"), Laura Nyro (\\"I Never Meant To Hurt You\\").

To claim (as did the previous reviewer) this CD to be rock would be very misleading.This CD is purely Adult Contemporary.

Several gifted composers provide STREISAND with quality material to sing. BURT BACHARACH, HAL DAVID, MICHEL LEGRAND, CAROLE KING and even a JAMES TAYLOR classic (You got a Friend). In 1971, this CD was never considered ROCK. Today, this CD would never be classified ROCKl. Its simply an extension of a gifted female vocalist. Worth the price to own if only to see the inside sleeve that has Diva Streisand in a funky 70s hat.

Rick Recorla, Susan Rescorla and Dan Hill are bigger than life and at the same time, very real. Susan asked me to be objective when she gave me an advance copy and I was - it's a book that explores the depth of friendship, bravery and a love that's elusive to so many of us.

While it does address that there are different body parts on boys and girls and that we are different, it also talks about how some women like to have their clitoris rubbed while having sex. It also talks about how to masturbate and the different ways and places to masterbate. There is not discussion on the safety of sex or the moral decisions involving sex.

It's not just the notes, sounds and words, it's the facial expressions and actions that create their unique form of acoustic vaudville-ish performances. If you can sit through this and not be alternately amazed and on the floor doubled over in laughter...then you definitely need some help! Buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality, but works","review":"I bought this as a motorcycle helmet lock, for which it works great except the lock itself is is totally cheap. I don't even care so much about the level of security, as this is just a deterrent so somebody can't easily walk off with my helmet; but locking it and unlocking it takes forever. To unlock, when you turn the key it doesn't just release or even disengage so you can pull the pin out, you have to wiggle the key to get it to disengage, and at the same time wiggle the pin while tugging. Then to lock it, it's just as difficult. You don't need the key, but the pin doesn't fit well and has to be wiggled and forced. Like I mentioned, this type of lock with this length of cable is perfect to use as a motorcycle helmet lock,but I would shop around for one with a better lock. The only thing I would add is both the lock and cable are wrapped in a rubber casing and shouldn't scratch your motorcycle, which is why I chose this model. However, for $5 you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Master Lock product made in China","review":"I bought 8 of these all keyed alike. As they are Master brand locks I was expecting typical Master Lock quality. They are NOT the high quality that Master has always been known for. These locks were made in China, poorly. If I had known that these were of Chinese manufacture I would not have bought them. Like so much other mechanical stuff that needs to be made to fairly tight and consistent tolerances, these Chinese goods just don't \\"have it\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"That's about right.","review":"I wish I had listened to the other reviewers about this lock. It is very, very poor. I used it as a lock for a motorcycle helmet and it worked twice. After that the key would no longer work in the lock. It wouldn't even go in. Winchester makes a gun lock like this for about the same price, and it works smooth as silk. Buy that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good price for a small cable lock","review":"I bought this for my garden hose, not a gun, as I live in an apartment where anything loose outside disappears. It's not long enough to go around all the loops of it but is enough to fit through the hose hanger and around much of the hose. This is good enough. Most vandalism is stuff that can be grabbed easily.Master locks are fair quality. If someone wants it they will cut the cable first."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does the job well...","review":"I purchased this for my Nikkor 60mm f/2.8 micro lens. I don't understand why it's not included in the Nikon R1 Close-up Speedlight Remote Kit though.

Simply it does the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, except for scratches.","review":"These are well-designed, durable dishes, but the darker colors do tend to show scratches. When stacked, the rough bottom of one plate can scratch the plate beneath it. This is a problem with the newer style Fiesta more than the \\"vintage\\" Fiesta which had more glaze on the bottom, and a problem with new dishes more than those which have been through the wash many times. When stacking these dishes in the cupboard, especially when they are brand new, you might want to put coffee filters between the plates to minimize scratching."},{"rating":"2","title":"timeless","review":"Fiestaware is a timeless collectable.

They are extremely heavy for dishes making them harder to balance and hold, especially for children. They also become scratched very quickly and it's not just from stacking them, though that would be bad enough. Everyday use with your knife and fork leaves marks too. In general I found the bowls and salad plates to be to small. There is no lip on the bowl so you can't hold anything hot in it with your bare hands. I recommend looking else where if you want a good set of everyday dishes."},{"rating":"1","title":"One sad shopper","review":"I bought this set from [...] and 3 out of the 6 sets that I bought were broken-not just chips, but the tea cup was cracked in half, the bottom was out of the bowl, and the diner plate was in pieces.

They are avid collectors, I mean they have almost all the colors and were so excited when they saw the chocolate. However, the one that my mom ended up getting had scratches and bubbles in the glaze. We were all shocked by this because we have never had a bad looking set of fiestaware and they have been buying it for every occasion(birthday's, christmas, hanukkah, mother's day etc). My parents sent the plates back to Amazon(in December) and they still haven't received their replacement ones yet. I am curious if this is a problem that everyone has had with the chocolate color or is it just the set they got, and does it normally take this long for a replacement to be sent out?Really, other than this issue they have loved fiestaware and been very happy with every set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disappointed","review":"Set was fine except for bowl which was broken.

Speaking of slapped all involved deserve a slap and Ann-Margret deserves a couple of slaps for signing on to this. Don't get me wrong, I love Ann-Margret(even had a secret crush on her in her Bye Bye Birdie days) but at 20 singing in a breathy, sex-kittenish baby voice-to some it might sound sexy--at 60+ using that same singing style-it sounds like asthma.This review is really useless since it is now unavailable but if someone is ever crazy enough to re-release it. You Have been warned.The original cast album is still the best and if you are a bit masochistic, I guess you could try The Burt Reynolds, Dolly Parton lame version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the Best","review":"I saw this production . . . it was a fantastic tour. I love this CD and highly reccomend it! This is by far the best recording of the show. If you are a fan of Ann Margret or of this musical I am sure you will love it. Now some people have complained about Ann Margret's voice not being what it was . . . I think it's better. Her voice is smokey, breathy and sexy . . . and perfect for this Las Vegas meets honky tonk score. She is the perfect Miss Mona aside from Dolly Parton. The supporting cast is very strong here as well. Flashy costumes and scantily clothed men and women . . . how can anyone not love this musical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Re-discover the musical you thought you knew","review":"Most of us familiar with this musical know the version made famous by Burt Reynolds and Dolly Parton on film. The original cast recording take the musical back to its original, and far superior state. Its grittier than the syrupy sweet Dolly Parton version but overall the performances are full of warmth. Best of all the singing is great and the music is catchy and fun. Highly recommended if you have affection whatsoever for this show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for casual practice","review":"The weight reminds me it is not a toy.

Nope. You have to be able to program the receiver of the gate or garage door opener.Oddly, I have not found any garage/gate openers on Amazon that could learn, or duplicate, the signal of another remote as do the Homelink remotes now installed in many new cars. I did, however, find such a remote for ten bucks (twenty with shipping) on that most popular of auction sites. As I live in a gated community and did not want to pay the $70 for another remote, one that wouldn't be of use to me after moving, the inexpensive duplicating variety was ideal for my needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"I love it becuace now i dont have to get out of the car to open the garage door.

Now, I am from the school of thought that believes that parents are always to blame for rotten kids so I didnt like that too much. I guess he has to write that because people don't like to be told when they are lousy parents.In the second half, he seemed to say that even if parents aren't to blame, here is what good parents do create good kids and you can do the same . This part I liked because i have a young child and could use a lesson or two. It also fit into my world view which makes it easier to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mix of music for Buffy fans","review":"This is a great collection of music for Buffy fans, and it was even worth the additional cost of being an import.

I also purchased the smaller scraper and it was fine and did a great job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very very marginally OK, but with real problems","review":"Not the best quality, one side of slots for plastic shades/inserts had brad/nail about an inch above bottom.

Amazon fans of Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series recommended this series. I bought a used copy through Amazon (couldn't find these books at local bookstores) and had a great time reading it. I'll read the others in the series as well. I enjoyed the humor even more than the mystery - particularly main character Chrissy McMullen's thoughts, quips, and descriptions of Lt. Rivera (and her false surnames for him). I appreciated Lois Greiman's descriptions of Chrissy's imperfections (eating ice cream at home but salads in public, poor lawn-care skills). Some novels' characters seem so perfect that we lowly readers just can't compare. The Chrissy-Jack chemistry and snappy dialogue is fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap.

While not a \\"how to\\" (and never pretends to be so this is not a criticism), there is useful broad advice in how to select a package to insure that the business needs will be addressed with a FCS system. The one area lacking is for all the authors' efforts to tackle the top-level issues in FCS, they missed a golden opportunity to remind the readers to not be distracted by the glitz in APS because at the heart of every APS is the need to address a real world FCS problem. The importance of a quality FCS engine, reinforced by the book, cannot be overstated for any business considering some form of scheduling technology."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was not a good way to buy a diamond!","review":"I was pretty sure what size diamond I wanted to replace. I just did some research online to determine if the color and clarify listed would be sufficient. Once I received the diamond (J-K Color, I3 Clarity) it looked like it had a piece of thread on it. I wiped it off with a soft cloth, looked at it through a jeweler's loop, which I just happen to have in my desk, and saw realized that thread was a huge inclusion throughout the top of the diamond. It could be seen clearly with the naked eye and not using 10X magnification as the learning guides say.

Yehoshua'sThe Lover(which I absolutely LOVED), in sampling different characters' perspectives and telling the story in a stream-of-consciousness style, unreliable narrators, marital breakdown by cheating but idealistic wives, and threads of psychological disturbances and emotional complexity. Albeit it sheds interesting points about modern Israeli society such as tensions between Ashkenazim and Sephardim. But this story is abstract in the non-sensical way that it gets in the way of relating to the reader. It's a little \\"selfish\\", more like a writer/characters' way of mental masturbation by spewing out their notions than truly engaging the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Information about Political Process of World War II","review":"This book was a massive dose of how the politicians and business men who coordinated the war thought.

Batson is the leading proponent of this theory and in a number of chapters he explains and defends it against the criticisms that have naturally been lobbed against it.I believe that his theory is robust enough to be acceptable. It certainly has intuitive appeal, as well as basis in Buddhist philosophy and mystical religious traditions of Judaism and Christianity.This a laudible work in the psychology of religion.

I picked up this album about 10 years ago when the re-united band were appearing at the North East Art Rock Festival in Pennsylvania. I have not listened to this disc in a long time, but I was pleasently surprised by reacquainting myself with it. This is a very very good band and a fine album. The disc is a double containing re-worked early tracks and tracks that were new at the time. The bands music falls in the symphonic progressive rock camp, but there is very little that is clich�� about them. They incorporate many different elements into their music with plenty of twists and turns to keep things interesting. Everything is instrumental save for one track sung in Hungarian. In some ways they remind me of fellow countrymen After Crying or Sweden's Isldurs Bane. If you like either of those bands you will probably dig this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent scissors","review":"Anyone doing applique needs these scissors in their basket.

First, this book seems to assume you've already read a book or two about Babbage before. It almost has an apologetic tone and seems to be an answer to what, I assume, have been slights against Babbage and his work. Second, this book is as much about the author and his quest to build a Difference Engine as it is about Babbage himself. If you want to hear about dealing with office politics in an British museum, you may find this interesting.All in all, this is a fairly dry read. It was interesting at points, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it for your first book on Babbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Disobedient Mistress by Lynne Graham (Large Print Harlequin)","review":"Description from the book back cover:Mistress in name only?

Is it too late to change the plans he's set in motion?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly written, but ok story","review":"An unlikely but entertaining story, it's far from my favorite. If you can get past flowery writing and stereotypical alpha male and weak woman, it's not awful. Those are common in romance but this book really takes it past my limit.Under 200 pages, yet padded with excessive description. No physical feature is mentioned without adjectives, often more than one, including synonyms, though the feature has been described before. Their eyes and hair are mentioned constantly and never without naming colors.Leone is really just a jerk. Misty rebukes him several times and he puts her in her place, despite deserving her rebuke. He all but fights any man who tries to talk to her."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a bore","review":"I usually read a Harlequin for fast, relaxing, but good storytelling-reading, and some of them are very successful in that respect, but this one was truly terrible! I had to force myself to finish it. The heroine was weak and spineless (and lived up to her horrible name, Misty), and the hero was a typical Alpha male. Some of the Harlequins surprise you with the depth of good writing and real tenderness between the characters, but there are no such nice surprises here! Very disappointing effort from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"VGA cooler","review":"The fan on my VGA card quit working and the manufacture could not replace it.

The work is profoundly instructive.In fact, my only gripe is with the slightly unwieldy, slightly overlong introduction.

The sound is clean, big, powerful, with great dynamic range and a fabulous sounding organ. The performance is accurate, not too restrained and not too \\"experimental\\". I have several other recordings of the major Liszt organ war-horses (Ad Nos, Ad Salutarem Undam) and this disc is a great addition to my collection.

The book has a bit too much of a rock-journalism tone at times, and is almost painfully earnest.

The classic traditonal sound is wonderfully represented by the legendary Lilly Brothers, the Vern Willimas Band, and the Bailey Brothers.

One tip, when in the ocean try to get as close to the subject as possible so the flash will help brighten the colors.

I e-mailed Karcher on the lack of packing in the box and requested a refund from Amazon. I have ordered a Hoover Spin Sweep instead, which looks to be a improvement over the Karcher. So far Amazon has been very helpful with my issues. UPS picked up the Karcher the next day via Amazon's automated return replacement system and the new product was sent out 2 day FEDEX.

I'm surprised I even managed to read as much as I did before finally tossing it over my shoulder onto the floor. Half the time I couldn't even remember who the main male in the book was supposed to be. I didn't find Tess or her sister's charming, or whatever his name was, or even the rest of them.

It is very clear even without ever knowing more books would follow that was her intention, a setup. Too much time was spent explaining each sister over and over again so we could truly get a sense of them. I felt that Tess really deserved a true story of her own, not one thrown into the mix of all the many explanations. I thought Imogen would NEVER finally run away with her love as we were told she would by reading the back cover. The story was very slow paced and instead of sitting down and finishing it the way I have done with all of her books prier it took me three days. Then suddenly when there are less than 50 pages left it grew interesting. It was truly a letdown but I hope the ones to follow will be better without all the explaining. We can only hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Adfo About You","review":"I have read several of this author's previous works, so I decided to ignore the review that was disappointed because this book seemed much more of an introduction of all the characters in this sister series. That reviewer was right on. While I like the James style of having her two main characters be part of a group dynamic, in this book, they become lost in the sheer number of other characters involved. At the end of this book I really couln't recall anything special about Tess and Lucius that made me care that they loved each other. In fact, I keep wondering how it was possible. I am interested in the stories of several of the other characters, so I will probably buy other books in this series, but this book was definitely a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tess - Essex Part 1","review":"Admittedly I enjoy Ms. James's writing and especially her series books.

She has always been the \\"go-to\\" sister.

Karen White knows how to set and tell a Southern story and her sentences and dialogue flow like sweet tea for which the area is so famous. You must real other reviews to get an outline of the plot as i am more concerned with character development, story movement, and satisfactory conclusion. These are the things White does so well along with her ability to \\"turn a phrase\\".

I found the strength training portion to be good, definitely worked out my upper body but the cardio and abs portion didn't raise my heartrate much. Perhaps level 2 will be harder.

In only 1 1/2 weeks he is tighter, his belly is coming down noticeably and his arms are looking bigger. He is red and sweaty after working out but looking good. I have watched the video at different points and it is a good workout and this is only Level 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Results!!!","review":"I love this DVD!

I did all 30 days and I lost 10 pounds! 3.5 inches off my waist, 2 inches off my hips, .5 inches off my arms, 1 inch off my legs. You have to push through it. I never was able to do a \\"regular plank or push up\\" .... I did those on my knees and still saw great results. I am so happy I bought this video and highly recommend it.

I am an ACE personal trainer, a certified yoga instructor, a classically trained and certified Pilate's instructor as well as a board certified neuromuscular therapist. Most exercise DVD's leave me cold as they don't have the proper form or are just too ridiculous. This DVD is a total exception. I was IMPRESSED!! This video kicked my butt and the butt of a few of my 20-something students. I bought the box set that has this DVD plus the fat booster plus the trouble spot. An EXCELLENT purchase. Get these three dvd's plus Brooke Siler's Beginning Pilate's for weight loss and Shivea Rea's Creative Core yoga dvd and you are set for months!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It can work for you","review":"All you need for these work outs are hand weights and a mat if you are working out on a hard surface. The work outs are intense and that can be a turn off for someone who is just starting out. But if you are serious about getting results this is one of the tools you need. Pace yourself and don't be too anxious to move from workout one to another level until you are 100% sure that you are comfortable with all the workouts. Also don't expect to see weight flying off. You need to work for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweat and pant like the Swat workout","review":"This is a really demanding workout especially if you have not been doing any exercise for a long time. You huff and puff by the time you reach 7 minutes. You will sweat and you will burn fat. The workout does not give you time to catch your breath. You have 5 secs of rest and you need to get back to working out. It isn't 20 minutes it is like 25 minutes for level 1, 28 minutes level 2. I have the SWAT workout too but I don't want to end up looking like a bulked up guy so, I chose to use Jillian's workout. Rest one day and then get back to working out. During your rest day, do pilates or yoga so that your body does not completely rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jillian is a Beast","review":"This is exactly the workout I've been looking for. I work out on a regular basis, but this is a video that will really rev you up and get your body in great shape fast. I've been doing the workout for almost 30 days and have defintely lost pounds and inches. This is not a workout for the weak; you have to decide you are going to do it and then get it done. Due to the 20-25 minute workouts, I can do this every day and fit it in my lifestyle and it works. I feel empty if I don't work out with Jillian every day now. The DVD is changing my life. I have more confidence in what I can accomplish and finally a workout that pushes me to new heights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bootleg","review":"I was excited to get this video at a cheap price... but you get what you pay for. This is a bootleg and the cover was printed on a desktop computer. But I was willing to deal with it if it worked... but it doesn't.

It does this throughout the entire workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"jackie warner's work out is better.","review":"i don't care for this work out at all! i felt jillian michaels was completely half assing the whole thing and was really mean. i know that she's goign for the whole drill sergeant effect blah blah blah but i don't think it's a very good work out. i go to the gym 4-5 times a week but was looking for something to do in between. i feel like i should do this work out 3 more times in a row to feel tired, there isn't even any kind of lower body workout, it's all abs and weights. jackie warner's power circuit dvd is sooo much better! it kicks my butt, i wake up in the morning so sore it feels great! this jillian work out was so blase that i had to do a jackie workout right after to feel anything. jillian really rubs me the wrong way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Order and Unbalanced","review":"This DVD was a disappointment to me. Unlike other reviewers, I thought the first segment was the better one, however, I could not imagine doing the same segment over and over for days or weeks, because she doesn't cover all the muscle groups. In fact, even if you do all 3, you don't get a balanced workout. I don't recall a single tricep exercise anywhere.The order of weights, cardio, then core bothered me the most. Basically, after each cardio burst you are supposed to lie down flat with your heart rate way up high - what the heck? I don't think Jillian is very knowledgeable when it comes to fitness and her personality and DVDs reflect that."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK workout, can't stand the voice!","review":"I have to say starting out that I do not watch The Biggest Loser as I am not a big tv watcher and find most shows a waste of my time. If I had I probably would not have gotten this video since her voice just *grates* on my nerves and I really don't like it when she says to \\"look at her girls\\" as they are exercising. Even my nine year old told me never to do that work out again since \\"the instructor scared\\" her. It is an ok workout, although if you do only one section, extremely short. I prefer Jari Love, The Firm, Tracy Effinger, and exercising longer than 20 minutes at a time. This one just wasn't for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"30 Day Shred","review":"I purchased this product because it was advertised as \\"new.\\" When I received it in the mail, it was very obviously a burned copy of the Jillian Michaels CD.

I started to notice my body changing after week 3. My only problem I injured my knee on day 10, but continued to modify the moves. Tonight I sit here with my leg iced and elevated after having knee surgery. So even with all her comments about being careful with your knees I still got injured. But I am going to get right back at this DVD when my knee heals."},{"rating":"2","title":"You WILL see and feel the difference!!","review":"A co-worker of mine suggested this dvd since I was getting frustrated with hitting a standstill with some other workouts I have done. She said I would see a difference almost immediately and boy was she right!! I am now on Day 9, still on level 1 and have noticed a huge difference! This dvd is kicking my butt into shape!! The first few days I thought I was going to die and not make it through but I kept pushing and the work shows. Her book says to do the shred for 5 days and take 1 day off. After my day off this week I am going to attempt level 2 and see how that goes but it's nice to see results so quickly which is definitely motivating me to keep going! I can't wait to finish the 30 days and see where I am at, but I have definition in my muscles and my clothes are already fit ALOT better! I would definitely recommend this to anyone!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the workout!","review":"You sweat to this workout! It takes a lot of effort but it is worth it, I am already starting to see definition in my muscles after 2 1/2 weeks. The only thing about this DVD is that you are not sure when to move on from level 1 to level 2 and so forth so I have been doing it at my own pace when I felt ready I moved on to level 2. If you are a beginner stick to the level 1 until you are actually ready. Other than that great product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Jillian Michaels prides herself on being the toughest trainer on \\"The Biggest Loser.\\" That might be true, but I'm not sure that's something to brag about. She seems to be overcompensating for something--her style is bullying, gruff, crass, and insulting. Maybe some people are motivated by that kind of attitude (seeing how many five-star reviews this has....*scratches head*), but I'm not. Her training style makes me want to sit on my couch, eat a cheeseburger, and watch \\"Newhart.\\" I've been active and fit all my life, but I don't respond well to condescension. If this works for you, fine. I prefer trainers who are warm and encouraging (though demanding), like Jennifer Kries and Violet Zaki. I'm selling 30 day shred. It's a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"That's not really fair - I never got to use it.","review":"When I received this DVD it was damaged. The shipping package was dented and torn. The DVD case was dented, the plastic cover wasn't even there. Then I opened the case and the DVD was bent in half and scratched. I returned it for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine","review":"I'm not sure if the seller knew or not but even though the DVD came wrapped; it was previously used and scratched up quite a bit. It still plays which is fine and the original attachments are in tact. My only gripe is that the description read \\"brand new\\" which it clearly was not. Other than that, it was fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Is too basic and much cardio, that makes my knees hurts a lot.I really thought it was good cause it has so many good comments, but usually I work out, so this is too basic, not really challenge moves, just a lot of jumping."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT","review":"I bought this about two weeks ago and use along with my regular workout.... BUT I can honestly say I love to hate Jillian... She works you hard and cheers you on the whole time..

I RECOMMEND IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout!","review":"Normally DVDs are not effective for me because I am too uncoordinated to perform complicated moves. However, this DVD uses basic moves and you never do the same exercise long enough to get bored with it. The 20 min blasts by but I can already tell a difference and I've only been using it for weeks. I would definitely recommend this to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"No joke workout!","review":"This is a no joke, sweat your butt off, workout DVD! I have tried my fair share of workout DVD's and most of them are so cheesy I can hardly get through one workout. Not this one. Jillian is no frills, not cheesy, and really pushes you. I'm 30 yrs old and for the first time in my life, I can SEE my stomach muscles! I've been working out with this DVD for almost 60 days and it still makes me sweat. I bet I have recommended this workout system to at least 20 people.Thanks Jillian!!!KaseyMesa, AZ"},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG!!!","review":"I just started this program and I can only say: OMG!!! You get everything in just 20 intense minutes. There are three levels and when you are ready for the next level up, make sure you are truly ready. Jillian does a great job of explaining to you what each exercise means and the two other \\"model\\" exercisers do either modified for beginners and the other one is doing the \\"at level\\" form. I like that there is no loud music or other distractions. You will definitely feel this at the end of the day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Workout","review":"This tape really does give you a good workout. The only downside is that it is pretty annoying that you have to listen to Jillian's intro every time - I wish you could fast forward to the actual workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!!!!","review":"I love this video. Jillian really whips you into shape in no time. I have two children and I can do this workout because it is only 20 minutes, my daughter loves it to, she does it with me, so I make it a family event."},{"rating":"2","title":"I agree with Little Ms. Cutey!","review":"Awesome workouts and takes only 30 minutes total!

I did Level 1 on OnDemand. I felt it, i was sweating like crazy, did i mention i FELT it? I did level 1' three days in a row because i enjoyed it. BUT after only 3 days of exercising i sprained my wrist badly..i dont know if it was because of the \\"Up & Down\\" movement, the push-ups(which i HATE lol), the weights, or even just ME! I had to stop working out for a week because of the sprain. So after all that I am still going to buy the DVD because it made me sweat & my muscles soar, & to me that means its working!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excited","review":"THanks everyone for your helpful reviews!

I can't wait to see my results after a couple of months!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"I bought this dvd first and have some others and this I feel is the most useful so far. It can get boring so the others are to add flavor. But in 3 months I lost over 25 lbs mainly because of this dvd. The first level is easy, so I switch between 2 and 3 and they are both tough. I do modify some of the reps to make them more interesting and challenging to me, some ideas I got from other videos that i like better. But my arms are toned and my legs look great, all my friends are now on the weight loss bandwagon. The only suggestion I have that would make this video better is to add a yoga or pilates with it. The breathing type exercises really help with weight loss."},{"rating":"2","title":"incredible workout","review":"I absolutely love this workout. I find it just as difficult as hour long cardio and conditioning workouts I do at my gym, but this only takes 20 minutes. Get this dvd, you will get a tough workout and see results. I especially like the difficulty of this workout, some dvds are geared for people getting in shape, but this challenges even the very fit!! Love, love, love this dvd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Short workout with BIG results!","review":"Wow. This is by far the best workout dvd I've ever owned. Jillian is amazing and she really motivates you! What I love about this is that it's so short (only 20 minutes) but you really see results. I am now in level 3, after much pain and sweat, but since they are short I do level 3 every day and also each day I alternate between level 2 and 1. I would recommend this to anyone. You just have to stay dedicated!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough One","review":"I got three jillian michaels dvd's. They all came pretty quickly and I was happy about that. It is a pretty difficult workout, so if you are a beginner, I suggest either going with something else, or expect to not make it all the way through the first few times at least. That being said, it is a great workout and will help you lose pounds, assuming you have the healthy diet to go with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Workout","review":"Its a great workout. I got it electornically on amazon and when I move my computer it freezes for just a moment. Other than that small annoyance, its a great workout!"},{"rating":"2","title":"just started","review":"Hey I did alot of research on this dvd before I bought it and this is only my second day but I honestly have to say that parts of my body hurt that haven't hurt since I was born I love the fact that the parts of my body that I really want to improve on are the parts of my body that hurt the most. I will keep my review updated, and as far as knees go I have a horrible knee and I'm not light and my knees arent bothering me, so I would def recommend getting this dvd its definately worth the money. And as I said I will keep my progress posted."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUCH! LOVE this DVD!","review":"I started Weight Watchers in 9/09 and have lost 16 pounds so far. I got tired of running on the treadmill and my other two DVD's (SELF - Bikini Ready Fast and SELF - Slim and Sleek) which are also awesome by the way! I decided to get this DVD because of the other reviews. I did it for the first time yesterday, thinking I was in decent enough shape. Yesterday I couldn't feel my butt. Today, stomach, thighs, chest, shoulders, back and butt are KILLING me! LOVE it! It is the hardest 20 minutes I have ever worked out in my life! When I am able to walk again, I will definitely be doing this DVD again. Love it, love it, love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jillian 30 Day Shred","review":"I LOVE This video!

Either way I went ahead and ordered it and it was delivered quickly and in perfect condition. Today will be my 5th day using it and its very quick to learn. She keeps you motivated just when your about to give up. Instead of waiting till Im comfortable to go up in levels, I followed another reviews recommendation about going from level 1 to level 2, to level 3 and back down again. I was in so much pain after the first few workouts but now Im starting to look forward to it!5/5 completely worth your time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"I thought this would be wack, but I absolutely loved it and strted shredding ounds as soon as I started. of course with diet added to the combination. Awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a great deal","review":"Although I haven't completed the 30 days, I will say that it is a challenging workout for only 20 minutes.

I will say the price was great for this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite!","review":"I lost inches with this 30 Day Shred and didn't gain any holiday pounds this year.

My wife made me do it. I lift a couple of times a week, and lately I've been thinking about doing crossfit. I've done this workout 8 times so far, and think its great. You can do it anywhere. You only need 2 dumbells.Because I can do it at home and don't have to go to the gym it saves me a lot of time. I'm still lifting, but on my off days this is a great way to mix it up and get cardio in. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!","review":"I bought this video after reading alot of positive reviews and to be truthful the bad reviews have to do with the music being \\"off\\" and Jillian being \\"mean\\"- I love the video- after running for 2 months in the morning I wanted to add to my workout in the evening without going to the gym. Day 4 and my legs are definitely feeling a burn and I am only on level 1!! Eventhough I am beat after this workout I have had soo much energy the day after! Great video! Great price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout","review":"Jillian Michaels - 30 Day ShredMy favorite thing about this workout video is that the workouts are only 20 minutes long. During my first workout I couldn't wait for those 20 minutes to be over. THIS IS A WORKOUT!!!!!I would be considered a beginner for the purposes of workout videos. Jillian explains how you can modify some of the workouts to be more accomodating to a beginner. I have knee issues so I had to take it easy on some of the lunging activities, but I totally worked up a sweat and there was no doubt the following day as to which muscles got the most workout.If you like Jillian Michael's you will like this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Workout, but tough","review":"This is really a great workout and it's short! I'm overweight and I'm struggling, but you just modify the workout or slow it down to the point that you can do the move. I don't always keep up with the pace, but I make myself do the workout as best I can. I'm on the second week and have moved to Level 2. Probably will be there for about a month as it's really tough. Keep it up and you will be in shape! It's your workout and if you want to lose weight and get into shape, this is the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Love it. great workout for woman, something I've been looking for along time. the intensity that has long been awaiting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough!","review":"Jillian doesnt disappoint, this workout is hard but you can cater it to your own level, you will definitely see results!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This will kick your butt! In a good way...","review":"If you want to feel like you've REALLY worked out but only have 30 minutes to spare...buy this. You won't regret it. At first the exercises seem simple and like a breeze...and then you keep doing them and realize that they're harder than they look! By the end of the first work-out I was exhausted and feeling GREAT. It's really all you could want from a workout DVD -- try it; you'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will see results","review":"I bought this video after running into two different friends that had really toned up. I asked them what they were doing and they both said 30-Day Shred. I've done it several days now and can really feel a difference, especially in my upper body. My friend recommended going up to the next level about every 10 days. It's nice also that it is only 20 mins long. I only took off a star because sometimes it hurts my knees. In Level 1, there is a good bit of jumping jacks and butt kicks. I also like exercise videos made by \\"Prevention\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Effective Workout","review":"I use the 30 Day Shred DVD when I either don't have time to do a full workout, or if I can't get to the gym. I think it is a very effective workout. There are 3 Levels to the DVD and each one is about 18 mins of actual exercise, with a brief warm up and cool down peroid. I only did level 1 once, because it is not as intense as levels 2 and 3. The DVD is great beacuse it incorporates strenghth moves that are familiar with cardio that gets your heart pumping in new and different ways.For beginners, or those unfamiliar with typical weightlifting moves, I reccommend you watch the DVD first to get a good idea of the different moves and the proper form. Overall it is a great addition to my collection, and to my workout routine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended!!!","review":"I am just getting back into exercise. I really like how there is 3 levels so you can choose yours. I quick 20 min. great work out. I would highly recommend. I really like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!","review":"I just started the 30-day shred (doing workout 1), and was definately sore the first day. This is a great workout. There's a great variety of excercises, and the best part is that they're simple. She shows a great way to attack lower abs on crunches too. Great video, worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast & effective","review":"I use this video to supplement running & weight lifting. It's fast and effective. No coordination required. I highly recommend!FYI - the DVD has an option to just have background music without Jillian's voice - this may be a good option if you have kids working out with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a workout","review":"The first week I thought it was to omuch but now I am in Level 2 now and moving right along with results! I highly recommend her DVD. Its only about 22 minutes of your day but the 22 minutes is equal to much more time in the gym due to the intensity! I had to buy this once my friends started doing it and I have to say it is a tough workout for beginners like me who have not worked out in a long time, but definitely a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"It is really hard! The first day I did it I was sore for about 3 days. I have only been doing this for about 3 weeks and I can feel my body getting stronger. If you want to get toned up its a good dvd to buy. I can knock out 20 minutes every day instead of spending hours and throwing away money at the gym if you're a busy on the go person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time well spent!","review":"I enjoyed Jillian's video. She works you very hard in a short amount of time, but it is much easier to find 20 minutes out of your day to work out than it is an hour."},{"rating":"2","title":"good workout but wish they were longer","review":"Good workout, there are 3 20 minute workouts on the DVD. The time goes very fast, I wish the segments were at least 30 minutes. She does a lot of squats which I try to avoid so I do something else. Overall, a good workout but I don't think the girls got their bodies from doing this alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT workout!","review":"This is such a fantastic workout! I love that it's only 30 minutes and it kicks your butt! I was so sore for the first couple of days after starting it, it felt so good. It's great if you don't have a lot of time, but want to get in shape. I definitely recommend this workout!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall good workout DVD","review":"I thought this DVD was pretty good. I like how it has three different levels and you can choose to do one, two, or three at a time. The workouts definitely get your heartrate up and provide good muscle toning. Some of the moves are tougher to get at first, but after a little practice, they are quite do-able. My only complaint is that Jillian relies a bit too much on jumping techniques for cardio, which is hard on the knees. I can't do this DVD on consecutive days for that reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seemed promising, but let down","review":"When I read the reviews I saw that many people complained of knee pain, I blew it off and assumed they were \\"old people\\". I got through 17 straight days before I had to stop. The moves not only affected my knees, but my ankles hurt so bad that I was hobbling. I'm 23 and in good shape. I don't think it was the exercises themselves, but the pace. The video is so fast that you don't have time to focus on the movements and make sure that you're keeping good form. I would suggest a work out based on a number of reps, rather than a set time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Workout but Tough on the Legs","review":"I bought this DVD to help me lose about 40 pounds. I've done the exercises on and off for about a month. I recently did five days in a row and have to stop now for at least a day. I was really apprehensive about doing an exercise EVERY DAY with no resting period for your muscles but decided I would give it a shot since other people seemed to be able to do it. I am not someone who exercises regularly. Last night I developed painful shin splints. My calf muscles are very tight and I had a hard time walking last night. There is quite a lot of jumping and lunging involved. Also is hard on the knees.This is definetly a workout that would help anyone lose some weight but I would caution anyone doing it that doesn't work out regularly. You might want to do it every other day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jillian, has done it again","review":"This has to be one the most amazing workouts, I have ever done. In 20 minutes you will sweat your butt-off, I used to consider myself to be pretty in shape ( 6 days a week ) I workout, rain or shine. But Jillian puts you through the ringer ( in a good way ) She's extreamly motivating and frankly, I like her. I've needed someone to kick my butt, and she's just the person to do it. I have her whole \\"Biggest Winner\\" ( 5 in a pack ) series too, those aren't disapointing video's either. I trade off days, there's more than enough in there to get in shape. I'm just wondering if I will ever get to levels 2 and 3. LOL"},{"rating":"2","title":"30 Day Shred","review":"Thia is a great workout video. It is a little tough but I am only on week two and level 2 and I am already seeing results."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a kick \\"a\\" video","review":"I bought this video over a year ago and I really LOVE it! It is short, perfect for when I don't have much time to work out but it totally packs it in to a short period of time. I have other Jillian videos but so far I like this one best. There are things I like from each level so I like being able to change it up. Mainly I feel that I have worked out after this video and I like that feeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"You know what you're getting yourself into!","review":"Jillian is Jillian! Tough, do it or die trying! But she really seems to care! I did level 1 and struggled a bit because some moves feel like they are never going to end! If you like her, you will like this workout! She will have you kicking your own butt - literally! LOL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout video","review":"This is one of my favorite workouts ever. It is a full body workout in well under 30 minutes, and when that's all the time you have, this workout is the very best. There are 3 workouts in the shredded series, with this one being the easiest. Personally, I don't care for the 2nd and 3rd, so I just do this one. I also like to mix up my workouts with some of Jillian's other DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"my 1st week with this dvd","review":"I bought this dvd a week ago and I have noticed a difference right away. I have been on (and off) atkins for the past 5 or so months and have been able to lose about 35 pounds. I walk as much as I can, and have done zumba and yoga at home. This video though is what is going to make a difference. you will be sore the 1st few days, but by day 5 if done right and completed every day you will see and feel a difference. I have lost 2 inches total in a week. No weight loss really, but my clothes already feel better, I am stronger and am able to do the exercises easier. I started level 2 today and love that it feels so different from level 1 but just as hard. I have a bad left knee, so I take it a little easy during squats but have had less pain since starting this video. definitely worth buying and doing, I believe I will drop a pants size by the end of the 30 days. she is a bit annoying though, she talks through most of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I AM GETTING A 4-PACK!","review":"I have been working out with 30DS every day to help get in shape. I have always been a regular gym goer- but I needed something else to start seeing REAL results. The DVD is easy to follow and Jillian is a kick-butt trainer! I recommend to anyone who wants a challenge and wants to finally see some real definition in their figure!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ouch but in a good way!","review":"Gillian is awesome and she pushes you. If you're looking to be pushed this is a good video, just make sure you're ready for it and never do more than you can handle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"30 day shred","review":"I like this video and the workout- they present a good challenge and make me feel like i'm getting a good exercise in. But, you're supposed to do the same workout for 10 days in a row and never changing it up? Ever heard of muscle memory?! It gets boring. I've recently revamped my exercise regimen and i'm doing this every other day so as not to bore myself or let my body get used to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout Video","review":"This video is great quality, keeps you entertained, you shed pounds in a very healthy way, and it was delivered very well. Overall the video is great and have to love Jillian Michaels."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Jillian","review":"Fast delivery. Ordered because of price and because it is Jillian Michales. They work if you work them. She is tough and knowledgeable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Long of An Intro","review":"It takes way too long from when you put in the DVD until the work out starts. There must be 10 minutes of 'commercials' in the beginning! The DVD does not let you fast forward through them either. More marketing than work out. I bought a bunch of Michael's DVDs and if I could return them, I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of 30 Day Shred Season 1","review":"For first timers or if you haven't exercised in quite awhile, it is difficult. You have to work your way up to the full 20 minutes, so don't get discouraged. I like that the video features two additional women besides Jillian. One you follow if you are a beginner and the second one if you have been exercising and want to step it up a notch. I like it because I can do the workout in the comfort of my home, not having to run out to a gym. The important piece is that I am getting exercise and the financial outlay is minimal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price and delivery","review":"I love this workout video! It totally works. The price was great and the delivery was fast. And I love the way Jillian sets up her exercise circuits."},{"rating":"2","title":"intense workout","review":"This is an intense workout. Level two was challenging, but I completed it. Level three was so challenging I had to stop before the last six minutes. Best combo of strength and cardio I have ever seen. I workout about twice a week normally, but this video made my muscles sore the next day. Also starting to see definition in abs. The time goes by very quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"It feels good to exercise","review":"This is a nice workout video. I just wish it had more ab workout as it only devotes a sixth of the main workout to abs with its 3-2-1 minute strength-cardio-ab training."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome workout","review":"Jillian is a great trainer and the workout is amazing. It is not easy, but she helps you stick with it until it becomes easier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps you moving!","review":"This is great workout DVD for beginners and seasoned athletes alike! This dvd will keep you moving and have you sweating in no time. The workouts have Jillian as the leader, and two other people working out with her, each of the \\"helpers\\" modify the workout a little, one person does a beginner modification, while the other does slightly more advanced moves. As a \\"beginner\\" I am loving these workouts and feeling great. Good job, Jillian!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard work, but fun!","review":"This dvd is hard work! But it's easy to follow - which is a huge plus for me. Produces real results but deffinatly gives you a work out! Jillian is a great motivator as well, which I find I sometimes need during a hard workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS IT","review":"I have done many workouts -with video as well as with classes at health clubs. Like many others have said here, I thought I would do the 1st level one time and then move to the 2nd and 3rd easily. There is no way. This is a serious workout and probably one of the best. How Jilllian crammed a complete workout in 20 minutes that has more of an impact than 45 min with weights, I'll never understand. But I highly recommend this workout!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this workout","review":"I have used this DVD for a few weeks now and I can definitely see results. This 20 minute workout DVD is good enough to replace the gym. It will get you shredded!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good & Challenging Workouts","review":"If you like Jillian Michaels, then you'll like her newest workout DVD. It's broken down intwo 3 cycles - each one consists of 3 mins of strength, 2 mins of cardio, and 1 min of abs. There are three different levels to advance to as you progress. Each level is only 20 mins long, but you feel like you got a good workout done in a small amount of time. All you need is a set of dumbells. I recommend buying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The intro is way too long...","review":"I love the workouts. I hate the fact that it takes at least five minutes before you can even get TO the workouts. You are forced to watch the intro every time you want to use the dvd. There is no way to jump to the main menu. It kind of defeats the whole 20 minute workout idea.Other than that one little issue, I really do enjoy the workouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent DVD!!","review":"I love The Biggest Loser and I have really have began to like Jillian the past couple of seasons. She's hardcore but she knows her stuff! I began this DVD and it was VERY challenging! But after about a week I completed the entire 20 minutes of Level 1 without having to stop & catch my breath (there's 3 Levels)! It's still very challenging but you have to push yourself through this! I think maybe after another week I will try Level 2. And Jillian is motivating in this DVD more than you would imagine. 5 stars for this DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Jillian","review":"GREAT starter video to the rest of her DVD's. I reccomend starting with this one and then moving on to the others. The others are non-stop 40 minutes and a little tough for beginners. However, I do 2 levels of this which gives you a short break in between levels as it loads the second workout. HIGHLY RECCORMEND!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this DVD!","review":"I used this for around 60 days, after the first day of using this, increased my level length days! Don't stop working out when you first start because you are so sore!!! EVERYONE I know that has gotten this DVD LOVED it later on.. when they saw results!!Me.. I wanted SOOO bad to stop! But where would that lead me... still out of shape, and FAT! So as hard as it was, I stuck with it! BEST THING EVER! I didn't really diet or anything... I'm in nursing school, and am a needle Phoebe!! So I eat allot of candy!! But I did down size on meals.. Worked out so hard, didn't have much of an appetite!!I lost 20 pounds in about 6-7 weeks!! I did this EVERYDAY! Pre-planed on a calender I made for it. That way, I'd do what I was supposed to for the day, and have the torcher be over.. but worth it!!L-O-V-E this DVD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jillian Michaels - 30 Day Shred","review":"This is a great exercise program no matter your level. I started on step two and was a bit sorry, though I'll stick with it because step 1 is a bit too easy for me. The moves are not hard to learn, and you can add more weight to make some of them harder if need be. I don't find Jillian bossy at all, in fact she's much nicer on the dvd than on the Biggest Loser. To those who hated the music - if you can concentrate that much on the music, you simply aren't working out hard enough. I barely noticed it. It'll be a while before I can expect to complete step 3, which is what I want. All in all, it really is a tough workout in 20 minutes or so. It will make you sweat when you don't have a full hour. I would have liked to have seen more specific ab time, because my upper body strength isn't where I'd like it to be, so doing the plank moves to get the abs in, is going to take a while. It's the one area I have to cheat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Effective Workout Video if You Keep it Up!","review":"I bought this video after reading reviews, since I wanted something to help me drop my baby weight, quickly and at home. The only thing I needed besides the video was carpet/rug and a set of light weights. I felt like I was in pretty good shape, even though wanting to tone up, prior to the video, but it was an extreme work out. I would not recommend this video as a starter for people making the decision to work on their weight being overweight, as it is very intense, even at level 1. The actual time you commit each day is 28 minutes, not 20 as expected - you have 4 minutes of warm up and cool down, with 20 minutes of intense work out. All in all, I love the video, and can put it in anytime to get in a quick work out."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOTALLY WORTH IT!!","review":"OMG talk about an @ss kicking work out!!

Amazon is Awesome!","review":"Jillian designs the BEST workout programs for those who do not have time to hit the gym or who don't want to spend a friggin' hour a day or more working out. This 30 day shred is a great staple workout that is less than 35 min., and it kicks your butt! It's gets right to the point! I just bought her Yoga DVD, and it's similiar in kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome dvd!!","review":"This workout video is awesome. Jillian really kicks butt. I've been doing it for over a month and results are showing. She really gives you a 20 minute workout...unlike other 20 minutes workout videos...she doesn't give you a rest. Although I have been doing it for over a month...it's still hard to catch up some days. Plus, I still haven't tried level 3 yet. Level 2 is killing me so I'm afraid to try level 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"good - difficult","review":"As a yo-yo workout person about 20 lbs overweight, this was a difficult, but good workout. I only did it for five days straight, though, and haven't had the stamina to do the full 30 days. I hope to get back on the wagon soon. I will say you can definitely feel it working - I was sore the first day! It didn't even take a full 24 hours like it normally does to feel sore muscles. Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"tone your body","review":"i feel good after doing one 20 minute workout from this dvd. this dvd has 3 20 minute workouts and they are all great. i see the changes in my body and i like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kicks your butt!","review":"I would recommend this workout! I do have to admit that, at first, I hated it. I am 52 years old and have 60 pounds to lose, so needless to say I'm not in good shape. The first day I did this, I was sick, the second day I thought I would pass out. I didn't do it again for a week because I didn't think I could do it. However during that week, I kept thinking about it. So...I tried it again, this time a little slower than Jillian & the \\"girls\\" do it. I have been doing it consistenly now for 2.5 weeks. I'm still at level 1, but I can keep up with Jillian and feel like I'm ready to move on. I have A LOT more energy and I can already feel things \\"tightening\\" up. I look forward to doing my 20 minutes with Jillian every day when I get home from work. For the first time in my life, I feel like I WILL lose weight & feel great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jillian, you kicked my butt","review":"I did a bit of research before I bought this DVD, but I'm glad I did. I'm not even half way through Level 3 right now and I've lost about 6-7 pounds. I didn't expect to lose a ton of weight since I'd already lost about 25 pounds before starting the Shred, but it's taken me past my plateau and then some. I'd definitely recommend. It's not a cake walk either... I was sore for the first three days of the workout, but it does go away, promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get ready!!!","review":"This was the first Jillian Michaels workout I ever did.

I am sooo glad I purchased this. My future mother-in-law and I have been walking about 3.5 miles every other day for about two weeks. I got the video in the mail yesterday and took it over with me for our daily walk. We decided to go ahead and try the 30 day shred video instead of our walk. Wow! We were both sweating and our heart rate was up in no time! We both feel like jello today, but are ready to go again tonight! I know that if we stick with this and eat healthily, we are going to be excited about our new bodies in 30 days!Each level (I totally recommend beginning with level one, even if you think you are advanced) is only 22 minutes long, so it is perfect if you are a busy bee whom is always crunched for time! I completely recommend this dvd...it is a worthwhile purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jillian rocks","review":"This video is freakin' awesome! I got a great price on it and I've loved doing the workouts. Jillian Michaels rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This workout is worth 20 minutes of your time!","review":"I purchased this DVD because I enjoy watching Jillian on The Biggest Loser television program. I also wanted something a bit different to do on those days that I only had 20-30 minutes of time to get in some exercise.This was only my first day. I only did Level 1! It's unbelievable how my body feels after that short 20 minute time frame! You think, ok, some cardio, strength training and abs. No problem. HA! There are no rests in between exercises. As Jillian indicates, there's no time for rest if you want the most from your 20 minutes of exercise (my paraphrase). You work arms and legs at once with every exercise. She bases her moves on the concept that you work both the small muscles and the big muscles at the same time. Excellent work for legs, arms, core, abs, everything.It's a fantastic workout and I'm excited to see what happens with consistency. I'll try to come back and give an update."},{"rating":"2","title":"bully to be","review":"I am on day 3 of Shred & it's an excellent DVD.

Be ready to be feeling everything!!!I love this DVD, can't compliment it enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing workout everytime!","review":"I've owned this DVD for 8 months now and I sweat each time. There are no breaks and the moves are simple, yet VERY effective. I highly recommend this for anyone. I do not do this workout everyday (30 days) but I use it to supplement workouts on the days I don't run and it's still a butt kicker! Best DVD I've ever owned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Obviously No Pain, No Gain, Awesome","review":"I recieved the DVD in a timely manner, and was thoroughly impressed. I must own at 30 work out DVD's and this is the ONLY one where I sweated profusely in such a short period of time. I've worked out for a much longer time and did not see or feel the way I do in just these 20 minutes exercises. I am able to fit this into my morning workout and I look forward to it! Which is new for me. My only complaint is in the strength training portions, It seems like the triceps and calves do not get enough attention. Most of the strength (weighted) exercises cover multiple muscle groups, but you can still tell what Jillian is concentrating on. There are no weighted \\"triceps specifically\\" excercises. Same for calves. Not to say she's not hitting on them at all, because she is! It's just not as noticeable. So I just incorporated a couple sets of exercises at the end to cover these areas. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU MUST BUY THIS!!","review":"I am now on day 5, day F-I-V-E and have lost 3 inches!! I haven't kept track of lbs because I am not overweight, but do need to \\"re-firm\\" my prob areas after last baby. I combine this with my regular cardio every morning! I have found myself wanting to hurry and get my 45 min of elliptical or tae bo over with so I can do this. It is VERY challenging but fun! It goes by soooo fast! I am still on level one, but that should tell you something...I work out no less than four days a week for an hour each time. I work out hard, break a sweat everyday and push myself...now that I have began the 30 day shred I feel my health and workouts have improved x's 10! I plan on doing level one for 10 days, 2 for 10, and so on.

I couldn't do the entire 1st workout without stopping for a few minutes, but I gradually worked up my stamina.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS VIDEO to the BEGINNER who is totally out of shape and really wants to see quick results!!!

That's just 20 MINUTES a day for a GREAT workout!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied","review":"This DVD is great- it's definitely an AWESOME workout with plenty of room to work your way up from level 1 to level 3. I am only 2 weeks in and I'm already seeing a difference in my muscle tone and stamina. I don't do the workouts every single day, but about 5 days/week. This DVD can really work for anyone- if you're a beginner, there are modified steps at each level. And if you're more advanced, you will still be challenged at any level because you can adjust your intensity. Jillian Michaels has gotten me addicted to working out- I can't wait to get home from work so I can pop in the DVD and work up a sweat!The only little negative thing I can say is that you can't fast forward through the intro at the beginning of the DVD, which is a couple of minutes long. This is really not a big deal though; I use this time to start warming up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kicked my butt, LITERALLY!","review":"This DVD has gotten me in great shape, and in less then a months time.

I have more tone in my arms and thighs and the ab work is great too but may need to be supplemented with more crunches and plank work.

That being said, it is very difficult to keep up motivation after the first week if you are one who easily bores with repetative workouts. I personally loved this DVD, however, my sister absolutely hates it! If you are a fan of Jillian and her personal style of telling it like it is, you should greatly enjoy this workout. If you're not a fan, look elsewhere! Also, be prepared to BURN after your first workout (if you make it all of the way through the first one) if you don't work out regularly!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jillian Bats You Up","review":"This workout is exhausting, but totally shows progress.

It is nice because it has 3 levels that are packed with strengthing cario and ab workouts. I felt stronger and thinner after one week.

So irritating!","review":"These workouts are good, however, I usually only have a short window in the day to exercise and because you are unable to skip the long-winded intro, I usually just pick another workout.

The best thing about this workout was something Jillian said and it is true... \\"If you only want to work out for 20 minutes a day and see results, you have to work hard\\" or something to that extent.

I wanted a workout that would help me tone up, and take some inches off, but wouldn't require a lot of time each day. Dedicating 20 minutes a day to the 30 Day Shred is very doable for me and, even though it is an intense workout, I enjoy it! There is a reason Jillian is called America's Toughest Personal Trainer, but she gets results! If you buy this video and dedicate 20 minutes a day to it, I believe you will be very pleased with the results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great short workout, gets you sweating","review":"I bought this and Ripped in 30. This video is less intense than the ripped in 30 but is by no means easy. You have to push through it and give it your all and you will lose weight. If you combine this with Jillians diet plan completely worth the money. It does not feel like your on a diet and you never feel hungry. The recipes are so delicious and it helps you stay healthy to have better weight loss results. I alternate this video with ripped in 30 to get a variation on exercise routines but you can not go wrong with either video. Thanks for a great 25 minute workout. You do need to warm up before you start the video since she doesn't take enough time to stretch and warm up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jillian Michaels- 30 Day Shred","review":"I bought this for my supervisor at work and she loves it!

I was able to get back to my pre-baby weight but not my pre-baby body. I decided to buy this after hearing some good things about it from other mommies. I have a very large tummy, that is saggy still from having a baby over 9 pounds. I am on day 4 of level one and I can already see a difference! My clothes are looser and fit better. Plus I am starting to see some definition in my abs. People at work are even saying to me that they can see a difference. I know I will never look like Jillian and that's ok, but I feel better about how I look and that's all that matters to me. As a recently divorce mom who is trying to get back into the dating world, it has helped boost my confidence and allow me to put myself out there. Jillian is tough, if you want an easy workout go somewhere else, but if you want results... This is the way to go!

Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I'm quite fit (ish) - I swim, hike, swing kettle bells so thought I'd breeze through level 1. I even used my 5kg weights to push me a bit harder, thinking it'd be a bit easy. But nothing prepared me for the after effects. It felt like a 2 hour work out and every single muscle in my body ached the next day. Had to give it a rest for two days but I'm about to give it another (more gentle) go. Seriously, ditch the expensive gym membership - this is all you need. I've never seen 'Biggest Loser' but I've heard about this DVD and now I know the reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"30 Day Shred","review":"First of all, I want to thank everyone who reviewed this DVD.

I'm only a few days in to it, among other workouts, so I won't know for a while what a difference it's making. Ok, maybe that's a lie. After only a few days my endurance is definitely getting better.Anyone looking for a killer workout (and hey, I'm only on level one) should definitely get this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quick workout","review":"For only a twenty minute workout, this video definitely gets your heart rate up. I'm in decent shape - I don't work out all the time, but I bike commute to work most days (used to be 8 miles roundtrip, now its 20 miles), walk, and hike often. My heart rate definitely is up within the first few minutes of the video and some of my less used muscles are protesting quite a bit by the end. I did level 1 once and have been doing level 2 a few times a week. I haven't tried level 3 yet, but plan to soon. I like that there are 3 different workouts so you can switch it up and by using heavier weights you can make some of the exercises more difficult. The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because I think if you want to see more drastic results you probably need to do one of the longer videos. But I like that it is only 20 minutes since I don't usually have a lot of extra time and it gets in a little time working my abs, arms, and other trouble areas/less used muscles."},{"rating":"2","title":"woohoo","review":"In just a week I've lost an inch on my waist!!!!!!!!!

I actually went all the way down to 3 pound weights. I did Level 1 for about 8 days and then moved on to Level 2 because I was getting bored with Level 1. Level 2 is so much more difficult. I sweat like crazy and I need to modify some of the circuits.I would absolutely recommend this workout DVD. I have lost about 5-7 pounds in almost 2 weeks (I'm trying not to weigh myself every day). Its easy to just do a 20 minute video and I saw results almost immediately!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid workout","review":"I started this workout routine 3 days ago (only 27 days left, lol!) and I think it's a pretty solid, high energy and effective work out. I'm in relatively good shape and work out ~5/6 days a week - but mostly cardio. That said, the strength portions of Jillian's work out make some of my lesser used muscles hate her - like my lower calves. Mad sore, but hoping that'll dissipate by next week. I started with Level I but found that only warmed me up so I moved onto Level II right away. Currently I'm combining both Level I and II (for a 40 min session) and it's kicking my a$$ - which is exactly what I bought this for. I'm hoping to move on to Level III by next week. All in all, it's a really good workout that goes by really quickly, but it's probably extra tough if you aren't in shape yet. If you are in shape, I'd recommend combining or going straight to Level III to feel more of a challenge - but whatever your level - you'll definitely sweat."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"I think this is a great workout video.

They are short, but still challenging and sweat-worthy. The cool-downs are a little too short for me -- I usually stretch just a little bit longer, but that's not a complaint about the workout. Definitely glad to have these on hand for an alternative to a 30 or 45 minute session."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great use of time!","review":"As a mom of 3 kids under 5, I don't have much time to work out so I LOVE that each work out is only 30 minutes (counting warm up/cool down) so I can do it during nap time and still have time for a quick shower before anyone wakes up. My oldest tries to work out with me so it gets him moving too.I also think it's great that you don't do any one thing for very long. Just as your muscles start to get tired, you're moving on to something else.Oh and one more thing - you don't even need fancy equipment to do this. Just a pair of weights (soup cans work in a pinch) and a mat. Very user friendly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome workout!!!","review":"OK girls I LOVE this video.... I just started it today. It is 20 minute workout and there are three one is Beginners then Intermediate then Advanced. OK I just did the Beginners and it kicked my butt. There are two girls doing the workout with Jillian and one is doing Beginner the other is Advanced this is WITHIN the Beginner workout. I ended up starting to follow the Advanced girl and ended up barely keeping up with the Beginner. It is simple basic stuff you would learn in high school but Butt kicking. I can see it really doing some weight loss after a couple weeks even. I can't imagine what the Intermediate and Advanced brings. It is quick and easy oh and it is the woman that personally trains the people on Biggest Loser reality show. Anyway definitely grab a copy if you are interested!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Will get you sweatin in no time!","review":"This is tough and you instantly will start sweating from doing this workout. I really love it, and the things she asks to do are fairly easy to pick up, unlike some of the other exercise DVDs I've tried (I always feel lost doing TurboJam). Just note that you will need weights for the DVD. The only thing that is s lightly weird for me is how sometimes you see the demonstrators doing the exercises in time with the music, and other times it's not in time. Really throws me off since I like to do the reps along with the beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Wow, after doing this for the past 2 weeks, I'm so impressed with Jillian. The first few times- and actually still sometimes!- I feel like I am not going to get all the way through. I started with Level 1, after a few days moved on to level 2. I stayed at level 2 for 10 days and the last few days I finally got to Level 3- woohoo! This is a majorly intense workout- don't let the \\"20 minutes\\" fool you. But it's such a great feeling of accomplishment when you get to Level 3. I am already noticing results after 2 weeks- especially in my upper body. jillian does a lot of weight training so not only will you lose weight, but you will become stronger. I am raving to everyone about this video, and it's nice reading other people's reviews because once you get started you're hooked. It's nice to hear from other people so I know I'm not the only one who is obsessed with this video ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Work Out!","review":"Whether you're a beginner or advanced, this work out will work for you. Jillian doesn't blather, she works. She makes you work and she makes sense. 3 levels, 3-6 minute segments w/a short warm up and cool down in each. Also, she is backed by 2 other exercisers, one doing the exercises at an easier level (e.g. not as deep with lunges and squats) the other doing them at a higher intensity (e.g. literally kicking herself in the [...]). The only drawback is that she doesn't do a modified jumping jack or the more modified 'run' so people with knee issues may have an issue at 1st. The nice thing is it's 20 minutes...just when you think 'I am done, can't do another...' it's over and you're done.This DVD is money well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"30-Day Shred - tough workout","review":"I plan to use this workout about 3 times a week this winter, when I can't get outside to run. I've done level 1 twice since I bought it, and it's a pretty good workout. I was a little sore the next day, and I was already in pretty good shape. I think I need to do level 1 & 2 to really replace my run though. Jillian Michaels seems a little uncomfortable at first, but then her personality (while not especially warm) does come through. She is very down to earth and encouraging without being phony or perky (both of which I hate!). The ladies working out with her are in great shape - especially Anita, who I've seen in other workout DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't regret it!","review":"This is a great exercise routine, the 3 levels are great, although I haven't reached level 3 yet, level 1 is a great intro on what to expect, and level 2 is a moderate routine as well.

Only 20 min, nonstop exercise, complete strength, cardio and abs, you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to workout plan","review":"This dvd is great for those who don't have time to work out, but want a quality work out. Yes people, if you aren't advanced you will feel like you're dying, BUT you can do modified movements. If you can't do jumping jacks, just because Jillian says not to doesn't mean she will spank you if you do! If there are cardio movements that you can't do due to knee problems or something simliar, do a different cardio move. As long as you keep moving you'll be okay. There is no need to give up at all. I have recommended this dvd to many, including those that frequent the gym."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! GREAT WORKOUT!","review":"I work out EVERYDAY. I usually do 1 hour on the eliptical, 20 minutes of pilates, and 10 minutes of light weights for toning. i got this dvd to put some variety into my routine. i started at level one thinking it would be fairly easy. But OMG! it kicked my butt! i've beend doing it for 3 days straight now. and i am SOOOO sore! i used muscles i didn't even know i had! great workout! i can't imagine what level 2 and 3 will do to me when i get there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jillian Michaels - 30 Day Shred","review":"I love this DVD. There are 3 - 20 minute segments. They get harder as they go along. You think 20 minutes is going to be an easy workout but oh no, not with Jillian. Once you're done with your 20 minutes, you'll know you've worked out. It's tough but it feels so good when you've accomplished the workout. Today will be my 7th day to do it. I can already feel tightness in my muscles from what I've done so far. I would recommend this DVD. I plan to purchase more of her stuff in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"I've lost my 15 pregnancy pounds by following this program for about four months. Nothing else was working. It took about a month of doing it about 3-4 times a week before I lost my first pound or two. I'm sure that's partly because I was gaining muscle. I decided that I needed to stick with it because I still didn't have enough muscle to burn my fat effectively. I do it off and on now, but I definitely recommend it. You are supposed to do it EVERY DAY for 30 Days, which is really hard to do. The more consistently I do it, the more I lose. The most days I've ever exercised in a row is three and I really started to lose some weight then. I would say to just keep at it and try doing it every day, like the program states before you say it doesn't work. BTW, it's helped my back a ton and just my overall energy level is definitely up and I can run after my children much easier. It's also very convenient to do at home and my children like to try to do it with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"difficult workout, but effective!!!!","review":"I'm on week two and just started the 2nd workout on the dvd and it is difficult!!! I was very out of breath but I really feel good.. I lost two pounds my first week (on a diet as well) and I can see results already!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense!","review":"This workout is intense! Yesterday, when completing the last strength interval on level two I was literally in tears. This workout is no joke, but you WILL see results if you stick with it. I have. I also like, very much, the fact that Jillian is not overly perky- she's very no-nonsense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweat Bucket! Short and sweet.","review":"Jullian can be annoying, but who cares. She's a great motivator. Don't kid yourself, this DVD is short, but extremely effective! The plank moves are the best for a tone belly inside and out along with the jumping lunges. You'll see results immediately and feel really good about yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kick butt workout","review":"This is a great workout DVD. It offers you 3 separate workouts based on your level and man do they KICK your butt!! In only 20 mins you get a workout that leaves you sore the next day! All in all, I'd say this is a great DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Short but not sweet","review":"My normal exercise routine consists of a Mon., Wed., Fri. run of 3-4 miles and a Tues., Thurs. video toning workout. I was pessimistic of this particular video due to its short 20 min. length. I didn't think I would get anything out of it. Boy was I wrong! There are three 20 minute workout options (all challenging), and each workout consists of three, INTENSE strength, cardio, and ab circuits. I wanted to cry by the end!!! It is a great, quick workout that you can feel like you've accomplished a lot. I was dripping with sweat when I was done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome workout","review":"One of my employees recommended this DVD to me, it's a great workout in just 20 minutes. Perfect for a quick morning workout! I do wish there were more workouts, would love to see Jillian come out with another version that has maybe 10-20 workouts to choose from, but all still just 20 minutes each. I really like the combination of cardio, strength and core. It's a great workout for beginners and for those already in good shape. I recommended it to my sister, who loves it as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good way to get up a sweat","review":"Great DVD for a short, intense workout. The only reason I didn't give this 4 stars is because Jillian's voice and style just get on my NERVES. lol But as far as the workout and results, I'd say it's great. It has three levels and I can do #1 but #2 is a challenge. Haven't even tried #3 yet. I like that it gives me something to work toward. Also, because they have beginner and advanced people showing you each routine, there are almost 6 levels instead of just 3. If you want good aerobics that will get you sweating and have some weight training as well, this is a great choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!","review":"I love, love, love this DVD!! I started it two weeks ago and am already seeing results! Call me crazy, but I actually look forward to working out to this DVD. It's only 20 mins and let me tell you, it's the longest 20 mins of my life...LOL It's super intense but Jillian is a great trainer and makes you want to complete the exercise. Who knew a \\"simple\\" jumping jack could make you feel like you are going to die? I certainly didn't! I would recommend this workout to all my friends (and have). BTW, I'm still on level 1 and am not sure when I will be ready for level 2...LOL I hope you all like this DVD as much as I do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly as advertised","review":"I have done this every day for 22 days now, and just moved to level 3. Great workout!! If you keep to it you will absolutely see results."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME SO FAR :)","review":"This video is awesome. I'm just on level one day six and i can already see my belly area trimming down. Aside doing this i also run mon-sat each time i get done with the video. So far of eating right, doing this video and running i've lost 7lbs. I'm gonna continue this video and keep you all updated! :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the $","review":"I would highly recommend this video for those looking to tone and slim but who don't want to spend too much time working out. Each workout is only 25 minutes and it is broken down into three circuits, plus a warm up and cool down. In each circuit 3 minutes are dedicated to strength training, 2 minutes to cardio, and 1 minute to abdominal work. This format makes it easy for quitters like me to push through a hard work-out since I know whatever I'm having trouble with will be over soon. The three different workouts keep things interesting and pack a punch. The only improvement would be an extended cool down period -- I often need to stretch more afterwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"30 DAY SHRED","review":"This product is just an OK for me. Its a great workout but a bit montonous after the 7th time. Music doesnt get you \\"pumped up\\" and its basically the same routines in Levels 1, 2 and 3. Is it worth the $10.00 I spent on it? I guess"},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to your body. My body tells me this is bad for me.","review":"I gave it 2 rather than 1 star because I did get sweaty & I did work muscles that I have not in the past (despite working out pretty regularly).However, as others have mentioned, it's killer on the knees. You know how you are supposed to feel good about yourself all day after a good workout? This one made me feel lightheaded and tense all day! Also, the intro lecture (that you can't fast-forward through) is really going to get to you after awhile.Try something nicer to your body. You can still work hard and get results without getting physically and emotionally tortured!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously disappointing","review":"I bought this DVD based on all the reviews saying it was an intense workout. Plus I really like Jillian and thought she would be hard core. I consider myself to be moderately fit, but I'm no fitness freak. I work out 3-4 times a week at the gym and walk the dog most days. I wanted a hard workout, so I decided to skip right to level three without looking at anything else. I just popped in the DVD and went for it. I kept waiting and waiting for the \\"real\\" workout to begin. Sadly, it never did. If you have ever been to a cardio class at the gym, level three was easier than that. If you do regular cardio, strength training and body building, this video may not be challenging enough for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"My copy was a bootleg. The disc is functional, I'm just annoyed that I paid for something that is so obviously pirated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just beginning and love it!","review":"Let me give you a little run down about myself, I am 5'8\\" and 200 lb 26 year old female. Not in the best shape of my life for sure. I just finished my first workout with this video and absolutely love it. It will definitely work your muscles if you do it right. Obviously, I started out on level 1, and by the end of it, I felt great. Can't wait to see my results after I've done this a while!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout","review":"I haven't finished all 3 phases yet. I bought this to supplement my normal workouts when I can't make it to the gym.This is well worth the short money, and in my opinion for someone in pretty decent shape to begin with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Workout","review":"The first couple of times I did it, I had difficulty getting through the entire workout while doing the workouts with good form. It was definitely challenging and as I progressed, I was able to do the workouts better. Even after using this regularly, I still get a good workout from this video each time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined my knees after 7 days","review":"I was so excited to try out this product. A friend of mine looked fabulous after having her kids and she let me in on her \\"Shred\\" secret. With little time to spare for workouts these days w/ children, I was excited to get quick results in 20 minutes a day. After just 7 sessions, I was unable to walk down a set of stairs without the inside of my knees feeling like they had pins & needles in them. I have NEVER had knee issues and am in good shape (I worked out through my 7th month of pregnancy). I got an orthopedic opinion and it turns out some of the exercises in level 1 (that's as far as I got) are AWFUL for your knees - butt kicks & side (forward) lunges primarily. The over-extension of the knee is awful. During the exercise, I remember thinking, 'this doesn't feel right, but I guess I just need to push through.' Well, if you feel this way, I would warn you to stop!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing workouts!","review":"This is by far the best workout video I have ever done- when I purchased it I thought it would be good to fill in some of my other workouts. Well let me tell you- if you can add this to your normal workout you are superhuman!! This is a full workout all on its own!! All I can say is thank you Jillian for making such a great-fun-time friendly workout!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT workout!!","review":"This workout is INTENSE! I am already seeing results and I've lost weight. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to lose weight and build lean muscle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout - watch your knees","review":"This is a good workout but there is a lot of deep knee work. It didn't start to bother me until about week 3 but then I started to notice it. Yes, I am using the proper form on my squats and lunges but there are just a lot of them. Considering you watch it every day for a month, I'm impressed that Jillian doesn't become totally intolerable after a month. Well done, could use more variety, but a good price for what you get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Circuit Training at Home","review":"This is a great home workout that keeps things simple. Lots of variables to suit your needs as to whether or not you want lower impact or constant verbal instruction. Just what I was looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG HALP ME!!!","review":"I am 250 pounds but in pretty good shape, even for my weight. I popped this in just today. I got to the squat and press with no trouble, but for some reason that hurts my right thigh so bad that i cant even hardly move it! so im gonna sit for a while and try it again later, but use my shake weight instead of the squat and press until my thighs can handle it. Besides that, it is a nice, full workout. Enjoyable. I like jillian because she isn't so perky. Sharp and to the point. The workout did not challenge me except for the pushups and the squat and press"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the \\"Jillian Experience\\" I wanted or expected...","review":"My complaint about this video is not the exercises themselves but the way they are delivered. Like most people, I grew fond of Jillian as the semi-insane, in-your-face instructor on The Biggest Loser. I think her approach resonates with people because sometimes we just need someone screaming at us \\"Get up off your butt and get working!\\" But there is none of that in this video. It is a traditional exercise video, with decent cueing and instruction, but no \\"fire\\" whatsoever. Given what I have seen and come to expect from Jillian on TBL, I would think a lot of people, like me, simply find the workout too boring to do on a regular basis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jillian Michaels- 30 Day Shred","review":"Great workout. Music is really boring, though. I go back and forth between Level 2 and Level 3 because parts of Level 2 are actually harder than Level 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"This disc injures backs","review":"After having 3 different existing patients that had rehabbed their old disc injuries show up in my clinic in the past 2 weeks after working out with this DVD, I took a look. After reviewing it, practically every ab exercise flexes the lumbar spine, which studies have shown is one of the quickest ways to herniate a disc. This \\"old school\\" sit up and crunch method will give you great abs...at the expense of the discs in the lumbar spine. If you have prior injury there, you should stay away from this. If you want to avoid disc injury, you should stay away from this."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Knee is Shredded - Torn meniscus, arthoscopic surgery to follow","review":"I loved this workout. Even bought a couple copies for friends.I did Level One for months before moving on to Level Two. I enjoyed Level One, and it did the trick for me. It was tough on the knees, but I followed Jillian's direction and kept good form to prevent the knee injuries she kept warning about.I rue the day I moved to Level Two ... I did it once or twice, which was one or two too many times. It is a knee killer.I am in my mid 40s, so my meniscus has been around a while. However I am (or was) in good shape before I began Level Two, so it wasn't due to a sedentary lifestyle or lack of following instruction.My doctor said many of the exercises in this video are very very bad for the knees. Even if you follow Jillian's instructions to \\"prevent knee injury.\\"Scheduling arthoscopic surgery today... My knee gives this video one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing workout!","review":"I bought this video with the intention of overall toning and weight loss. I will say that the program is working quite well. I am on day 21 and have dropped about 9lbs and my overall energy level and stamina has improved. Just to give you an idea where I started, I was about 154lbs and now 145. I am 5'6\\" and under the age of 30. Just stick with it! It works! I have tried many different videos and found this is great even for me with no cordination whatsoever! Before this video I ran up the stairs and got winded. Now I can jog 1/2 mile and not feel too tired. Also my husband has told me he has seen a great improvement in my overall energy. I would reccomend this product to anyone who wants to increase their strength, tone and loose inches off their body. I havent changed much in my diet other than lots of water and no alcohol. Also cutting calories helps too but I love my ice cream treat every now and then. So all in all great product!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout!","review":"Last year I started doing this workout 1-2 times a day in the spring. By the fall, all the fat around my stomach area was almost completely gone. This is a great workout.My pants were practically falling off of me. If you stick to this and eat right, you will tone up and get fit.My only complaint about this workout is the stupid commercials in the beginning. I have to wait around 5 minutes before I can start the workout every time because it wont let me fast forward through it. Comon already! Stop wasting time! Im ready to EXERCISE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout!","review":"I love this DVD! For only 20 minutes I get a full body workout. Many workout DVDs are only cardio but Jillian Michaels also works in strength and abs in a quick, cohesive way. I did Level 1 a few times before and worked my way to Level 2 which I started today. I like how the girls in the background act like they are feeling the burn as much as I was. It helped motivate me to keep going since they were! To anyone reading the reviews before buying: Just buy this DVD already! :) It will definitely give you a good workout! I am planning on buying more of her DVDs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW. Just wow.","review":"OK so I am only 15 years old and trying to get into shape. I have lost a total of 30 lbs so far and have another 15 to go, although I didn't lose the weight off this video. I started this video 30 pounds back, and I had to stop. I know, it wasn't Jillian's fault it was my own. It was so hard I would rather go to the gym and spend and hour there than do this. Well after I quit and lost the weight, I am ready to start it again because I need to get seriously toned up. Not bulky, but lean and lose fat. Hopefully Jillian can help me with this, I gave it a good review because it is so hard so it must work good. Please comment me if anyone has had great results for this dvd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best option","review":"I purchased this video so I could work out at home those days when I couldn't get to the gym. I'm in my twenties and on the chubby side, so I'm not used to working out. The exercises are a bit too hard if you aren't already in shape, which causes frustration instead of the desire to keep going. I wanted to feel energized but instead I felt worse than when I started, so I put the dvd away and decided that the gym was better for me, since I could start slow and work my way up. My suggestion is, if you're overweight and want a video you can keep up with, THIS ISN'T IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost 2 lbs in 4 days!!!","review":"I am an exercise fanatic and always try the latest videos and products. I work out 5-6 days per week doing cardio every day and strength 3-4 times per week. THIS DVD WORKS!

Then, I found Jillian Michael's 30 day shred and after doing level 1 on day 1 and level 2 on day 3, I lost 2 lbs!!! This is incredible! I hope to continue this and lose another 2 lbs by next Saturday! This time flys by on this workout and I really feel that Jillian is there pushing me a long to my weight loss goals.

I read all the reviews but disregarded the ones where they said they got injured, thinking that it wouldnt happen to me. Well 5 days I was unable to walk and in excruciating pain. The dvd has lots of jumping, squats and twists. So I tore a tendon in my knee. I got.a good sweat and burn so I will go back whene s my knee heals. On to the six week 6 pack for now.Update: april 6th, 2012: so now I have two knees with torn meniscus. The last week I have been unable to walk, squat and bend without pain. I was unable to do any videos or workouts. I am highly discouraged, upset and mad with jillian right now. There are alot of reviews I wish id read before ordering."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!!","review":"All I have to say, is girlfriend can sure bust your butt in 20 minutes!

Great job Jillian!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout","review":"I haven't exercised consistently in about 3 years so I'm doing Level 1. I've only done if for 2 days, but it's a great workout. It's intense and you are done before you know it!My only complaint is that there is no diet/nutrition information other than referring you to her website or other books. Also, it seems somewhat misleading. 30 Day Shred - meaning if I do this for 30 days in a row, I will see results? Or does it allow you to take any days off? And losing up to 20 pounds...if I only do this workout? I guess I would like some clarification. Anyone have any ideas? I mean, we all know to cut our calorie intake and what to eat, but I would like to know specifically what to do in terms of exercise and nutrition what I need to do to lose 20 pounds in 30 days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for anybody with great knees","review":"There were areas I really liked about the program, especially the strength training and core exercises that I've incorporated into other areas of my fitness routine, but overall it was very hard on my joints, especially my knees, for which I'm still paying. I don't normally write reviews of products, but I felt I needed to for anyone out there that may have weak knees/joints so that they would think twice or at the very least take precautions (that I obviously didn't) before doing the program. I believe another reviewer mentioned modifications for knees (padding, especially during the modified push ups) which should be heeded. I hadn't done high impact exercise for a while and I should have thought twice before \\"jumping\\" right in. My knees and I will be doing low impact from now on."},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLE!

A+++"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jillian shows tough love","review":"So, the DVD is harder even on level one than i remember it being, but i know it provides an excellent and accurate workout. Don't buy this DVD if you don't want people on your case when your working out. Jillian talks troughout the video to motivate you, and can be tough some times. Overall its a great DVD and if you have the motivation to complete a twenty minute workout then i say go for it, just keep in mind it's a little harder then expected, but you WILL see results if you start and finish the 30 day shred."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel the burn!","review":"This is an excellent DVD! Jillian's not kidding when she says your muscles will be burning.

If you're serious about getting in shape and want a fast and effective workout, this one is for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough time given to ensure proper lunge form","review":"My main issue with this DVD is the speed at which it moves. I actually liked that aspect a lot, until I got to the lunges. Michaels moves through the workout so quickly (which otherwise is a good thing) that it is very, very hard to ensure you're in proper lunge form the entire time, for every lunge. Even when doing these lunges in front of a mirror, which is what I used to keep myself from overextending, it's quite hard to do them perfectly when you're absolutely flying through the workout. I blew out my knee. It hurts. @*&%. I REALLY wish Gillian would slow the lunges part of the workout down just a little. I'm sure plenty of gym rats (just kidding ;) will criticize me for not having my lunge form down perfectly, but like I said - it's REALLY freakin' difficult to do when you're moving at this speed. Now I can't practice lunges at all, because my knee is all @$#%ed up. Yay."},{"rating":"1","title":"30 days shred","review":"The program changes moves too quickly. It is not normal to change so quickly from standing to sitting to lie down. It put lots of stress on joints.Also, there are no option for biginner or some one with knee or back problem.The movements are not bad, but becareful with your knee and back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent exercise, however language issue in our household!","review":"I am very pleased with the excercise & motivation in this DVD. HOWEVER, I do have a problem with some language that she uses that is not acceptable in our household. She calls one exercise A--[...] (we only use the words bottom or buttocks in our home) and before the cool down she states that, \\"G-D knows you deserve it.\\" I am sure that this is not a problem for most people, however, we have a variety of ages of children in our household and do some exercise DVDs as P.E. So, if you have the same standards as us, be forewarned. If not, enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless pre-video","review":"This might have been good if I had the patience and interest to sit through 5 minutes or so of advertisement and introduction EVERY SINGLE TIME you watch the video. Usually, on most DVD's you can just hit 'menu' on your remote and go right to the 'Play' option, but not on this one! You can't even fast-forward past the junk! By the time you get to the menu to start the workout, you're irritated with the video AND with Jillian. Because of this, I'll not likely be using this DVD again and will stick with my tried and trusted Tae-Bo Amped that allows me to get right down to business in the short amount of time I have to workout. If every minute counts - don't buy this workout DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love is workout!!","review":"This workout is awesome!

Over a month later, after only doing the video 2 times, I have serious back pain and have an appointment to go see a chiropractor. It hurts so badly. I have NEVER in my life had back pain, so this isn't some old thing that flared up again. I have always been happy to not have endured that headache of a problem, seeing other people around me with chronic back problems. I guess I will now have to join them after this experience.

Really, if you are out of shape, get another DVD unless you really need to look good in 30 days because you are going to at the very least hurt very badly the day after you begin. My copy is going to the Salvation Army."},{"rating":"1","title":"faulty dvd","review":"I have done the actual work out... and I LOVE it!!! However, the dvd I received didn't work. It would pause and skip every couple of seconds in the work out. I've sent it back and am waiting on my replacement dvd. Hopefuly it will work better and I'll gladly up my rating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!","review":"I found this tape very boring and very basic beginner level - but a decent workout. It is only 20 minute workouts - I had to do 2 in a row to feel I got enough work in. Great for the really out of shape - boring and too short for higher fitness levels. Plus too much talk!!! I like her on TV - but wasted my money on this dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT DVD WORKOUT!","review":"I am an aerobics instructor so I am extremely skeptical of other instructors-especially at home workouts. This really is a great cardio and strength workout and it's so nice that it is only 30 minutes! Very high marks! I have a new respect for Jillian Michaels and they way she is able to motivate people even through the TV screen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout!","review":"I have heard good things about Mrs. Michaels, and I was proven right when I decided to purchase this DVD. I just started it today actually. It for sure had me sweating a storm.I love her no-nonsense and fun upbeat personality. Today I almost gave up, but decided to go on and felt great when I finished. I realized I am beyond level one and can actually step up to level 3. I am going to do this 5 times a week along with Turbo Jam to get maximum results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout","review":"Very hard, but it works! The videos are longer than 20 minutes each. They are about 30 minutes each with the warm-up and cooldown."},{"rating":"2","title":"best workout","review":"I think this is probably one of the best, and quickest, workouts I've ever done. It's definitely tough, though maybe not for people who are in really good shape, and it definitely changes the shape of your body. Whether or not you lose a lot of pounds, you can definitely fit into clothes differently. It's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout","review":"I enjoy the 30 Day Shred, it provides a good workout. If it alternated between 2 different workouts rather than the same each day I would have rated it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Trainer!","review":"Love biggest loser, and Jillian! This workout is not too long, but effective. It has a variety of levels to progress to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout!","review":"This is a very good workout for those short on time. Jillian tries to give you what you need in 30mins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think 9th Grade Gym Class","review":"I was very hopeful when I purchased this video. I have the other Biggest Loser video's featuring Bob, and I LOVE THEM. Fast, effective and well worth the time and effort. I am not going to say this workout wouldn't work but it's jumping jacks, push ups, \\"butt kicks\\" and jumping rope (no rope required). Exactly like we did in 9th grade gym class. If this keeps you motivated go for it but I need something a little more inspiring to dedicate my time too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kills your knees","review":"I did the level one for 10 days and my knee began to ache around day 6/7 and thought it would wear off and just needed extra stretching. Fast forward to level 2, day 2 KILLER knee, popping sounds, etc, can barely move around. I am a runner and average weight at 110 lbs (average 10-12 miles/week) and never had any knee issues. I attributed it to the lunges in level 2, but perhaps it is the jumping jacks, not sure. I am going to stick to running and try the ab workout dvd instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Video but not really \\"30 days\\"","review":"When I purchased this video I thought it was going to take me through 30 days of different workouts. However, it is simply 3 different levels of workouts that you are supposed to change yourself when you feel you are ready to move on. If she was going to do it that way, she should have done 4 so you have a different work out each week at least. It's typical Jillian style of she shows you then walks around to the other people doing the exercises. Generally it is a good DVD to fill in the holes of going to the gym, but I'm not sure if I would say this is going to get you in shape in 30 days since you may get bored before the end of the month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome but tough","review":"I have had this video for a month and if I was consistent like 5-6 days a week I would have lost 20 pounds. I still have not gotten to level 2 because I have weak upper arm strength but I did try it once and it was about twice harder than the first one. This work-out is really effective but it pretty tough. There is a little bit too much wait to get to the main menu that you can't skip(I just finish getting my stuff ready). An overall great work-out video but so far have not felt an after burn and I give it all I got."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"I was pretty sceptical to work out from a dvd for only 20 minutes but this dvd is so worth the money. It kicks your but and you will definately feel your body changing when you wake up the next morning. Killer workout *thumbs up*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes You Sweat!","review":"It really warms up your body and keeps your heart rate pumping; you are constantly moving. There is no way you can't lose weight with the three sessions selected on this dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"it makes you sweat...","review":"Im on day 4 on the shred work out, and is great! I like level 2..level 1 after a few days is too easy, and level 3 is too hard (for me) , in four days I feel my body becoming stronger and is eager to keep on..Im not into excercising but this video makes you want to wait for tomorrow for your next session...Jillian is a great instructor...I highly recommend this video....In 20 minutes you sweat like you was working out for about an hour...Jillian sure knows what she is doing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"I love it! My husband too :) oh, I use it, and my husband enjoys the results , lol ! I used to go to gym before, but after having baby, there is no time to leave the house. So only opportunity is exercise at home. Only after first week using the DVD my hubby said that my butt got firmer , LOL! I'm using second level now and I feel my body is getting stronger and leaner.I got this DVD only to get my body stronger and leaner, because 6 month ago I gave birth to my baby and I lost the baby weight already :)Overall, great DVD, but I am not sure if it is possible to lose all the weight it says, because I'm 5'7 and weight 122 lb ( same as pre-baby), so I don't need to loose too much weight, only to gain strength and get my belly and bottom back in shape....Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoa Baby!!!!!!!","review":"I got mine last night - did it this morning and let me tell you - this is some workout! Yes the moves are basic and yes the workouts are only 20 minutes, but I guarantee you will be sweating like you worked out 60 minutes! I am looking forward to the results, and I know that Jillian will get me there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Workout","review":"As someone who is in pretty decent shape, Jillian put me to SHAME. I love the Biggest Loser, and especially admire Jillian for her training techniques. I hadn't bought any of her DVDs before because of the mixed reviews and the necessary equipment. For this work out, all that is necessary is a pair of hand weights.A bit skeptical of the three leveled work outs, I started with Level 1, just to get a \\"feel.\\" Well, within 5 minutes, I was yelling at the television for some relief. The next day I was so sore. My five pound weights felt like 50s. While the workouts were about 25 minutes each, I definitely felt like I got a workout. Totally recommended this one for a booty kicking fun time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very surprised!","review":"I bought the DVD thinking for such a great price why not try it. I have been wanting to lose some weight ever since I had my daughter. It's great that the workouts only take 20 mins because that means I have no excuse to not do it . Everyone has 20 min. I went into it thinking I was just going to get into shape and I was pleasantly surprised to see my body changing. So far I have lost 9lbs and I am on day 13!!! I highly recommend this to anyone! Very pleased that I bought it! Just remember to push yourself and stick with it! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This is actually my second purchase of this DVD. I used it so much, I wore it out. Jillian Michael's has a great 3-2-1 system that gives you a maximum workout in a short amount of time. I highly recommend this DVD for beginner to advanced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Work-out in very short time","review":"This is a great workout dvd. I consider myself a very fit individual. I used to run daily, but for various reasons I can no longer excercise outdoors. On top of that I have two little boys that take up all of my time so I really am short on time. I was very hesitant about a 20 minute workout because most have you workout then rest and are half filled with stretching and taking your pulse. This was a solid 20 minutes of kickin your butt and no rest. I actually felt like I worked out - and worked out hard. I vary the levels and mix it up with my elliptical. My only complaint (which I think was mentioned in other reviews) is there is a lot of talking and general stuff before you get to the main menu that you can't forward through. If you are like me, and really in a time crunch, I recommend starting the dvd, then get changed into your clothes, get out your workout gear. By that time the main menu will be up and you can start.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, this was hard!","review":"Jillian Michaels - 30 Day ShredI just did the level 1 workout for this DVD and it was SO hard!!! I hate to exercise but really want to get in shape for a friend's wedding this summer, so I purchased this along with one of the Biggest Loser DVDs. Wow. I was dying after the first 6-minute circuit and it only got harder for the last 12 minutes! Jillian really packs it in--you have got to be motivated or pretty fit to stick with it the whole 20 minutes. But, like she says, you have to work to get results.I thought this was a really good workout for people who are serious about getting fit. Make sure you have a soft surface (like a mat) and some light dumbells before starting this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good DVD","review":"I really enjoyed this workout, I workout about six times a week for an hour and thought I would find this workout super easy (especially the level 1) I was pleasantly surprised that it is difficult and incorporates activities I have been neglecting in my workouts (like push ups). My only qualm is that it is only 20 minutes (at least there are three 20 minute workouts so you can theoretically do more)but I would prefer a 45 minute workout. All in all though I think this workout is really good, though I will do it in conjunction with about 45 mins on the elliptical just to get the calorie burn up. I would say that the difficulty is on par (if not slightly more difficult) with most of the turbojam workouts. I would definitely recommend this DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kicks your butt!","review":"I really have enjoyed this video. I am not very fit at all so level one (there are three total) kicks my butt! I honestly have a struggle just to make it through the entire 20 min workout. But it is a good struggle. I feel refreshed after her workout, though tired as anything. If you are serious about wanting to get into shape than this is a GREAT video to try. Each level is 20 minutes in length and gives you a great workout. She incorperates arms, legs, abs, strength, and cardio in each level to give a total body workout. She also keeps you motivated and with each move only being done for about 30 seconds it keeps you from getting tired of doing the same move for too long. I have only done this video about 4-5 times and I am already seeing a big difference in my endurance."},{"rating":"2","title":"All reviews right on!","review":"After finding out about this video from the Wedding Bee I decided to look into it because all the brides were highly recommending. I was blown away when I got on Amazon and there were so many reviews and all mostly really positive. I was still a little skeptical but ordered the video anyway.I did my first workout this morning and it was TOUGH! I have been exercising 5-6 days per week for eight weeks doing basically the same things in my workouts- cardio, strength, abs and rotating all of that. I have to admit this one on Level 1 was tough. I plan to do it through the week and move up to Level 2 next week...we'll see. I still plan to do my regular afternoon workout with my trainer and do this video at home in the mornings.I am only 4 weeks away from my wedding so I hope Jillian can help whip me into a little better shape! I will try and keep you posted!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great dvd, great work outs","review":"It never ceases to amaze me when I will get a DVD, master it and think well nothing else will be hard, then I order another DVD and wow it is hard. This DVD is not for getting a six-pack, its not for getting huge muscles, its for burning calories and YES IT DOES, I have been exercising moderately for a good long while and this DVD on level 1 does make me sweat a good bit, I like it, she is not rude or nasty and this is very effective. Doing this is a little hard on the knees but with taking care of them and doing proper stretching you will get over that issue really quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective","review":"I bought this dvd after the birth of my second child. My first and second workout, I couldn't really keep up. By the third workout, I could tell a huge difference in my stamina. I do think its effective, but I do think its easy to injure yourself if your form isn't correct or if you try to overdo it.I really like that its pretty short. With two small kids, 20 minutes is perfect. I do wish each part of each circuit had a countdown timer, but that's just personal preference. Jillian keeps saying that this will replace hours in the gym. We will see..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unskippable intro","review":"Others have said it, but the intro is extremely annoying. It turns a 20-minute routine into 25 minutes. Someone wasn't thinking when they made this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This work out is a kick butt tough work out. For only 20 minutes you really feel the burn. I have just started but am already seeing the changes. I look forward to doing it everyday. Jillian is straight forward and makes you work. Like she says you want to get your money's worth and you do for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't hesitate- Buy it","review":"I have been looking for a total body workout solution for awhile. I thought my answer would be a rowing machine or something like that. Then I came across 30 Day Shred and for less than 5 bucks and no shipping cost or time at all I was working out with this GREAT program. I'm a stay at home - work at home mom of 2 with a busy husband and don't have time for long work outs. But since I work at home sitting at the computer most days I really needed something with cardio plus strength training. This workout is something I can fit into a 1/2 hour (including a shower!) and it kicks my butt! If you do this daily or even every other day, you will see results. I'm so happy I found this- Saved me hundreds on expensive equipment."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't stop sweating","review":"I was looking for a short workout for those mornings that I don't have time for the gym. Since I bought this DVD about a month ago, I have been to the gym only twice. I really love it. I really feel challenged and that's just on level 1.I have two complaints only. One is that it takes forever to get to the menu. This is not unique to this DVD, but it drives me crazy. The second thing is that Jillian can over explain things. The producers obviously realized this and you can select to just hear the music, but then you really have to watch the video. Anyhow, those are my only complaints and their minor.Now if I can just find a 20 minute yoga workout that I like..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Break a REAL sweat!","review":"I have a whole library of workout dvd's and there are only a handful of ones I like and keep in my workout rotation. I don't even write reviews but I have to say that Jillian's 30 Day Shred is now my #1! You are constantly moving from one move to another and she is there to guide you the whole time. She is not cheesy nor annoying in her instructions to you and there is no fancy choreography footwork, just basic intense cardio, strength training and abs circuit training. You work at your own pace and increase the weights when you feel like the routine is getting easy. Once you have mastered the first level, you go to level 2 and then 3. You will certainly be pleased with the workout.I thought that only 20 min wasn't enough and I wasn't going to get a good workout. I was WRONG! I couldn't stop sweating and was only motivated to hang in there by Jillian. I highly recommend this dvd for beginners to advanced since there is a challenge for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME WORKOUT","review":"I have been exercising for many years and this workout is really tough. It is definitely not for beginners and it is a little harsh on your knees. I have been doing it for 4 weeks and already see results. However, it is not the type of workout you can do every day. I do it every other day and run 3 miles on the days off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful DVD!","review":"I've tried a couple workout DVDs in the past and didn't think they were very fun or effective. However, this DVD is great! After the very first try I could already feel my muscles complaining. It has 3 different levels-- about 20 minutes each. I've only done level 1 so far but it's so much fun already-- fun in the way that you know it's working because you can FEEL it, but it's not so complicated that you feel like giving up not long after starting. Jillian is a great trainer; she's supportive and encouraging the whole way through while at the same time she's very strict about the routine.I think this DVD is a wonderful addition to anyone's collection :) It's made me want to try out her others!"},{"rating":"2","title":"killer workout","review":"I couldn't believe that a 20 minute workout could kick my butt but this one proves it. The only downside is that Jillian does not suggest what weight to use. I have been using 3 pound hand weights and that's about the max I would suggest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jillian Michaels 30 day shred","review":"The video is tough but has easy to learn moves. The instructor is always talking and encouraging you. I could sure feel my muscles the next day, it felt good."},{"rating":"2","title":"More hardcore than I expected... in a good way!","review":"I've seen Jillian on The Biggest Loser a few times, so I decided to try this workout. She gives me the verbal butt-kicking I need to stay motivated! The DVD is great -- I started as a beginner on the first level and within a week I was onto the second level. It really makes you sweat and get a much harder workout than you would expect from such a short routine. I highly recommend this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Butt Kicker","review":"I just started this DVD today. I don't have a lot of time because I am a nurse that works 60 hours per week and has four children.I rate this 4/5 stars only because I think it is actually too hard for a beginner and it should maybe start with a level even lower than it does. I'm not fat but am very untone and need work. I'm starting today weighing 136 lbs, we'll see what I weigh every 10 days, i'll be eating a 1200 calorie diet as well. I've been done for 40 minutes and am still shaking and in pain. Michelle"},{"rating":"1","title":"LOTS OF JUMPING!","review":"There are lots of jumping jacks and back kicks. If you are big busted or have knee issues, be forewarned. On the positive, it is concise and easy to follow along. She is motivational."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth the money!","review":"I bought this DVD after being a fan of the Biggest Loser, and Jillian definitely delivers. Even though each workout is only 20 minutes, I'm always dripping with sweat by the time it's over. Prior to getting this DVD, I had already lost 50 pounds (less than 40 more to go), so I was at a pretty decent fitness level by the time I started 30 Day Shred. That said, I wouldn't really recommend this DVD for someone who is new to working out. If you're already at an average/intermediate fitness level, this will definitely add some spice to your routine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I had my doubts about ordering this video, but thought I could add it as a supplement to my regular workouts. I do a bit of cardio first, maybe 1/2 hour on the bike, a walk or a X-country ski and then do this and it just kicks my butt. I almost didn't start at level 1, but am glad I did. Now I am alternating between the two and haven't even made it to level 3 yet and still feel like I'm getting a great workout. If you want to work out with weights, but have limited time, this is a super workout!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout video..","review":"It's been 3wks of workout and I could tell the differnce, this is a good workout video..your body may be a in pain the first week but its worth it, this is a much have..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This","review":"I bought the 30 Day Shred on Instant Video- which I love because I can workout in either my living room or bedroom without having to transfer a DVD back and forth. I really have enjoyed the workouts so far- it's been about 3 weeks. I have already noticed some toning in my legs and arms.. unfortunately it's my tummy that needs the toning the most :( I definitely recommend this workout for anyone who wants a great workout without spending tons of money for a gym membership or spending too much time at the gym. I love how Jillian keeps me motivated throughout the workouts- she's pretty inspiring. And I have to say that if Anita's abs don't push you to keep working out then I don't know what else could!?! That girl is ripped!! I'm planning on purchasing the 6-week abs in addition to this workout. I absolutely LOVE Jillian :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I have been looking for a compact, efficient, maximun result workout that I can't say no to.

For those of you who have been working out for years and you are looking for a challenge this dvd will do. Each level (there are 3) amounts to about 27min., but you will feel like you have been working out for an hour.

I don't even like Jillian Michaels, but she is a great motivator. I'm over 50 and in OK shape, but I had not worked out in a few years so I started out slow. It is so much fun and hard. I'm still on level 1, but at least I can get through the entire level 1. I can move up a level or add heavier weights now. I add a little warm up because her warm up is only 2 minutes and I don't feel that's enough. I also add more stretches at the end, but that is just my personal preference. I can't believe how much better I feel after only 30 minutes a day. Buy it, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer","review":"Just started this program yesterday.OMG!! I am exhausted. not sure were its going but so far so good. I like that she goes between strength and cardio moves. I defintely build up a sweat. I do this program every morning then go for a walk.

I love Jillians way, she is very tough but in a good way. She keeps you motivated. Other reviews stated that her voice was annoying but it is way better to listen to her so that you can focus on your fourm and not the tv screen. This video is a short full body workout, and is quite effective. I can't wait till the end of the 30 days to put on my GAP skinny jeans :)I am starting over today because I missed 2 days after being in the hospital with my sister after the birth of her first born. I will be giving this to her when she is well enough to handle it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout, Annoying Format","review":"I really like the workouts presented here, especially that they're only about 20min long each. To me, that's the whole point of this DVD, which brings me to the reason I'm not giving it 5 stars: there's about 7 or 8 minutes of promo stuff in the beginning that you cannot skip. Literally, you can't skip to the menu to get past the ad (it's basically for the Biggest Loser TV show). If you're like me, you don't want to waste your time watching that over and over again, so I just start the DVD playing while I do something else for awhile. Every time I forget to queue it up, though, I'm irritated. Pain in the butt.The workout itself is a pain in the butt, too, though, which is great. =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"wear good shoes","review":"This is my first time doing aerobics.

I see signs of abs and my abs HURT right now...today was my first day on level three.I have lost about 2\\" between my waist, hips and thighs and have only lost 2 or 3 pounds but I was thin when I started.My body is tightening up big time...Jillian chatters a lot and her profanity is not necessary for the work out. Swearing might not bother some but I don't care for it especially if my kids are in the room listening/watching mommy huff and puff.She promises results and you will get them if you stay true to the work out. I don't know where the diet system she talks about it...I suppose you could lose a significant amount of weight if you were on it...it doesn't appear to be on the dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"short and effective","review":"I love doing these workouts when I can't run because it's pouring outside. Also a great way to get back into working out if you have stopped for a while. It's short and effective. I'm on level 2 now and it's definitely much harder than level 1. They may look easy, but it's not. These workouts mostly use your own body and some dumbbells as resistance. If it's not hard enough, then get heavier weights and sink down deeper in the squats and pushups. It is as effective as you make it.The only issue I have with the DVD is the same as everyone else's, you can't fast-forward through the introductions. Adds an extra 5 minutes to the work-out because of that every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shred & Tighten","review":"From day one I felt like my body was tightening.

I used to work out at the gym anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours. With this video, I am feeling the same results from the 25 minute workout. I absolutely love it. For all of the people saying that this video is hard on their knees, it's because they are doing the workouts wrong. Jillian reminds you many times throughout the video how to do the workouts correctly so that you are not damaging your knees. If you do the workouts as she instructs, you will have no problems. This video is definitely worth the money hands down."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome workout","review":"This is amazing and it gives you results if you keep up. Don't get lazy and act smart.

You will be shaped!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Will Kick Your Body into Shape!","review":"If you do this video every day for at least 30 days you will absolutely notice a difference! You'll have to buy 5lb weights separately, don't be like me and pretend you don't need the weights at first- the weights make the difference! This video is great for cardio, weight training, and ab work. Delivers the promised results if you have enough discipline to work out every day at home for 20 minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"No nonsense workouts","review":"This is a good addition to my workout collection. Jillian crams a lot into just twenty minutes. With three levels to choose from, there is lots of variety. Great for days you have no time to work out. Very easy to follow. Would be good for men too."},{"rating":"2","title":"We all have 20 minutes to spare","review":"This DVD is tough, but gets results. There are 3 workouts - 20 minutes each. Each get progressively harder. Only need free weights and a mat if working out on hard floors. The main menu takes a long time to get through so get dressed while it's loading. Have water and a towel close by, but stick with it and love the results!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!","review":"This workout makes my muscles beg for mercy but for twenty minutes I can get through. Twenty minutes is all I have as a mom of an infant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Total Body Workout","review":"I enjoy this DVD very much. I can get through this one without feeling like I'm killing myself but still feel as though I've had a good workout. I workout with this DVD between my workout with her other DVD \\"Killer Buns\\" because I get a little break. I like working out for 20 minutes and still feel as though I've done something effective. You get to choose how hard you want it too with 3 progressive workouts. My only complaint is that the DVD doesn't allow me to skip past her introduction at the beginning. So I have to go and do something for a few minutes until I can click on the workout menu. I'm happy to say that I can skip forward on the Killer Buns workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jillian Michaels-30 Day Shred","review":"I really like this product and it is a great workout. I ordered this DVD because I don't have a lot of time during the day to workout, but I want/need to get back into shape. Level 1 is pretty easy for me but did provide a little bit of a sweat. Level 2 is tough and I am sweating up a storm by the end. I haven't reached Level 3 yet. My only problem with this program is that there is no diet suggested to follow while participating in this workout. You are supposed to lose 20 pounds and I have yet to lose one. I have great eating habits even before starting this, I am trying to cut down on certain things but don't know what else to do.All around it's a great workout and I feel better already, just wish there was diet suggestion along with the exercise."},{"rating":"2","title":"You are well on your way to being shredded","review":"I've finished day ten of level one and what a difference from day one. At the start I had to modify the moves I couldn't do or I knew would give me knee pain. IE I did touch steps instead of full jumping jacks, alternated my feet instead of skipping rope with both feet off the ground, watched my knee positions with the lunges. Didn't do the workout day after day, let my muscles rest. But by the end I was doing the unmodified moves, except for those darn military push-ups, but given time it will come.By using the knowledge I already had on proper form, remedial exercising and just listening to what my body could do BUT not making excuses when I was just feeling lazy I feel I got a lot from this DVD. I would recommend it to others with the warning to use exercise commonsense and listen to their bodies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vickifivekids","review":"This dvd is amazing. I am a mother of 5 and have been working out for about 5 years now. I was starting to turn into the cardio queen, getting bored with my routine, in a rut and not pushing myself. My body stopped changing and I was just maintaining. That was not good seeing as I am still 15 lbs overweight and need more toning. After watching biggest loser I have become a fan of Jillian. I decided to order her tape in order to lose the last 15 lbs and tone up. I am on day 10 of doing this tape and I can already see a change in my body. I was amazed. I started with level 1 and moved to level 2 after about 8 days. Level 2 is really hard for me and I am sure that I will be on level 2 for at least 3 weeks until I master it. I can't wait to see the changes in my body after 1 month. I doubt that I will lose 20 lbs but will be happy if I lose 10 plus more toning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jillian Michaels - 30 Day Shred","review":"I didn't feel that I got a very good work out with this one compared to some of her others. This one is shorter though so this could have something to do with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense but short","review":"This workout is very intense, but it's only twenty minutes so I don't feel like I'm getting the results I could be if I were exercising longer. I realize that is part of the appeal. However, though my butt is kicked by this, I feel like I need to put in more time than twenty minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"motivating....","review":"I used to play team sports 2-3 times a week and do some form of cardio the other days...well that was 4 years ago and 25 pounds ago.I now want to shed/shred that weight and so far this DVD has held my interest...thanks Jillian."},{"rating":"2","title":"good workout...","review":"definitely worth the money. the workouts get you moving and keep you moving. you will definitely see results!"}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],C={key:0},N={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",B,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",C,"See more"))],8,M)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(x,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-2cc9470e"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/43.md","filePath":"guide/43.md"}'),R={name:"guide/43.md"},G=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{L as __pageData,G as default};
