Unfortunately, it was stolen from the back of my car in college. I've always had an eye out for a suitable replacement, and when I saw this bag and read the great reviews I thought I'd finally found the one. Overall it's a fine piece - sturdy leather, seems well constructed, and has decent pockets for organizing. The problem is the size. As a 5'6\\", slim-built woman, this bag really overwhelmed my frame. I felt like I was wearing a seat cushion on the end of that strap!

Even after a big personnel shift, they have developed their sound into an impressive tapestry- a mature step forward from \\"Teaching the History of Teaching Geography\\". Taking full advantage of the studio, Pele incorporates piano, vibraphone, keyboards, banjo, and multiple guitar tracks to create an amazingly full sound where each listen can reveal a new theme. Elephant is an unusual title for this album because it shifts so nimbly and subtly through each track with the occasional triumphant, anthemic finish, but forget the irony, this is a thoughtful, complex, beautiful album.(For those that were able to chase down copies of Chris Rosenau and Jon Mueller's Collection of Colonies of Bees, several of those movements are beautifully transformed into complete songs here.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fine CD","review":"This cd is quite the mix of sounds. In a turbulent but beautiful combination of post-rock sounds, this ablum continues the experimentalness of their previous ablums.

Seeking a group decision I took it to work where 20 other people, ages 20 to 45, kept looking at me asking why should they be tortured listening to my mistake purchase. I can take the Euro/Techno sound but give me a little variety. I swear they used only one maybe two pads on the drum kit, no bass drum. I would also say they only used about a quarter of the whole keypad of the synth. The lack of any muscians( check the last page of the inner sleeve, only the last song used guitars), proved to be too much as I had to remove this after about seven songs. I kept thinking of Cher's \\"Believe\\", but most of the songs on this CD are slower in tempo and beat.

The rest of the album is very trancy, dubby monotonic songs. Maybe her voice is gone and she has to use 'gimmic' synths to make it. I don't know. But it is far below her standards.

It is strange that a CD that started so well ended up so badly. I listened to the entire thing and had to hit the forward button because there was no way to make it through song #4 it was so awful. The song Push was about as pleasant as a police siren. I Love New York was just mostly her hollaring \\"get off my street\\" about a hundred times. Issac sounded like classical music speeded up with an Arab guy singing in the background and ends with him uttering something that didn't make sense about the gates of heaven and \\"that's what it's about\\" It is a weird CD and not worth the money.

Boy was I wrong! I am happy I went off of the other reviews on Amazon and by what others around me were saying by going out and purchasing it, this CD is truly terrific!

She is an over-rated mediocre singer.Come to think of it,her material always was production based.The voice always boring and thin, helped by electronica.Her acting is worse.The modern world of materialism and banality created her .(material girl). She has masqueraded as Dietrich Monroe and che Guevera,eager to distract us from her empty shell.Her videos from the 80's are her pinnacle.They were her greatest achievement.However, this cd shows she has to go backward to get attention,and hype.Kabbalah and fish-nets don't mix.Cher doesn't have to worry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"Wow, I couldn't believe how bad this was after all the hype and great reviews! I own a lot of Madonna's earlier work, most notably the Immaculate Collection. Now, that's dance music. This is boring, droning, repetitive, mechanical and monotonous. It reminds me of a broken record, every song blends into the next until 45 minutes later, you realize how bored and tired of the whole affair you are. It ain't disco folks, it's \\"Techno\\" and it stinks. Anyone who calls this a return to form or even suggests it's disco music is either under 21 years old or needs the wax removed from their ears!

It was a bitter disappointment after her really great album \\"American Life,\\" which had great tunes and great lyrics. \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" hearkens back to the bland and boring style of \\"Ray of Light\\" without the benefit of interesting lyrics. In fact, many of the lyrics sound like they were borrowed from other Madonna albums or even other people's songs. The first few songs are interesting, but the album quickly becomes repetitious and dull. You would do better to listen to the album a few songs at time (like in sets of three or four) to avoid being bored. If you are looking for an album to prove to you what a great entertainer Madonna is, steer clear of this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what a let-down","review":"DO NOT...i repeat: DO NOT buy this cd if you have any real appreciation for good music! I saw the video for \\"hung up\\" and it was hypnotic and catchy. I loved it. I am a huge fan of synth and electronica of all sorts and I was pretty jazzed when I heard the single with its very electro style. I still love \\"hung up\\" but the rest of the cd is utter trash. I am not usually some one who needs really powerful lyrics to like a song (although it's always a plus). But in this case, the lyrics are so shallow and vapid that they just can't be ignored. The music for the rest of the songs is not near catchy enough to overcome their shortcomings. I was thoroughly disappointed with this cd and i strongly suggest anyone to think twice before purchasing this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Set the Dance Floor on Fire","review":"I just downloaded my pre-order of Confessions on a Dance Floor from iTunes and after the first spin I have to say, \\"Oh My God.

Sonically, it's overly digitized 70's sound with some electronica thrown in for ethereal accent. Lyrically, it's as mature as Ray of Light and as seductive as Erotica with a hint of rebellion a la Like a Prayer. Production is perfect and Madonna sounds like she's at the top of her game (as always).Definitely recommended for Madonna fans (duh!) and dance music junkies out there.

Madonna said she wants people to 'jump out of their seat' to this new album and it really makes you want to. A non-stop album takes you through a plethora of feel-good highs and makes you want to rush to the club, get the glitter ball cranked up and spin with your arms outstretched on the dance floor.

Madonna continues to be a strong contender in pop music and I will continue to purchase her records. This cd is one of her best. Every songs segues into the next so seamlessly. I commend Stuart Price for his valued and highly danceable work. Madonna you have done it again!!!! Congratulations for always amazing me."},{"rating":"2","title":"May be her best yet","review":"If you enjoy Madonna you will love this collection. It is clearly Madonna returning to what made her the most successful and most influential Dance/Pop female singer. The entire production is pure fun. Catchy up beat dance beats. Premixed for your dancing and partying pleasure. Some silly some comical some serious lyrics but all danceable. The heavy sampling is enjoyable and a nod to historical dance floor favorites. The departure from heavy spirituality and religous themes is truly refreshing. I love this collection. I can't get enough of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna Forever","review":"Yes, this CD is the real deal, when i first heard it i was sitting in the living room, my feet on the dusty carpet, then i started playing the CD, the music began, i got up and couldn't control my feet, i was dancing like a mad on the carpet, the room was filled of dust, i wasn't able to see anything, i wasn't knowing where i was, that was such an experience!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna is back on TOP!","review":"Great album.

Madonna truly is an artist that gets better with time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confessions on a Dance Floor","review":"Confessions on a Dance Floor~ Madonna is Madonna's best release since the groundbreaking album Ray of Light. Madonna was the first artist to get permision to sample ABBA and this in itself is quite remarkable. Madonna has created here an astounding album with so many gems that it is hard to pick, but if I have to then I would say that my favorite track is Forbidden love (gotta love the vocoders, and being a huge fan of early 80's synthpop this was quite obvious that I should like this track). The book-let is really nice and liner notes are quite informative. I easily give this album 5 stars and I can not wait for her next album which I think might be realesed 2007 or 2008."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm so in love with this album I just don't get tired of it","review":"I purchase this cd when it first came out november 15 2005 and since then I can not stop listing to it I hear it every day and it was like yesterday I ran to the store right after work and got it madonna your the best thank you for a great year to me it's my favorit cd. you should buy it if you like dance music I recomend"},{"rating":"2","title":"lets dance","review":"This is a great cd with nice new sounds or like other people call it ''future disco''.I love all the songs but my favorites are hung up, sorry, get together, jump and forbidden love.

I have been a fan of Madonna ever since I saw \\"Desperately Seeking Susan\\" as an impressionable 12 year old (I had my first cigarette outside the movie theatre that day).Since then I have liked most of Madonna's stuff, it's always different. This album has high energy, good dancing music which is great for parties, and great for dancing to.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BILLBOARD MAGAZINE review can't get better!","review":"The diva has returned to the disco. The swirling, throbbing and altogether great \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" is Madonna's nonstop ecstatic cabaret. The 12-song set takes some of its musical cues from the likes of Giorgio Moroder and Richard X, though it remains thoroughly and uniquely a work of Madonna, who never gets lost in the dizzying beats and dense production. The tunes focus on self-discovery (\\"How High\\"), enlightenment (\\"Future Lovers,\\" \\"Get Together\\"), empowerment (\\"Jump\\") and love (\\"Push\\"). There are also fluffier cuts: a rocking dance anthem in \\"I Love New York,\\" the ABBA-sampling lead single \\"Hung Up\\" and the springy \\"Sorry.\\" In the wake of 2003's dead-on-arrival \\"American Life,\\" \\"Confessions\\" is a welcome return to form for the Queen of Pop. -Keith Caulfield"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I never received the cd \\"Confessions on the Dance floor\\".

I loved the songs....that is, until Miss Diva started singing.I'm sorry-I don't mean this to sound like a rant but frankly I'm so tired of people telling me that Madonna is some sort of musical genius because she really isn't. I guarantee you that if you are looking for insightful lyrics or complexity...this is definetely not the album for you.

Unfortunately, on this album, she does not even hide her blatant borrowing and it seems she is running out of steam. She borrows ideas from ABBA, The Jacksons, Kylie, The Police, GoldFrapp, and Donna Summer. She even borrows ideas from her former glorious self. Part of Madonna's problem is she is relying too heavily on Euro Pop. Since Ray of Light, Madonna has used Euro Pop to mask other things she has been lacking. What's lacking are passion and energy in her voice and meaningful and creative lyrics. Clearly, Madonna at 47 is at a crossroad...she needs to make a decision on continuing to be Queen of Pop or just another Euro Pop female singer. Having said that, this cd is not bad but it is not to the level that we expect from Queen Madonna."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"This album is so nice!From the opener Hung Up to the closure Like It Or Not you will love it!!!!!!!Let Madonna hit the dance floors (and your CD player!!) once again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worldwide Success!","review":"Congratulations Madonna for another worldwide success that your latest CD is bringing.

That happened after I presented it to my friend, during my trip to Europe. Unfortunately, it doesn't make any sense to re-do the present - shipping to Europe is more expensive then the disk. But it is pity to understand that even LISENCED brand new sealed disks do not have a proof of quality as it used to be from Amazon. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"It was what I expected...","review":"This cd from Madonna is okay...if you are a fan of techno music.

I just like Hung Up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your $13.49 Madge does not need it","review":"It used to be that Madonna would release something, do something shocking and 2 million people would run out and buy the new release. Give this a listen at Napster, Yahoo music or wherever, and save your $13.49 unfortunatley there is nothing here worth hearing twice so you dont need to buy it. It is not retro it isnt even re-hash, it is confusion of genres at best with an attempt of trying to differentiate the same old thing yet again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Album of the Year this is..NOT!","review":"I am a Dance Fan and serious Lover of Groove Armada..Noow, this stuff is just plain Crap..Do Not waste your money..It sounds just like something made in a basement. Hung Up is a decent song, but like most are saying, I to am outraged at the Blatant stealing of the ABBA sample..Shame on you madonna..your throne has not only been abdicated, but you are an 80's foot note now."},{"rating":"1","title":"madonna has lost her edge","review":"I bough this CD with the hopes that it would be great. After all, the two singles that came out on the radio (Sorry, Hung Up) were awesome. The rest of the songs, though????? Not so much. I was incredibly disappointed to find that those two songs were the only ones I liked. And, I already can hear those for free. The other songs were just boring beats and lyrics that were either spoken word (weird) or when sung, they weren't sung well. I have only listened to it all the way through once, and don't even remember where I put it after. That was a few weeks ago....Needless to say, I haven't looked for it. Seems to me that, just like her concerts, this CD was way over-priced. Not worth it at all. Buy the single"},{"rating":"1","title":"A NASTY FORGERY","review":"As it has been described, this album is NOT ONLY a mixture of influences of artists such as Giorgio Moroder, Donna Summer, ABBA and even KYLIE MINOGUE. Actually, it is a lackluster attempt to resurrect a career of a MATERIAL SINGER whose steps have gone nowhere after the mid-90s; acting like a copycat and a GRIFTTER is remembering us how huge 70s and 80s electronic performers and producers used to be. This album shows us a total scarcity of originality but if you are a MADONNA die-hard, deaf fan you should download this one through a p2p engine and save your money from SCAM"},{"rating":"1","title":"Her worst album","review":"There were no hit singles from \\"Confessions On A Dancefloor\\" and that shows how good the album will be if the singles are bad. I didn't like any of the singles from \\"Confessions...\\" as they weren't very mainstream. Madonna's new release \\"Hard Candy\\" is a much better album. If you want to buy a Madonna album check out \\"Hard Candy.\\" \\"Confessions...\\" just isn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One hit album, really!","review":"Don't be fooled by all the rave reviews from her rabid fans. Critics that find this album as good as \\"Ray of Light\\" have listened to Ray of Light lately. Nothing comes close to the freshness and exuberance of \\"Hung up\\" on \\"Confession\\", not by a mile. There a few mild hooks smattered throughout the disk but not enough to save this train wreck. I'm not sure what went so wrong with this effort, could be the lack of variety in the (over)production or simply the laziness of our equestrian wanna be pop star. I played \\"Confessions\\" for a good ten days to give it a fair shot but weeks later I forgot I had a copy, bad sign. I hear she is fearless when riding, apparently not a good thing when riding a horse or trusting to much in your producer. One star for the great Hung Up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you know how long I've been waiting for this?!","review":"I'm a 28 year old Madonna fan, her music has always been in the background of my life. It took \\"Ray of light\\" to make me realize just how much of a fanatic I am.When I first heard \\"Hung up\\" I got chills, I loved it!I have to say after listening to this album that it is one of my favorites already! I love the album, I like every song, and I don't feel the need to skip over any of the songs.A few of my favorites already:Hung upSorryForbidden LovePush"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wanna Dance?","review":"Madonna is back after 2 years with her new album Confessions Of A Broken Heart. I bought it today and, if you like to dance, you'll like this album. It's really techno with a lot of computer sounds. There's a couple of soungs I don't like but I definitly enjoy listening to it. It makes me wanna dance, and music like that makes you happy when your down so. Welcome back Madonna ! And to everybody, get your copy the fast you can ! It worth it !"},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!","review":"This is a fantastic dance album, and one of the best around, so don't bother with all these negative reviews! Go Maddy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Material Girl's Best albums to date","review":"The fisrt track, 'Hung Up', is fun to dance to and contains the sample of Abba's hit song 'Gimme Gimme, Gimme'.'Get Together' isn't bad and is very romantic, along with 'Future Lovers'.'Sorry' is another great song from the album and does a great job at expressing one's feelings towards their ex who never will change.'I Love New York' is a great song and goes out to all the New Yorks and those who love the city.'Let it Will Be' isn't bad either along with 'Jump' and 'Push'.'How High' is semi-autobiographical of the Material Girl herself and is get to dance to also.'Isaac' with its Middle Eastern influence is another beautiful song from the album.'Like it or Not' clearly makes reference to the story of Adam and Eve and about sin.Overall the album is great for dancing, and confessioning ones feelings about things.Another smash about from the Material Girl indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm going to tell you about this album: IT ROCKS!","review":"If you've read my other Madonna reviews you know where I stand.In my humble opinion, M's last greatest album was ROL. Music was-decent/okay, American Life was -er, uh, not so good. But here on Confessions, she kicks it once again into high gear, Madonna style.There are only a couple fillers on this album and the rest is awesome. This album does not get as much rotation as other M albums, but I do have repeat listens. Perfect for working out or driving through the park or just to chill out with. Confessions does deliver.M put her heart and soul into this one and it shows, even if some of that heart and soul is borrowed: Donna Summer, ABBA, Pet Shop Boys. Doesn't matter, it jams.I wish I could say the same about her latest release Hard Candy, but I can't.The tour for this album is just as awesome as the album, if not more so. This is a must have for Madonna fans, especially if you dig old skool dance and disco sounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahhhhh.","review":"This collection of songs will encase you within the sparkles and glittering melodies.

There's not one single dud in the bunch and it'll be sure to have everyone on the dancefloor. Mixed like a DJ set, all the songs blend seamlessly into the next, but never loose their individual appeal. Those who hate it at first will eventually succumb to it's infectious beats, catchy lyrics, and pulsating aura. Madonna brings us her best work since \\"Ray of Light\\".

IT IS AMAZING! I feel stupid for getting Carrie Underwood it is horrid! For MADONNA I give this grade of A+"},{"rating":"2","title":"She was never really gone ...","review":"People calling this album a comeback are a little mistaken. Madonna never went away. Just because \\"American Life\\" was more low-key than her other albums doesn't mean anything. She was experimenting and unfortunately timing had a bad affect on both her album and her as a person.But, a comeback to her roots it is. People calling this a 'non-dance album' must not have ears is all I have to say. Granted, a couple of the songs might take a few listens, but listen to this album no more than 3 times and you will be hooked, and I mean HOOKED!Purchase this album, you will not be sorry, and for G-d's sake, give it a chance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"surprisingly good","review":"I didn't expect too much on this album because the first single (Hung up) doesn't sounds too creative to me. Turns out that Hung up is just an intro to this album. The mixing is cool. The music are tightly coupled, so there is no reason not to get the whole album. I like this album much more than the last one."},{"rating":"2","title":"this CD is good but","review":"I've played it way too many times and right now it only serves as background music to get my energy levels up. But that's what makes madonna awesome. If you want an album that makes you reflect on life she has albums in her catalogue that do that. If you want an album that liberates you she's the queen of that as well. If you just want to chill and listen to meaningless music with great grooves this album is it. Well done madge!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Dance Confession","review":"From the beginning to the end a true confession of non stop dance beats intertwining and giving you a sense of wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beats are Back!","review":"Madonna's new album, Confessions on a dance floor is very unique. It is like one continuous disco-fest with never ending pulsating beats and vibes. You toes will be tapping for hours after listening to it! I love the idea that Madonna brought to this album, \\"Screw it\\". She was sick of juicy love ballads and wanted a hit album. This CD is stacked full of one hit single after another that is bound to be one of the top selling of this year. \\"Hung Up\\" is probably the best song, but \\"Jump\\" is also one of my favorites. Before this, I would never have even considered buying a Madonna CD, but Confessions is different. It will leave you bobbing your head, tapping your feat, and dancing all night long..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Madonna album ever?","review":"Could this be the best Madonna album since her career started over 23 years ago? I think so. Confessions on a Dance Floor is a gorgeous work of music - swirling synths, disco harmonies, killer hooks. I cannot even explain how electric this album is. It is the kind of album that makes you want to roll down your windows just in order to share good music with everyone else. People are saying Madonna has returned to her roots. And I agree. But this album still manages to carry the world of pop music forward.A track by track review is not even necessary. This entire album deserves your attention. Every track bleeds into the next giving us a nonstop party. If you weren't a fan of Madonna before, I seriously suggest giving her another shot. With this album, she again solidifies her status not only as the Queen of Pop but also as the Queen of Music."},{"rating":"1","title":"madonna","review":"This album has all dance songs. No Ballads. This album reminds me of the 80's. When we were all in track suits and leotards and leg warmers. My favorite track on here is Push.

Never has an album infected my brain with such audio bliss, and caused my body to sway in such abandon.

This album is targeted squarely at Madonna's core audience.... fabulous gentlemen.If you are a Madonna fan, you will love it. If you're not a fan, then why are you reading this anyway?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected better.","review":"Disappointing. Coming from Madonna, I truly expected much more. The dance tracks are generic-sounding. If you're in a club, surrounded by sweaty half-naked people, and partially stoned, the music is fluffy and can/will make you feel good. Sitting at home listening to the CD, you can't help but ask yourself, \\"What the heck went wrong?\\" Only two songs stand out: Jump and Push."},{"rating":"1","title":"TIRED and ENDLESS....","review":"I don't care how big of a Madonna fan any of us can be, this CD is just annoying. Did she phone in the vocals?My partner is however stuck on this CD like Linus to his blanket. He LOVES it. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a Madonna basher. I just don't like this CD. For all it claims to be, \\"Confessions\\" is neither catchy or groundbreaking. The lyrics to most of the songs are brainless and repetitive. C'mon, \\"Ring, ring, ring goes the telephone....\\" The arrangements are a techno nightmare relying mostly on samples of other songs. Like we need to feed ABBA anymore royalties.Better to buy Madonna's early stuff. Now there's an idea... How about making an album sampling her old music and then \\"techno\\" it all up. She wouldn't even have to show up to the recording studio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting because of the artist not the songs","review":"I like the songs hung up and jump... but this album has too many annoyingly bad lyrics .... she needs a producer that wont stand for that crap... if im gonna make an album.. and i have 4 years or whatever to do so... im gonna come up with real songs and not pretend crap lyrics that are embarrassing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Dance Cd from Madonna","review":"When first purchasing this cd, I was a little skeptical, but after the first listen, I was hooked! Great driving music, and although there may not be a lot of substance to this cd, it is a great listen, and well worth the purchase.

What a shame American Life was such a flop....this album is the result of nobody buying that great album! The only catchy song is the one with the Abba sample. Everything else seems like a desperate attempt to get another hit. I don't see the Cure or Robert Smith with any writing credits, but she completely stole the melody and title from the song \\"Just One Kiss\\". I hope the Cure's lawyers hear this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and LOUD--","review":"The best songs on the album in this order are Hung Up, Forbidden Love, How High, and Isaac. This is not an album I'll keep as I just won't listen to it enough.I watched the MTV Europe awards and basically cried after her performance because it was SO GREAT. I couldn't wait for the album and now I'm just terribly disappointed.She's lost the plot and I can't even begin to think what her next move will be. It looks like Carrie Underwood may just knock her off the #1 spot too and that is SO SAD."},{"rating":"1","title":"so-so c.d","review":"The best songs in my opinion are Get Together (because it sounds like vintage Madonna), Future Lovers (the most futuristic song on the album that owes a lot to Donna Summer's I Feel Love), Forbidden Love (yes, it is true Kylie took a lot of ideas from Madonna and on this song Madonna does a reverse), and Sorry (a great bass line from the 70s Jackson). The other songs sound like filters. I do not regret buying this cd...I enjoy it. But while I still listen to Madonna's earlier materials (except for AI)...this album will find its way to my basement in the near future."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Definitely Disco!","review":"While I understand that people love Madonna (I am fond of her) this album is pointless. Tracks 1 - 10 sound like one non-stop song............the same song. Nice stuff - but sounds like it was put together in one night. I'm not saying it was....but it just sounds like it. Someone here posted that 'Disco gets a new lease on life'. I can agree with this statement in that it has a monotonous feel throughout the whole album. Oh well. It definitely is upbeat and 'club-friendly'. Once again the public doesn't need much to impress them.......I give you Madonna's version of 'American Idol'. Nothing more - nothing less - nothing new. Oh - and the one star is because it's Madonna."},{"rating":"1","title":"Madonna Confessions on a Dance Floor [Special Edition]","review":"ok - about the cd - let me tell you that it is one of the best that came out recently and I know it cause my Mum and my Brother likes it and also the guys at work . so nothing more to say than if you have this Cd in your collection - your mornings are much more happier and you go cheery to work .to get it to my house in Israel - it took only 6 Days ! ( 3 workings day ) - that's what you call excellent service !"},{"rating":"1","title":"You Could Call It TRASH MUSIC","review":"Not new about it. This kind of singer do the same thing over and over. Madonna when you will learn? Can you create something new done by yourself? Stop copying and immitating others. This CD is really a piece of TRASH. Digustting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a easy breezy album","review":"I would give 5 stars, but because of her ranting and put downs towards society-She gets a star docked. Other than her talkin like she's better than everyone else, this album is good. Every song is good (even the really cheesy I love NY) and it just makes me want to move. Which is nice because with winter fastly approaching, the depression wanting to sink in...pop in this cd and listen/move my cares away. Nothing deep, just easy breezy feel good fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knock 'em down Mads!!","review":"This album is by far Madonna's best, and the film clips for Hung Up and Sorry are HOT! Nearly every person I know has Confessions in their collection.The Special Edition contains a book with various cool glossy photo's of Mads in her dancing tights, sprawling in different poses on the dance floor. There is also a writing pad included which you wouldn't really want to use if you want to keep it as a collecters item. There is an extra song on this CD called Fighting Spirit, I'd give this song a 7/10.Overall, The album and photo's are definately worth a five star rating. The dance scene in Sydney has never been so thankful!Go Mads, you rock!! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna's best album ever","review":"I am no big fan of Madonna's. Yet I couldn't resist buying this album, and now I can't resist listening to it all over and over. I don't care if this is the sound of the future or else. I love the rhytms, I love the voice, I love the light, inspiring tone of it all. It is fun. It is as simple as that."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Just watch me burn!\\"","review":"Madonna's Confessions on a Dance Floor is a throwback to the days of disco and Madonna's earlier work as a dancefloor queen. Standout tracks include: Hung Up, I Love New York, Let it Will Be, Push, Jump, Forbidden Love, and my favorite Future Lovers. The rest of the tracks hardly do anything for me, kinda boring and repetitive. Her songwriting hasn't been that great since Ray of Light (her greatest achievement yet). I like this album but I don't listen to it as much as her previous albums. But Madonna is a genius and trailblazer so I would buy Confession on a Dance Floor if you like her dance songs. I heard she is going on tour this summer, can't wait. Love her sample of Abba's Gimmie, Gimmie, Gimmie for the track Hung Up, brilliant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd","review":"I've been a fan of Madonna's for years.

Growing up in the 80's with Madonna, Confessions takes me back to musical dance rythyms and tunes that I love listening to.I wish \\"they\\" would release Get Ready To Jump for radio release as this song by far would be perfect for airplay. I love this album. It makes me move. Madonna sounds crystal clear and beautiful as I think she always does.DouglasAtlanta, Georgia USA"},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna's Triumph in Music Yet Again!","review":"Madonna has surprised her fans and shocked others; and this time is no different. Confessions on a Dancefloor is a 'mircacle' in todays age. Mature lyrics, spiritual themes, and yet simplistic and modern. In many ways her growth is relfected in her art. This LP was by far one of her best and like 'wine' she only gets better with age. Here's to Madonna...til next album we meet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have CD of the year!","review":"It's the best album of the year! I'm absolutely in love with every song! If you like great music and like to dance, then this is the CD for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna at her best","review":"This cd is not breaking any new ground or blowing the doors off of the dance music genre, but it is a darn fine pop record and insanely addictive. I can't single out a bad track on it! Yeah some of the lyrics are a bit trite but it is leagues better than some of the crap getting airplay right now. (\\"My Humps\\" comes to mind). It won't disappoint longtime fans and certainly should win her some new ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's back","review":"Just when I was getting so tired of Madonna wearing her Kabbalah bracelets and rapping about Starbucks, she went and made the best dance album I've heard in a long time. It's infectious and catchy. I haven't stopped listening to it since I got it."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the age of singles, Madonna delivers a complete album","review":"I have to first admit that I am a long time Madonna fan and typically enjoy her CDs. This album has met all my expectations and more. Many listeners will enjoy the fact that the songs flow seamlessly into each other (remember when you used to put on a record and just let it play!). No skipping is needed with this album. All the songs have at least one catchy hook that will keep your attention and make you want to dance. As with most pop songs, the lyrics are pretty basic, but you will be able to (and want to) sing along after a few spins. The standout tracks on this album are Jump, Get Together, Sorry, Push and Hung Up. Each song is unique enough to sound fresh and new, but they also summon you back to the 70s and 80s. Future Lovers, I Love NY, How High and Let It Will Be will also be big in dance clubs. The rest of the tracks take some getting used to, but support the overall theme of the album - dance music with a purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"People take this album seriously?","review":"Geez, how could anybody take Madonna serious? I don't, neither should you. This garbage is plastered over every \\"music\\" channel known to man. If her kids weren't such spoiled brats, i'd feel sorry for them. You're getting old Madonna, so is your act, and you're false religious lies. In fact, everything about you should have died long ago. I only give you credit for not dying yet. Nothing about her music is talented. End of story. There is hope though. Back in 1986, when she was around, making music just as bad. A little band called Slayer released the masterpiece \\"Reign in Blood\\" as a slap in the face to mainstream pop. Twenty years later, this Tuesday, Slayer is back to do it again. Christ Illusion will destroy this unworthy piece of trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"This album is pure trash. Madonna is a sell out, plain and simple. Her last album talking bad about policts flopped, so now she is just working with hot producers and making dance music because it is popular, she just wants money. She is a sell out. She can hardly even sing, and she is unoriginal. Most of these dongs aren't even danceable, Madonna you are almost 50, quit acting young and making this crap, it is not even good or enjoyably, SELL OUT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring boring boring","review":"My title says it all, boring boring boring.The same thing over and over again.I think Madonna owes me the amount I spent on this boring cd.I can't imaging why people think this is good music.Mediocre at best.The only good part was borrowed from Abba."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking - this CD only has 1-2 good songs","review":"This CD does not live up to its hype!

I walked into an HMV store during the playing of Hung Up, and it wasn't until halfway through Get Together that I realized I was listening to a new Madonna album. I bought it immediately.\\"Do you believe in love at first sight?\\" Yes, and I also believe Madonna is one of the most talented and creative artists/performers in the history of music. On the heels of the first Kate Bush album in 12 years, to have this classic from Madonna is to be blessed indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"How does she do it again and again?","review":"I am so amazed at how Madonna can still make music after twenty years in the biz.

The album is just all around AMAZING!!!I think even non-Madonna fasn will enjoy it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic album!!","review":"Just bought it and had my first listen to it. FANTASTIC is all I can say. Starting from Hung Up all the way to Like It Or Not, this is a non-stop dance album that's sure to fire up the dancefloor. Imagine if you take the best bits of Madonna (her first album), Erotica, Ray Of Light, True Blue and Like A Prayer, and put them altogether in a futuristic retro dance album, well, that's the best way to describe Confessions On A Dancefloor.Essential listens include Sorry, Hung Up, Jump and Get Together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna Just Scored 12th UK No. 1 With Sorry","review":"Here's some awesome random info for you:- she further strengthened her record of being the female with most No. 1 singles in UK history.- She's the female with most weeks at the top, this being her 25th week.- She also just edged further over Kylie Minogue being the female with the longest span between #1 hits: Before \\"Sorry\\", she was pushing on 20 Years, 3 Months and 30 Days (1060 weeks) between \\"Into The Groove\\" (August 85) to \\"Hung Up\\" (November 05). Kylie had a track record of 15 Years, 9 Months, and 23 Days (825 weeks) between \\"I Should Be So Lucky\\" and \\"Slow\\".- \\"Sorry\\" is Madonna's 60th top 40 hit in the UK.- Both \\"Hung Up\\" and \\"Sorry\\" stretch Madonna's number of weeks in the top 40 to a grand total of 461.- The new single has become Madonna's 55th top 10 hitAll hail the Queen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"stinky pile of poo","review":"i'm a madonna fan and really enjoyed her last album. there's nothing on this one to compare to \\"love profusion\\" off of american life. it's all shallow disco with a 16/16 beat. the music is uninspired, dull, and repetitive. at least the producers decided to lose the annoying pitch-shifter they have been using on vocals since cher's album \\"believe\\". it's time to hang your pumps and ho outfit up, madonna, cause you jumped the shark with this album for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimme Gimme Gimme A Frigging Break!!!","review":"Madonna is so lame now that she is stealing riffs from ABBA. The song \\"Hung Up\\" is so horrible that her husband stormed out of the room when he heard it. And she isn't even talented enough to make the cast of Mama Mia let alone ABBA."},{"rating":"1","title":"I prefer old school Madge.","review":"Sorry, Hung Up and Jump are the only songs I really enjoyed on this album. I found myself skipping many of the other tracks, I just wasn't very impressed by it as I am with her other CD's. Although I wouldn't say it's full of filler tracks which it's not Madge puts passion into each song but I just don't find them appealing.I'm really at a loss if I would recommend it or not, I would recommend 3 or 4 tracks but not the CD as a total. I would recommend some of her older CD's if you want to hear Madge at her best. If you decide not to buy the album I would definitely suggest you buy those 3 tracks I mentioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another clone album","review":"What are these reveiwers on? Madonna is outdated and boring now. Its the Crazy Frog and similar outfits like Banana-rama that are selling the records now. Avoid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"It only took about 2 listens to realize that this is the same Madonna schlock wrapped in a shiny new package. Same boring songs (can we have another about what fame means or doesn't mean to her?) with slick production. She is completely out of new ideas so she has to rely on a producer to make it sound fresh. This CD is lousy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent. Her best album to date.","review":"This album is just great. All of the songs are gonna make you dance.Hung Up - One of the best tracks in the album. 8/10Get Together - My favorite. Reminds me of Daft Punk. 10/10Sorry - Catchy. 9/10Future Lovers - I don't like this one very much, but it's still very good. 7/10I Love New York - Fun song! Love the lyrics. 8/10Let It Will Be - Just a normal song...nothing special about it. 7/10Forbidden Love - Sexy song! 8/10Jump - Great song! Makes you dance all night long. 9/10How High - One of the best tracks in the album. I love the lyrics! 9/10Isaac - WOW! 10/10Push - The closest the album gets do R&B.; 9/10Like It Or Not - Normal song. 7/10Overall I give this album a 9. It's VERY good, worth buying and it's Madonna's best album to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Post Modern Tedium from the Material Girl","review":"Hey there everyone, listen - that scraping sound you hear is the sound of a last gasp attempt at ploughing the depths of pseudo-nostalgia to make a quick buck. Or could the sound actually be Madonna's whiney voice, still faking emotional torment and pain after all these years rather than expressing any real feelings of her own? Rather than being controversial as many have misjudged, Madonna is actually the epitome of tedious entertainment. This new album is a milky confection, a hodge-podge of recycled cliches and techno bleeps. If the truth be told, Madonna is more akin to a centre-right political party than a serious pop artiste - offend no one, and just tentatively go with the flow to ensure your survival in changing, challenging times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disco Grandma","review":"If you don't need lyrics that matter, if you're not listening for original melodies, if you like a beat that toddlers can dance to, this album is for you.

It's very, very good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love this CD!","review":"Madonna is incapable of making bad music. All her albums are great from start to finish. It's always hard to just name a few favorite tracks, but here I go: Sorry, Let It Will Be, Push, and Like It Or Not. The beat's are infectious, and the style of her songs is always unique. And I dislike when people pick on her for her voice because I happen to find her voice very appealing. Promise it's not the last album Madonna because music is always better when you're doing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna CFNM Queen","review":"Madonna's album is so wonderful and shows how she's really developed as an artist. If she were to join CFNM (don't know what this is? look it up through a google search) she would undoubtably rein as the queen and rule over all men who are made into objects for her to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now THIS is what I call Madonna!","review":"Excellent. Much better than the previous release. If you take the self-titled debut and combine it with RAY OF LIGHT, you get CONFESSIONS OF A DANCE FLOOR. There is not one ballad on the record, and it does not lack for that. Each song flows into the other, just like a true dance CD. Definitely worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Ministry of Sound Instead","review":"This C.D is Horrible! she should be executed for shamelessly using An ABBA sample as heavily as she does..shame Madonna..You really dont have anymore tricks up yopur sleeve anymore do you???Hung Up is the only standout track.."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a sad attempt at Dance","review":"For all those who like their music to be Dance and not Madonna's version should definitely grab a disc from Kylie Minogue..This is nothing more than a sad attempt at stealing Kylie's style and it fails on every Level..The good song is Hung Up..That is It..and only b/c of the AbbA Sample that she steals.....Mariah carey's Fantasy was a good use of a sample..this is just plain Stealing."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCKY!","review":"i dont like the cd its bad she cant sing no more she needs singing lessons from whitney or mariah sorry madddonna you not the queen no more"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Try!","review":"If you are into madonna then you might like this album.

Did I miss something? HAHA. After I found out that it was Madonna's new single I just rolled my eyes.With that said, I love Madonna and have all of her cds, but this one? Not on my favorite list. Her Dick Tracy sound track is amazing, Rain, Material Girl, Cherish, are all such wonderful songs. But when 47 year olds start singing clubbing songs it makes me laugh....its like my 73yr old gramma hitting the club scene.There is nothing orginal about taking someone else's work and putting your own lyrics to it. I hoped that this cd would be better but it just isn't.I like the older songs so much better then this cd. Save yourself the money and just download it if you want to listen to it. I wish I did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Overrated","review":"I respect that Madonna had a lot of success and maybe one of the biggest ever, but the last LP, Confessions on a Dance Floor, has been overrated a lot, everyone says this is the best album of Madonna, but not even the half of the success of her first albums achieved."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST and most important album of 2005!","review":"Madonna's stunning \\"Confessions on a Dancefloor\\" is jampacked with beats and rhythms that will leave you breathless.

From the adrenaline-drip high on the hit single \\"Hung Up\\" (with samples from Abba's \\"Gimme Gimme\\") to the retro beats of \\"Future Lovers\\" (with samples from Donna Summer's \\"I Feel Love\\"), the all-dance, no-ballad Confessions On A Dancefloor will re-inspire the hustle and bus stop on the dance floor.

From start to finish with no pauses between songs, Madonna has once again proved herself to be the queen of pop music!

If Dick Clark was still hosting Rate-A-Record, I'd have to say that \\"it has a good beat and you can dance to it\\". The only duds for me were Forbidden Love and Jump.

A few catchy tunes, enjoyed the continuous play. However, after I took a break from the CD and came back to it, I realized it's attraction and artistry. Now, I cannot stop playing it. Truly is one of her best. Sure, some lyrics are \\"dorky\\" but that's part of the uniqueness. She has come back to her niche (dance) and expresses her fondness of not taking herself so serious and just enjoying life."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW Madonna","review":"Very addictive. The music makes you jump out of your chair and start snapping. I am totally in love with this lastest offering. Anyone of those tracks would make a great single. glad to see u back doing your thing, madonna, as only you can!Obviously people use this forum to vent their hate and have not listened to the album.

For all of those Madonna fans out there who have not been too sure about where Madonna's musical direction has been going for a while---the present direction is \\"to the top\\". This album is a perfect modern blend of exotic tunes, hip dance beats and disco. It has been a long time since we have seen Madonna like this.....a perfect gift for any Madonna fan and for anyone who has not been converted to one yet---this album will surely change that!My favorite tracks are \\"Hung Up\\",\\"Get Together\\", \\"Sorry\\" and \\"Isaac\\"!!!Awesome--just Awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Awesome.","review":"Put this CD in your Player, and bring your best Dancing Shoes with you! This album is a corker!"},{"rating":"2","title":"1 star my bum!","review":"Anyone giving this a one star review is a Mariah Lamb. They even have a website and group called \\"TeamLamb\\" whos only purpose is to bring down Madonnas album. To bad its not working cause in a few more weeks Confessions will have outsold Mumus world wide. And she is going to achieve this without 20 versions of the same album. It also went to #1in 40 countries! Mumus probably didnt even reach that in 5 countries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glorious Dance.","review":"Honestly I have never been a Madonna fan, and the only album I really liked from her was The Ray of Light.When I first heard this album, from the beginning of the first song, I was literally enchanted by it. She uses really great dance music with catchy melodies, cool metallic beats, modern ethnic and electronica fusion and you literally see a rainbow of color when you put this CD on and close your eyes.This is by far the kind of cd that makes you happy and up-beat when you have it on. I was really impressed how every song was better than the last, and you can certainly listen to the whole album twice, and then keep looking forward to the next time you can put it on.Overall, Exellent stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic.","review":"This is a brilliant album. I love the new single Hung Up. My favourites though, are rumoured second single Sorry, Isaac, and Like It Or Not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna rocks AGAIN!!","review":"Kudos to you again Madonna! I love this album. I love how your taste changes with each album. I have been with you from the very beginning and this album is by far going to be one of my favorites. I love the continuous music. As I am running on the treadmill listening to the upbeat disco type beats, I am finding I want to run harder and faster. This music is uplifting. \\"Sorry\\" is awesome. It was a great 'in your face' to all the past bad relationships that went wrong. Thanks! You are a remarkable artist who has come so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best dance album, EVER!","review":"There seem to be a lot of false reviews going on, don't listen to the negative people. It is obvious they have never heard the album. Madonna seems to bring out the jeliously in a lot of people. Yes she is better than every artist out there but thats no reason to get all bitter. Just go with the flow. Anyway, this album is a stand out in dance music history. Each track is single worthy and amazing. GET TOGETHER recalls early Madonna, with it's happy go lucky beat and lyrics this track is sure to you move and sing along. The album is not all fast pace beats, one track PUSH does take us down to about 120bpm to more of an R&B; beat, and the hook on this one is off the wall. Just trust me go out and get this album, you will not regret it! A++If you only own one Madonna album this is the one to own!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album, she's back!!","review":"First off, Mariah and Madonna do two different types of music. It is stupid to compare them. Why can't we buy both cd's? They are both great in their own particular genre. My favorite song it probably Isaac. Everyone else thought it was weird, but it gets stuck in your head. This album is much better than American Life. I think the album flows well together. I can see all these songs being played in the club if not for the beats alone. I'm a member of Team L.A.M.B. but I can support other artist as well. When you back yourself into a corner, your mind will never expand."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Welcome Return to Form or a Competent Comeback","review":"Yes she has done it again, Madonna has pulled something good out of the bag and re-established herself after the rubbish that was American Life. This CD is full of great dance tracks and Madonna has reclaimed her throne even if for once she isn't leading the charge but just being part of the pack. It is a competent comeback and nothing more as there is nothing new or remotely original here. Hung Up would be lost without the ABBA backing and Sorry (track 3) is just Hung Up without the ABBA backing and to rhyme New York with dork is really scratching the bottom of the barrel. A must buy for the fans and anyone that just loves loves loves 'Hung Up'. Unfortunately for Ms Ciccone this won't win many new converts."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's only so much you can learn in one place","review":"This is my personal favorite quote from \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\", it comes from \\"How High\\", one of the best Madonna songs in years.\\"Confessions\\" is basically the antithesis to \\"American Life\\", the latter was filled with political, religious and personal commentary. This one is the antipode, with only songs intended to make you Jump and cheer.Very recommended for those who may feel a little depressed. Without a doubt it will make you feel god."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna's best album in years!","review":"I have to admit that I'm not a big fan of Madonna, but this album is just FANTASTIC!!This is the best Madonna record I've heard since 1998's Ray of Light.Forget about American Life's annoying beats and political lyrics, this is pure catchy pop/dance music at it's best.Highlights are:SorryLet it will beJumpIsaacand the last song Like it or not?I'll have to say that I REALLY DO LIKE IT :-)Good work Madge... One more time you're the one and only dancing queen."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not music","review":"This is a bunch of artificial sounds crappily put together, containing all the feeling, depth and richness of a plastic lid. Then there are the lyrics, almost deliberately idiotic cliches repeated mindlessly. This album has little to offer to anyone with a decent ear. Sounds like it was put together by a bunch of teenybopper 8th graders using a computer to make the music, as a school project."},{"rating":"1","title":"This dumbkuff forgot disco died in 1979","review":"I can't believe how many people are taken in by this phony known as Madonna, Madonut to me. Are there that many blind sheep who thinks this disgrace to Italian Americans is great. Her use of the song Gimme Gimme Gimme by Abba on Hung up which should be called Hung Over was sickening. She's proven over and over again that she's a bad singer, actress, writer and king sized HYPOCRITE who hates her fans and only likes their MONEY!!! Confessions on a Dance Floor!!?? Dressed up disco crap for the millenium or shall I say ARMAGEDDON. If any of you pallies want good music, buy Ted Nugent's Double Live Gonzo or Live at Hammersmith!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a bit disappointing","review":"I have been a longtime fan of Madonna, but I was thoroughly disappointed by her latest CD. Of course her hit single \\"Hung Up\\" is very catchy, but that is only because she sampled an Abba song. Even tracks that have some potential are ruined by her cliched and self-involved lyrics. Get over yourself Madonna, not everyone wants to be you and have your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another dance album","review":"The whole album sounds like one only song, just like all the \\"New music\\" I like the \\"ABBA\\" song and wish i bought the single only, I got bored, isnt an album that i would play in my car till the end, sure will/is a hit on the dancefloor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much synthesizer","review":"The first song \\"Hung Up\\" is to me the classic Madonna sound that I wanted to hear. This song is a great 80's feel dance song and is definately a five star song. The rest of the CD sounds like the \\"Ray of Light\\" CD. If you like the synthesizer sound than you will love these songs... if you don't then think twice before purchasing. Once I heard \\"Hung Up\\" on the radio I assumed the rest of the CD would have the classic sound. Hopefully there will be a Confessions II CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Now I am not a madonna hater, look at my review history, I have given Madonna albums 5 stars!But Madonna's new 2005 release \\"Confessions on a dance floor\\" has showed that she is not only desperate for attention, but has also ripped off her fans of their money for this awful, boring, and flat album.On november 15th, i ran to my local record store to purchase this album, I thought madonna could do no wrong. But i was horrificly dissapointed when I listening to this tripe. Not only are all the songs montonous and souless, half of them are not even dancey! Songs like Issac, Like it or not, and Let it will be show that she has lost her creative genius.However, the record does have a FEW decent songs, noticeably \\"push\\" and \\"jump\\" But both are not worthy of spending $15.00In conclusion, stay away from this awful, boring, and montonous album, get Mariah Carey's \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noooooo!","review":"This album does have a \\"Kylie Minogue\\" aura to it, but it's definatley a Madonna album. Some songs are catchy. Some are filler. There's a couple of songs that are pretty stupid... \\"I Love New York\\" for example. But all in all, it ain't half bad. Someone in this forum chose a good word to describe this album... VANILLA.This is definatley not a mainstream album. People who are not as musically diverse won't like this album at all. TAKE IT FROM ME, A LONG TIME MADONNA FAN... \\"Confessions on a Dance Floor\\" is one you will have to gamble with, so borrow it from a friend OR QUIT BEING CHEAP and just get the album. It's not a big investment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lamb","review":"This dude who claims to both respect Madonna and Mariah is a LAMB. Dont be fooled.

This is copied and unoriginal. She must made that song in only one hour. ABBA should sue Madonna for this.

It sounds like she phoned in the lyrics and then the studio went to work with electronic over-production. Billed as a \\"dance\\" record, this is a snooze record. And with ridiculous lyrics like, \\"I don't like cities but I love New York because it doesn't make me feel like a dork\\" it shows she is perhaps so bored & out of touch with reality. Her fans expect & deserve better than this. Check the auctions as my copy is for sale, cheap. Madonna should provide apologies and refunds for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like one long song","review":"To be fair I've listened to this CD five times in a row--you know, to see if it's one of those CDs that grow on you. NO! Listening to this is like being trapped in an elevator with MUZAK playing continuously. Hung up and sorry are passable. Your high and Push are just shy of potential-and that's it. What happened to my 80's icon? What's with the Jane Fonda 1982 workout outfits? It's not doing anything for me. While she still has the moves and the body, I'm just not feeling this one. The extra star is just because she's Madonna."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great !","review":"This album is so amazing. I can't stop playing it. My favorite songs are Future Lover, Jump and Get Together. What are you waiting for ? Get it now !!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I get my money back?!","review":"I haven't liked Madonna's music since the 80's. When I read reviews in magazines that this cd is suppose to be the return to her 80's dance roots, I bought it. Mistake. This sounds nothing like \\"Borderline\\", \\"Burnin' Up\\", \\"Holiday\\" days. This is techno song after song. It all sounds the same. I hate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a tired waste of a former-artist","review":"Dance music this is NOT..It is a big Mess..The songs I like are Isaac and Hung Up..although I prefer ABBA 's GIMME,GIMME,GIMME...what a shame...she was good in the 80's"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Was She Thinking???","review":"I have to say, I looked forward to this album, and it is one of the worst of Madonna's long career. I grew up listening to her music, and must admit that the lyrics and musical scores are very immature for someone who has been around as long as she has. I would expect this from a novice singer, but never from an artist in the leagues of Madonna.Her best album to date has been \\"Ray Of Light\\". She's had two very mediocre albums in between, but to have an album holding a magnitude of higher expectations fall as flat as this one is extremely disappointing.Save your money and spend it elswhere on music that really is chart worthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS is what the wait was for? Yuck!","review":"I remember the day when Madonna was a trendsetter. Now she seems to be the follower, but getting a bit lost. With the exceptions of \\"Jump\\" and \\"Future Lovers\\", this CD is a total waste of time. Don't get me wrong, I'm an avid Madonna fan. I just feel she sold out here for a quick buck (since her movie career is nothing). It would have been nice to have had a \\"dancefloor\\" CD that contained songs to which you could actually dance. \\"You Can Dance\\" was a remix CD, but at least it showed some variety and originality. On this endeavour, Madonna sounds like Kylie Minogue...only less focused and singing off-key (as usual)."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST Madonna CD MADE -- used price of one cent proves it!!!","review":"WORST Madonna CD MADE -- used price of one cent proves it!!!-------------------------------------------------------Sorry---but when the value of a Madonna CD is 1 cent it is crap.

This CD is boring and dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is my review?","review":"Who did my review disappear from the Amazon site?I've been a customer of Amazon for years, now I ask, why I should think like the majority of mediocre people? Why should I like this outrageous Madonna? Only because people want I to like? I want my review back. Where is the liberty of expression?Maybe Amazon did this because of Madonna's pressure, who knows?I only said things that I really believe, is my opinion, I'm a free man.Maybe Amazon only wants reviews saying good things about the goods in question in order of increasing sales. This is ridiculous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm why would anyone bother","review":"Everything on this Cd sounds exactly the same and Madonna goes half (...) with her vocals as usual.

I have followed Madonna since her first album in 1983 (I was 12 at the time)and she has impressed me the easy way she can change her style of music without losing that Midas touch. I've always tought that Michael Jackson was great at that before running into trouble in the late 90s.Love her music and hope to hear her for at least another 30 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"relaxing and feel good dance music","review":"This CD has entertained me for the last few months and is still on heavy rotation on my CD player it's really that awesome. I wish I could find a way to thank madonna for making such a fabulous and meaningful dance music album that sounds exciting and makes life all the more exciting too. I'm in my final year at university and studying really hard and I usually blast this CD while working and will probably look back on this 2005-2006 period with confessions being the soundtrack of my life at this point. I can hardly wait to hear the other dance music albums she says she is planning to release, I'm sure they will be great"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent return to form","review":"All I can say is go ahead and click the 'Add To Cart' button, cause you will not hear a better dance album this year. Wow, this is a stunning blend of so mnay things, that words cannot do it justice, only listening will.Go Madonna!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Burning Up the dance floor","review":"Madonna is back on the dance floor were she belongs. This album finishes what I feel is the trinity of Madonna's Prefect CDs: Like a Prayer (lyrical), Ray of Light (sonically) & now COADF for pure energy! This is a must for any fan of not just Madonna but great music in general!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant CD!","review":"This is a fantastic CD which I recommend to any fan because it proves that Madonna really is the Queen Of Pop and has been on the throne for the past 20+ years of her music career."},{"rating":"2","title":"When LAMBS attack!","review":"Wow, Mariah must be so jealous of Madonna's GLOBAL success with her new album she has sent her sheep.....oops....I mean \\"lambs\\" out in full force to give this a 1 star review.

You rule Madonna and Dance on girl! Let the haters hate while your new album flys off the shelfs around the world!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome '80s Re-Iinvented","review":"If You are a true fan of '80s Pop/Rock, This will probably take you back. This is the SAME Madonna who gave us hits Like \\"Borderline\\", \\"Holiday\\", \\"Like A Virgin\\" and \\"Material Girl\\" Those great hits made have changed ourselves from Kids to Grown-Ups in 20 years. Somehow, Madonna has really think outside the box, and cooked up some new music that Still have the same chemistry 20 years ago. She is now 47 years old, and I still listened to her after all these years. It pays to have a better life-by listening to Top-40. Now, we have kids, and they are listening to Madonna as we speak, and Madonna is'nt the hot chick like she was 20 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"anyone who doesn't like this album has NO taste whatsoever. I loved Ray of Light but this album has now topped that one in my book. I don't understand why people are so bitter about Madonna... jealousy perhaps?

Best tracks Hung Up/Sorry/Future Lovers/Forbidden Love/Jump.........oh heck, the whole thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Queen Has Returned!!!!!","review":"Yes, the Queen of Pop has finally returned to her rightful throne. When I first heard this CD I thought,\\"Omigod! This is soooooo much better then 'American Life'!\\" 'Hung Up' starts off this delightful, beautiful, dance-til-you-drop masterpiece that every Madonna fan has been waiting for. The Abba beat brings back old times, as well as new dance beats we all enjoy. The rest of 'Confessions' is just as entertaining if not mesmerizing in its sound. 'Sorry', 'Push', and my personal fav,'Issac' are some of the songs you'll push repeat on many times. Like I said earlier, The Queen really has Returned to her Throne of Pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"My American pop queen","review":"Madonna has always been tops to me, and this album is a perfect example of why."},{"rating":"2","title":"I AM DANCING AS I TYPE...","review":"OMG!!! What are you waiting for? If you have yet to buy Confessions on a Dance Floor, then you have waited too long. This album is FABULOUS. While it is not as introspective as the Ray of Light album, it definitely offers new beats from a classic dance-floor diva. She has once again redefined what we dance to. Ya gotta love her...if not, then you at least have to own this album. Get your credit card out...this is a MUST BUY."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Confess that I'm a M.A.Ddy Fan!","review":"This album just hits off! Kudoz to Queen Maddy for an excellent dance album...DJ's around the world is goin' crazy with all kinds of remixes! The tracks of her album enables DJ's to get creative with dubbings, remixes and beat creativity!Finally, I love what Madonna has came out with the theme of the album. It's retro-70's, it's hot, it's POP!I love the blend of techno, electronica, house,spanish quotes, middle eastern (kabbalah) beats and dance pop that she had came out with.My favs tracks...Hung Up, Sorry, Jump, I Love NY , Get Together and Push.Madonna Forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"In The Evidence Of Its Brilliance\\"","review":"I have heard 'Hung Up' numerous times over the radio and television, but until you pop it in your car stereo, you will truly be blown right off your seat. Days before the album release, we got a little sneak preview of a few tracks from 'Confessions' at a Vancouver night club. As far as I recall, and judging from only half of all the tracks, the album was already of pure brilliance. Favourites tracks: 'Future Lovers', 'Sorry', 'Jump', and of course 'Hung Up'."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Superb C.D.","review":"Wow, what can I say? I enjoy each and every track on this album. I like how the songs are so blended and continuous. The transition between the ending of \\"Forbidden Love\\" and the start of \\"Jump\\" gives me a goosebump. Buy this wicked album people!"},{"rating":"2","title":"YES MADONNA I AM READY TO JUMP!","review":"WOW WOW WOW! After the depressing and dark vibe of American Life, Madonna goes back to her roots. In a world filled with hate and war and insane politicians *cough*george bush*cough*, this album lets you escape it all for an hour and brings nothing but joy."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a surprise!!!","review":"Aside from being one of the worst singers on the planet, Madonna's new cd proves once again that this aging star has no talent whatsoever. Wasn't it bad enough when she tried to remake \\"American Pie?\\" Now we listen to her use someone elses music to her lousy lyrics. The music is horrible but Im not surprised because the artist is horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"what the heck is this??","review":"This one goes on the shelf never to be heard again....what dance floor are they talking about......pass me the \\"e\\"? Where is the Madonna that brought us Holiday, Like A Prayer, Express Yourself....I know the remixes will be EXCELLENT...until then, wait!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You're not in your twenties anymore","review":"Why does Madonna refuse to acknowledge that she is a middle-aged mother who looks ridiculous trying to look and act like she is 20 years old. I've never been much of a Madonna fan, and the few tracks I've heard on this album only reinforce my opinion of her music. I admit that at one time she was an innovative force in the music/entertainment industry, even with VERY limited vocal talent, but c'mon now.. isn't time to pack it up already? It goes to show that it doesn't take much to be $ucce$$ful in today's mainstream market."},{"rating":"1","title":"crapptastic","review":"She basically hit a high note with Ray of Light and has been copying the Euro trance-dance mood from that album since, with little tweaks here and there. Remember when Madonna would completely change it up with every album? Now we get a string of rehashes. Imagine Ray of Light, but with the lyrics written by her daughter. And most of the songs sound like they USED to be a song, but the DJ she hired to produce it watered it down into a club song.Forbidden Love 4/10The weakest and only filler track on the album. Why she put this on here is beyond me. But the other tracks more than make up for this song. It just is no good, you can't dance to it. Check out Forbidden Love on her Bedtime Stories album though. That song is amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Madonna, but not this album","review":"When i listened to this album i found it to be quite dull. NO sparks or anything. She proved she cant sing like she used to. Ill go back to listening to Ray of Light because this is not a good album"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Pure pop Fluff w/out the sugar!","review":"i'm a madonna fan and really enjoyed her last album. there's nothing on this one to compare to \\"love profusion\\" off of american life. it's all shallow disco with a 16/16 beat. the music is uninspired, dull, and repetitive. at least the producers decided to lose the annoying pitch-shifter they have been using on vocals since cher's album \\"believe\\". it's time to hang your pumps and ho outfit up, madonna, cause you jumped the shark with this album for me"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Rip Off","review":"Of course people think she is great, since non of her material is her material. She steals all her ideas from other artist and then releases under her name. This album, like all the rest of her albums, is a chaep rip off. She aint pretty, she can't dance and she needs to retire and quit ripping off other more talented artist. Give it up, Madonna, before your vericose veins start popping out. If they had -0 stars, this would be the lowest on that scale"},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck...","review":"Madonna is untalented, her voice is annoying, all the songs on this cd have stupid lyrics and get boring really quickly. \\"hung up\\" is the worst video EVER- she can't dance. It doesn't matter if it was No.1 (Hilary Duff was No.1- who likes her?); read any professional review and the highest this gets is 2 stars. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"HER BEST WORK!","review":"This album is just amazing!!! Every song is brilliant and fun!!! Not a bad song...from Hung up to Like it Or Not...its nonstop euphoric dance music!

Madonna is at the TOP of her game!! Learn and appreciate what us hardcore fans have known all along - she IS THE UNDISPUTED QUEEN!! Mimi only wishes she was as grand as Lady M! :smug:"},{"rating":"2","title":"20+ Years: her best album!","review":"Q: How many recording artists can claim to have made their best album more than 20 years into their career?A: Very few, but add Madonna to that very short list.Confessions on a Dance Floor is Madonna's long awaited masterpiece. This CD is a winner from start to finish. No tracks to skip. No clunkers/cringing moments (no whiney-rich-girl-rapping or overwrote ballads) Just a solid, A+ CD that accentuates what she has always done best: great dance-pop!5 stars...easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ik ben droevig...","review":"She sings in the beginning of \\"Sorry\\", as the phrase \\"I am sorry\\" in a great number of other languages.She probably used Babelfish, because if you translate \\"I am sorry\\" into Dutch you get \\"Ik ben droevig\\". But unfortunately, \\"Ik ben droevig\\" has quite another meaning in Dutch, it means \\"I am sad\\". Let's call it a research mistake.The album itself makes me kind of sad too. This has nothing to do with disco music, this is simple DJ music (samples all over the place). Yes it's popular music, so it will sell well. But this album will be forgotten in a few years from now.Except maybe for some legal cases popping up every now and then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"Madonna's CD is not good. It's all disco music and Madonna can't sing anyway. Every song is rip off of another dance group.Hung up is Abba all the way. Dont' bother with this garbage.Bo Bice has the best CD ever made, The Real Thing, and it's a SMASH hit, outselling Madonna by a MILE. Try it for yourself and you will see what all the people are buying, Bo Bice!! Buy this you will love it and will become addicted to listening to every song! Amazing debut for theextraordinary AMAZING, Bo Bice!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding??","review":"This is not \\"old\\" Madonna. Although Hung Up is good, the rest is ALL filler. I'm so disappointed it makes me sick. How can anybody think this is a good buy? The words are pathetic and the sounds as if it took 15 minutes to write. Too much \\"talking\\" in the songs which make it sound cheesy. And to be honest, it's not even a good dance CD. You keep wishing the next song will be stronger, but they are all weak after Hung Up and even though I like that one, it's not like it's Vogue or one of the many Madonna classics. You are Madonna, what's up with the synthesized Britney voice?? Oh well, bye bye $9.99, hope you enjoy the money Madge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you call it MUSIC?","review":"Please give me a break. Little girls maybe can love this CD. This CD is not for adults or people understand about music. If you buy this crap you will be sorry. Damn I was hoping for something better!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible! This is music?","review":"I was expecting good things from this album. Even though the current single \\"Hung Up\\" isnt anything groundbreaking, I thought I would give it a try. I am embarassed to say I bought this CD. There is nothing on here that sounds like a legendary singer. Madonna, this might be the end of the road for you. I am very disappointed in this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST album of the YEAR!","review":"This is by far the best album of the year. It is so amazing! There is not a track on here that I skip! The tracks I think stand out the most are \\"Like it or Not,\\" \\"Issac,\\" \\"Push,\\" \\"How High,\\" \\"I Love New York\\" and \\"Sorry!\\" I think anyone who likes up beat music will love this album more than anything they have bought this year! Madonna you are awesome! Keep making great music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Intended for U.S. Use","review":"This is her best album since Erotica. Others say Ray of Light (which was great), but that's up for discussion. Every song is either very good or excellent. The only song I don't feel is How High.Madonna has alway been a club favorite. Has more number one club hits than any other artist, so it was only logical to make an album for the clubs. These songs also have the potential to have great remixes unlike American Life. U.S. radio is not embracing her new album. Hung Up preaked at #20, but else where in the world it has topped the charts. All the other songs don't fit well to the Top 40 format, which is fine because radio stinks.I believe those disappointed by American Life will embrace Confessions on a Dance Floor and forgive the last album.Top Tracks:Hung UpSorryFuture Lovers (Think Donna Summer's I FEEL LOVE)I Love NYLove it will BeIsaacLike it or NotIt's between 4 1/2 stars and 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsomeeee !!!!","review":"She's done it again -GREAT- create a totally cool album! I bought it today and the songs are FABULOUS! The continuous flow of the 12 tracks were great to listen and reminds me of her old disco songs! Bottom line: BUY IT"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the Best!","review":"Plainly stated, this is the best thing to come out of Madonna in a long while. With hints of what she's learned from 'Music' & 'Ray of Light,' Madonna takes her electronic euphoria to the next level in 'Confessions.' There are some cheesy lyrics, but like Madonna referenced, this album is to be fun, light and make her listeners feel buoyant. No doubt for the purpose of getting through the next two years of the current political climate. Everyone needs a vacation and this is the little mental escape her fans have been yearning for!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Give me everything so it's brilliant.","review":"This is a fantastic album! Besides Hung Up, some of my other favourites are:Get Together,Sorry,Future Lovers,Push,Like It Or Not.They are all fantastic. Great comeback, Madonna! Let's get you to #1 again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Thai Chicks Love Madonna!","review":"I'm a New Yorker who's been traveling Asia. Right now, I'm enjoying myself in Bangkok, Thailand. Over the past week, I got to spend sometime in some of the city's hottest clubs. Man, people here loved Hung Up and Sorry. Those tiny beauties shook their ass off whenever Madonna blasted out. A few days later, I did what I'd never done before which was buying Confessions on a Dance Floor just to see what the Thai fuss was all about. Now, I see why! God, am I becoming a fan? It'll be fun to hear what my friends have to say about this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great dance cd that dosent stop","review":"Wow a great cd from Madonna. I have her 2 greatest hits and her music cd which was good but this one bets it. After he last cd American Life did poorly Madonna competly changes her music style and dose a great job. The music is full of 70's dance tracks that will keep you moving. A rare cd in which all songs have the same sound this cd has it. There are a few not so good songs like Isaac and How high. But there are great songs like Hung up, and almost all the other songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent","review":"The original album is perfect, this one is beyond that, the photo booklet is the ideal collector item and the new bonus track is top quality material and with the one-month subscription to ICON, you can get the other Bonus Track (Super Pop) from the Internet."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"Brilliant album from Madonna, definately her best yet, and I'm not just saying that!Lovin' Hung Up, Get Together, Sorry, Forbidden Love, Jump and Isaac!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Madonna album since Like A Prayer.","review":"To describe this album in a lot of words would be very difficult, so I'll just say: Brilliant. Just brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love it ..one of the best album of madonna!","review":"i love it ..one of the best album of madonna! if you want to be happy u must own it into your collection ;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great music -- Lame limited edition!","review":"The CD is great. The Limited Edition leaves a lot to be desired -- could have included a DVD, full lyrics, etc. instead of the pointless diary. I bought it for the bonus track (which is terrific), but I was not happy with this clunky package. For someone who is so cutting edge in her music, this is another packaging disappointment like the \\"American Life\\" Limited Edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonnas Confessions On A Dance Floor","review":"Hey, I just got theis CD the other day and I must say its better than American Life, this album is a huge comeback! This album has sold more in America than American Life sold worldwide! But is it a great album? Not hugely. Its very listenable but theres something about it that is very repetitive, I am not a huge fan of Remix albums, but Confessions On A Dance Floor sounds like one big remix album. Its not without its gems though, of course there is the huge international hit \\"Hung Up\\", which I suspect a lot of people love and the tracks \\"Sory\\"and \\"Get Together\\" really shine on this album.I am not a HUGE Madonna fanatic, so I cant reccomend another album over this, but please DO give it a try, a lot of people love this, or hate it, the question is where do you sit?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tunes to keep you moving","review":"This album is great. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is not every song holds up to the \\"awesome\\" standard. The radio played Hung Up and Sorry get the best action here. But, overall, this album will get you up and keep you moving. If you like solid heart-felt-bass dance, you will like this album. If you are looking for more electric-synth type dance, or something like NYC dance, this may not be the best for you.My advice, for the money - its definately worth it. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dear Madonna,","review":"Love the album, love her, hate the self-doubt. Now that I have played the album to death, I begin to pay attention to the lyrics. Madonna, once again, has a song on her album that wonders whether she should be rich and famous and is it still worth it (or was it worth it). DRIVES ME CRAZY! Okay, so maybe she has some regrets? If so, do something other than write songs about it. Some of us love her because of who she was and who she is now and enjoy watching her evolve. Evolving is one thing--self doubt without action (writing songs doesn't count--it is the first step perhaps, but you can only do step one so many times) is truly maddening."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the evidence of it's brilliance!!!!","review":"This album is one of the best Madonna albums ever. So many bonus features and a non-stop dance mix (not to be confused with her fiasco \\"You Can Dance\\"). This is truly an all dance, feel good album with the bonus track \\"Fighting Spirit\\". Perfect for road trips and dancing around the house...or whatever you choose. It's phenomenal!!! A must have for an old fan or a newbie wanting to see what Madonna is all about!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks Madge, for another great album!","review":"Another great album from the Queen!I don't understand why some fans don't like this product!It's absolutely FANTASTIC!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Believe the Hype.

I have yet to have 1 single person say I really don't like that. EVERY song is single quality. When is the last time you bought a CD that had more than just a couple of good songs??? Well guys and dolls THIS is a must have. Need cheering up? This is it. A masterpiece!!! I'd give it 6-stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best dance music","review":"I did not like Madonna when she started in the early 80s. After Ray of Light, I started thinking she was a serious artist, a music chameleon.Confessions on the Dancefloor, is one of the best albums I have ever listened to. There is not one song that I did not like.A lot of energetic, uplifting, modern dance music with a 70s touch. I listened to the CD till it melted. I bought it twice. With this CD she became one of my favorite pop artists ever. She is the Queen of pop, no doubt about that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome back","review":"I have been Madonna's fan since 1983, CONFESSION ON A DANCE FLOOR is indeed one of her greatest achievement since RAY OF LIGHT. I love \\"Hung Up\\" \\"Get Together\\" \\"Jump\\" \\"Sorry\\" \\"Isaac\\" and \\"Future Lover\\" personally.I still think she is one of the greatest since 80's and there is no doubt abt it. I love to dance, I love to sing, and I love her work. Well done, Maddy."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're human, you won't be able to resist this album.","review":"Madonna's new album is something special. The songs are so exuberant and powerful and fun and magnetic that only a robot could resist them. Give yourself over to the frenetic vibe and just have fun! Enjoy it for what it is and if you've spent the last several years bad-mouthing Madonna and everything she does, it's OK to rescind your negativity. We die-hard fans will forgive you and welcome you back into the fold of Madonna fans.I love the message on \\"Like It or Not.\\" Like Madonna or not, you'll be boogeying your butt off to this music for years to come if you just give it a chance. Take that, you haters!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a Madonna album I like","review":"I liked most of Madonna's music over the years. I was into her back in 1981 when she first came out and then like around '83 when Boarderlie and Lucky Star and have been a fan ever since. This one, Confessions on a Dancefloor, I'm not impressed by. It's not really pop music or a variety of songs it's like one long continuous disco beat song. The same pulsating disco thing goes on like a heartbeat from the start of the CD through the end.

I was so surprised to find a majority of 5-star glorifications here. I was barely able to play through the cd so unchanging was the beat, so mundane were the lyrics, so devoid of melody was the music and so unimaginative were the chord changes. I'm amazed so many people could tell enough difference between the songs to review them separately. I'm even gay and I hated it. I was not inspired to dance and that takes a lot. A pounding disco beat with nothing else to offer has never been inspiration enough for me to dance and I love to dance and have done so for many years in gay clubs. (Ray of Light has been one of my favorite dance songs.) One needs a little funk and complexity of rhythm, a soaring, catchy melody, a creative bass line, none of which exist in this album. Just boring and nothing that stimulates. [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless, tasteless, insubstantial fluff.","review":"This \\"music\\" is just uncreative, derivative nonsense. Can Madge sing? No. Write a decent lyric? No. Write music or play an instrument well? No and no. So as usual she pulls in some folk to concoct a musical backdrop for her inane self-congratulatory lyrics. Yeah, lots of people love NY, woo-hoo, but it's not the only cool city in the world. Wanna dance? Go buy some Paul Van Dyk. Hear authentic, talented musicians trying to improve the world?

Then i plugged the entire album into my i-pod and have been playing it ever since over and over. It has a very Late Disco, early 80s music, (which is hard to notice at first, but it really does) But in each song one can also detect a futuristic feel to it, (a Future Disco of sorts) Mark my words: This will be the album to recon with in 2006!by faves areSorry (my 3rd favorite)Jump (my 2nd Favorite)Isaac(my 1st favorite)All in all, its a good Club/Dance Album."},{"rating":"2","title":"2007 Grammy Award - Best Dance/Electronic Album","review":"This album won a Grammy for Best Dance/Electronic Album on Feb 11, 2007.

Lewis is riddled with groundless guesswork in place of innovative research or thoughtful interpretation. In describing Lewis's early life,for example, he refers to Lewis's \\"overactive imagination,\\" and comments that Lewis listened to \\"pointless, meaningless\\" sermons when he was taken to church as a boy. On what, exactly, does he base such conclusions? These are the sorts of unverified, opinionated comments that even a freshman English student would be expected to avoid in his research, and they are peppered throughout the book. Further, the prose itself is colorless. One wonders at the sheer lack of vocabulary. The book offers nothing that might flesh out the intellectual context of Lewis's best known works.

Unfortunately, the feeling on this track is completely different. The electronic sound is gone, a piano now accompanies Lafon, and the reverb is cranked way up. Even the vocals sound different, although I don't know enough French to know if the words have changed. I am disappointed in the result, and I will have to keep looking for a high quality recording of the original 45 cut.One other gripe is that the CD liner is deceptive, listing this album as a compilation. There is no hint that the song has been redone, even the copyright date for the track remains 1985. I have come to distrust Sony music, and this simply reinforces my belief that Sony music products should be purchased with caution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well recommended history of war psychology","review":"A fine, well researched history of military psychological practices in the 20th century and easily comprehensible by the layman. As an American, I found the English spelling and punctuation annoying (honourable British writers reverse the use of single and double quotations, don't you know, Love), but you can get past that. I'm sure the British have similiar feelings about the American writing style. I can best compliment War of Nerves by telling you that I am citing it in a book on mental disorders during the American Civil War. Aside from that, I was intrigued by Shephard's thoughts on the creation of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder as a recognized mental condition, i.e., that it came into the lexicon as much or more from social and political reaction to Vietnam as a step forward in mental evaluation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saturn Fuel Injector","review":"AUS Injection MP-50121 Remanufactured Fuel InjectorThis injector fit my 1996 Saturn SL1 perfectly, and came with everything I needed to install it at a low price.

These are two of my favorite, perhaps THE favorite, performances of these symphonies. The sound on the Dvorak is clear, with a lot of presence, but gets cramped in some of the tuttis. The performance is brisk and exciting, beautifully articulated with the subordinate figurations always clear. The string sound of the orchestra is somewhat grainy, but this doesn't detract from a reading where every bar is deeply felt, yet integrated coherently into the whole. I have no reservations about the Franck. Here the mono sound is actually luscious. The interpretation is big and gutsy, with a tremendous feel for the symphony's organ-like sonorities.

Markevitch directed this performance with dark poetry (The catacombs, and Baba Yaga), zealous and almost imperceptible accents carefully sculpted in the score.This version to my mind must be included among the most pyramidal readings ever made. You will not find optimistic brightness, or radiant expressiveness, but a fervent Elegy in memory of Victor Hartman.

I realized that it is not the timing issue, it is more a decision about the composition, melody and performance. And Thomas Hampson's American Songs is the hidden jewel. His interpretation of \\"Bought me a cat\\" (along with Hugh Wolff conducting Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra) is whimsical, sparkling, colorful, dynamic, delightful and toddler friendly.

They have yet to match it's clever lyrics and even smarter guitar riffs. This is the \\"hardest\\" CD I've heard from The Get Up Kids, and I love it. They start the record off with a slightly more punk-influenced song, then easy into their \\"Get Up Kids style\\". The CD is experimental and mood changing. If you feel like pitying yourself over that lost love, open your ears to Lowercase West Tomas, but if you feel like head banging while doing 70 on a 50 mph road, then turn up Washington Square Park. Fall Semester, No Love, and Shorty are personal favorites (along with the previously mentioned).

I play it over and over and over to the extent that all my friends know every word due to over exposure.This is a much harder and grittier sound that retains some of the \\"Core\\" of emo. Unlike some of the pretty keyboards on ...Home About, this is all about rocking guitars and more strained vocals.Were i to criticise i would moan about the lack of any shouting in any of the choruses.

When I played it the first time I didn't like it at all, but I gave it a chance and listened several times to see if there was something I was missing...there wasn't!! Ok, now... there's nothing wrong with raw, under-produced albums. Some of my favorite albums are just that,(Operation Ivy, Rites Of Spring, Sebadoh, Pavement, every hardcore album from the late 80s & early 90s)but this one just dosen't work.

I was pleasantly surprised to find a copy of this album last year at a shop in Kuala Lumpur. I'll buy anything by Leven without hearing it first; I think he's that good. He's one of those guys whose voice is so compelling that he could sing the proverbial phone book and I'd be satisfied. And this album is another very solid effort, with a few guest vocal snippets from singers such as David Thomas from Peru Ubu (who is not one of my favorites, but I put up with his occasional appearances on some of Jackie's albums; I assume they are pals). Fans of Jackie Leven and Doll by Doll should enjoy this album.

Don't get me wrong, it is a very interesting book. Especially on the subject of racial discrimination in the U.S. The way New Orleans is described is great.

Gore, SUPREME INJUSTICE is still a damning indictment of the reasoning expressed by the five justices in the majority. His guesswork and unattributed quotes weaken Dershowitz's arguments, and what he has written will do little to change the minds of the partisan readers. But then the book was probably not intended to convince so much as to express indignation at judges who seemed to conveniently forget their own past opinions in a case that will be discussed over and over again for generations to come.

Gore from every possible angle and the verdict is the same: 5 Supreme Court Justices handed the presidency to G.W. Bush. It doesn't matter who \\"really\\" won in Florida. The election was decided elsewhere, by 4 men and a woman who were not elected and who are supposed to be above partisan politics.For those concerned about the state of democracy, this is a truly scary book. As with Dershowitz's other books, it is meticulously researched and yet totally readable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth and Its Consequences","review":"This book will take a lot of conservatives by surprise. Dershowitz proves resoundingly that the SC's conservatives betrayed their own principles in their convoluted ruling in Bush v. Gore. Dershowitz examines the rulings of Scalia, Thomas, Rehnquist, Kennedy and Scalia to show why their vote in this case caught so many people on both sides of the political center by surprise. You don't have to believe in the vast right wing conspiracy to find this case very disturbing.Incidentally, I notice a lot of complaints about one star reviews not showing up on this site. These complaints are part of a coordinated attack by the conservative \\"free republic\\" site.I can't understand why these people wouldn't want the court to be held to standards worthy of its position as the highest court in our land."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems to leave no stone unturned","review":"As a layman, it seems to me that Dershowitz and his assistants have left no stone unturned in describing why the Supreme Court's decision to even *accept* Bush v. Gore made no sense, as well as the ultimate decision reached by the majority. Dershowitz et al point to Constitutional law, prior case, and prior decisions by these very justices, as well as their opportunity for personal gain. Comparisons are made to cases where the death penalty is involved - - theoretically a loss of life is pretty important, yet cases were not accepted, or decided inconsistently from this one. The reasoning seems very solid to me, and I'm glad I'm reading it. The tone, perhaps, is too angryor strident, though, to convert anyone who agreed with the Supreme Court decision. The book makes me want to invite five robed justices over for a BBQ and a little chat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supreme Exposure","review":"Mr. Dershowitz has exposed the acts of our rightwing Supreme Court Justices in a clear and factual manner.

He shows his bias in every thing he writes, it is as if he was defending his client Al Gore, which I suppose he was. If Mr Dershowitz had been a conservative lawyer he would be hearalding the decision by the supreme court and the book would be defending that decision.If you are looking for a true bi-partisan look at the legal issues revolving around the supreme cout decision, this book is not for you.

Quite ironic!While the book is well written from an English teacher's point of view, the history teachers out there will have a hard time accepting this book as non-fiction. It relies on the numerous lies, distortions, and half-truths propogated by the Democratic political machine during and after Al Gore's attempted coup d'etat.This book is just another attempt to 'count every vote' - except for the votes of overseas US servicemen who usually vote overwhelmingly Republican. Dershowitz skips over facts such as the concerted legal effort by the Democrats to disenfranchise U.S. servicemen, while emphasizing unproven allegations of police roadblocks being set up to keep blacks from voting. ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"From a Neutral Reader in Alabama","review":"If Mr Dershowitz thinks that this is an unbiased account of the 2000 election, then he is badly mistaken. The book is poorly written, he's very wordy (with little reason), he's repetitive, and apparently he's very angry that his candidate didn't win. Unfortunately, I'm sorry to say that this seems to be typical of our college system of today, and of those that would preach to our children under the guise of an unbiased professor.Why would any thinking person believe that a voter would prefer one candidate over the other, just because he or she didn't vote for either candidate? Why should all of the military vote be thrown out simply because they didn't vote for Mr Dershowitz's candidate?This book is very badly written and extremely biased and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Truth About Supreme Injustice","review":"Supreme Injustice is typical of what one would expect of a biased liberal.

Although I haven't always landed on Mr. Dershowitz' side of the issues of the day, his intellectual prowess and powers of reason are unimpeachable. Great book, well worth reading.

It can't be said that \\"Tales from the Twilight World\\" is Blind Guardian's best CD; it goes along with Blind Guardian's consistent concept of variety (=no CD is alike the previous one). I only think that \\"Tales from the Twilight World\\" was the first to reveal musical and thematical variety in itself. It is a good example of Blind Guardian's admirable skill of arranging powerful and melodically complex speed-(or \\"power-\\")metal which does not impose itself on the listener by high pitched voices or platant power-chord themes.

It's major feature is that it clearly reads \\"pregnant\\" or \\"not pregnant\\" on the indicator, but other than that, you pee on it and the collection part of the stick is not any larger or easier to use and it gives you results in the same amount of time as any other test I've used. It was accurate for me, so that is not an issue.

General Scott's engaging humanity in all its noblest -- and sometimes ignoble -- forms comes through very clearly in this much-needed biography. Author Eisenhower's wry comments, exemplary writing quality, and impeccable research make reading the story of Scott's life a pleasure from cover to cover. \\"So Far From God,\\" Eisenhower's history of the Mexican War, 1846-48 (and Gen. Scott's triumphal campaign through Mexico), is currently out of print. This state of affairs should be instantly rectified, if for no other reason than to give this paramount moment in Winfield Scott's military career its proper place on the bookshelf next to John S.D.

A \\"life and times\\" it definitely isn't, since there is no attempt to examine in depth the political or social climate in which Scott was operating.His personal life is curiously absent from this book, as though his family was strictly a peripheral matter. I am not even sure that his daughters are all listed by name in this book. One has no inkling what ever happens to any of them, or what Scott's relations were with them.None of this helped in any way by Eisenhower's rather wooden prose. He simply does not have a flair for making a book more readable, and with a larger-than-life character like Winfield Scott, this is a shame. It would be nice to see a biographer like Robert V.

The sound is amazing. The brass is rich and smooth. The strings, powerful. The wind solos are beautiful. Everything you expect in a Philarmonic recording is there.Here, however, the orchestra has never sounded so tired and lifeless. The Allegro is slow, never really leaving the dynamic of mf. The woodwinds sound distant and fuzzy, espically the oboe solo. The second movement is also too slow. While the brass enter powerfully, showing the power of the Philarmonic brass players, the movement is uneventful and never exciting. The same can be said for the other two movements. In the finale, it is difficult for a conductor to make the orchestra sound dull and quiet. Here, the ending seems anti-climatic and leaving listener wanting more.

I don't have the issue that has a picture of Masur on the cover but the Warner Apex version (I'm not sure if the one with Masur on the cover is any better sonically but I doubt it).

He talks about the travestis that come from Italy to do business in Brazil where these things are more acceptable. Some of the people he interviews talk about how they started in the business, they talk about the ups and downs of their jobs. I found some of the stories to be very graphic. The lives of these men are sometimes beyond their choice of living. Some of them believe they were born into it. The stories are very realistic and in some cases tragic.

As it hit float charge, it should have done the opposite; 13.5V.15V is above the maximum charge current recommended for AGMs in general and specifically this battery's specs (Exide Megacycle here on Amazon). For every .5V overcharged, there is massive long term battery life loss (20-40% for consistently overcharging it by 1V).I noticed the battery was ever-so slightly venting gas (hissing sound) which confirms that it was charging beyond the specs of AGM.Beware!

Using aluminum foil is probably the cheapest and safest way to remove rust and tarnish from chrome.Afterwards I applied this product, which did noticeably shine the exhaust tips, though not to the same degree as my wheel rims that were in much better condition.Bottom line: This works, but don't expect miracles on older surfaces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paid over $87 for a $21 DVD and then found out it was defective!","review":"I stupidly ordered this DVD with \\"one click\\" because I have often done that with paperbacks in the past although I live in Thailand and the postage was always minimal.

He also doesn't include any relevant facts or statistics, which might make such an open-ended book an enjoyable starting-point for conversation. On the contrary, he often makes arrogant unsubstantiated comments assuming the reader shares his liberal humanist world-view. I often agree with the ideas, but the snide unsupported barbs are only enjoyable when read with an equally-petty and supercilious attitude."},{"rating":"1","title":"When people try to be what they can never be (Smart that is)","review":"I liked The Meaning of Things so much that I had to have and readother books by this author so I bought The Reason of things withthree hard-working hours only to find out that the author has gone astray in this one!I got mad instead of relaxing because on page 35 the author insults the readers bluntly by calling people who'll believe inGod uneducated.Anyways as you can imagine I had no energy to carry on readingand since I was at page 35 and the book wasn't so damaged I wentto the bookshop and exchanged it for some smart author who mustappreciate my hard-working earned money (not to mention my energy and time to go through what they bla-bla'd about).\\"I know what I have given you but I do not know what have you recieved\\" - goes one of my favorite sayings by Porchia.In this case I must change it and say that \\"I don't know what you have given me but I do know what I have received\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Powers that Be:","review":"Do not buy this book!First it is made with poor quality products.It is very short, out of the 84 pages only 44 pages comprise the actual text of the book.

Whitesnake used to be a clssic hard-rock, blues band, and this is a fine example of the kind of material they put out in their heyday.This is the classic line-up (Coverdale, Lord, Pace, Murray, Marsden, and Moody), and features some of their best songs--\\"Fool for your loving\\", \\"Ain't gonna cry no more today\\", \\"Love Hunter\\", \\"Take me with you\\", and others.It goes without saying that you have a great combination here, with Pace's very under-rate drumming, and Lord's powerful keyboard playing. Marsden and Moody make a great guitar team, with some scorching solos throughout this great live concert compilation.If you like classic Deep Purple, or want to hear what Whitesnake was like in their absolute peak, you owe it to yourself to check this one out. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful recording of Vivaldi and Pergolesi","review":"This is a wonderful recording by Nikolaus Harnoncourt. His recording of the Vivaldi Gloria is marvelous as is the recording of Pergolesi's Stabat Mater.The recording of the Stabat Mater is quite moving. The soloists do convey the emotional content of the work wonderfully. Yet, they do not transform it into a work of Italian Romantic Opera, which it most certainly is not.All in all, this recording has much to commend it. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spalding Basketball net","review":"I've had this net on an outdoor rim for about 6 months with no noticable wear and tear, so far.Update Nov 2012:The net is still on the hoop! Excellent quality. I needed to replace the basketball set because the pole has rusted and then realized this net is still on there and in good shape."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIN NET, NO RESISTANCE, FLIMSY","review":"This is an extremely thin, and flimsy net. You will notice as soon as you take it out of the package. The worst part is that it provides VERY little resistance after the ball goes through the hoop, which means the ball will still follow its natural projection and end up going behind the backboard, or to the sides where you don't intend it to. If you have a hoop in your driveway with a base, that means it will bounce off the sides of the base and fly into your neighbor's yard.I don't expect it to last long. It was probably 1/3 the thickness/durability of my last net. The only thing I can hope for is that it expands after it rains or that it gets stronger over time. I'm pretty sure it will just break or wear out within several months.Pros:1. Cheap priceCons:Everything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pefect for what it is","review":"Good net at a great price.

This game is really good, I just wish it had the moves that Winning Eleven has... but then again Winning Eleven misses on the big names, and on building an ambient ...which at the end turn out to be a really important variable in my book. So if you like the Fifa series or just plain soccer, I would strongly recommend this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Fifa Game, but it doesn't reaches starhood","review":"I bought this game even without having played it cause I knew what I was taking.

Extended teams and players database, various game modes... you are never get bored of this game.But... (there's always a but), the two flaws I think this game has are it's narrators and that the players always look small... and if you zoom the camera too much, you loose your omniscent view of the field.But nothing is perfect in this life, so you what's nearest to perfection. Get Fifa."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much improved","review":"One of the things no one talks about is the inclusion of a map, so you actually know where your team is.

Seriously","review":"When I put this book on my Amazon Wishlist after reading about it in one of James Humes' great books about Political anecdotes I thought that this version would be a professioanl grade book. - Instead it is obstensibly a bound printout of a scanned copy downloaded from Google Books or another similar type book preservation group. Nowhere on the main title or information is it listed that this is a scanned copy instead of a true reproduction that is clearly not a series of photos from the original book. To be fair it was mentioned in the comments/description but it was a poor disclaimer that appears as if it was trying to slip by. - I hope that those who think this is an original or republication are not mislead by this and find this review helpful and will decide not to buy this version but seek for something better."},{"rating":"2","title":"good controller but...","review":"I installed this controller on winXP.

Well this controller brings a new world to PC gaming. I can now play titles that were great for consoles on my PC just like it's on a Playstation 2 or Gamecube. This controller feels wonderful, has PLENTY of buttons, very programmable (including making your own scripts on buttons), and 2 analog sticks. Me and a friend both got one and now we're playing Nintendo 64 games on his laptop and having a BLAST. This gamepad is THE BEST PC GAMEPAD EVER, and for only $20 why even think twice about it?

I had a hard time using those buttons quickly.Also the toggle and digital buttons cant be mapped for other uses so your limited to 8 total buttons rather than 10.And finally, for some reason there was no way to invoke fight in NHL06, i couldnt live with that so i had to ship it back, and ill soon go with the logitech."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"I bought this thing for travelling, the features work ok but there is one major problem with this thing the alarm is so low you will be very lucky if it wakes you up.

This book, which has only 72 pages, tells you how to make notes,how to prepare for tests and how to approach various questions like\\"Multiple Choice Questions\\", \\"Sentence-Completion Questions\\" or \\"Match-ing Questions\\". His way of making notes is writing formulating questions on the left margin of your notebook or textbook and ....

The book is written by a woman in a Jewish/Christian relationship, and I would say that it is skewed significantly but inadvertantly toward that audience. A lot of the advice in the book is written for laughs rather than practicality. For example, one suggestion to calm fears of cooking a dinner for inlaws is to put so many garnishes on the plate that they spend all their time picking through them without getting to taste the food. Or else, cook a traditional dish from an unfamiliar country so that your mother in law will not know what it's even supposed to taste like anyway. My areas of most careful reading centered upon Islam and Christianity, and I can say that most of the serious advice and religious background was basic.

The Africa here is Kenya, while it was British East Africa, and Powys depicts the land as cruel and the British settlers as even crueler. And a gem of a short story called \\"The Wryneck\\" is simply a shocker. Powys was a lifelong atheist, having no belief in any sort of life after death, and the Africa he sees sustains this belief entirely. It is harsh and unforgiving. England doesn't seem much better. The only sweetness and light in the book comes from his descriptions of nature, which are beautiful, and something he obviously loved.

I really cracked up watchin this just only once and a couple times online, just his stage quality of humor like his high voice &: \\"AH AH AH AH\\" is just hilarious made me cry and it's been so hard to find a stand up dvd with no violence towards women such as; Tony Roberts he was funny in the first 4 mins then he got in to it horribly, saying stuff like: \\"I would laugh if i saw a man beatin a women\\".

I believe he even came to the comedy house here in Columbia and the next day I remember everybody discussing how they wished they could of saw him and how funny he was. So that night, I went home and did some research (Youtube). I looked at some clips of him doing comedy and then I came across the upload to this movie and I watched some of the clips and was laughing so hard that I teared up. Right then I bought the movie from Amazon and when it came that was a hilarious night, every now and then I watch again just to see my reaction and its the same, ROFL. lol. A definite buy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST BUY!","review":"This is what put K. Hart on the map for me! This is a must buy! This man is crazy!

They are \\"feel good\\" books, and I enjoy them all. Although this particular book is not a story evolving around the local townspeople, as are many of his, it is still an inspiring read. I hope Mr. Gulley continues to crank out his particular type of humor/inspiration for years to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For Everything A Season","review":"I personally love anything this author writes because he does so from the heart and actual experience, therefore drawing you into his stories. This book is a series of vignettes through which you can laugh, cry, or just identify with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ecclesiastes according to Philip Gulley","review":"Philip Gulley uses the words of Ecclesiastes, \\"For everything there is a season\\", as a springboard for essays on life. He happens to live in the small town of Danville, Indiana, where he grew up, so his stories have to do with the people and customs of his small town. Gulley is a Quaker pastor who holds to traditional values and the sovereignty of God, but this doesn't hinder his sly wit or wry observations on the absurdities of modern-day life. His choices of stories range from the addition of a screen door to his home under \\"A Time to Build\\" to a list of his prejudices and pet peeves under \\"A Time to Gather Stones Together\\". This is a good book to read a bit at a time as each chapter stands alone. It's also a good way to escape from stress and to get a laugh and a new perspective on life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching and joyfilled book about a special, real town.","review":"Danville isn't a pretend place. It's my town. Phil Gulley brings it to life with humor, love, and best of all, with God's grace. I would want to pack up and move here if I wasn't already so blessed. He is a male version of Erma Bombeck, able to make the reader laugh, cry, and see their own world in his pages. He takes the everyday journey of life, and illuminates it. The love of God shines through these same, everyday moments. If you are from a small town, you will see your life; but if you are from New York City, you will still find company in the human race so tenderly portrayed. DO NOT MISS THIS BOOK! It is a like a sunset at the end of a wonderful day.

There seems to be an attempt to tie surfing, philosophy and religion together in some way but it never really happens. It seemed the author picked a bunch of theories and tried to force some sort of analogy to his life and surfing but the connections remained unclear. The book does not have any significant conclusion. I forced myself to finish it just to catch the surfing stories which were ok but couldn't stand alone on their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Searching for awe in all the wrong places. . .","review":"If you are looking for something uplifting to read. . .this isn't it. Steven Kotler's irreverent, cynical voice seems at odds with The Transcendent Experience he pursues from continent to continent. Along the way however, he does tell a lot of interesting surfing stories that give the reader a good understanding of how it feels to ride the waves. Besides looking for Trancendence-thru-surfing, Kotler looks for ways to explain it. He does this by reading every book he can find on how the brain works and then sharing excerpts with his readers. The effect is like trying to transmit the wonder of a Van Gogh by explaining the chemical formulas used for his paints (the term \\"reductionist\\" comes to mind). I found this depressing. However, he does create a pretty comprehensive bibliography for anyone who wants to do further reading on the science of altered states of consciousness."},{"rating":"2","title":"intelligent and ambitious","review":"An ambitious attempt to capture and explain the intangibles that all surfers know by their experience in the water. Wonderful exploration of myth in the tradition of Joseph Campbell but far more accessible than some of J. Campbell's works. By his intelligent approach and his credibility as a surfer Kotler helps destroy , in part, the stereotype of the burnt-out, stoner Spicoli surfer and at the same time celebrates the free-spirited, fringe aspects of the surfer culture/ethnology."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Kajiura Yuki","review":"I do love this album, but if you want to know more about here musical range, buy her .hack//Sign albums, they are so awsome.

I plugged it in as directed, with a long-term charge and a 60A jump start, but it was unable to start my car (2001 Audi S4).Six years later I used this again when the battery in my 2001 BMW Z3 was dead after a week of not driving it. The 2A overnight charge didn't do much, but the 10A charge did charge my battery enough to start the car once. The battery died again, so I tried an overnight 10A charge. It didn't work, and neither did the 60A jump start setting.The built-in voltage indicator seems to show increasing voltage, but it I guess in this case it hasn't really corresponded to the charge level of the battery.

When I found Joy of Sects, I was hoping for a broad review of the major world religions. I got this and much more. Not only are the six major eastern and western religions covered, but so too are many of their sects and sub-sects.In what could otherwise be dry reading, the author has managed to find an appropriate balance between reporting the facts behind each faith, and finding the humor in each and religion in general. Playful, and non-offensive. Yet the work goes deeply enough into each topic as to give the read the history and spiritual nature of each belief systemI would recommend this work to anyone even remotely interested in comparative theology or even those mildly interested in what their friends and neighbors believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grossly over priced.

I have taken both accounting and finance courses, and the disciplines complement each other, yet this book does an awful job explaining even the most basic economics concepts, and at times it's even contradictory to the concepts of the disciplines mentioned before. I consulted other economics textbooks and noticed that between them they recycle and repeat the same explanations of the concepts. Apparently this is a pedagogical deficiency in the way this discipline is taught; memorized concepts are useless if they are not understood, and when this is because they are not being well explained this is simply unforgivable and unexcusable, and this textbook is a prime example of how you do not teach.

I have read that many other customers had this same experience with their 6330 and 6329 toasters, so I sent an email to Oster's customer support asking for a replacement circuit board. Hopefully they will choose a new value for the R3 resistor, too.

However, I think its portrayal of what the Bible says about homosexuality is very lopsided. The argument of the film relies mainly upon emotion and opinion than what the Bible actually says. What little it does allow the Bible to speak it does so in a very bias manner. I would have liked to see some dialogue between the two sides presented in a balanced fashion. Perhaps some scholarship on the original texts of Hebrew and Greek would have served well. Overall, it challenges Christians to see that this issue is not as clear cut as they would like to believe, but its weakness is that it opens questions that are never answered, namely the title.

It was so much easier buying one collection rather than seven games.Then there are the actual games, which are even more incredible than the price. The graphics may not be Call of Duty 2, but I encourage any strategy gamer to buy this collection, or at least just one of the games. The Total War games are some of the best strategy games I've played. These games are actual strategy, requiring one to think, unlike some games that boast being strategy when all that matters is numbers.

The purpose of this effort is to describe the nature of the threats US interests and citizens have faced since the end of the Cold War and will continue to face in the future. Peters uses bare knuckled clarity to explain that these challenges can't be dealt with by technology and gadgets alone. He makes a compelling case that these new threats challenge our very moral, ethical and legal foundations. And we'd better figure what to do about them! It's not hyperbole when people describe Peters as one of the foremost strategic thinkers of our time. This is not a work of scholarly research. Rather, it's the culmination of a life of scholarly observation - of disaffected and downwardly mobile guys with guns. This is an insightful, well written, perception-altering book.

His solos on this album range from purely (though unconventionally) straightahead to his almost Threadgill-esque solo on the final number.

She does not shy away from showing how Daoism changed over time, incorporating a wide variety of practices from Chinese folk religion and tradition, Buddhism, Confucianism, as well as going through a myriad of internal changes, as it transmuted into different branches and trends, each stressing some new or old (or new-old) element of Daoism.Daoism comes across in Kohn's book not as Daoism, but daoisms. There is great deal of information in this book ina short space, and Kohn does not dilute it for us in the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Overview","review":"Livia Kohn's book is both a wonderful survey of Daoist philosophy but also an engaging cultural history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful book.","review":"Mister O'Neil has chosen very effective strategy.

It was a mistake. This book is another example of someone throwing something together at the last minute to sell a book. I am very disappointed. The chapters are laid out with virtually no instruction. Joseph gives a very convoluted and brief explanation of concepts and then merely throws some examples at the reader to finish his thoughts. So much is left out about the programming language and so little is explained. The examples are no help at all. Maybe the examples would help if he explained the concepts within them. Sorry folks, this book is worthless. As a Software Engineering Specialist for a highly respected software development firm, I give this book two thumbs down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality net.","review":"I purchased this net to replace the net that came with the portable basketball system I set up in my driveway, which was thin and kept falling off the rim. This net is made of thick cotton cord which stays in place on the rim. This net is a bit longer than the non-regulation length net it replaced, so I had to trim a couple inches off the bottom to use with a ball return/trainer that I installed on the rim. When my net eventually wears out from use and being exposed to the elements, I'll replace it with another of the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short net","review":"I was expecting a full length net - red, white and blue!

The line-up is Janick Gers on guitar ( not a great guitar player at all, but it fits the mood of the album ), Andy Carr on bass and Fabio Del Rio on drums. The album was produced by odl \\"wizzard\\" producer Chris Tsangarides, with the blessing of Iron Maiden's manager, Rod Smalwwood.

I am a huge Maiden fan but this solo effort by Bruce was a bad, bad dream. Yes, the first song (son of a gun)is decent but the rest of the album is for the trash. Zulu Lulu?? Born in 58?? Lickin the gun?? these are all dreadful tunes and Im sure I have forgotten the rest by now. It is because of this album that I never bought another Bruce Dickinson album. At the time I was craving new Maiden material. When Tatooed millionare came out, I was there on day one. He killed the dark mystique of Iron Maiden in that one upchuck of glam trash rock. Steve Harris and Paul Di Anno had to be laughing somewhere. Iron Maiden hasnt made a decent album since the one before Bruce made this album (seventh son). It was like Dickinson planted a bad seed.

While Silver Lake had a very good backing band- here the band is not so much backing but adding their own very distinct and musical talents to the mix. Van Dyke Parks accordion (concertina?), string arrangements sound like open spaces or parisian streets. Vic's niece Liz Durrett's layered vocals on \\"What Do You Mean?\\" sound like ghosts in a southern forest. The album is well-produced but not over-produced.Above all- if you like Vic's sparse earlier recordings you should love this as all the musicians add to the songs AND if you like Silver Lake you should love this as the recording is rich sounding.

Kuchar is underrated but continually well represented on Cd. I agree with the previous reviewer,the Janacek Philharmonic may not be Vienna,Berlin or Philadelphia but they're a lot more exciting to listen to than those more well regarded bands. Nearly everyone of these performances is first rate and they seem to have been recorded at a very high level. This sometimes makes the performances sound a bit frenetic and noisy at times(Carnival Overture especially)but for the asking price of these three disks,you'd be a fool to pay more.

Namely, his goal is to perpetuate the myth of the Lost Cause in such as way as to make it seem like it is a legitimate view of history. De Rosa specifically attempts to use an analysis of the Confederate Constitution to justify the idea that the Confederacy was based solely on the idea of states rights and not slavery. The book is perhaps most enlightening for what it leaves out. DeRosa does not spend much time talking about the Confederate constitution's approach to slavery, which is decidedly different from the U.S. consititution in several ways. I am sure many of the the members of the League of the South buy this book to make themselves feel better, but those of us who ignore the myth of the Lost Cause know better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half Happy","review":"If only I had know that only \\"one side\\" of the pendant had a design!

Other great insights include Dalrymple's observation that criminals may not respect the social order, but of them who end up in prison create a very clear social order on the inside. Irving Kristol once said that ideas have consequences. Man do they ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look in the mirror.","review":"I think that a lot of the people who read this book seem very pleased with themselves that they aren't like 'Those People'. But for me, the book made me look at my own character and my own failings. This book made me face my own laziness, my self deception, my own lack of will and follow through as well as my own attitude towards morality. I am not saying that I am a drug addict or a criminal or really, much like any of the people in the book. But I know that I have taken the easy path more often than I should. I know that I have lied when it was convenient and decieved myself more often than anyone else.I think that if you approach this book from a political angle, which almost all the reviewers seem to have done, you will come away from it with exactly what you want to see. The liberals will decry it as 'blaming the victims' and the conservatives will laud it as 'blaming the perpetrators'. But, if you can ignore your own bias, I think that you will get so much more out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Products of the environment","review":"As a left-leaner, I bought this book with great skepticism, but after finishing it, I must say that I agreed with many of Dalrymple's points.

While Sowell effectively and convincingly outlines the liberal annointed map towards societal destruction, Dalrymple shows us the end point. Or if not the end point, then it's visible from here. An indictment of the socialist \\"victimology\\" cult in Great Britain, these essays apply equally well, if not better, to the U.S. Conservative or liberal, you will find this book either alarming or annoying, but it is difficult, I think, to refute either Dalrymple's observations or conclusions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A scary book","review":"This book is really good but scary. It's about the underclass in England and tells how much of their behavior is becoming cool and is now found in all levels of society (for example the awful behavior at soccer games.) Getting married before having children is considered not at all necessary but has led to increased domestic violence. Each chapter deals with a different topic and shows how things have changed in the last several years as people have lost their moral grounding and what is acceptable has changed. Some of this is in our culture, too, and some is headed that way. Very thought provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"THAT explains it!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Two years ago a missionary in the favellas of Brazil stated that many of the residents there were content with their lives.

I am a new fan of this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dickensian","review":"Dalrymple's argument is essentially that the poor have made many stupid choices, and that the rest of us therefore owe them nothing.Of course some people make bad choices; this is obvious. But Dalrymple's diagnosis of the problems of the lower class are based on his experiences with convicted criminals and with psychiatric patients. What kind of book would he have produced if he had worked with white-collar criminals and patients at a celebrity rehab center?Dalrymple's brand of concern was parodied well by Charles Dickens in Hard Times: a wish that the poor would simply stop being poor. Does it all come down to the individual? Well-written, but as cruel as any other social darwinist tract."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely lacking in empathy","review":"The author is just dripping in self-righteousness. He places 100% of the blame for bad situations on the decisions the poor have made. He shows no grace or empathy. His observations aren't necessarily wrong- but he extends his assumptions to everyone in the same situation.This is how he explains that abused women choose to be abused:\\"At first, of course, my female patients deny that the violence of their men was foreseeable. But when I ask them whether they think I would have recognized it in advance, the great majority- nine out of ten- reply, yes, of course. And when asked how they think I would have done so, they enumerate precisely the factors that would have led me to that conclusion. So their blindess is willful.\\" P40These sorts of explanations are given for all different types of ailments of the impoverished."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book will put you in a sour mood","review":"Author Dalrymple's claims of interviewing 10,000 people at the bottom of life is amusing in that he must have been doing it out of pure morbid curiosity. He hates these people! He has no empathy with his subjects which 1.) makes him a biased interviewer, and 2.) gives him no credibility with the rest of what he is trying to say with this book. I admit that 25% into the book I gave up and started scanning the rest of it to see where he was going with it. It looked like more of the same.

As an immigrant from England over 40 years ago, with occasional visits and family connections, I recognized the stories and the conclusions all too well. One only has to think about the recent riots in Britain to realize that Mr. Dalrymple is right on the mark. Barring a huge upheaval of the socialistic, entitlement programs and the common sense look at the false apologetic guilt of the establishment, Britain is doomed.

The similarities between the underclass in England and that found in America are striking. The biggest difference lies in the racial makeup of the so-called underclass. In England almost the entire group is white. This allows one to view the problem of life at the bottom with the race issue removed from the equation.

I learned a lot about allergies and keeping cartilage and bones healthy. I found surprising facts (all well documented), for example, that people can have both RA and Osteoarthritis, or why milk is not good for you, or what is the real cause of ulcers (and what to do about it).

Luckily we were able to buy from Amazon and have shipped here to Riyadh. Whole process only took 6 days, so will definitely be ordering again. So much easier to order a box of 6-packs rather than previously buying from supermarket every few days back in NZ. For anyone unfamiliar with this product, the rusks turn soggy yet hold shape when they come into contact with liquids (i.e. saliva), so they were safe for our bubbies right from the start of solids introduction. The shape is a long wide oval, so easy to snap in half when appetites are small, yet come in two-packs wrapped in foil, so easy to keep fresh. The texture is kind of like foam, so no crumbs to clean up and therefore easy to eat when out for a meal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tasty!","review":"My baby simply loves this biscuits.

Not so this book, Murder is Served: the conversation is stilted, the clues initially add up to one character as being framed and another character as the one who has set up the frame. About 7/8 through the book, however, a third character emerges as the villain, on far less evidence or stated motivation. Rehashing the clues and watching the cats serve as filler -- much too much filler. The quality of the plot is NOT what keeps people reading this series, but quality of plot, as well as prose style and conversation, takes a big downturn in Murder is Served."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Playing, Solid Interpretation","review":"The New York Philharmonic sounds great on this recording. The CD is recorded well. The balance is great between all the sections; with the exception of a few spots where the brass seem a little distant. I think the only thing that brings this CD down is Masur's somewhat sluggish tempos during the Symphony. The individual efforts a great all the players during the first movement, but there were more than a few spots that seemed slow and lacking a little bit of movement. The horn solo during the first movement was nailed. I think the second movement was successful. Overall I like Bruno Walter's interpretation of the symphony better. The Overture on the hand is 5 stars. All the tempos are up and once again the orchestra sounds great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of quality","review":"I LOVE the size of this little pan. The reason for such a negative review is because EVERYTHING that I cook in it sticks to one area. The remaining area of the pot is fine. My opinion is that there is a fault in the pan construction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Experience... AGAIN!!!","review":"Wow! What a artist! What a cd! I happen to be a fan of Mr. Gunn's work, why? Because not only is he talented, but he uses his talents to express whatever he wants to. The results, nothing short of amazing. He has a knowledge base for the past, the present, and listening to his music, it is the future. I have all of his cds and this one is great, I'm partial to \\"Yesterdays\\". If you want to experience \\"Real Jazz\\", you can't do wrong hearing his cds. I'm fond of any talented musican that writes their own music! Think about it, he's so good that Wynton snatched him up right out of high school to tour with him. Nuff said. Enjoy the cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I had high expectations regarding Replenix since Dr. Bailey is so highly regarded.

I can now listen to this album minus the muffled sound and having to turn the stereo to a high volume. This is definately worth picking up and replacing the original version with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good pure Blind Guardian","review":"This album is one of the first albums that BG did. It has a more thrash oriented sound and is filled with all the typical passion of Blind Guardian. Many of these song are from the first album they did: Lucifer's Heritage. For some reason it is not listed under their albumbs. I guess it is becasue it was their first album. This is the studio version of Lucifer's Heritage that they released later. If you are looking for the true first album that BG did check out Lucifer's Heritage [IMPORT]."},{"rating":"2","title":"BG ROCKS","review":"Blind Guardian, along with a few other bands (Iced Earth, Stratovarius, Symphony X, etc..), is the best thing that has happened to metal.Blind Guardian is amazing, buy this album, along with all of there others. A Night at the Opera is highly reccomended. And in my opinion Tales from the Twilight World is their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not the best","review":"This is a good album but not the equal of some of their later ones. It sounds too unfininished and rough around the edges particularly Hansi's vocals. He has this weird yelp/scream thing going on. The songs with few exceptions don't have the same epic feel except for Majesty which apparently is a fan favorite as it shows up on both of their live albums. My personal favorite song on the album is guardian of the blind. But what do I know. I also like Gandalf's rebirth and by the mines of moria, not neccesarrily because they are great songs but because I am a fantasy fan. Run for the night is another good song with a catchy chorus. Obviously, if you are a die hard BG fan then you should already have this but for new fans you would do well to get Somewhere far beyond or Imaginations from the other side first among others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product for the Digital SLR","review":"I have found this to be quite a handy device when having to make slow shutter shots in an area where a flash would be too invasive. I have my camera on a tri-pod, of course, and use the RC to keep the camera from moving at all while taking pictures in a quiet area, like a church service, or wedding. Though you do have to use it in front of the camera, you do not have to use it in front of the lens. Plus, once you get it down, your hand it out of the way long before the shutter goes off. It is a very handy device."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice enough","review":"Delivery from Amazon was easy and timely. Remote works well with the minor exception of having to be directly in line with sensor on camera. More design issue than anything. Wanted to be able to be behind or off to the side of the camera, but remote signal does not seem to get to the sensor. Does seems to be responsive when positioned correctly. No real lag time between pushing button and taking picture. Size is good for hiding it in your hand when taking your own picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remote control","review":"Doesn't work.

It's compatable and very handy for taking family pictures on holidays where you can be included in the picture.I know the camera's have self timers, but who wants to run and be breathless to get in the frame in time before the camera fires.This way you can take more time to compose your picture and it turns out great. I highly recommend this if you plan on taking pictures at any family gathering-or taking informal portraits at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful assessory","review":"It's a useful assessory for my Olympus c-730 camera (it also works with a few others). It allows you to take vibration free pictures on a tripod as well as getting yourself into the picture.

I only have two problems with it but both I knew before I bought. The first is the limited distance, which is not a real problem for anyone who is doing self-portrait photography. The second is that you have to aim the remote directly into the lens because that is where the infrared sensor is located. Again this is not a big problem because for me and for most newer Olympus models because you have the option of delaying the shutter so you can get out of the picture. I own an Olympus E-510 and as I expected only the shutter button on the remote works, none of the other functions (as far as i know) do, for my camera. It is pretty sturdy as well considering I've dropped it and stepped on it more then once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead on arrival","review":"RM-1 does not function.

Anything more than that don't expect much."},{"rating":"1","title":"RM-1 Impossible to Change Battery without Ruining It","review":"Aside from complaints about short range, in trying to put a new battery in, carefully, I somehow managed to damage one of the battery contacts, bending it downward in such a way as to make it impossible to reinsert a battery inside the small plastic transport. The tolerances are so tight inside that it could not accommodate the new battery inside the transport after the battery contact was bent downward. Because the slot for the plastic transport is less than 1/16 of an inch, there is enough room to insert a tool to bend the contact back upwards, but not enough room inside to actually bend the contact itself. One attempted battery change, and it was ruined. I'm looking for a non-OEM compatible now. Won't buy this junker again. First disappointment with Olympus after an e-500 and an upgrade to the e-510. Olympus shouldn't neglect these little products, but they did with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very easy to use","review":"I have had this remote for a couple of weeks now. The remote is pretty easy to use and only took me a couple of minutes to get it working with my camera. It's great for family shots and easier than the camera timer for those.I'm not sure the buttons beyond the shutter will be useful because how would you be able to see how much you've zoomed in or out unless you go back behind the camera? Maybe as time goes on, I'll discover their value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the trick","review":"It does the trick,,,you do have to be in direct line of the sensor otherwise it takes a lil finnagle,,my only reason for not giving it the full 5 star treatment is,,if small-only a few inches ling and wide,,I had to buy 2 because I lost one easily,,,there is no key chain or 'connector' ability to keep track of it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"Buen producto que reune las características que se ofrecían.

His sons similarly reinvented themselves, one going so far as to submit forged credentials to win acceptance in an exclusive prep school. After the parents split up, Geoffrey lived an interesting if peripatetic life with his father, while his brother Tobias stayed with his mother, suffering poverty and abusive stepfathers. Since the father had the more interesting and eccentric personality, Geoffrey's book is perhaps the more adventurous, although less well written, than his brother's, This Boy's Life: A Memoir, but both make fascinating reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"More a \\"Master Class\\" than a piano lesson","review":"I found this DVD to be more a master class with the excellent pianist Warren Bernhardt than a piano lesson itself. On some of the topics he covered, I only understood what he meant because I read a jazz theory book before and have been playing bass for over 20 years.I don't believe this DVD will teach someone how to play the piano. It will illustrate what is Warren Bernhardt's approach to the jazz piano and provide food for thought. To understand the mechanics behind what he is doing, we have to read books such as theThe Jazz Theory Bookby Mark Levine.But the DVD is well done, nonetheless. The camera is well positioned and he talks very clearly. He is a great musician and offers some very interesting insights. After I saw this DVD I got inspired.

Unfortunately, the 2 cup mark is lower than the lip of the cup, so if I simply fill the cup and level off the flour, I will actually have MORE than 2 cups. This cup is fine if you are measuring liquid, but for dry measurement, this cup will not be accurate. I am learning to work with it only because I don't see any other choices out there for a 2 cup DRY measuring cup. If you want to measure liquids, melt butter, etc this cup is great.

While I've not washed it yet, I think it will wash very well. I didn't think the crinkly sound was very loud at all and it doesn't bother my rabbit, who we just rescued and is fairly nervous. My rabbit will be getting a \\"girlfriend\\" soon (don't worry, he's been neutered and she will be spayed) and this bed will be plenty big enough for them to lie on together.

I bought it for our 19 year old cat, Tigger. Since he has lost a lot of the fat and muscle around his neck, shoulders, and back he stays cold.

We can just throw it in the wash."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY CAT LOVES IT","review":"I was surprised to find out that my cat will not get off of it!

YOUR CAT WILL GO CRAZY OVER BOTH OF THESE MUST-HAVES!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My cat is just picky...","review":"My cat sleeps on this mat about 50% of the time, which is much better than most other pet beds I've purchased. I keep this towards the foot of my bed; he takes to it on most nights. It does make the slight crinkling noise, but by no means is it annoying in my opinion. I'm considering buying another one for his favorite location in front of my sliding glass door; it's well worth the money to try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get my cat off this mat!","review":"I don't know what is so amazing about this mat but my 10 yr old cat LOVES IT.

He would rather sleep on his mat. I just wish it were a little bit larger for those times when his companion cat wants to share it. I haven't washed it yet, but the fake fur seems sturdy. Neither cat seems to be concerned about the crinkle sound at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thermal Cat Mat","review":"My cat does not like this mat, as it makes a crinkle sound when she walks across it.

The thermal material inside that warms up is a wee bit noisy when cats step on it. Thus, I set them each on it and sat with them, petting them & talking to them until they felt the warmth. Then they settled right in, and they've been using them (I bought 2 & am now going to buy 1 more!) daily ever since.My only other complaint is that the mats are a wee small. Again, because they're slightly \\"stiff/crinkly\\", when the cat lies on it, the mat's corners curl up a little. If it was larger - more like a blanket - then it would be cozier, I think.All in all, I highly recommend it - just be prepared to \\"coach\\" your cat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Small, Crinkly and Pretty Much Useless","review":"I'm not sure how anyone gave this five stars but to each <cat> his own, I guess. My cat wouldn't go near his new igloo with this thing inside. It's flat and crinkly... not at all puffy and fluffy looking like the picture. I'm not even sure where it is now. I think my cat nudged it out of the igloo and the wind must have blown it away. Saved me the trouble of tossing it. I couldn't even think of another use for it.

The idea was that I would put one in the chair where he liked to sleep and one on the floor near my computer. Unfortunately, he hated them and he ended up flattening out a large paper bag to sleep on. I bought some catnip spray that supposedly would help a cat get used to a new bed. That didn't work either. You can check out my picture on this product--he sleeps fine on the paper bag. Some people said the mat is too small for a Maine Coon but so is the paper bag. I don't hate the product at all, it just doesn't work for my cat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly just a crinkly pet bed","review":"I cannot verify that this mat keeps my pets any warmer whatsoever. Like other reviewers, when I feel the bed either while my cats are on it or having just left it it feels like any other pet bed. Not scientific, I know. I would give it three stars if it were just that but when you add in the crinkling you lose a star! Not a terrible mat, but not a warmer mat. Just get your pets a regular bed with a less offensive print and no crinkle factor. (NOTE: this is a MAT = THIN; it is not a bed)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A treasure!

I am familiar with Aaron Sorkin's plays, movies and television series and find him to be a brilliant and insightful writer. I was hoping to learn more about his process, technique and where in this \\"whiz kid\\" his idea pool resides. Instead I found this collection of esssays to be tedious and overly-analytical in their review of minutiae in an attempt to find hidden meaning in words and phrases. Aaron Sorkin's works are perceptive and realistic in pace and tone and substance, but the contributors to this book have found very little positive and a great deal of perceived subtext to examine.

This book is full of half truths and spin. If all you want is fodder to attack someones religious beliefs then this is the book for you. It won't challange you or cause you to think, but then open mindedness is probably not an important trait of yours.If, however, you are truly trying to understand Mormonism and all that it entails, their are a number of books that are far superior to this one. I would recomend \\"No Man Knows My History\\" by Fawn Brodie or any book by D. Michale Quinn. Both authors are ex-Mormons but at least they try to take a more honost aproach to the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor at best","review":"Though not a member of the LDS Church, I am fascinated by Mormonism and have spent time studying it. It's definitely difficult for outsiders to understand the Mormon experience but this book sheds no light and does a disservice to it. This is an unfair and biased representation of the Mormon religion. In 48 pages, one can hardly delve into a religion and culture very deeply or accurately. On top of that, it's obvious the author has an agenda of his own and it doesn't have anything to do with presenting the truth. For a very interesting and fair look at the Mormon Church and culture, I highly recommend Mormon America by Richard N. Osting & Joan K. Ostling. Don't waste your money on this tripe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good source of historical mormon mistakes","review":"A simple book to keep a person updated on the history of the Mormon church. Mr. Ankerberg is another writer who puts the facts out for anyone to learn the hidden side of cults. This book serves as a current guide for people trying to not be swayed with the plagarized works of Joseph Smith. It's a great book to keep handy in case a young Mormon missionary is trying to persuade people who don't know the truth of the Mormon church and they certainly won't tell you. ie. blood atonement and secret handshakes, and slitting of the throat gestures in the obediant temples. I would recommend the book to anyone simply trying to avoid being told what the Mormons believe at this current time. It serves as a historical reference of how many changes the \\"prophets\\", always life-long Mormons, have covered up and changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"deceived","review":"I was looking for a book that told me about the actual facts and beliefs of the mormon religion and its followers. This book calls out certain elements and is based on author opinions of the religion. The description was decieving and led me to waste my money. I am not mormon but have family that are and just wanted to understand them more not know someone elses biased opinion about their faith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not necessarily the facts","review":"This book appears to be a factual non-biased account of the Mormon faith. However, it doesn't take long (by pg. 15) to realize the book is incredibly biased against the faith, to the point of refusing to recognize that the Mormon faith is indeed a Christian denomination. Read with caution: don't take it as a factual account without bias as there is plenty of negative bias about the faith in here for everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Information","review":"If you are interested in finding out facts about the Mormon Church that you can't hear from any Mormon then this book is good for you. It focuses mainly on comparing Mormonism to Christianity in order to prove that the Mormon church is not Christian. It's all backed up by other sources of literature, so as far as I can tell it seems like a pretty legitimate writing. It's short and has some pretty interesting information. Plus, it's handy to keep around in order to scare off any unwanted visitors. Good buy all in all."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Better than the Original","review":"The Foundation for Ancient Research and Mormon Studies (FARMS), which can be reached at 1-800-FARMS-15, has published a pair of reviews of the longer Ankerberg/Weldon book on Mormonism. At length, with abundant detail and ample references, the FARMS reviews show Ankerberg and Weldon to be unreliable, sloppy, uninformed, sensationalistic, even bigoted. Of course, as evidenced below, there are some who like that kind of book. So, for those who like such books, this is very much the kind of book they will like. For those who actually want to understand the faith of their neighbors, however, Ankerberg and Weldon are among the worst guides I can think of."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor research, poor facts","review":"The biases in this book are obvious. I wonder if the writer has ever set foot in a Mormon church, and sat through all three hours of meetings and services. He claims to know about the Mormon church, but has he investigated the original sources. Does he claim to have been in a Mormon temple? No, most of his \\"facts\\" are hearsay and rumors. If the writer has a point to make about religion, please tell me your beliefs; tell me why your beliefs are correct. Attacking others does nothing to inform people about the correctness of your beliefs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why not just ask a Mormon missionary what the facts are?","review":"I don't see much point on wasting time or money reading this book. To learn the \\"facts\\" about Mormons it would seem more wise to ask a Mormon than anyone else. It is clear to me that if you know what you believe is true, than learning the real facts about the Mormon religion wouldn't bother you, for truth is eternal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evolutionary but a lot of fun","review":"Medieval 2 builds on Rome: Total War, it looks similar and plays somewhat similarly, but is easily my favorite in the series. The simple joy of trebuchets battering down castle walls, sending enemy archers flying is complemented by the intricacies of dealing with the pope and crusades. In a nice improvement over previous titles, even a game that you seem to have won, having a large empire and plenty of cash can be challenging. The computer players are more aggressive and you will square off against equally large opponents; not to mention the arrival of the Mongol hordes!

This book is really a breath of fresh air that does a very good job as it is intended to. I, like most of you use one manufactures hooks.

I have rewatched this season a couple times since buying it in late December 2010, and I notice something new each time. (Shawn and Gus have lines that go by so quickly that it takes a few times to catch all of the references.) There are times when I don't get a joke that they make, especially since they make jokes across the generational gaps, but it just makes me appreciate the jokes that I do understand all the more. For Psych fans, Season 4 is a great purchase, and for those of you who have never seen Psych, try Season 1 first."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Psych","review":"Season 4 does not disappoint!

It is kind of different and it grew on me when I watched it on ION when they played it over and over but then they stopped it and I was actually looking forward to it being on. I went ahead and bought the first 2 seasons when they were selling for 12.95 at the time. I then bought 3 & 4 season a couple weeks later & they were 8.95. I now want to purchase 5 & 6 but it is now 20 bucks. I will wait until they come down again before I buy 5 & 6. All in all...I would recommend these to someone who wants something different in the comedic and quick witted line of a show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Psych is Awesome","review":"Psych always gets a 5 star...Hoping this season keeps it PG....Loved the first season best of all.

The new plotlines are fresh with even more witty words from Shawn and Gus, the greatest duo in TV history, (even including J.D and Turk from Scrubs!) In most series you can easily see a decline in quality and repetition as the seasons go on and on but not with Psych. The brilliant friendship between Shawn Spenstar and Gus TT Showbiz (extra T for extra talent...) continues to impress, they are perfect for each other and truly believable as best friends. I highly recommend this show to anyone and everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst Psych episodes","review":"The acting from the regulars was good as usual, but the rest of the cast are plain bad. The dialog is awkward, the jokes lame. After seeing all 6 seasons of Psych, I found the lamest and most unfunny episodes are written by Andy Berman. His episodes often feature car chases, shootouts and stuff, but the story is often boring and the dialog cringe-inducing, making the characters sound un-cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Show Ever!!!","review":"I love this show. It's so silly and ridiculous it's hilarious. It's great because even though I have seen every episode you can watch it over and over again.

I don't know why others aren't reporting this. This is my 3rd attempt at buying Psych videos. They all advertise 16 episodes on Amazon's description, and on the DVD case when they arrive, but they only have 8 episodes. Why aren't others reporting this or having this issue? Are they not noticing? Amazon sent a replacement for a previous DVD - same issue. I ordered the $30.00 something version this time instead of the $20.00 something option to see if that was the issue. Same problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of there best seasons","review":"It is not one of there best seasons, not as funny, not as creative. It was sort of a let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Ruin a Good Thing?","review":"Psych was by far my favorite show. But in this 4th season, they have taken a proven winner and mucked it up with \\"real life\\". The reason I liked it was the manner in which they solved the crimes, along with the comedy. Sure, it was wasn't reality, but that is why I watched it - for entertainment, not real life. Too bad they felt they had to \\"evolve\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the series","review":"Season four is quite possibly my favorite season, although season one comes in pretty close behind. Gus seems to find his own place this season, and Shawn has a nice thing going on at the beginning and end of the season (as usual). The first episode, \\"Extradition: British Columbia\\" is hilareous: Shawn takes Gus on the road to Canada, where he passes himself off as Santa Barbara's head detective and Lassiter & Juliet have to play second fiddle. Then we find out the whole reason he went to Canada: it was originally a trip he had planned for Abigail. I had to watch the episode again, because suddenly a lot of the scenes took on whole new meanings.I also enjoyed \\"A Very Juliet\\" episode - very touching, even if it does pull Juliet and Shawn apart a bit. Perhaps that's why in Season five he sends a picture of a dog to all of Juliet's boyfriends with a message \\"this is you\\". Ah, the on again-off again relationship between the two.If you enjoy the series, this is another one to add."},{"rating":"2","title":"Price is nice!","review":"I got this for like fourteen bucks. Excellent price! Psych is still awesome. The Yin-Yang conflict in each finale, however, is getting extremely tiresome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the best season yet!","review":"Psych is an all-around great show - the cast, the characters, the acting, the directing - but Season 4 was a fantastic season. As you get to see more about the relationships between the characters and they show you a bit more about how they all interact, it just gets better and better. The finale was hands-down the most amazing episode (stellar job directing, James Roday!), but some other favorites from the season are: Thrill Seekers and Hell Raisers (one of my all-time favorites), Death is in the Air, A Very Juliet Episode, High-Top Fade Out and The Devil's in the Details...and in the Upstairs Bedroom. I can't say enough about this show and I will be a fan for life. If you like a little bit of drama mixed with a hearty dose of humor and 80s references, you will love this show. I definitely recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of errors = buyer beware","review":"I found 5 errors in the practice exam questions and the solutions.I wrote REA a letter that outlined these mistakes in great detail.

In reality, none of these accessories came with the helmet, they are optional accessories. Then I saw that the mirror attaches to the visor, not to the helmet. No problem if you ride a recumbent or use upright handlebars, but with drop handlebars you can't use the visor (you can't see where you're going) and so you can't use the mirror.In contrast, Bell's Faction helmet is half the price and you can put a mirror on it. It has only a few small vents so you don't need a rain cover. In the winter I cover the vents with tape and fill them with foam. Plus the Faction comes down further on the back and sides of your head so it should be safer. And the shell is thicker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This book is not good. Lake seems to have had little real hunting experience. His stories seldom match other hunter's experiences in Africa and his \\"knowledge\\" of firearms and ballistics is non existant. He invents calibres as often as he invents his experiences. But not only does Lake's own stories lack the ring of truth, his tales of others (such as Col.Patterson, whom he absolutes cans) are often figments of a twisted imagination. Lake's experiences of african animals are almost totally opposed to other African gun writers whom I admire and provide evidence to back their stories, as well as having their stories supported by other African legands."},{"rating":"1","title":"You did not have Zero star","review":"This is a racist book probably because his author is a Jew that hates Arabs."},{"rating":"1","title":"the title doesn't match the content !?!","review":"the author claims to work on a scientific basis, but he only makes use of hypotheses and subjective interpretation.

READ THIS BOOK.","review":"This book provides excellent insight into how an Arab thinks, and why he thinks that way. Mr. Patai's roadmap of the Arab mind will direct you through a myriad of interesting, subtle behavioral traits and mannerisms. This is a scholarly work, and a substantial part of the book is dedicated to supporting Patai's somewhat stereotypical conclusions. Regardless, this book should be a Westerner's primer for conducting business with the Arab population"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read, but very academic","review":"The book was in great condition.

Can there be One?","review":"I lived in Jordan for two and a half years and read 'The Arab Mind' while submersed in the culture. I can't imagine a scholar of Arab culture would suggest such a bold title as 'The Arab Mind'. That is tantamount to suggesting there is a 'Western Mind'. Do Americans think like the French? Hardly. The book is good as long as you keep this in mind. There is no consistant view of the world eminating from Arabia. All one needs to do is look at the Arab League. A group of disfunctional Arab countries that barely can agree on where the sun sets at the end of the day. Again, there are good points in the book. But beware there is no panacea here.

Based on my own years of experience living in Arab countries, I can confirm that the prejudices and errors are rampant. Might as well say that all Americans are named Chuck, wear baseball hats and ride skateboards while shooting their guns. I was appalled to learn that the US goverment is using it as a manual for how to deal with Arabs. No wonder they've messed up so badly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Racist garbage","review":"Pure racism.

The examples he gives are mainly on Egyptians (not all are from illitirate villages), muslims. Remember they are africans too. what about Asia and the middle east? Patai gives few examples. This is not enough to judge an entire Arab culture. Patai seems to have forgotten about the Druze, Christians, Orthodox and Arab Jews. Not forgetting the Berbers and Kurds. In this book he mixes arabic with Islamic culture. Arabic culture existed quite long before Islam."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAUTION FOR OUR MILITARY: research book before reading","review":"Get some outside scholarly opinions before considering this book. A simple Wikipedia search will suffice (be sure to read the entry's references). The book's popularity and revival mostly comes from neoconservatives and, in turn, the Pentagon's use of the book as a basis for understanding the Arab culture and, subsequently, creating interrogation/torture techniques to be used on Arabs. From other scholars' views, this book seems by no means to be a work of which to base notions upon the Arab culture. \\"The book is described as simplistic, reductionist, stereotyping, generic, essentialist, outdated, superseded, flawed, unscientific and even intellectually dishonest by other scholars.\\" It saddens me that this book is given to our men and women in the armed forces.

There are no chunks or chips or chocolate, but rather just the entire bar is chocolate flavored.The organic and gluten-free ingredients are pleasing to me, and I feel they are of high quality.There is no high fructose corn syrup, thank goodness, in these bars. They do contain invert cane juice, which is 1/2 fructose. So, if you have an intolerance to fructose, keep this in mind.These bars remind me of Rice Krispie Treats, though not quite as dense or sticky. They can be messy for small children, but what kid doesn't like messy food? They stay very soft and fresh in their individual wrappers, too.I'd highly recommend this snack for adults or kids with gluten-free diets, or those looking for a yummy and sweet organic snack!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just plain good!","review":"I love the cereal on which these bars are based, so I wasn't surprised that these are also great. The only reason it doesn't get a \\"5\\" is so I don't water-down that rating by making everything I like a \\"5.\\" Make no mistake - these are great, there's just not something to make the bar stand out in a class by itself.

The kids that recorded this album should of waited a little longer because some of the songs are so rediculous for kids to sing. Like, Feel That Beat... this song needed to stay in the disco era where it belongs, the vocals were below-average, and it seems that their ad-libs were un-nessicary. The only tracks that are worth buying are the first 3 the rest are just rubbish.Recommended Tracks(or singles):One Step Closer - Great dance song.New Direction - Has a fun, urban, pop feel to it.We Got You - Its a remnance of kids singing fun and upbeat songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Freaks","review":"The people are such freaks they are just marketed rats.

Spears' first and second albums might be somewhat good choices but but your discretion would be advised.Here, however are a dozen of fun songs aimed at children by other children. All I have to say is, where was music for children when I was a child? All I had was adults with exaggerated warbling and Seasme Street!For all you teenagers and young adults who do not have kids, leave this alone. Don't listen to it and don't review it.

Don't do it - just load the software from the cd and then update it once it's installed. The product seems to work well, but I am wary about how it will react when new Windows updates are installed.

I found it to be a very informative read, and as a non-Mormon, it reinforced some of the opinions I have come to hold about the church. But I should clarify. I *have* read the Book of Mormon. I *have* attended the church. I have had protracted discussions with Mormon missionaries, and I have had six months of continued discussion with one person in Utah, firmly a member of the church. So all I have to say is this: how can you tell people never to read this book? Is the Church on such shaky ground that hearing the words of one \\"anti-lds psycho\\" will collapse the whole thing? If so, you should consider reading it yourself. Oh, and believing in Christ doesn't make you a Christian. Come on, you're Mormon, you know that, right? *Living a Christlike life* to the best of your ability makes you a Christian, and nothing else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?!?!?!","review":"Sorry this isn't a review, but what I think about what they are doing:Why do these people insist on driving members of the church of Jesus Christ away?

On the plus side, I've now got 20oz of liquid space, ending up with about 18 oz of coffee. Also, it's insulated, so the coffee stays hot a lot longer than it does in the Bodum. It is also a lot easier to press than the Bodum and does a better job of keeping the big grains outta the drink after the pressing. One issue that I have is I feel there needs to be another screen to filter some of the smaller particles during the pour. Also, a way to close the spout for when coffee is left in the container would be nice as well. Those two points aside, I replaced the Bodum with this one from Liquid Plant.

It is not tapered enough for my wife to get the plunger in the cup very easily without breaking the edges of the plunger or spilling the hot contents. She already tore up one of the teeth on the plunger. Fortunately the wire spring in the plunger and the teeth themselves are decently built.I find I have to put the plunger in sideways and then fiddle with it while it sits to get the lid on.I think this is a nice start, but if I need another one, especially considering the price, I would probably go back to a glass press."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will Not Shatter In Sink","review":"Glass coffee presses are pretty but extremely fragile.

I drink lots of coffee (especially on weekends) and I had been transferring coffee from my french press to my insulated thermos in order to keep it warm for a few hours. So, I started shopping around for an insulated french press. I was super excited when I opened this one up - it's lovely, it has a great pour spout, it's super large, it looked easier to clean than my other press, etc. etc. HOWEVER, it absolutely did not keep my coffee any warmer than my glass press. Could be a flaw in the design (the spout is always open allowing air to come in).

As another reviewer has said, the author appears to be hiding a gross racism. The horrors perpetrated by the subjects are all well-known and at least somewhat documented. However, it appears that the author has used those actions as a springboard for his own fevered imaginings. Wild descriptions of sexual slavery, cannibalism, disembowlings, and beheadings are strewn throughout this little book. That's not a bad thing in itself; I personally enjoy both horror fiction and extreme cinema.

Which of the conflicting stories that happened are real? Is Mary a character from the Nathan's books or his real partner? Does the anguish of sexual impotence happened to the writer or to the brother? Who stays alive?Cleverly described, conflicts presented reflect the reality of the world.

I would only suggest that in showing himself so much a master of the art of 'narrative alternatives' he takes from us a bit of the real sympathy we might have from people who having only one life and story, seem to us more real."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth a read","review":"kristin hannah entertains my thoughts as usuall. she is one arthur that i have to read all her writings. very light hearted"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwarming story :)","review":"I am a fan of Kristin Hannah's books and this storyline looked really interesting. I really did enjoy the book, but found it to be slow at times. Once it picked up, I found myself wanting to know more and more about the mysterious girl and what happened to her. It's not my favorite, but if you're a fan you will like this book. Hannah has written some really good books...The Things We Do For Love is my favorite along with On Mystic Lake."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well written novel","review":"This is not the first novel by Ms. Hannah that I've read but I believe it is probably one of the best she has written. The plot and the characters are well developed. The novel keeps the reader engaged. Although the ending is somewhat predictable, it is very pleasurable to see the way that the writer presents the resolution of the conflict in the plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands down, best book I've ever read","review":"The title of this book says it all, pure MAGIC. This is hands down, the best book I have ever read. This book pulled at every emotion, ranging from out loud laughter to crying my eyes out. Once I started, I couldn't put the book down! There are not even enough amazing adjectives to describe this book, I wouldn't even know where to begin. It is beautifully written from begin to end, and it left me wanting more. Definitely my new favorite book of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrible Beginning-Wonderful Ending","review":"I have read many Kristin Hannah novels and most of them I was able to jump right into and read through in less than a few days..this story was a bit more complicated. It was a very slow beginning and the characters were incredibly boring and/or unbelievable.I finally forced myself through the beggining and Im glad that I did. I have read other reviews and noticed that some readers were turned off by certain things that seemed too unrealistic-there are, I must admit a lot of situations that seem far fetched-but this is a fiction novel! Its a wonderful, magical story about love between a mother and a child, a father and a child, two sisters, and long time friends.If your picky and you want a FICTION novel made up of all real life instances dont read this book. If your a romantic and enjoy escaping with harshness of the real world with your head in a good book than you will enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another work of magic!","review":"Another tear jerker from Hannah! Took me a little while to get hooked into the plot of this book, but once I did it was hard to put down. As always with Hannah's writing the characters are well thought out--which is a big + for me. I truly believe if your not vested in the characters you'll never get truly invested in the story the authors trying to bring to life, but with Hannah this is never a concern!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reading!","review":"I've always been a huge fan of Kristin Hannah's and I daresay that this is her best book yet. In fact, it's one of the most riviting books I've ever read. Such an intriguing storyline and wonderful characters!

Ms. Hannah has a way of allowing the reader to connect on an emotional level with each of the main characters. The sections of the story told through the eyes of the child, \\"Alice\\", moved me to tears. This was a wonderful story of how trust is central to all human interaction and without trust, we cannot love.Tammy Wood"},{"rating":"2","title":"A CHILD WALKS OUT OF THE WOODS","review":"A scared/young girl walks out of the woods, and the people and town that help her adjust, learn and love and bond had me riveted to this page-turning book.

All of her books are so good and enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forced myself to finish this book","review":"There were times I couldnt put this book down, then times I wanted to put it down and never pick it up again. I found the adult want-to-find-love romance parts of the book boring, typical and predictable. I loved it when the auther engaged me as a reader about Alice and Julias work with her, I suppose I was expecting and wanting something more raw and realistic. I was annoyed with the flip-flopping on the book that was one chapter Julias love life or lack there of, Ellies love life or lack there of and then Alice and her progress becoming a socialized child. It seemed liked I was forcing myself to finish the book simply because I bought it. The ending was good, but good in a very predictable way that you can predict the end of a good romance film. If this book were split up into 3 different novels: one \\"Julia loves Max\\", another \\"Ellie doesnt know it yet, but she loves Cal\\" and \\"All About Alice\\"...They all would have been great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creating new tenuous relationships and renewing others","review":"A truly wild little girl is discovered in Rain Valley, Washington. Ellie Barton, Chief of Police calls her sister Julia Cates, a psychiatrist to come help. Julia just went through a traumatic ordeal of being sued by parents of a former client. Having no reason to stay in Los Angeles; she heeds her big sister's call for help. Julia is haunted by memories once she arrives home. As Julia works with the little girl she named Alice; her life and her sister's are changed for ever. Dr. Max Cerrasin is the man every available woman in town is after. He seemingly is attracted to Julia but is fearful of committing. Everyone has some secret to hide. This compelling novel will lead you on a roller coaster of emotions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love","review":"Love love love!! Another must read by Kristin Hannah to add to your list. There isn't a book I don't love of hers"},{"rating":"1","title":"It started strong, then fell flat","review":"I was enjoying the story, the elegant descriptions, and the characters for well over half of the story. Then as the plot progressed, I ended up feeling like a schmuck for wasting time reading it. Wrapping up every loose end in a predictable way turns out to be unsatisfying. I've never felt so irritated at a book for this reason. I don't mind endings that leave you thinking about the characters and what they could be doing. In this case, there's nothing left to wonder about. I wish I could have chosen a different book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The story of a young girl found in a city park after apparently living in the wild since a very young age, seemed intriguing at first. But, this was one of those times that I wish I'd read the sample before purchasing on my Kindle! The book read like a made-for-TV movie - very predictable at every turn. The story of Alice, the lost little girl, was the only redeeming aspect of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kristan Hannah's Best","review":"Kristan Hannah is a great author and Magic Hour is her best. When you read her books you are right there with the story. After you read one of her books no other author seems to be as real. I won't repeat the story as many other reviews have done that. I highly recommend this book. Just get a box of tisuses and read this book. You wont put it down until you finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book by one of my favorite authors","review":"Like all of her books, this one is told so well and you get to love all of the characters, espcially Alice. It's emotional, sweet, touching, and a great story. You will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I enjoyed this book as much as I enjoy all the Kristin Hannah books I have read. She really develops her characters in a way you learn to care about what happens to them. I highly recommend this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and predictable","review":"This novel was a selection of my book club and as such it was a letdown. While you could classify the book as a \\"good read,\\" so is a lot of mass market fiction. The characters are not well developed, and the author doesn't portray them subtly or fully enough for you to care about them. The plot as well as the writing is cliche-ridden, and the ending is pat. It is clear early on that the sisters will mend their relationship, find true love, and all will work out in the end. If you are looking for a recent, well-written book about sisters with more interesting plots and characterization, and a nice dose of humor, try Case Histories by Kate Atkinson or Rise and Shine by Anna Quindlen. A second-tier Anna Quindlen book is sharp, funny, and better written than most premiere efforts by other writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great summer read.","review":"Well written, strong plot, thoughtfully fast paced with no sudden twists or turns - just steady progression toward a not unexpected ending. This book makes you want to read more of Hannah's books. Content of Magic Hour ranged from feral children to the emotional healing of a psychiatrist to small town life in Washington state. The physical setting is reminiscent of the Twilight series and there was a moment of panic that she would drag a vampire into the storyline and ruin everything. Was disappointed when I reached the last page only because I was so drawn into the story and I hated to leave all those characters behind."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Special Story","review":"I loved this book.

I love Jack Casady's bass playing. I wasn't sure he could teach me how to play, though. This DVD is excellent. Jack and Jorma play several of the best Hot Tuna songs and then break them down so you can follow. There is also a printed insert with music and tabs to show you what is being played. It works very well. I am learning more in a few days than I learned in months trying to follow along with the records.I recommend this to all levels of bass players."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Don't waste your money. This poorly written account of an insignificant affair is replete with inaccuracies (it's Citronelle, not Citronville) and difficult to read due to the author's repetitive writing style. The author's main assertion, that this battle was somehow significant, holds as little water as the Laguna Madre. This unfortunate affair, which did nothing more than add a few more figures to the butcher's bill for the war, precipitated no great events and resolved nothing, coming six weeks after the surrender at Appomattox. The author's rampant pro-Confederatism buries any pretensions of an unbiased account and makes the work even more distasteful. Perhaps the only significance of this affair was to give partial rise to the \\"myth of the lost cause,\\" evidenced by the creation and publication of such a biased account two centuries later."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of his best ever!!!","review":"this is right in the alley way of a music video masterpeice! it had its little kinks that stray it from perfection but what is perfect? this video had me second guessing which music video of his was my favorite. smooth criminal will remain as my all time favorite but ghosts falls right into second place. i do think that the crowd couldve had more interaction with the plot but like i said before what is perfect?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Jackson is the best!!","review":"Can anyone tell me if this box set comes with the video of Ghosts, and is it in the VHS format, because I heard its hard to get a hold of it in VHS, I hope someone can help me.

The fridge holds only so many pictures on it and I find taping pictures to the wall leads to tears. You use the frames like you would a sheet protector with a sturdier plastic. The hanging itself kind of resembles a tarp like material. I haven't had to clean it yet, but it appears as though it would be easy to wipe off.

The con to this is that they would replay the last few minutes at the beginning of the next episode which is obviously their way of saying, \\"Last time on ...\\"Overall, there was drama (and I understand why Koreans call TV shows dramas, not shows), which is expected, but it didn't appear to be over the top until the end of the series. I was slightly disappointed as the beginning was very well-done.

It is a must read for those interested in law and public policy, and those bafled by the dizzying array of new laws and regulated promulgated each year. Howard does a masterful job of pointing out the mind numbing stupidity of certain laws and regulations, and how they adversely affect public policy. Using an array of anecdotes, stories, and examples, Howard drives home one simple point: We are a law happy society, and because of it, we are unable to use common sense or discretion to solve problems which are becoming increasingly unmanageable. From Mother Teresa to Superfund, Howard exposes the inherent contradictions of certain health and safety laws, and explains why this is the case. He also gets a bit more philisophical towards the end, explaining that the use of \\"offensive\\" rights has been the main culprit for some of these mind numbing laws, and that we need to use rights only as a defensive posture. Hats off to Mr. Howard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money--this book reeks!","review":"After reading the other reviews for this book, I thought I'd give the book a try, but boy! what a dud!!!

The chapters on his sailing experiences were trite, cliche, and frankly unbelievable--and the rest of the book is little more than yet another \\"hollywood tell-all\\" book by someone obviously frustrated and bitter by a failed acting career.

While the author has a great amount of clinical experience she has never made the jump from her intuition based on this experience to rigorously defining or confirming any of it. She honestly declares that she \\"has no numbers to crunch\\" and is \\"not in the numbers game\\".Because the author is so comfortable with untested ideas I don't feel that any of the information presented can be considered reliable.

His music sounds simple the same way Michael Jordan made basketball look simple. But in the melodies, harmonies, counter-melodies and rythmns I hear total genius.As for this particular CD, there are many fine arias, chorales and choruses. Sit back and enjoy these works of genius.

Pages and pages of lavish self-praise followed by childish backstabbing of just about everyone else who worked on the Ground Zero project becomes tiresome very quickly. And the book is written in the language and style of a college admission essay - extended lists of perceived accomplishments, but with the self-absorbed, giddy presentation of a seventeen year old lacking maturity or perspective. Libeskind may be the colorful sort of personality that gossip columnists love, but his writing is vacuous and the book is largely superficial. I was dubious about Libeskind before getting this book. Now I see why so many consider him a shallow, self-important buffoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it and you will Enjoy it.","review":"This book is about life through one man's experienc, but there is something in it for all.

Most importantly, there are no complaints, only optimism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Stuff","review":"Last time I checked, whinging was not the stuff of great men. Maybe it was the ghost writer who helped bring out Libeskind's inner wuss. For some reason this very sissyish book seems more like a dumb, trashy biography of Jessica Simpson or Anna Nicole. All of the malicious whining about the guys who bettered Libeskind in architectural competitions just seems unmanly, definitely not the stuff of professional role-models. (Maybe because he is so insecure, he also feels the need to remind us that he beat Izthak Perlman in a musical competition over forty years ago.) At best, this is a lightweight, hokey sort of memoir, but mostly it is an unbalanced, miserable and selfish book.

The world needs me and deserves my greatness. - In the second half of the book, Daniel seems to suggest that all other architects are barely talented enough to design toilets; that many clients are ignorant philistines; that Germans are stupid, and, that Museum Directors / clients are not worthy of his talent. He wraps up suggesting that life has taught him a lot and, with a bit of effort, you (the reader) could learn from and be like him. - After reading this book I was happy to accept that I'm completely unlike him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Rubbish","review":"I came across a pile of these books remaindered for 10 cents and figured - \\"Well, you can't go wrong for a dime, Right?\\" - WRONG!!

Shoddily written, \\"Breaking Ground\\" tries to \\"dumb down\\" architectural design for a lowest-common-denominator audience. But a sort of bossy haughtiness gets in the way, and Libeskind will probably insult the intelligence of anyone who suffers through this supercilious nonsense. His hyper-inflated sense of his own self-importance was unbearable after just a few crass and aimless chapters. (I decided that life was too short to waste time finishing it.)

Libeskind barely stops short of hair-pulling and face-scratching in his catty and cowardly attack. Similar stories of his other projects in London and Berlin left me with the impression that this very pretentious man has some misguided notions of his own importance and intellectual capabilities. Unfortunately, most of this poorly written account reads like tabloid journalism and Libeskind's relentless self-congratulation was extremely annoying.

(Really - it is THAT bad.) I don't know how it ever got published in this form. The parts where Libeskind tries to create a sense of urgency describing his wife Nina setting out to save the world for her husband's architecture are just ridiculous. [e.g. page 142, about the Berlin Museum, - \\"Daniel, this process will be drive you insane.

Libeskind seems very resentful of any other architect who is genuinely professional and talented and most of this book is just a tool to discredit any competitor he has come up against. I've never seen so many nasty comments about other people in a single autobiography. His super-sized vanity gets hard to stomach after just a few chapters. Reading this book about Daniel Libeskind's ideas on architecture was about as useful as, say, reading Rick and Cathy Hilton's ideas about raising a daughter well.

Halfway through the film, when the Plames begin having marital problems and the plot moved closer to an accurate portrayal of the actual historical events, I had hope that the film would end on this high note.

Valerie and Joe each have to make separate decisions about whether they should play it safe by keeping quiet or should expose lies perpetrated by some at the head of the American government.While it is not a five star movie, it certainly is more than a one star movie.

The directing is tight, the action moves right along, and the pace is just about perfect.I think it is a movie that anybody who likes a good thriller would enjoy.By the way... the ending sucks, as you are aware.NOTE: the principals do a voice over that's pretty instructive into what they went through during the period of time the movie takes place.

I know that when I have read Dilbert in the newspaper the past couple of years, I haven't laughed much compared to five or so years ago when Scott had me howling. Seeing all the strips together just supports that opinion. I don't know if the strip's reduced quality is due to the fact that Scott has been away from the corporate ratrace for several years and has lost touch with all the idiocy (he gets most of his ideas now from readers) or whether he has focused his energies on other aspects of the Dilbert world (TV show, marketing) that he doesn't focus on the strip like he used to do.This is a good book to have if you are a Dilbert book completest, but if you want to laugh get an earlier Dilbert strip compilation book instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as some other books from Adams, but still great.","review":"Somehow, as soon as you start to think Dilbert is dying and few new ideas are coming around to Scott Adams, he creates another succesful collection of hilarious comics.

I haven't laughed much at Dilbert the last couple of years and this collection confirms that. I have been a big fan of Dilbert since the early 90's, but I think Scott Adams' dependence on reader input for ideas instead of those generated from his own corporate experiences (he quit his job several years ago) is starting to drag the strip down. I also think Mr. Adams' is spending too much time on the business side of Dilbert (TV shows, product marketing) to give the strip the attention it needs. I hope that he'll remember what got him where he is today and focus his energy on his comic strip in the future.

Especially engaging are Christopher Mitchell's lengthy essay on the Lutheran perspective on the Song of Songs and Roger Cotton's shorter piece on a Biblical theology of Leviticus, drawing especially on Lev. 19.

I have seen some scenes where I felt that I was the only Anglophone who could understand the jargon. And that's because I was born and raised in Manhattan, the motherland of all mobspeak.

A cheap knockoff. A waste of time. I find it very depressing that this rubbish became so popoular...speaks volumes about the vast wasteland of popular culture. The fact that Don Imus tirelessly promoted it should have been a tip-off that it is bad.

I took it home, like a boy at Christmas, and unwrapped it. When I popped in the first tape though, there was this ringing...sort of like a modem or telephone. It made the first tape unwatchable. I returned it from where I purchased it, and exchanged it for another set. I took it home and watched all the episodes, somewhat pleased with what I saw. I popped in the 5th and final tape and it was broken. The tape kept cutting in and out and the sound was horrible. I have to take back my set today (FOR THE SECOND TIME). Take my advice, save yourself some trouble and rent it at Blockbuster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its no \\"Godfather\\"","review":"The popular Sopranos series can be summed up by saying that if you combined the elements of four other works, The Godfather, Analyze This, Throw Momma From The Train, and the TV series, Thirtysomething, you would get The Sopranos. Its almost like a comic book look at Mafia life. Not nearly as serious or dark as the original Godfather, the main charachter, Tony Soprano struggles through each episode grappling with the stresses of mafia life, avoiding sex with his wife, abusing his girlfriend, and taking out the garbage. The series does have its moments of interest; the soundtrack is hip and appropriate; the camera work is above par; casting is good. But watching the Mafia boss eating a bowl of cereal in his underwear while he swears at his sister is just a little too much white trash than I can handle for a series of this genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's so real, it reminds me of my childhood....","review":"Never since the 1980's \\"Wiseguy\\" mini-series have we had such an excellent example of great crime drama on TV.

Also, being that I'm from north new jersey, it made it even more enjoyable because I recognized almost all of the spots that they were filmed in. As far as the series go, it's a hit. I was a bit skeptical first because I thought I'd find it hard to get into after watching classic mafia/gangster movies such as Goodfellas, Casino and Scarface. But in the end I found it most enjoyable with some funny parts. James Gandolfini shines as Tony Soprano. He's the reason to watch this series. As far as the other actors go in their roles, it's mostly hit or miss. Meadow Soprano's performance is borderline fair and quite frankly the son (his name slipped my mine for some reason) is extremely annoying. But other than that, the first season was most enjoyable.

If you haven't seen it yet, you don't know what your missing. For those of us who have seen it, and already have it archived on tape, the DVD set is a worthwhile investment. The sound (Dolby 5.1) and video (letterboxed) quality is second to none, it literally floored me with the clarity (and I'm getting HBO through DirecTV as it is). The only thing that makes this set less than perfect, is the fact that the fourth disc only contains a single episode, a couple behind the scenes documentaries, and little else. There was plenty of room for additional goodies. The commentary is limited to only the first episode, and is not on par with some of the better Director Commentary tracks for other movies and series. Yet, in the end, it doesn't diminish the other benefits of having the Soprano's on DVD. I'm looking forward to seeing Season Two released on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"wuzup lilbro","review":"loveit loveit loveit i like that you get the complete first season in 1 boxedset i only need season 3&6"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sopranos is KILLER!","review":"For those unfortunate souls who missed out on the Sopranos phenomenom on HBO, this DVD is your answer. The first season introduces us to Tony, his family, Big Pussy, Paulie Walnuts, Uncle Junior and a whole host of great characters. This exciting and dramatic series is written with great characters and realistic dialogue. If you never see another dramatic series - you must see The Sopranos!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad people!!","review":"The people on this show are so mean to each other. They holler and cuss all the time, and even worse, sometimes they kill each other.

It actually DOES live up to the hype. I gave it 4 stars because it got melodramatic and slow in the middle; not what I would expect from a gangster series, but I guess it was filler. All in all, it was a great set, great packaging, and the 4 episodes per disk helps you stay up all night watching it and makes you late for work the next day. I would suggest timing it so that it comes in on Friday. James Gandolfini is superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding","review":"This is a fine example of what TV can be. There is nothing else like it. A must see. Highly addictive....where's the second season?"},{"rating":"2","title":"If only I could give more than 5 stars","review":"Clearly, one of the best offerings ever done in the made-for-television genre. From a production perspective, you couldn't ask for better casting or better acting. Gandolfini and Falco are entirely believable as a mob couple from northern NJ. Bracco turns in a great performance as a psychiatrist and completely separates her character from the previous mob related material she's done (Goodfellas).Even the components of the story that are not riveting (e.g. the ducks) are woven into the larger picture very well. A great mix of American family life, the grisly activites related with the underworld, and the torment faced by middle aged men who come to question their life, career and family.Special note must be given to Nancy Marchand, who sadly passed away last June (2000). Her character, Olivia, will be sorely missed in the Soprano family. This is a must have for your permanent DVD library.

The story is not very good, jumping back and forth between Tony's relationship with his mother, wife and daughter and his visit to a shrink. I had no problem at all with the nudity; too little of that. Personally, I prefer The Godfather to this crap and that steaming pile of cow dung known as Scarface with Pacino (the 1932 movie is better). I also like historical drama series' like The Borgias. Great storylines, meticulously researched for accuracy and wwell-built sets (unlike the obvious CGI \\"Sets\\" of Spartacus: Blood And Sand). Avoid this series and Scarface with Pacino.

Tony Soprano is such a beautiful character and I fall more in love with him (James) and the cast every week. I ran out the other day and splurged on the first season collector's set. I took it home, like a boy at Christmas, and unwrapped it. When I popped in the first tape though, there was this ringing...sort of like a modem or telephone. It made the first tape unwatchable. I returned it from where I purchased it, and exchanged it for another set. I took it home and watched all the episodes, somewhat pleased with what I saw. I popped in the 5th and final tape and it was broken. The tape kept cutting in and out and the sound was horrible. I have to take back my set today (FOR THE SECOND TIME).

Most of what I remember is a bunch of glowering punctuated by a few arguments and gunshots.The bulk of characters seem to represent a very mediocre brand of evil. They are human failures not because they gleefully engage in villainy, but simply because they are incompetent at living their lives. The acting, sound, and camera work were all quite competent, but since I was bored by the story, it was all wasted effort as far as I'm concerned.Certainly I'm aware of how popular the show is; the only other negative reviews seem to consist of people who can't deal with language or feel unfairly stereotyped. I figured I should take the time to say some people simply didn't think this was a very good drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"movie","review":"Just not my cup of tea. I didn't like it.

Everything about the show is amazing. I was hooked on the story line 10 minutes into the first episode and now i can say that I am completely obsessed. The worst part is that it makes watching the show on HBO not as good becasuse you have to wait 7 days between episodes as opposed to 7 seconds. I hope this show goes on forever and i look forward to purchasing the second season as soon as it comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive Sopranos","review":"Totally Addicitive. The acting is superb. In the first video all of the characters are repulsive. My first impression of Tony was fat and disgusting; by the end of the series he grew to be irresistable, undenieably sexy, and someone you would want to have on your side. I can't wait until the second season comes out on video. I would start watching it now on HBO, but fear that I would not begin in the proper order. The development of the characters is fascinating. Watching the next video, became a nightly ritual; The Sopranos, a glass of wine, and you have entered into a heartbeat of the subconscious."},{"rating":"2","title":"NO Closed Captioning","review":"First, let me say that I'm an avid Sopranos fan. I put the first-season DVD on my Amazon wish list and was thrilled when I was given it as a gift. I have a hearing problem and always use closed captioning while watching TV and videos. I have been disappointed to find that some DVDs that list CC don't actually have it. Unfortunately, The Sopranos: First Season is one of them. Yes, I do know how to use the DVD menu to select closed-captioning, but the only options listed are for quality of sound or the languages Spanish or French. Since my TV is always set for CC, that shouldn't be the problem. Consequently, I have to turn up the volume considerably, but still miss some of the dialogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sopranos: The Complete First Season","review":"Arrived in excellent shape.

I would never think that a series like this would have me laughing but some of the things in this show are too funny not to laugh at.

A word to the reviewer who thinks The Soprano paints a negative portrait of the Italian-Americans - you're wrong. Every culture has its own negative/evil side. The Sopranos does the best job showing the Italian-Americans from every walk of life....better than The Godfather, Goodfellas, and even Moonstruck. Look at that psychiatrist Dr. Melfi and her family.

The Sopranos is one of the best shows on TV today, and is probably one of the best shows in the history of TV. This story of a mafia boss and his 2 families explores notions of filial loyalty, the Oedipus complex, psychotherapy, marriage, parenthood, and much much more. Gandolfini is amazing as the conflicted Tony Soprano, trying to balance his home life with his other Family, the New Jersey Mob. Tony is at once repulsive in his violent and self-centered attitude, and yet lovable as a father who genuinely wants to do good for his family. And although Tony is the central character, every actor gets their chance to shine, and they all have their own feelings, stories, and demons. A great show that runs the gambit from drama to comedy and everything in between."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maxim's tone is too dry","review":"Actually I am not quite keen on Maxim's interpretation.

I never used it on my 16 hour flight as once it was inflated, I really had to stay in that position because if the seats next to you are full, there is no place to easily place it if you want quickly grab the earphones you dropped or something like that. Also, it kind of makes the person next to you claustrophobic when in use because it completely boxes them in as well.

It can be summarized as followed: there is an abundance of money on the planet, admit that you want and love money, be true to your goals, and be generous with others. If you do so, all the money you will ever need need will come your way. He suggests that you put a lit candle in a window for a week along with a letter saying that you want money for all the good you've done in this world, and ......voila ! A truckload of money will soon be dumped in your lap. (This is how the author puports to have obtained $15,000. WOW.)

Most of the stories have the girl as the main character, and the father is a leading influence. You can read a sample from this collection online at the Ploughshares web site, a very reputable literary publication and the source through which I found this author. The story, \\"Mr. Sweetly Indecent,\\" was selected as one of the best short stories of the year a few years ago by Best American Short Stories, a popular annual, and is my favorite piece in the anthology. I hope to see more writing of Ms. Broyard in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daddy Dearest?","review":"A much less then enjoyable collection of stories. The type of material one expects from a student of the many writing programs around the continent. All of the stories feel incomplete and grounded in the idea of writing about something, but not having really experienced anything in a real life. It isn't that the author doesn't have the ability to construct a story, it's just that she doesn't have anything really meaniful to say. Most of the collection reminded me of the early Ann Beattie. I feel bad, I feel sad, or isn't life a bummer. The passivity of most of the women in this collection was also a real turn-off, in each story their helplessness sounds like a repeat of the past one. And this collection has the strangest group of Daddies around-cold, indifferent, almost always vague. It's interesting that three of the stories were winners of competitions when originally published. It just goes to show that a decent story in isolation does not a great collection make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Father's Day gift","review":"The author is a good fiction writer. But the cover is misleading. It's a collection of stories about insecure young women discovering relationships with men, with parents, with the world. Not a young woman's relationship with her father, as I was expecting from the cover. Too bad. Also, it is written for a teenage or twenty-something female audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading title--","review":"From the title I thought this would be a book about the tender relationship between fathers and daughters. Instead, it's a collection of stories that have little to do with father-daughter relationships. A father is present in many of the stories, that's about it. There is little tenderness. The farther you get from the front of the book the farther you get from any sort of tenderness. It's a fast read (i read it in a day). Based on the title I was hoping it could be a book I could give to my father on my wedding day (next year). After reading it, I wouldn't even give it to a friend on her birthday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bundle of Garbage","review":"I purchased the EasyShare Bundle a few years ago. It was my first digital camera and last EasyShare as I just placed an order for a Sony Cyber-shot DSC-W290.

I have two big problems with this product. The first is that I assumed I'd save some money on batteries switching from lithium (from my last camera) to regular AA's. One pair of batteries did not last even one Thanksgiving afternoon(about 30 photos in all.) Part of this is due to my second complaint which is the on/off dial. It is VERY loose so that almost every time I put the camera away in my purse or baby bag, when I retrieve it the camera is already switched on. I wish I'd gone ahead and bought a decent camera though it would have cost two to three times the cost of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh.","review":"Loved this camera the first month or so that I owned it. Two years later my feelings are very different. Batteries need to be recharged constantly. Camera rarely turns on after being off it's dock for more than an hour.

They said they are aware of the problem on some computers running Windows XP. It is now several weeks later and they still don't have a fix. They don't really seem to care either.It might not be a bad idea to consider other brands, instead of Kodak. Since, if the software won't work properly, then what good is the camera?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless except in bright light","review":"The camera takes decent pictures in bright light, but it's useless in any sort of dim light. The flash is weak (probably because it has to run on AAs), so only close subjects are well-lit; and there's no autofocus lamp, so it can't focus unless you've got bright light.

This camera was purchased by someone who is no longer here. If you want a reliable camera that takes decent shots, don't buy this camera. I carry this camera in a bag and it always turns itself on so the batteries get wasted. It doesn't always turn on the first time you switch it on. You have to switch to a special mode to get a decent close-up shot. It can't handle shots in dim lighting so unless it's really sunny out or a really well-lit room, forget about using this camera. Colors don't always appear right. Bright reds sometimes turn out looking orange which isn't good if you're selling a bright red car. In my humble opinion, Canon is the way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great buy!","review":"I purchased this for my daughter since I had already had purchased one for myself.

I had pictures in the memory and there was no way to retrieve them.I called customer service and all they were interested in was selling me another camera at around half the original price. They also wanted me to pay shipping to and from their office at around [...] each way.Buy the camera if you feel adventurous but beware that you probably will not be able to get service when you need it most.Also forget about buying the docking port - it is very expensive to print from it... both the paper and the ink cartridges.

What I got instead was a rather smart thriller that was more Alistair MacLean than Stephen King. In fact, this was like a MacLean espionage thriller with quite a bit of Dean Koontz-like horror elements grafted onto it, as a research team attempts to uncover the mystery of the Loch Ness Monster, with various individuals attempting to sabotage the expedition. A mysterious stone covered in runes also features into the story.

Mere words fail to describe the sheer genius that are the Mr. Hughart's efforts on Master Li and Number Ten Ox. The three books in this omnibus are so cleverly written, so unfailingly humorous and so totally poignant that other works will hereafter be spoiled for me. The author does state that he could have written more adventures for these characters after these three, but that they would have been formulaic, and what would be the point in that? As accurate as that may be, I mourn the fact that the world has no more to look forward to from this amazing author and his two phenomenal characters.

I was quite pleasantly surprised by this book, since I had never heard of it or the author before. The writing style is quite lyrical and charming, and the plot is fast-paced. The adventures are often solved through some quite humorous actions through the efforts of the two main characters. Almost in an action-adventure movie style, the author commonly has the heroes go through some seemingly-pointless activities, which are later revealed to have been a clever attempt to foil their enemies or get around an insurmountable obstacle.The only drawback to the hardcover trilogy is the cost; the current listed price on Amazon is ridiculous. This is certainly a worthwhile book, but I don't think that it's worth the amount that the private sellers are charging.

The switch has proven to be very disappointing. After only six months of service the light now only switches on when and how it wants to. Many times when I try to turn it on, I must try several times to get any response at all, and then it may light brightly, it may light at a very low level, or it may flicker for a while and then go out. This behavior occurs with alkaline or rechargeable batteries. My first led light lasted for over eight years; this one is useless and undependable in less than eight months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Floody beam, perfect for tradesman or anyone in the dark about flashllights","review":"You have to spend money to get a good product. This flashlight is one of the best when it comes to price vs. runtimes vs. brightness vs. durability. I can not think of one better flashlight that fills the niche like this little guy. It is a high performance product that has a great floody beam. This flashlight will not be suitable for a cop or for someone who needs a 200 lumen cannon to light up the other side of a ravine.

However, if you're choosing between this album and anything by (Church, Bocelli, Watson, Garrett or Brightman),then PLEASE buy this instead.

When he does opera he has an incredible warmth and presence, as well as a way with the text that I thought would carry over to Broadway music.Unfortunately, this is not the case and his renditions rival the Three Tenors in terms of being horrible interpretations of classic showtunes. He sings everything in an overblown manner without a trace of subtlety or lyric sensibility. The arrangements do a disservice to the numbers as well. All in all, this is one of the worst albums I have ever purchased, and I instantly gave it away after my first listening.If you want to hear opera folk sing Broadway and do it well, buy Dawn Upshaw's I Wish It So or one of Jerry Hadley's cross over albums.

The quality of the recording on both CDs is terrible, more like what you would expect of archival material from the 20s or 30s.There are only four tracks that feature Ustad Allah Rakha's live playing prominently, and in these he is backed by one very, very repetitive instrument. The second CD is music from film scores, and in many instances the tabla is both hard to hear (due to singing and sound quality) and quite repetitive.The CDs were a massive disappointment and also arrived damaged.

When I got this one, I REALLY liked it. The gauge was accurate and made it easy to properly fill the balls to the correct level. However, after less than a year, the pressure gauge part started coming off (it uses friction to stay together) and it got increasingly difficult to use without it coming apart. I tried gluing it with several different adhesives, but could not get it to stay together for more than a few uses. Also note that the picture shows an inflation hose. Mine did not come with that and thus it was a little tricky inflating balls without breaking a needle. I would NOT let my kids use the pump for this reason. It's a shame because I really did like it when it was new."},{"rating":"1","title":"picture is misleading - there is no hose!","review":"I had the version of this pump without the gauge and wasn't happy with it because it didn't have a hose - you attach the needle directly to the pump shaft.This is a problem because you have to be very careful when pumping your ball or else your needle will bend - you must keep the pump shaft straight and steady.Because of this issue, I bought a new pump. I saw this version of the power pump on amazon and it was a little more expensive but the picture showed a hose, so I bought it. Big mistake. No hose, and it's still annoying to pump balls with. I'm returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I bought this pump at Target. It pumps, but the check valve leaks, so the air just leaks back out through the pump.

The PSI gauge was great. However, after a while, the tip and air hose just broke off. I actually bought this at Target, which cost 15 dollars. I actually had some epoxy glue I used, which made it last a little bit longer, but after that the thing just stopped pumping air. Sometimes if I get lucky, I can pump it a certain way and it will pump, but it take extra strength to do so and it takes much longer.I just ordered the Fraklin one of Amazon.com and hope it is better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this one, bad design and will breakt the needle easiy.","review":"When I fist got this, it seen to a good one, and the bag can be reuse and and can be zip. but the I found the out when I pump the ball, it break my needle very easil.y mainly due to the poor deisng that doesn't leave too much space between the pump and needle, which will easily breakt he needle, avoid this and get a different one,."},{"rating":"1","title":"No help","review":"I studied these words constantly and learned a good 300-400 of them.

When the gold falls through the floor into the tunnel everyone starts fighting. But during the fighting people keep talking about how Iron Robe has set a \\"signal\\". Minutes later after the fighting is done, the movie proceeds to show Iron Robe taking away the gold and Hai To sneaking onboard underneath the cart.

When you read the title you probably thought, \\"This is just another book about how we would be in hell without Jesus.\\" That's what I thought at first too. Instead it tells how Jesus impacted this world, even after he ascended into heaven. It also tells how some Christians impacted the world.At times I found this book a bit boring, but that's what I expected when I started the book(since I'm only 14 years-old).Overall, if you want to read a book about how Jesus and Christian leaders impacted this world, you could probably find a better book elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"book full of false facts...","review":"The book should be lsted as fiction, and not under history or theology. Mr. Kennedy should keep his act to the TV, where he can present baseless facts. His subjective biased argument does not help in promoting christanity, a more obejective would. \\"A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom\\" by ANDREW DICKSON WHITE does a far better job in presenting an objective analysis on impact of christanity on science.

A lot of non- Christians could benefit from reading this book- it is an eye opener. The extensive influence of Christianity in the world, and its impact on the U.S. goverment and the world made me weep, when I realized how much Jesus has affected this world, and how much would be lost if He had never been born. The non-Christian population has no idea how much they would lose.

I can't believe this is the same author who wrote Wicked. I found myself wanting to quit this book or at least read another book along with it because it is slow and it rambles. Mr. Maguire flips back and forth between the Liir now and the Liir from Wicked. Sometimes there's no warning of the flipping. It's in the middle of the chapters and there's no rhyme or reason. Just sad that he felt the need to write this book without a clear picture in his head of what he wanted. I think this is a typical middle book of a series which he's obviously writing now since Amazon has up as a subtitle Wicked Years 2. Middle books usually are just about what is going to happen. Which based on the ending I think will be something wild. Oh well. I'll chalk this one up as a rush job and try to remember to pick up another one of his books sometime in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking","review":"You may want to read this book, most likely because of your familiarity with his other pieces. You may know he is a very talented writer. This book lacks all of the direction and coherence that Wicked offered, however, and comes off as a confusing plumb-the-depths-of-whatever-soul Bildungsroman. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed Wicked and how little I enjoyed this. Alas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been so much better","review":"This started off with so much promise but fizzled in the end. The pace for the first 2/3s flowed well, defining the characters and tasks at hand. At a moment that changed the main character (Liir), the book also makes a drastic change from a crafted discription of the events of the life of the son of Elphaba to an all out sprint. I was left wondering what happened to the tale? Were the last 100 pages just thrown together so the book could have an ending? If it hadn't been for the beginning, I'd call this work garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring book, even more boring narrator","review":"Perhaps I didn't care for this sequel because of the narrator: Maguire himself! I could hardly distinguish characters because Maguire barely mastered one voice, let alone several. Talk about monotonal. I hope next time he gets a real actor to actually engage the listener."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling novel, by a talented author.","review":"Though a sequel to Wicked seemed a little unnecessary, the novel, Son of a Witch, turns out to be a capturing and intriguing work of literature. True there are some slow and dull parts as others have mentioned, but Maguire's excellent writing skills cover for the loss of excitement.The protagonist Liir, is a complicated character who is more than anything trying to find his place in the world. He is not certain whom his true parents are, where he came from, or what purpose his life has, if any.And as for the setting: Maguire's vision of Oz is one of a land twisted between religion, cultures and political powers. Such detail to atmosphere makes Oz seem as real and alive as any place on earth.Ultimately, Son of Witch is a grand sequel by an accomplished author. In my opinion, the book is definitely a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mooooo","review":"Moooo. I feel like I have been milked of my money and time. Unless you feel the need to supplement the author's income, do not buy this novel. It is filled with all of the short comings of Wicked and none of the charm or invention. Do yourself and your wallet a favor and read a few pages at you local library or book store. You may find it overwritten, meandering, and in the end frustrating. Oh yeah, what end? You will get to the last page and find that you will have to wait for yet another sequel before there is any resolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay","review":"Expecting the story to be a continuation of \\"wicked\\" and why would i think differently when the author promoted that way...really this story is all over the place, like the author is purposely trying to \\"unwicked\\" this book. only should read if your really, really a fan of this author. an example of all over the place...the character trism who comes between liir and candle...huh?.otherwise...go back to oz."},{"rating":"1","title":"So...boring...","review":"Son of a Witch is the story of Liir, who may or may not be Elphaba's son, and what he does following her death. The answer to that is 'not a heckuva lot.' He wanders around, joins the army, meets with some birds...This is a profoundly boring book. It picks up at about the halfway point, but doesn't come to any sort of thrilling conclusion. In fact, this book seems like a bridge. As to what, I do not know. Apparently, there's a third book featuring a lion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Filling in the holes","review":"My largest complaint with the story of \\"Wicked\\" was the large gaps of missing time between sections of chapters.

But I had to force myself to read it because I have never quit on a book in my life. I absolutly HATED IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even worse than Wicked.","review":"Most people in reviews only criticize the writing in the book, but we all know that Maguire isn't a very good writer. The main problem with this book was the same as the first, only to a much greater degree. Maguire throws the history of Oz out the window and spits in the face of L. Frank Baum's creation. He changes characters and events and completely disregards them, rather than taking the intelligent option and merely writing his story around the original events. This book serves to frustrate the reader, no matter how many original Oz books they have read, but for someone who loves Oz, it is a complete insult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected as a sequel to a great book","review":"I am greatly disappointed after just completing the book. I dove right into it after finishing Wicked. I suppose, I should have just thought about it for a minute. A popular precursor? A sequel a few years later? What will it bring? Major disappointment.Combined with a boring plot (the writer seemed to get lost up until 250ish) and was stringing (barely) a few different situations together, which, in the end, came up to be a huge mangled mess with an open opportunity for a sequel.One thing that caught me off-guard with this novel was the romantic situation with Liir and Tism. What? Where the heck did this come from? Just did not seem to fit. A crush or something would have been acceptable and would fit perfectly because of Liirs' past and his lack of a father figure, but to create a big love triangle right at the end, what?Full attention is needed for this book. You will be reading and suddenly get ADD. BE WARNED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wickedly Disappointing","review":"It's certainly not a sequel. I give you that. However, Son of a Witch pales in comparison to its predecessor. Wicked artfully conglomerated politics and plot into a delightful story, flip-flopping all of the notions of Oz that were planted into our heads as children. Elphaba becomes a heroine, Glinda seems more vapid than a kiddie pool but oddly clever at the same time -- everyone is relatable.Son of a Witch's overriding weaknesses are its over-reliance on skimpy metaphors, its pale and unrelatable characters (it wasn't just Elphaba who shone in Wicked), and its too overt political message. Politics are all well and good, but leave the reader to do a little bit of the work . . .We've seen all of this before: flying on brooms, identity crises, an attempt to visit powerful politicals . . . Give me a break. Give me a better plot. And give me characters I can root for."},{"rating":"1","title":"One big fat - eh","review":"Basically I'd give this book a rating of \\"eh\\". It seems like a book I'd like. It is written in a perfectly competent manner. It has a creative idea at its root. It is internally consistent. It just didn't pull me in.I just can't seem to find any soul soul in Maguire's writing and execution of the concepts. I really like his idea and his premise. I enjoy fantasy. I enjoy satirical fantasy. I just can't get excited about his books.Then again they are written in an ok fashion and not bad per se I just don't get pulled in so maybe it will work for someone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine journey back in Oz","review":"Wicked was one of those novels that, upon finishing, I was disappointed to have to leave the characters behind. So naturally I was happy to learn I could return to Gregory Maguire's well-crafted revision of Oz in Son of a Witch.I must confess, I didn't find this follow-up as compelling as the original, but I enjoyed it for what it was - a fast-paced, rollicking tale set in a deeply detailed environment.I suspect that those who haven't yet read Wicked will find themselves a bit lost. But then again, that is completely in keeping with the feeling of the main character, Liir, as he tries to determine who he is and what he should do next."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wanted To Enjoy This Book","review":"I guess my mistake was thinking that this was actually going to address the title of the book. After dragging myself through parts of this book, I found that in the end there were way too many loose ends and an obviously stage setting for a sequel. This never works for me, and surely didn't here. If you are looking for any answers this book is not going to reveal them. Wicked was great, this one is not!"},{"rating":"2","title":"decent enough read","review":"*spoiler alert*liir was such indecisive character. He spent most of his time either escaping reality or thinking about how possible it was that elphaba was his mum. The story was extremely slow at times, but as if on que would pick up the pace once it got too droll. I didn't really have anything against the excessive self discovery/realisation bits, but I was definitely pissed off at how after all that happened, he was still the same wishy washy character he was at the start of the book. After all his wanting to be emotionally attached to someone, he just HAD to go and mess things up by being indecisive. Ah well, if only the end didn't leave you in the dark about so many things, like: Is he a bi? Has realising who his mum is, changed his perception of himself? Did the chic abondon him because of the baby(or his divided affections), or did she really try to lead the soldiers away from him?"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Wickedly\\" Wonderful","review":"If Wicked was good for you you will enjoy this sequel so much!highly reccomended, it made me become a fan of Maguire's work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"REALLY wanted to like it...but I hated it.","review":"I've read all Maguire's books, I'm starting to think that Wicked was just a brilliant fluke because not only have I been steadily disappointed by every thing else after but he is now approaching the point of being just unreadable to me. If you've read Lost, and you feel as I do that it was just the most awful stuff put to paper, then trust me, you will think this book stinks. It's a meandering, pointless, thunderous bore; I hated the protaganist Liir, he's a pathetic, wimpy character and I am p*ss*d that keep buying this guy's books because they always look so promising. Though I can never bring myself to throw a book away I want to toss this dumb thing in a land fill, I'm so annoyed! Never again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A sorry follow up to \\"Wicked\\"...","review":"I couldn't even force myself to read this entire book. I loved \\"Wicked\\" (and am also a fan of the musical) but \\"Son of a Witch\\" (though cleverly titled) wasn't as amazing. The beggining of the book held my attention and made me want to read more, but as I went the interest fell and the book droned. The main thing that turned me off was the tedious quality of this book--I have always been very attentive to detail (this is one reason why I loved \\"Wicked\\") and \\"Son of a Witch\\" was either completely devoid of it, or it was disgustingly oversauced in it. Wither way, the plot becomes amazingly confusing and ridiculous (reminds me of a soap opera). I had to stop reading because I was so bored and confused (both at once--weird I know)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read it if you want no questions answered","review":"I really enjoyed the first book in this series Wicked. I thought it was quite enjoyable but it left you with many questions, Was Liir her son? What happened to Nor? And I thought that these would be answered in Son of a Witch. Well...they're not. Liir's mother is only slightly hinted to in the last sentance of the book and *SPOILER ALERT* you never find out what happened to Nor!! That was 3/4 of the reason I read the book. Plus you also never find out what happened to Candle or the Maunuts. It's like Maguire left room for a whole other novel at the end of this book. There are WAY too many unanswered questions that made me so angry I wanted to throw the book across the room when I was done! Don't waste your time reading this if you think you're going to get any type of answer out of it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Resolves nothing from Wicked","review":"I was disappointed. This book lacks the passion of Wicked, and it doesn't really continue the story from the original book. It tells a largely unrelated tale about Liir, who is fairly insignificant in Wicked. It isn't really even the story of Liir but more like a sequence of events that he drifts through. So beyond being disappointed that nothing from Wicked is resolved in this book, I didn't find the story engaging. Liir is never passionate about anything he does, which leaves the reader wondering, who cares? Fans of the original book will want to read it anyway. Others shouldn't bother -- but do read the original. And see the musical. Both are outstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I typically love Gregory MacGuire's books, however this book was a huge disappointment.This book was very slow moving..very little action. I never came to like and or care about Liir, sadly I was happy to see the book end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Unnecessary","review":"I loved Wicked so much, and as others have stated Son of a Witch was such a huge disappointment. I was two hundred pages into the book wondering when the action was going to take place. This sequel does not add a thing to the original story, and I feel like readers are better off wondering what happened to the characters of the original rather than reading Son of Witch."},{"rating":"1","title":"very boring.","review":"Didn't really enjoy the first one but it was much better than this one. Story is just plain boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've read!","review":"I have read all of Gregory MacGuire's novels (starting with the brilliant Wicked to this one) and I have to say that this book ranks as one of the worst books I've ever read. Sounds pretty harsh, but I say this as a warning, if you read Wicked and want to read another good book by this author, then read Confessions of an Ugly Step Sister, if you read that then read Mirror, Mirror. Yes, I'm leaving out Lost, because it was not one of my favorite books either.So why didn't I enjoy Son of a Witch, well it just didn't feel as if it was going anywhere. The entire books feels as if it could have been condensed down to two chapters and used as the introduction to a complete story.In my own opinion this book was written only to capitalize on the popularity of Wicked and to give the writer more time to write a better novel (hopefully it won't be a sequel to this novel)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A serious audio disappointment...","review":"The book is wonderful, like all of Maguire's books, in my opinion. But if you listened to \\"Wicked\\" on CD, then you will be very disappointed by Maguire's performance of his sequel. Both novels are very dramatic, full of fantastic, extraordinary characters. And any rendition of them ought to be colorful and highly interpretive. Unlike \\"Wicked\\", Maguire's interpretation is bland and predictable, losing the emphasis on both the humor and the horror.Buy the book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"rushed the sequel","review":"I really liked Wicked, but this sequel was awful. it felt like maguire rushed to write it to appease the publishers...or he was just trying to get it done and out of they way. either way, it was a terrible follow up to Wicked."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bland sequel to a great book","review":"While I absolutely loved Wicked, Son of a Witch screams of Maguire's want to capitalize on its success. There are some interesting passages within the book, albeit generally slow, but you won't find anything as creative or interesting as those in the original.Liir, the book's main character, feel two-dimensional and lacks a life-like personality. It is true that he is on a search for himself, but he just doesn't seem to find it. The book fumbles around for some point, some climax, but there isn't anything of the sort.Also, the inclusion of the original Oz characters feels gimmicky at best. They spout boring, predictable phrases that make me long for the innovation of Wicked.The book isn't terrible, but it's clearly a corporate move, rather than an actual want on Maguire's behalf to farm his creativity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sequel to Wicked","review":"This is the sequel to Wicked. It was slow to get going but eventually got it's rythm. Rather disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible waste of money and time-very disappointing","review":"TOTALLY unnecessary homosexual themes added toward the end of the book-very angry I had read almost the entire thing and then was bombarded with homosexual agenda at the very end.

This book is going in the trash and I will NOT be buying the third installment in this series. VERY DISAPPOINTED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"Why is it movie producers and best selling authors feel compelled to send us dreck on the heels of a tightly crafted story well told? Presumedly greed and a profound disregard for the intelligence of the audience drive this. Son of a Witch barely aspires to being a sophomoric (sorry to the sophomores out there) ode to teenaged angst told against a backdrop of the Sound of Music, Dr Doolittle, Lord of the Rings, and The Wizard of Oz all stewed into a thin soup served in a very shallow bowl. One Star because zero wasn't a choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have not recieved it yet :{","review":"iCAN NOT REVIEW SOMTHING i HAVE YET TO RECIEVE AND HAVE YET TO GET A RESPONSE FROM THE PERSON i ORDERED IT FROM.

The fun from the original, the reimagining of Oz, is gone, and we are left with some dreck that Maguire stirs around which comes to nothing in the end. Maguire needs to get a real editor and stop writing endless scenes of bland, characterless dialogue that don't mean anything to the story at large. I seriously cannot tell you how disapointed I am in this book. If you are looking for a pointless paperback fantasy, this book will be fine. If you are looking for something literary, look far from here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"First I should say that I did not read Wicked but saw the touring musical. I loved the show and was excited to read the sequel. What a huge disappointment. The book is dark, dreary, and depressing. It could have more successfully functioned as a short story as most of the book dwells on Liir either denying his lineage or whining about his lack of direction in life. His character is poorly developed, in fact, it's not developed at all until the end of the book and even then he still let's life happen to him. And what a poorly concocted ending that merely sets up another book to milk the Oz name. Hopefully the talented folks who put the Broadway musical together can lend their magic to this sequel and do justice to the character of Elphaba we fell in love with on stage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Son of Witch no match for Wicked","review":"Got this for my daughters, 13 and 23.

Looking forward to possibly borrowing the book after they are done to read it myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author should have stopped with Wicked!","review":"This book contains long periods of boredom with minimal amount of interest. It is a true let down from it's predecessor. The author should have stopped while he was ahead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two's a Charmer","review":"Easily my favorite of Maguire's Wicked series, this is the back story of the wizard of oz, glinda and the wicked witch of the west. Starting with the discovery of a badly beaten Liir, the book traverses the kingdom and gives us a peek behind Dorothy's oh-too-rose-colored glasses. Dark and sometimes bitter, Son of a Witch takes us through the witch's life and times as seen through the eyes of the man who may be her son. This story easily stands on its own, and is a wonderful ride through a war-torn and tyrannous Oz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"I really enjoyed Wicked, and when I saw that there was a sequel I got really excited. I didn't really know what kind of storyline could be created with Liir, so I was very curious to see where Maguire was going with this. I have never been so let down by a book in my entire life. The whole book seemed pointless to me because it didn't go anywhere, and everything Liir set out to do was never accomplished. The ending was also terrible. I don't even want to read the third book because this one was so bad. Do not buy this book! If you must read it get it from a library, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Son of a bore....","review":"I'm not sure exactly what other customers are reading, but I found this book interminable wit but a scant few highlights. Yes, I get the themes of finding yourself and forgiving yourself but this book is SO boring. I'm pretty sure I spent the longest time reading this book, wondering why I was continuing at all. From the longwinded descriptions(do we REALLY need 1,000 detailed descriptions of the Kells?) to the story that sometimes gets interesting for a few pages then slides back into it's neverending descriptions of events that most authors would spend a line or two on. Not sure why he wrote this as it really adds nothing to the mythos of the world he borrowed and made his own. VERY dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait for the last installment!","review":"Granted, this is not Wicked. But it is an excellent book, and I love where Maguire has taken this tale. I can't wait to read what must be a third book in this series - I am intrigued about the \\"loose ends\\" others mention - think of it like \\"empire strikes back\\" and you'll be okay with it!! Liir definitely does his share of whining and wandering in the desert, but the themes that echo our current politics and the revelations he makes at the end are fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and engrossing, but not the original","review":"I have been a Gregory Maguire fan for years, long before the fame of the musical brought him into the limelight. When I first read Wicked I knew he was genius. I also loved the musical, after I got over the initial shock of the plot differences. So I was quite excited to read this sequel. Overall, I was not disappointed. It is not as good as the first book, but worthwhile all the same. Maguire shows the same depth and creativity that attracted me in the first place. His writing style is very unique and I can see how many would be put off by it. This is not light reading and takes some concentration. This is a journey of self discovery, not an action-packed adventure. Anyone expecting a fluffy Oz story or a Broadway romance should look elsewhere. But if you're interested in really exploring the complexities of legacy, heritage and nature vs. nurture, read on. This is a fascinating tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick To Writing !!","review":"Maguire is a fine writer but is way out of his league narrating. His voice and inflection are downright disturbing. At times his reading takes on a monotonic, robotic tone that sounds like Robby the Robot! I hope there is another edition ot there because I don't think I can make it through listening to him. And I do listen to audio books all the time!bob"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I bought this book for my grandfather, it came fast and in perfect condition.

I was caught in the story line of Wicked and felt for the characters as the story played out. I had no connection to Liir. he could have been killed off and I am not sure it would have made a difference.The whole love plot of this book seemed like a cry for attention. It had no flow or rhythm with this book at all. The fact he left this open for yet another book, frankly scares me.It was a waste of money and I am really disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"sonofawitch","review":"Didn't care for this one.

But overall I really liked listening to the audio book on my way to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess...","review":"I loved Wicked so I was looking forward to this book. The book seems to have several stories it's building and none of them go anywhere. It's as if it is setting up for another book. A couple of the story lines don't even seem to have much relevance. Personally, I thought it was a mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing narration","review":"I'm listening to this one immediately after finishing Wicked, and I have to say I'm disappointed. Wicked was a good story itself, but the reading by John McDonough was brilliant and made it everything an audio book should be. I didn't look at the narrator when I reserved this from the library and assumed McDonough would be doing this one as well; I was wrong. Boy, was I wrong. Maguire is a talented writer, but however passionate about the story, his reading falls flat. Odd intonation, melodramatic rhythm, indistinguishable character voices, and an overall lack of modulation in his voice make this, so far, a very dull listen. I don't know that I'll be able to finish, regardless of how interesting the story may be."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst things I have ever read","review":"When I first read Maguire's \\"Ugly Stepsister\\" I was hooked on his unique style of wit and writing. But it's safe to say that lightening has not struck twice- I read Wicked, and while it wasn't his best, it was far from this pile of schlock! Maguire's tale is haphazard, sloppy, and a complete bore. You can tell he has no idea where the story is going and to cover it up he just starts up plot line after plot line- all of them leading nowhere! I kept hoping the ending would save it- but to no avail. Hardly anything is fixed and/or resolved. The characters are dull and unlikable - including the main character! I'm under the impression Maguire thought he was making his main character complex by giving him no redeeming value and no sense of continuity! What a heap of swill- don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Wicked Left You Wanting More....","review":"then reading this book and reading the rest of the books in the series will not quench that thirst. If you like laborious melancholy tripe, then this is your book. Personally, the author didn't make me care whether or not Liir was Elphaba's son, which is the main question in the book. There is not anything compelling here, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange book","review":"Saw Wicked in theatre and wanted to read more of the story but the book it very hard to follow. I only read the first chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Son of a Witch: A Novel","review":"I read and loved Wicked, so had to read this one. But, it is adolescent and inconsistent in tone compared to Wicked. It has characters that make cheap sarcastic comments that are completely out of character, but instead seem to reflect whatever the author's mood was the day he wrote it. The most annoying thing is an unexpected and disturbing, homosexual relationship that left me feeling dirty and sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Son Of A Witch","review":"I really enjoyed his book \\"Wicked\\" and looked forward to the release of \\"Son Of A Witch\\". I finished 'Wicked\\" and immediately began the journey of \\"Son of a Witch\\". I was very disappointed that the narrator of \\"Wicked\\", John McDonough, was not used for \\"Son Of A Witch\\". I purchased the audio book CD hoping for the best. Mr. Maguire is a brilliant author but sadly is not trained as a narrator. At times it is difficult to listen to the book because I was spoiled with Mr. McDonough's extraordinary performance. I wish Gregory Maguire would request a \\"do over\\" for the audio version of \\"Son Of A Wtich\\" using Mr. McDonough?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Purchased after seeing the play Wicked.

Even the ending which I seriously looked forward to, wasn't what I had hoped it would be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing! Don't bother with it.","review":"This sequel to Wicked was terribly disappointing. It lacks a real plot and could not hold a candle to \\"Wicked.\\" I was only able to read half of the novel before I gave up - and I really tried. I rarely ever stop reading a book, so it has to be pretty dull for me to stop.Go ahead and read Wicked, it's great - but pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio book - Maguire should not have read...","review":"I have no idea yet if I like the actual book or not. I attempted to listen to the audio book while on a long drive. Mr Maguire reading his own book was a bad idea. He just does not have the voice I care to listen to for many hours. Mr Maguire's attempts to define each character by changing his voice was laughable. Perhaps I will visit the library for the written book, but this audio experience has turned me away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost time.","review":"I liked Wicked. He did a great job creating a backstory and giving the characters depth. The \\"big\\" events in Wicked didn't need to be written as we're to remember them from the movie. Son of a Witch was written in the same way (i.e. just mentioning big events) but without giving the characters any depth. Just poorly done all the way through. Constantly waiting for something to happen, for some suspense to be created, but it didn't happen. Since I've only read two of his works, I don't know if he phoned this one in as a way of cashing in on the musical or if this is par for the course. What I do know, however, is that I won't be finding out 'cause I won't be spending any more money on his novels. Unfortunate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please! Has the author no shame?","review":"WICKED was simply a wonderful book. Thought provoking and entertaining are two words which come immediately to mind. SO what happened in the follow up? The books drags on with Liir the wimp for the first three quarters and then suddenly he's Superman? Oh, and let's throw in a little confused sexuality. Was that really necessary. What I think we have is a poor attempt at providing the middle leg in the Witch (no, not Which) Trilogy. I don't want to give it away but the entire plot leaves more questions than it answers. I have to say that if you read the last sentence first you will get \\"it\\" and you can then be thankful for not having wasted six hours of your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book in a good series","review":"This was a gift to complete my husband's hard-cover Wicked collection. I myself wasn't a huge fan of Wicked and didn't read past the first book. BUT my husband went through the whole series like water on a hot day; he loves them. And I do believe that this second book in the series was his favorite. He did mention that sometimes it can be a little slow going, but VERY good overall. So I would recommend continuing the series if you've already read the first one (Wicked) and enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Son of a witch","review":"This picks up where Wicked left off. It resolves some issues of Liir's birth and helps him resolve some of his childhood issues. He continues his mother's search for Nor and just misses finding her. He continues looking for Nor thoughout the book. Along the way, he meets up with numerous characters from the original book. It is well worth the read if you are a Wicked fan. The ending definitely left me wanting more and hoping for another sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Oz fan disappointed","review":"I love The Wizard of Oz. It was one of the first books my mom ever read to me and I was Dorothy for years for Halloween. I loved Wicked, its twist on the story only increased my love of OZ. But alas Son of a Witch was boring. While Maguire paints a beautiful landscape with his words, the only good thing I can say about the book is that it set up for an interesting third installment. Only read if he decided to write the third book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Son of a What?","review":"I checked this out as a book-on-CD from the local library to listen to on the way to and from work. The book was initially interesting but by the end of the first CD had become merely frustrating. By the end of the second CD my patience had expired with this, the first book on CD or tape that I found unworthy of completion.The problem, pure and simple, is that the only thing worse than the author's writing is his reading! Now and then a clever or picturesque turn of phrase suggests that the author may be on to something but then return the inconsistent characterizations, random application of big and unusual words, and just plain awkward style. A better narrator might have made the book sound better by more smoothly reading the text or by making it easier to tell one character from the next but the author's flat and unappealling reading makes his writing seem if anything even worse than it is.The book on CD is unlistenable. Pass on this one and go see \\"Wicked\\" on stage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Letdown","review":"this book was a major letdown. i kept waiting for something to happen & it never did. after reading the book i can't say i have any idea of what the plot was or for that matter what the point of the book was.

This book, however, was by far the most disappointing. There should be a warning label on the cover that says, 'Warning! This sequel is nothing more than a setup for yet ANOTHER sequel.' Virtually nothing actually happens in this novel; it only opens up questions for the writer to try and suck you into a series. There's nothing wrong with series, however the writer should try and make each book stand on its own. This book does not do that. There is absolutely no closure and I actually found myself angry once I had finished it. If only Maguire could give me back the portion of my life that I wasted on this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book itself","review":"I cannot truthfully review the contents of the novel because its physical form was compromised.

I love Gregory Maguire. But this book was truely a disaster.The character of Liir is shallow and underdevloped. The entire second chapter is nearly completely useless. The major antagonist was underdeloped and not nearly as forboding as he should have been. I had to force myself through this book. Just so that I wouldnt feel bad about spending the money on it.Maguire's first two books were AMAZING (Wicked and Confessions). But everything since then (Lost, Mirror Mirror, and Son of a Witch) have just been disasterous. Im starting to think that the author of my two favorite books might be past his prime. Im sorry Mr. Maguire. But you have lost a reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too many loose ends","review":"If this book isn't crying out at the end for another sequel, I don't know what is. You could drive a truck through all the loose ends, and the climax of the book is, well, anticlimatic. However, Maguire does an excellent job of delivering once again a place that is not your children's Oz. This is a great allegory of religious zeal run amok, as well as an administration that keeps people riled up against each other. (Remind you of any administrations in the present-day US?) I especially like that it is not the worship of the Unnamed God in itself that is bad, but an overriding zeal led by those who don't understand that God is greater than any of us. Despite the loose ends, I recommend this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"a very fitting sequel","review":"I agree with the reviewer that stated if you enjoyed the true intent of Wicked, you will love the sequel just as much. While I admit that the thirll of meeting some of the characters for the first time in Wicked is not present in this book, the truths you discover as you read this make it a must-read for the Wicked fan. This is a book you must read carefully and not skim over, because hidden revelations are everywhere, tucked away into small paragraphs and in the reactions of characters to events. It all comes together in the end, but not in such a nice little package. There are still questions left unanswered. DO NOT turn to the last page and read it first. The last line of this book is worth the entire journey. You must save it for your final surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"Like many other reviewers noted, this story lacked action. The main character was reactive, rather than pro-active, and it really started to drag after awhile. Not nearly as clever or entertaining as his anti-heronie mother, Liir's constant identity angst became grating very quickly. Although there were some good moments, overall the story really seemed to lack direction, and the ending was weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a letdown","review":"Wicked was so good that I didn't question it's sequel. Until I read it.Son of a Witch is very disappointing. Liir's character is poorly developed. The plot was missing something...like an actual plot perhaps. I had a hard time following the story because none of it made any sense. The story just follows Liir around while he runs away from everything (from Kiamo Ko, the army, Elphalba's memory) and leaves many dead ends. Perhaps the author meant to leave loose ends to be able to make another sequel, but I won't be running to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless reading","review":"There was just too many questions hanging unanswered at the end.The author spends too much time describing -in such ANNOYING detail- things that aren't important, but leaves all the important detail out. I don't even know what most of the characters look like because the descriptions were pretty much non-existent.I skipped a lot being there were a CHAPTERS that would only talk about how the character felt. Very disappointed, and not so optomistic about book 3. Hopefully all the questions from this book will be answered then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Random, disjointed, and totally unbelievable","review":"I have to admit I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Wicked\\", and like many was willing to enter that world again. Unfortunately, \\"Son of a Witch\\" is just poorly written. We follow a sullen, joyless boy who steadfastly insists that there is no possibility that he is interesting or talented in any way. Unfortunately, he's right.The book is full of non sequiturs both emotionally and in the logic of the story line, including: a completely random episode of homosexual sex, a life changing experience that seemingly makes no impression on the character (not the sex), a random appearance of a wizard like character, and immaculate conception of a child.Who let this book go to press?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes you have to finish what you started","review":"I really wanted to like this book. I was a big fan of Wicked and wanted to see more of that world. But this book just one big story about a sullen young man that really has no idea what he wants or where to go. There was some of the book that I enjoyed but the majority was just boring. I seldom finish a book that I find slow but sometimes you have to finish what you started.

Fully manual mode is a bit confusing at first, but you can save your own manual presets, so once you figure it out, that is also excellent.It is a quality product for a great price, good for some amateur photojournalism, but not really for anything professional.A tip: they suggest you buy the Kodak SD cards to go with this.

Memphis Hustlin' Rollers. So I was delighted to see that there would be an episode that revolved around Women's Flat Track Roller Derby. There were some things they stretched or invented for the sake of the plot; other things they got right. The one thing they absolutely should not have done was have O'Hara hit another skater in the face and continue to skate in the bout (as well as brag about the hit later). That's a serious foul and she would have been automatically expelled from the bout. If Shawn had gone undercover as a minor league baseball pitcher (no more unrealistic than an untrained, inexperienced O'Hara going uncover as a Derby skater), I cannot imagine that he would have been allowed to deliberately hit the batter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"Not everyone knows about Psych, but those who do love the show and it just gets better with time. Shawn is the zany hyper-observant lead and Gus is the brainy straight man- together they solve crimes for the Santa Barbara police, with Shawn posing as a psychic. Corbin Berson plays Shawn's grumpy father (BTW, I saw Corbin in Vancouver while they were shooting an episode- he really is grumpy. But I also met James and Dule and Tim and they are FABULOUS!). The show is a constant hoot with wit and dry humor flying everywhere. The cultural icon references are usually subtle, but they are zingers when you do catch them. I can't say enough good things about this show. It is family friendly, fun-loving and has a little something for everyone. It is much like Monk, but much hipper. I hope it has a long run."},{"rating":"2","title":"new season, new format","review":"The first two seasons had a certain format they followed as far as the base story board goes.

Somebody might have owed somebody a favor. I noticed that Roday and Hill have been credited as \\"co-executive producers\\".

He was one doctor, who early on, wrote an article concerning the deteriorating health of FDR. One of FDR's sons took issue with the doctor in a failed effort to cover-up his father's failing health. Much to his credit, Dr. Wold stood by his analysis. Even in the last few years, there has been an expose of how well FDR's doctor (Ross McIntyre) covered-up from the public, his patient's health.Of course, new information has emerged in the last 8 years concerning Presidents Lincoln, Wilson, Harding, Coolidge, and FDR.

If you tried to walk on the tiles, they would slide against the floor, opening gaps between them that the still-liquid glue then tried to ooze up through, when you subsequently pushed the tiles back to where they belonged. This is nasty, messy stuff that ended up ruining several hundred dollars worth of carpet tiles.

I don't like the Critter remix at all; it destroys much of what makes the song special. The instrumental version, however, is very good (although the music only slightly differs from the original), and the Dust Brothers / Korn instrumental is quite okay, but not very interesting for Manson fans.

I just needed a faster flow nipple for my 9-month old daughter, and these happened to be the least expensive. I love the angled shape, and these are the only bottles with nipples that my daughter doesn't completely collapse. They work great in that she's able to get more milk, (and she actually drinks more now that she has better bottles). My only complaint is that they leak a little around the top of the ring that goes around the nipple, but it's not too serious. It leaks while I'm mixing the formula and sometimes a little when I first start feeding her, but after that it's fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for young nursers","review":"While I do appreciate that this product is good for preventing gas and that it has a tri-flow nipple, it proved much too fast, even at the slowest setting for my 2-month old nursing son!

I had been checking it out of the library for years until it disappeared from the stacks. Prior to home computers, I searched for a copy to no avail. Once I retired I realized it should be simple to find a copy now. Sure enough as soon as I entered my search in Amazon.com many copies came up. I carefully read each description, and several of them claimed to be in \\"like new\\" codition. I'm not sure why I chose this particular ad to order from, but I'm glad I did.

Important equations are not boxed or easily findable in the text, and example problems are in the same typeset as the instructional material, making reference to a previous chapter very difficult.The book changes tone several times within a chapter with off-putting dry humor that seems forced and out-of-place.Overall, this book made learning differential equations much harder than it needed to be and should be reformatted at the very least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for simple equations","review":"So complicated when you know that you can guess what is the percentage by a simple division, this equation is taking you the extra mile to get the result.Not good for simple maths but fantastic when it comes to variables solving solutions.

The photo doesn't show the discoloration of the weld beading. Since there was a huge differance between the photo and the product, at first I thought I had a cheap knock-off.

You have to know a litte about photography to really get great results from it. I have a Nikon 3100 and I found it to be a lot easier to use. You do have a thousand options to work with the Z760, but it does require some basic knowledge about photography. It's not a \\"beginner\\" camera.One of the things I love about this camera is the battery life. I love my Nikon but I hate its batteries life. The Kodak Z760 battery life is just wonderful.

Two cons: It does not take very good quality pictures in low light situations and the mode dial ceased working altogether. The camera will not even turn on now. Estimated cost of replacing the mode dial is $125 which is 60% of the initial cost of the camera and more than a new purchase of a Z760 today.

DARE looks deeply at some, seemingly randomly chosen, terms, but misses the vast majority.Chambers Slang Dictionary actually tells you when the word was used, and often where specifically. You can search it on Google books, which is a great help because that's the one problem with a print copy: you can't look up by definition. You should do that because you'll see how much info is in each entry.But buy the book, it's fun just to sit and read the entries.I've spent a decent amount of money on reference materials recently and this is the one item I can honestly say is worth several times what I paid for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ready to throw it away...","review":"After a few short weeks of bliss-filled computing my Toshiba decided that it was going on strike.

There were some bits of worthwhile information wedged in between the tales of horror. I found the information on the calendar change and heraldry of interest.

I often lost track of what was happening, and didn't understand that so-and-so had done such-and-such until maybe a chapter later.The only reason I can give that makes this an alright book is the obvious care Lucile Morrison took in researching it. Every word seems loaded with information on this time period. It just didn't come alive for me. Perhaps the fact that it is jam-packed with info makes it less real.The Lost Queen of Egypt is a quick, enjoyable read, but it doesn't have that quality of making me wish it would go on and on.

Nothing too serious, but I have been shopping for what i consider to be the best around this price range.I bought these thinking that perhaps these, being quasi-in-canal as they are, might offer better bass response than theSony MDR-E828LP (and other VERY similar models made by Sony) that I've owned in the past. While the sound is VERY comparable, I think theMDR-E828LP's actually have a little more bass and a little more volume.I like both, but theSony MDR-E828LP also tend to fit in my ear a little more securely and comfortably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior earbuds","review":"These earbuds are absolutely fantastic. I bought them to replace my original iPod earbuds. The Sony set fits slightly better, having a smaller rounded \\"bud\\" with a small rectangle on each. When worn properly, with the little rectangle pointed toward the back of your head, these fit nicely into just about any size ear.As for the sound, it is robust. The highs are nice and clean, the midranges wonderful, and the lows come through very well. Considering these are fairly inexpensive, they are superior in performance.I would buy these again.The only con I can see is the wires to each earbud seem to twist constantly and have to be periodically \\"spun\\" in the opposite direction of the tangle to be untangled. Over time I suppose this might cause the product to fail, although I've had them for over half a year with no issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the value...","review":"While, a decent price, it quickly become evident upon use, the headphones are not of the greatest caliber.

Typically I like their designs."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I didn't get them","review":"I don't know, I guess it depends on your ears. I always liked and trusted Sony. I will like and trust Sony in future, but these simply weren't made for my ears. It hurts just trying to put them in.

The part that goes into your ear is hard plastic, and unless you were the model for the mold on these things... they're not going to fit your particular ear shape. There's only one size/shape, so your chances of a good, comfortable fit are slim. I ended up returning them and buying earbuds that have a soft rubber end that comes in 3 sizes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discomfort makes them not worth it.","review":"While the sound quality on these ear buds is good, they are highly uncomfortable. I agree with several other reviewers that there is no comfortable position in which to wear these.

I chose these after doing some research. It was a mistake. These earbuds are average. My mp3 player's original earbuds (made by creative) are more comfortable, provide better bass and conduct better sound in general. These earbuds are good if you want decent quality, but if you want superior sound quality, look elsewhere. Additionally, these earbuds produce a weird feeling in your ears because of how deep they go. It was not too annoying at first, but you have to wonder if they are completely safe. Finally, the wire is too short for running or any activity other than sitting or walking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for MP3 in my Pocket","review":"These buds are sturdy, have very good (not great) sound, and provide at least as twice as much volume as my pricey Etymotics.

As a result, I don't recommend this product to you guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional, but Fit is Paticular","review":"Sound quality is decent, however the \\"forced\\" shape of the earbuds surprised me since they really aren't going to fit everyone.If you can get Sony's 51 or 71 model of earbuds at a good price (I've seen as cheap as the 21s,) get those instead.Also, I prefer the 71's long/short cord that allow you to drape the cord behind your neck (i.e. weightless) - as opposed to the 21's Y cord that you leave hanging in front of your chest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent earbuds","review":"Great sound, ok bass, and for me these fit well into the ear. They are comfortable even after an extended period of time. The rubber pieces that inserts into the ear are soft and flexible, yet I've never had a problem with them falling out (unlike other types). They rotate, too, so you can adjust the angle of the wires coming out of the earpieces.This is the second pair I've bought--the first lasted six or seven years, so no complaints there.The audio quality is quite good. I'm a classically trained musician, and pretty picky. Most headphones or earbuds have distortion and frequencies that are over-emphasized. This one doesn't have those drawbacks, and sounds clear and clean. In comparison with bulky over-the-ear full headsets, these earbuds are just a little low at the bass end, but I think that is going to be the case with any earbud."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I got these for my 14 year old son who loves music. They were fine for the first few weeks but broke very soon after. He still uses them, but keeps \\"fixing\\" the earpiece.

Sure, you could spend a lot more and get even better, but I wasn't about to go nuts.I like them. They fit fairly nicely in the ear. They seem to keep the sound when I am in the gym, versus the old style over the ears that pick up sounds.Definitely worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great earbud for sensitive ears","review":"For a general use earbud, these are my favorites. Perhaps I have strangely shaped ears, but I can't stand the typical iPod earbuds. It hurts trying to cram them in my ears and then they just fall out again. These ones sit snugly in my ear with out any discomfort and have very good sound reproduction, for the price. My first pair lasted for six years of heavy use and now I'm on my second pair. These can't be beat, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound with Side Effects","review":"I wore these headphones for awhile.

They fit well in my ears (with a little turning & tweaking) and the sound was AMAZINGLY better than those Apple earbuds. However, within 6 weeks I somehow tore off one of the foam ear pads & it is nowhere to be found. Perhaps it is lodged in my ear. (That's a joke.) I wore them one morning on my walk. Things were fine. I picked them up the next morning to go on my walk & the foam was gone. It is literally torn off. Sony doesn't want to hear about it. It's way too late to return them.

I run, play soccer, bicycle (not recommended due to safety) with these earbuds and they are right there with me every step of the way. The sound quality is not as good as fully enclosed phones for obvious reasons, but these are manuverable, light headphones that have great volume and good bass response.I also recently tried a friends Bose earbuds that cost $100 and there was little difference in sound quality. On the other hand, when we run our weekly 5k he constantly complains about them falling out of his ear. I guess some people have to learn the hard way."},{"rating":"2","title":"These work great","review":"I really liked these earbuds.

I tried adjusting the bass/treble/vocals (which changes from song to song or artist to artist) to get better sound, but it's a lot of work just to get rid of static that shouldn't be there in the first place.

And it blocks outside sounds pretty well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak sound quality and bulky shape","review":"I was really disappointed when I got these headphones. They are not bass-enhancing at all. Sound quality is weak. The earbuds are also freakishly large, they did not fit comfortably in my ears (I'm a petite girl, if that means anything). The material on the earbuds is cheap and squishy, which is a pretty accurate indication that the sound quality is on the same par. I would not recommend these at all, and I returned them.

I've played with the equalizer on my laptop, and tried to get a satisfying sound out of them, but I've just not been able to!The bass is weak, and the mids seem to be too loud. The \\"bass booster\\" appears to be a rubber shroud placed over the speaker element in an attempt to \\"drive\\" more sound to your ear. It doesn't work all that well; I'd recommend Koss's \\"The Plug\\" or \\"The SparkPlug\\" ear phones. They deliver a MUCH more satifying bass, and reproduce a more even sound. I like the Koss models because the ear cushions they provide are for a MUCH more snug fit, and deliver more of the sound directly to your ear.These earphones also provide a very poor isolation from the outside environment (my primary reason for purchasing them). I can't drown out office noise with them.These will be returned immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design - too big for my ears","review":"This earphone is NOT good for people with small ear.

On the good side, the sound is decent. On the bad side, these earbuds are very uncomfortable. After more than a week of usage, I still can't find a positioning that will let me wear them for more than an hour without getting seriously annoyed. Also the cord is both short and not as convenient as iPod cords when it comes to folding/unfolding, tangling/untangling.I wish there was a way of testing earbuds before buying them. All I can say is, look at how many people writing these reviews are complaining about the ear fitting issues, and decide for yourself. I did this and bet that I wouldn't have problems, but obviously I lost. Clearly, I'm recommending that you pass, even though the offer is tempting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful earbuds","review":"These earphones have two unique ways of making you uncomfortable after long use. First the earphones are very shallow, so the weight pressure is concentrated along the edge. Even worse, the seams between the front and back rubber coatings of these earphones are not smooth at all, and they run right along the narrow edge of the earphone, giving these earphones a unique knife-like feeling after an hour or two of use. I really hate them. In contrast, the apple earphones that came with my ipod are deep and smoothly rounded so I was able to wear them all day long."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor sound balance","review":"I was very disappointed in these, Their sound was relatively murky, very much biased toward mid and bass, to a degree that couldn't be corrected with an equalizer. Though I could make out treble sounds okay and high-frequency sounds did come through, the audio did not feel crisp or high-definition. Similar to other in-the-ear headphones I've tried recently (e.g., Nexxtech backband 331-3000).That said, they were comfortable enough. If you mainly want big bass without lots of definition, these might be okay for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Function-Great, Fashion- Good, Comfort- Could Be Better","review":"They stay inside my ears very well, and the sound is great. The design is no so great, because they stretch my ears out a bit if that makes sense.

Rather than rely on scare tactics, she demonstrates through a very OCD lifestyle of hers of researching CDC documents and calling them to verify and double check their information if she finds inconsistencies. In the process of doing so much research she has found that other vaccinations that have been created, especially hepatitis B vaccinations can be more dangerous to the public than helpful.It's not dramatic, it's not scare tactics, it's professional, informational, and very insightful.

I'd recommend trying another book instead (any other book)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I have been machine knitting for about 18 years and most of the stitches included in this book I learnt to do quite early on. This is probably a book better suited to a beginner who may not have any other source for learning these stitches. I also found the majority of the stitches outdated. They were big in the 1980's when everything was big, bulky and oversized. Only some of the stitches would suit todays fashions. I wouldn't reccomend it but others might like the stitches in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have for Machine Knitters","review":"This book is amazing. I am an intermediate machine knitter and its so difficult to find books that have advanced techniques. This book is a treasure and I'm so happy I own it. There are all kinds of cast on's, some I have never heard of! I was really excited to find machine knitting resources on the back, but there were no websites. When I searched for the companies names on the internet nothing came up. That was the only disappointment. However, it is still a 5 star book."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL","review":"This has got to be the best book on Machine Knitting that I have ever bought. Susan gives step-by-step instructions on how to do each stitch. A must-have for every machine knitter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, digital print is hard to read.","review":"I just received the soft cover reprint of this book. I haven't had a chance to really delve into it but the contents appear to be very informative.Unfortunately, the digital print job on it is a bit fuzzy and the photos appear a tad low-resolution (similar to xeroxing a photo). It's as if the old edition was scanned, and then printed from pdf.Earlier, I had considered getting an older hard-cover copy but decided on the new version since the author has corrected mistakes in it. But now I wish I'd gotten an old copy -- it'd be easier on my eyes for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceeded my expectations","review":"This is an excellent resource for any machine knitter. If you have a Bond or Ultimate Sweater Machine, as I do, you will be able to use almost all of the stitches except those for double bed machines. The punch card stitches can generally be adapted for manual use. This is a book which I will refer to again and again. Good clear instructions and illustrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing techniques","review":"Susan Guagliumi came to our machine knitting guild to demonstrate and teach and was amazing. What was most useful about her talk was the techniques, her \\"bridging\\" ideas and new ways of looking at and treating stitches that you already knew about but might not have used often because they were difficult to manipulate. Even something as simple as cabling was treated in new and exciting ways with Susan's techniques. I had always considered hand manipulation a chore and something to be avoided until after her class, demonstration and the usefulness of her book. With that help, I was able to convert several complicated hand-knitted patterns with popcorn and open-work to an easy and wonderful machine knit pattern. My sincere thanks to Susan Guagliumi for thinking of machine knitting in a completely different way."},{"rating":"2","title":"There aren't enough stars to rate this book!","review":"A wonderful resource just PACKED with tips, designs, beautiful pictures and easy to follow charts and instructions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it, love it, love it!","review":"Never dreamed you could make an art piece on your knitting machine?

It is not an introductory book on Taoism; there are plenty of those on the market, by Alan Watts and others. This book is, I believe, for those who already know something about Taoism and the Tao. Like the Tao Te Ching itself and many other oriental books it cannot be understood as a factual account but requires a degree of intuitive understanding. If you want an introduction to Taoism, don't buy this book. If you already know the Tao, and want to take your understanding further, this book succeeds admirably.Tony S"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good chocolate","review":"The chocolates were sent by me to my son who appreciates chocolates very much.

Now he has information that an international assassin-for-hire is going to be part of a guided safari in Zaire, and he wants photographs of all the participants to share with Interpol in hopes that they can put a face to his code name. So off goes Mrs. Pollifax to the not-so-dark continent. But as always, her mission acquires unexpected complications--Cyrus Reed, a retired judge who shows more than a mild interest in her; his grown daughter, who seems attracted to two of the young men in the group; and Mrs. P's newspaper ad for her old Albanian prisonmate, John Sebastian Farrell, which attracts first a police inquiry and then a sinister trio of kidnappers. Mrs. Pollifax's delight in her first visit to Africa is especially well portrayed (\\"She would *demand* lions\\"), and she's lost none of her quick wits and courage. An excellent entry to the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK if you don't know Africa","review":"As a yarn goes this novel is tolerable but I write this review as a warning to anyone who has actually spent time in Africa - this book will irritate you.The characters are all lazy stereotypes which is tolerable until we come across 'freedom' fighters being portrayed as such.Having had family in that part of the world it is just too much to read about them as they are portrayed here. These 'freedom fighters' were terrorists and yet they were the darlings of the bleeding hearts. It is nauseating to read this novel when you know that the author had the opportunity to do a bit of research but chose to reinforce the fluffy stereotypes instead.Am I wrong?

It pushes the desperate to a higher plane of optimism in it's bear-bone lyricism and uplifting guitar solo that allows the protagonist believe in himself, and take life by the balls. Gallagher's lyrics reveal the struggle in all and the undiscovered ability of the mass to kick the ass of adversity. Through an arrogant optimism, Live Forever relays the feelings of a nation of 20 somethings, which drives them to ask questions of their 'petit' lives and makes them ask - 'why not?'"},{"rating":"2","title":"this cd is good","review":"personaly i like this cd, i know some people that think the that the beats are wack, and the lyrics arent real, but i dissagree i love all the beats, and lyricaly this is one of my favorite cds"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best oatmeal out there......","review":"I discovered this oatmeal on a whim when scrounging the aisle of the grocery store while on vacation. I loved the taste from the get-go. The price is kind of high for an instant oatmeal BUT it is organic (which you pay a premium for) and it so much better tasting then the cheaper commercial brands.

They are a little more expensive, but at least organic so they are trying to be more sustainable for a processed quick meal."},{"rating":"2","title":"oatmeal","review":"I would definitely recommend this product.

The Thernstroms bombard readers with \\"facts\\", graphs, charts, and a whole lot of stereotypes and dangerous assumption. For starters, they must have a different place in mind when they describe the \\"affluent town\\" of Cambridge, Massachusetts. Clearly they've never stepped outside the Ivy walls of Harvard Square. If they did, they would see first hand the gross injustice being done in the shadows of these walls...an urban public high school that is nowhere near the profile that they provide. They go on to describe, with great confidence, different groups as chapter titles as crass as \\"Asians\\" \\"Hispanics\\" and \\"Blacks\\". Don't bother with this...pick up anything by Kozol, Deborah Meier, Gary Orfield, Richard Elmore, or Richard Rothstein instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here We Go Again...","review":"Just another example of white racist rhetoric!

Still, \\"No Excuses\\" is a thoughtful, insightful work worthy of a close examination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad news and lobbying for charter schools","review":"Get ready for some really bad news if you are a liberal. The authors go to great lengths to outline the academic gap between white versus black and hispanic students. The authors analyze all the excuses for poor performance and come up with the No Excuses truth.

With the exception of some anecdotal evidence there is nothing to support this conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the Budget Bride","review":"I was thrilled when I found this planner because I was looking for one that had a CDRom companion, but when it was delived I was highly dissapointed. To begin with, it is quite over priced for the quality, and it really seemed aimed towards brides intending to spend $20,000 or more on the wedding. It didn't have many good suggestions for how to choose vendors, and there weren't the comparison charts that you find in a lot of other planners.

I feel the \\"pivot\\" portion is a marketing ploy versus actually helping with the shave. However I purchase a shaver for both the shaving portion and the attached trimmer (not the ear/nose trimmer). I have a mustache. I don't need much, just something that can occasionally trim that mustache. The trimmer is a total letdown. Maybe they forgot to sharpen mine but it is truly worthless. Now I need to purchase a mustache trimmer or a new shaver. I do like Panasonic shavers. And, again, if you just need a shaver this one does a good job. The nose/ear hair trimmer is also solid. It's just not large enough to do a mustache."},{"rating":"1","title":"Panasonic Wet/Dry Shaver","review":"Having owned several Panasonic Wet/Dry shavers over a 20 year period I can, with authority, say that this model is a big disappointment. The battery life is outstanding, but that's because the motor speed is so slow it's not using much juice.

And the pomegranate flavor is the best, in my opinion, compaired to the other flavors. However, the reason for me to give it two stars is that it has a ton of sugar! About 32 grams of sugar, if I recall correctly. Without a doubt, sugar is the worst part of any product, and I was hoping that an organic \`pop tart' would be made with less sugar and more natural sugar-free sweeteners like Xylitol.

I would recommend it.This book is very easy to ready with plenty of pictures with step by step instructions so you are able to follow and understand what is being conveyed.It covers 'drapping essentials, manipulating dart excess, bodice styles, bias cut dresses, jacket & coats,collars, etc' to name a few. Each of these chapters talks about and shows different styles. They also include a 'design analysis' on the styles which gives you information about the design eg, bias cut, type of dart etc.I hope you enjoy this book as much as I am."},{"rating":"2","title":"Draping for Apparel Design","review":"I bought this book because my college course told me so.

I have never had any problems with it, and it's still going strong. I recently bought two new ones on Amazon, the reason being the brighter red light display. These gauges are extremely accurate. I have compared them against two other high quality manual gauges, the Accutire is spot on every time. One of the features I like in the new ones, is the ability to change the batteries yourself.The one I had recommended you send it in for battery replacement, but that was not so bad considering they offered free batteries for life. I like the idea of being able to replace the battery myself. I highly recommend this tire gauge.

It's much easier to get an air pump nozzle over the tire nipple then to get this over the same nipple. At times I've had the gauge show me 29, then a few seconds later when I tried again, it showed 31. I assume I wasn't using it correctly. There must be easier gauges out there for people like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"not working","review":"Sorry, but this just doesn't work. I tried it twice when I first got it, and it gave 2 ridiculous readings, about half what the actual values were.Since the instructions mentioned zeroing the gauge to ensure accuracy, I tried that. Since then the only reading it gives is 00.0. I've taken the batteries out and put them back in again, still the same thing.

Cons: Mediocre accuracy, 0.5 psi precision","review":"This digital tire pressure gauge measures pressure in 0.5 psi increments (e.g. 29.5 psi, 30.0 psi, 30.5 psi, but nothing in between). It terms of accuracy, this gauge has always been within 1.0 psi of the actual tire pressure. However, if you use this gauge to take two measurements of the same tire right after each other (i.e., no change in pressure due to temperature or other factors), the readings can be up to 1.0 psi above or below the first reading.However, if you don't have a tire pressure monitoring system in your car, this is a reasonable gauge for a reasonable price that is far better than the old fashioned metal analog variety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Accurate... for a while","review":"Takes a very accurate reading. i have no beef with that. HOWEVER, the part that goes on the tire valve and partially opens the shrader valve is entirely plastic. after nearly daily use, it only lasted a couple of months.

The tire gauge works fine, but it eats batteries. I purchased the unit 6 months ago, have used it 4 or 5 times, and when I went to use it this morning, it briefly flashed 'LL' on the display and then went dead - it needed new batteries. The unit requires 3 watch batteries, which would cost $5+ to replace, almost as much as the initial price of the unit. I'm just going to toss this unit, rather than sweat replacing watch batteries every 6 months.The 5-star reviewers on this page clearly were a bit hasty in giving their reviews - especially the gentleman who was patting himself on the back for having figured out that he needed to remove the protective sticker from the display."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and simple","review":"Simple to use. Works well. I get consistent readings from the same tire.I made a series of measurements with letting the air out in between and got nice correlated results so I'm pretty happy with the device.On top of that, the readings are matching the pressure gauge on my compressor only more precise, so either they are both off by a same amount (not very likely, since they are different types and from different companies) or they both measure pressure correctly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not solid - the plastic part comes apart","review":"Even though the handle is quite solid, the silver portion where the LCD display is housed, is made of two pieces of plastic and is not secured together properly , hence when I press the guage on to the valve this portion splits apart due to the pressure and I am unable to get a good seal.Useless now :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Accutire MS-4021B Standard Digital Tire Gauge","review":"I read about this tire gauge in Consumer Reports Magazine.

She is considering giving them out as stocking stuffers next Christmas because it is so handy (she also recently started work at a tire factory, so it would also be a good themed gift.) It is so much nicer than using an analog gauge and guessing the accuracy.Overall, highly recommend.

I do not work at a mechanical shop, and I have one car and I had taken a reading about once a week for 4-5 months.I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reliable and accurate, but with one fatal flaw","review":"I've owned two versions of this gauge: An LCD version that I bought 7 or 8 years ago, and the more recent LED type. Aside from the display technology, they looked identical.They were both accurate and reliable, but they both also had very poor sealing against the tire valve. The rubber ring that seals against the valve is too hard and uneven. You have to line the gauge up very precisely, and press very hard to avoid a burst of air escaping from the tire. If you don't get a good seal, the reading can be off, and a couple of bursts of air is enough to drop a tire by 1 psi. Every time I checked my tires, this happened on at least one or two of them. It's bad enough that I got into the habit of overfilling the tires by a couple of psi so that when this happened I would not end up below the desired pressure.I finally got tired of it and bought a $26.00 gauge at Sears that seems to be just as accurate and does not have this problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"If your gauge always shows 28.5 PSI...","review":"...try peeling the protective plastic film off the LCD display.

It worked OK until now. It is showing \\"01.0\\" only, on my car tires, bike tires, whatever. Changing the 3 x 1.5v button batteries did not help. So I opened it and found there is another battery inside, a 3v button one, which I am pretty sure ordinary users will never find out or imagine that it even exists (I also found two big pieces of fallen solders inside, kind of clinging to the 3v batter). So I replaced that battery too. Still, it shows \\"01.0\\" only. And then the LED display fell off place while I was taking apart the gauge. So this is the end of it. I am going to have to find another one, for my bike which needs a range up to 110psi. I won't buy AccuTire again. BTW, the AccuTire \\"sensor\\" is actually a little touch switch pressed against a circuit board when air pressure is exerted upon and the touch switch can be easily contaminated due to poor seal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accutire MS-4021B Digital Tire Gauge","review":"accuracy appears to be good but what I really like is that it doesn't waste air.

While it will give you a quick initial reading, trying to do a second reading never works.Normally I put air into a tire and then recheck the gauge to see if the tire is still under-inflated or maybe over-inflated.With this gauge, you only get one reading.

It seemed at first glance to be great. It was easy to use and read and I thought that it was perfect. A few months later I brought it out to use it for only the second time and it had died. I guess those watch batteries don't last even six months. Reading other reviews I note that one must either remove them after every use or replace them every few months or so.

I purchased this particular guage based on some ratings and the description of its accuracy, ease of use. I have used the new guage several times. It is reliable and, I assume, valid as far as I can tell. Ironically, my old guage, based on these new measurements, is valid as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super quick way to check tire pressure","review":"I love this gauge. All that is needed to get your pressure is a quick tap on the valve and voila! The only downside to this gauge is that it has a somewhat awkward curve to it with the handle which makes it somewhat hard to measure my motorcycle's tire pressure because it is in the middle of the wheel with a large disc brake in the way. It would be nice to be able to disconnect the black handle part of the gauge for this reason. Also, it would have been nice for some sort of beep when it has the pressure, because the screen is hard to see while I'm jamming it into my motorcycle rim. Other than that, its a great product at a great price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very fragile.","review":"I've bought two of these. Both broke after being dropped from tire height. (OK, I'm clumsy.)

The product's own packaging says, \\"Accuracy +/- 1%\\" which is something quite different. If, like me, you were fooled into thinking that this is a higher quality gauge that simply reports a reduced accuracy for the sake of making things simple for a normal consumer, well, now you know that it is not. It's a cheap gauge like all the others; may as well save $5 and get a cheapy.I've been an Amazon customer since the beginning, and it is disheartening to see the increasing frequency with which it gets its product descriptions wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to get a good seal","review":"This device is disappointing. The 1st time I tried it, I couldn't get a reading other than 0.00. I was ready to give up on it, but I tried again a few days later. I was able to get a reading but it took multiple attempts per tire. I must have lost a few pounds of air pressure from each tire since it was so difficult to get a tight seal. I wanted to send it back to Amazon but according to the invoice they will only take it back within 30 days and I had waited too long to test out this device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so accurate","review":"This thing is not very helpful. It gave me a zero on one of my tires. It gives erratic readings on multiple tries on the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good easy to use product","review":"I have used this a bunch of times. Bought it for personal use but now use it at my farm to check the tire pressure on my farm equipment. Very accurate compared to the old tire gauges. Its so easy to use that my wife will steal it from time to time to check her own car's tire pressure. Came back here to buy another one for her. Easy to use LCD screen. And for the people that say that it breaks easily, this is obviously NOT built to be beat on, its plastic. Take care of your tools and they will take care of you. Owned it since February, used it hundreds of times, tractors, trailers, coupes, 4x4s, trucks, sedans,and mowers. Works great every time. No false readings or different readings when checking multiple times.(you need to make sure you \\"zero\\" the gauge every once in awhile too, might help those with false readings) And battery it still running."},{"rating":"2","title":"It a tire gauge not rocket science","review":"It works and is accurate like other tire pressure guage, only downside is the size, it pretty big. I guess it would be harder to lose compare to the small one, but the only problem I had was using this on a motorcycle. I had to tilt it to the right angle just to get it to fit, but on cars or truck there was no problem (Had to take one star off for that). I just leave it in the car to check the pressure every couple months. Great thing to have since most gas station air pump either doesn't have an pressure gauge equip or is inaccurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best yet!","review":"I have only used this products for about a month so I can't comment on the longevity of it but can confirm the ease of reading the device in low to no light areas and the off set makes checking the tire pressure on my son\\"s bike a breeze."},{"rating":"1","title":"split along the side = useless gauge","review":"we bought this at canadian tire and within a year or so the tire gauge split lengthwise along the seam - making it useless - as the air just leaks out the side and doesn't measure the pressure... i give it one star for lack of durability (its not like we use it daily... so maybe 10 uses?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after a few uses","review":"I bought this one and the other model MS-4652B to try both, but this one stopped showing the pressure after a few uses.

The gauge lit up and looked like it should work, but it didn't display the tire pressure. We tried several times but nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works excellent for the price","review":"I love this tire gauge. It's cheap, accurate and easy to use. The angle of the gauge is perfect for easily pushing it onto the valve stem and it has a nice little area to put your thumb on to apply pressure.One thing I will note is that you have to hold the gauge on the stem for a couple seconds before it will register a reading. This was not something I was used to and kept popping it off too early only to get a zero reading. At first I thought it was defective until I finally decided to read the directions (I know, but seriously, for a tire gauge?). So yeah, read the directions first :) I try never to be one of those reviewers that hastily returns and gives a 1-star review to a product when it's not the product that is defective, it's the reviewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accutire MS-4021B","review":"Simple order.

My car's tire pressure tends to vary over a period time and I was looking for something that'll be good enough to do the job. Ordered this item from Amazon and tested it as soon as it arrived. Super easy to use. Sometimes the LED panel faces downwards and you've to use it like you use a thermometer (stick it in, and take it out to check the reading).

Seems durable enough for household use, but probably not one for commercial use.It could be improved if there was something to let air out of the tire when the tire is over inflated - somewhat of a pain to check pressure, remove gauge, insert nail or something to let air our, recheck pressure and start all over again, until you get the right pressure."},{"rating":"1","title":"accurate, but difficult to use","review":"This gauge is accurate and easy to read, but it is very difficult to get a good seal. There is no rubber inside the stem and you have to get the right angle to get a good seal.

A good simple tire gauge."},{"rating":"2","title":"good tool to keep in the car","review":"This is a good tool to have in the car. The readings are accurate and the feeling of this tool is comfortable. The reading is easy to ready because the digital is large.

I don't trust the ones that they have at the gas station."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this gadget!","review":"I'm a tire pressure fanatic, checking at least every week. I've been through a score of gauges over the years... pencil type, brass dial versions with/without hoses, and another brand of digital. Every one has disappointed me. This little gem is amazing!

Most tire inflation stations in my area don't have an accurate pressure gauge on the inflator or the lighting is poor. All combined, glaring idiot light, bad weather and less than ideal inflating equipment conspire to the aggrivate me. The gauge works as advertised. It is dead on accurate, and easer to use. I have discovered that the low pressure warning limit on both cars are set not very far below the recomended tire pressure, so I now know when the idiot light comes on, chances are I am not in any real danger, allowing me to pick my spots when I will top off my tire pressure.Great Gauge, good bang for the buck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Working grear","review":"It works as expected.

So no wonder some are experiencing \\"nausea.\\" I'm really only using this as a supplement to a healthy lifestyle and to make sure I get all the daily nutrients I need. No, you won't lose weight with the pill alone - but it's a good thing to combine with a healthy lifestyle...especially if you're just beginning to partake in a more healthy diet. It's not a miracle pill, and I don't think it claims to be. It gives you the vitamins you need, and helps keep your metabolism going in COMBINATION with a healthy lifestyle.

Not like doctors on their way to a town in the old west. I can't stand the actress they picked to play Belinda. She was so expressionless and lifeless. I much prefer the darker haired actress of the prier film; she was spunky and full of life. This new girl was like \\"yes I'll marry you\\" with absolutely no expression or emotion.They turned the last two films into more feminist rhetoric then a Christian message. In fact there was no Christian message.And what is with them making the first husband of every main character die????? It's like a family tradition.I enjoyed Patrick Duffy and Cloris Leachman but I didn't like seeing Lou Diamond Phillips as the bad guy. Over all not a great story but not bad directing and a wide range of acting from really bad to great."},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie","review":"I actually thought this was the best movie of this series.

But what a disappointment! The character of Belinda no longer has red hair and is no longer fiesty. The new Belinda is too stoic and barely smiles in the entire movie. Cloris Leachman does a great job as the orphanage matron, but she cant save the movie. Even Haylie Duff does a decent job as Belinda's classmate. Lou Diamond Phillips and Patrick Duffy were horrible too. The book is so much better: Belinda is not married, and follows Mrs. Stafford-Smythe (from the previous movie) to Boston to be her private nurse. I hope the next movie is better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Soooo Disappointing","review":"I was so excited to see two more \\"Love Comes...\\" movies coming out. What a huge disappointment. They were just so predictable and corny lacking the acting and story lines of the first Love Comes Softly movies.Here are some of the things I did not like about the Love Takes Wing and Love finds a Home movies. First of all if you're going to change the character actor could they please use someone with the same hair color? Or wig it with the same hair color. And personality is a must also. The Belinda charater in these two movies had blond hair and a soft demeanor not at all like the first grown up red head Belinda. Also back then they did NOT discuss pregnancies or lack of --- people were much more private and not telling each other all their personal problems. Not to tell it all but be forwarned that these two movies lack the acting and plots of the first six. Patty Duke was great! Love her in anything!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Takes Wing","review":"I own all the movies to this series. I was very disapointed with the seventh. It couldn't compare to the first two episodes.

To over sermonising - shoving down throat (which wasn't in the first couple of \\"love comes\\"). And most of all lack of development of character and story. The characters weren't real and you end up not caring what happened to them.It was a good theme - \\"loosing faith\\" but just wasn't explored or allowed to develop correctly.It looked like the director, producer suddenly had the smallest budget and gave up.The last \\"love comes\\" wasn't as good as the others but it stood head and shoulders taller than this one.Give this one a miss and just remember how good the others were."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Takes Wing","review":"Whatever shortcomings the production includes, the movie satisfies its place in the Love Comes Softly series, which, as a Christian, I consider to be the best I've ever viewed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fly away from this movie","review":"I LOVED the first two movies in this series, enjoyed some of the others, but they've really gone downhill in quality and storyline, with this movie being the worst one yet. Here are the problems: 1) Belinda is absolutely not the same character in this movie as the last one. OK, so I've seen soap operas where they changed actresses mid-storyline, but they at least try to keep the same hair color! More than that, the two Belinda actresses are nothing alike in terms of personality and spirit. 2) It was so predictable. We had the mystery source of the illness figured out in the first 30 minutes. 3) Totally unbelievable -- who would kick out sick orphans -- come on! 4) The romance is poorly developed. The proposal at the end takes you by surprise, seeing as how you never saw them together much. Even if you are a fan of the DVD series, I suggest saving yourself some time and skipping on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful story","review":"Beautiful movie in a series by Jeanette Oke, Jeanette Oke has written many series.

I found myself bored but kept hoping it would pick up. The actors didn't seem very scared, happy, or much of anything....they seemed bored. When the \\"bad guy\\" was revealed...he was rather boring. Considering all the psycho/sociopathic killers featured in movies this one was very bland. His looks (no mask made of human flesh) and his actions (no derranged orphan who killed off everyone) were very vanilla. The bad guy even died very easily, no tense, end of your seat, struggle to the death fight. The only interesting point in the movie was the girl with the bad guy; but the movie never gave much information about her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.","review":"Let's just say the film's two best assets were on the chest of the lead actress.

Most of Barenboim's Wagner recording are rather hit and miss with the singers. if you need the glorious digital sound then this recording will do well along side a few others. I think the Karl Bohm recording is the most satisfying.The glories of that recording being Nilsson and Rysanek even James King is solid as Siegmund....For those who don't need sound please try the second act from San Fransico 1936 conducted by Fritz Reiner.

Unlike CD's by some other artists, all the songs this CD are different from each other, interesting, beautiful, intelligent, poetic, composed and sung with true musical talent. I listened to a CD by Ingrid Michaelson, who also has a song used in an Old Navy commercial. That one was disappointing because all the songs sounded the SAME! And they weren't very good either! I got another CD by Patti Rothberg, and that one had the same problem too! But this CD by the Weepies is what a CD SHOULD be like. I was really pleasantly surprised after I finished listening to it. I was surprised by how good the songs were. They were not just some amateurish wannabe junk! The Weepies are true artists with true musical talent & genius, unlike so many wannabes. I also appreciate their intelligence, soulfulness, and sophistication, which you don't find very often either."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 cent zipper on a $17 item","review":"It's going back and I'll look for something else.

Those things are all great and important in a mouse pad, but the \\"stand out\\" feature of this mouse pad is that fact that it DOES NOT MOVE. This thing feels as though it is welded onto my desk. Of course it isn't stuck to your desk permanently and can be removed if you wanted it to be, but unless you \\"peel\\" it off, it isn't going anywhere.

Maybe if you live in southern California or Arizona such a cover is considered reliable, but here in southeast Pennsylvania with wind being a constant nuisance? Yeah, this thing is useless. Also, too much rain will make it rot, especially if the water is sitting in the middle of it for an extended period of time. Always make sure you drain the water after a rainstorm. Oh, and in case someone says \\"This is intended for summer weather\\" guess what?

It has ties on the four corners to tie it to the table or chairs to keep from blowing away, although the ties are difficult to tie around anything because they aren't very long and something with a buckle or clasp would be easier.The biggest problem is that it falls apart and tears after about 4-6 months. I've had to purchase 4 of these in the past two years. Maybe it happens because I'm down in Florida and it can't take the heat... After it sits in the sun for a while, it rains and the water puddles and the material tears under the weight. I think the material is not thick enough.

Save your money and use either Armstrong Floor Cleaner or NON sudsy ammonia. The detergent container locks securely about 30% of the time; requires multiple tries (read:spills) to make it stay on. The wand cracked after 1 use. The hose connection, like the detergent cup, does not latch securely, rendering the small tools ineffective, since the cleaner cannot be dispensed or removed. Neither the floor nor grout brush (mounted on the upright unit) is effective in cleaning the grout in between tiles.If your floor is very lightly soiled, it may work just fine.

A point in its favor, adding water and dumping the dirty water is pretty easy.My next problem is with the plunger in the dirty water reservoir. This is what stops the suction when the container is full. The problem is that jostling will caused the plunger to set even though it isn't full yet. You have to turn off the unit to fit this. It is very annoying.I've actually went back to regular mops, and have experimented with using my carpet cleaner vac instead.

I did not expect the vacumn to rival the one I have (Dyson Animal); I vacumn as usual and then use the SpinScrub. I use one oz (instead of the recommended two) of cleaning solution per tank. It takes two to three tanks to clean the floor (depending on dirty they are). It is loud - so is my Dyson. I have not heard a quiet cleaner that worked.The tools work well, too.

Overall does a much better job then just a mop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works good but will not buy it again","review":"I bought this product after reading the reviews from previous buyers, but is not as they say, is kind of heavy to move from room to room, the spinscrub does not have enough power. I went to a local store and I found a better hard floor cleaning, small, light and alot more cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me...","review":"Read most of the reviews before buying this, thought I could live with most of the downsides, but found otherwise. I found the dry vac mode too weak to pick up all of the debis. I had to sweep up small stuff that really should have been drawn in the vac. Also found the unit tough to turn becuase the back wheels seemed to prevent (rather than enable) a good swivel action.Next, I tried the wet scrubbing mode and was surprised at how hard the unit was to push once it sucked against the floor (vinyl). In vac mode it was easy to push forward and back but in scrubbing mode it was MUCH harder to push.Other drawbacks were - finding a storage place for this large unit; it is heavy; dragging the electric cord around.Given the cost, effort to prepare the machine, operate and store this unit, I found I prefer my broom and mop after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"why would anyone scrub floors again!?","review":"this machine can scrub and clean your hard floor surfaces, and I wonder why anyone would mop or scrub a floor again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised","review":"I bought the FloorMate for my wife... she was complaining of back pain for having to sweep and mop the floors. We live at the street level so our floors need to be cleaned regularly... a lot of street dust accumulates easily. I was skeptic at first... but decided to try it myself. I ended up cleaning the whole floor myself.This vacuum did the job and was easy to clean after finished. My only complaint would be that the water reservoir is quite small, so I had to refill twice. I like in a small 700 sqf apartmet... so if you live in a bigger place... be ready to refill at least 4 -5 times every time you clean your floors. Aside from that minor issue... this product is worth the investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean floors so easy","review":"A friend told us how nice this was for cleaning floors. It is better than they told us. Great for cleaning hardwood and tile floors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"This floor cleaner is great! It's easy (and fun) to use, and it leaves a dry floor behind. I have tiled floors in most of the house, and the machine does streak slightly, but less so than other methods of mopping. I would recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Dry Vac, but Terrible Wet Vac","review":"I have owned the H3060 now for several months and the dry pickup is great and the unit moves easily across our tile floors (our entire home is tile). But under the wet vac mode it is extremely difficult to push across the floor. They really need to install a \\"power assist\\" under this wet vac mode if you are going to get through your whole house. For small jobs it is probably OK, but definitely not for an entire home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover H3060 Floormate","review":"I absolutely love this product, it has made cleaning an absolute breeze for my tile floors.

I would recommend it for any type of hard surface floors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"At first I really liked this product, however after 4 or 5 uses I started having problems. 1) you have to empty the tank alot 2) the unit stopped picking up the water consistently 3) if you use the vacumn feature the dirt gets wet and clogges up the tubes. Great idea but alot of design flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Well","review":"We have used this product for several weeks now, and so for has worked very well on our hard wood floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Not Working","review":"A few days after receiving my FloorMate, I put it together. It took about 2 hours to assemble. I tried to use it to pick up the loose debris on the floor before attempting the wash function. It picked up less than my Swifter and seemed to blow things all over and I got VERY frustrated. My husband tried it and determined it was defective or something was loose. He called Hoover and they said to bring it to a service center. The alternative was disassembling and packing it to return to Amazon, a daunting prospect right before Christmas. I just got it back last week and still have not tried it. At this point it is too late to return to Amazon and I hope it works. There is nothing worse than a vacuum that blows dirt all over the floor. I will hold my breath and try it next week, almost two months after purchasing it. I am not a happy camper and probably will not buy another Hoover product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing performance.","review":"This product got a lot of great reviews and was the reason why I purchased it.However it had very poor suction power, in fact it would blow dirt away from the edges. It was also very heavy to maneuver around. The solution reservoir was too small and had to be refilled often. Cleaning the tanks takes a very long time. The attachments are useless since hose is not long enough the machine needs to be repositioned frequently to be near the area you want to clean. There was also leaking water on the floor every time after turning the vacuum off. Finally, it saved me no time at all. It took longer to do the floor with this vacuum than it would have if I used a broom and mop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoover is a Synonym for Crap","review":"First of all, this is my 4th Floormate. If any other company made a machine that cleans like this one is supposed to, I would buy it in a minute. They usually work for a year. This one was defective right out of the box. It wouldn't squirt much solution on the floor. It made a huge mess. I work near a Hoover repair center or I would never dream of buying anything made by this company. As far as I'm concerned, Hoover means CRAP!!! I know I'll probably end up buying another POS made by them. When it works, nothing cleans like it. It just doesn't work very long"},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't last very long","review":"The machine does what it says, it scrubs all kinds of floors and sucks up the water, but the motor goes bad quickly, in fact mine stopped working after less than a year, and I've had two 500 models burn out within a year also, so much as I liked how well it cleaned my floors, I'm going back to a tried and true mop.Bottom line, not worth the cost, motor doesn't last, easily burns out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I had researched in depth to find the right floor cleaner for our home. It was so disappointing when I used this for the first time. After vacuuming the floor, I still had to sweep. The vacuum hardly picked up any of the stuff on the floor. Washing the floor was better, but still not what I had anticipated. I think that maybe the machine wasn't working properly, because I expected more from this Hoover product. Returned cleaner to Amazon and received full refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope that I get it back in the box","review":"Very disappointed. More work than mopping my laminate floors. I guess I was hoping for a miracle. Plus every time I turned it off, it started leaking badly. Now I have to try to put it back in the box for shipping. Forgot to take pics of what it looked like before I took it out.Save yourself time and money. This is not working."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover FloorMate H3060","review":"I love using a hard floor cleaner versus a mop. There is no comparison. You are putting clean water on the floor rather then using the same dirty water over and over and cleaning out the mop over and over. The only negative to this product is that it is a little heavy. It does work good though."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more floors","review":"Had the original floormate about 8 years and decided on new one. Gave old one to neice. This one is way better. Much more quiet (still loud) than old one. Works a lot faster. Would recommend to anyone with vinly or tile floors. Did not use on my hardwood so can not say about that. Very happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"MACHINE DOES NOT SUCK AND TOTALLY BLOWS","review":"I purchases a Hoover H3060 FloorMate SpinScrub 800 Hard Floor Cleaner with Portable Detail Kit. I was not only disappointed, I was fairly disgusted.The dirt from the vacuum feature and the floor cleaning feature all end up in the same tank. It is so disgusting to clean. There are nooks and crannies that will not rinse out. The vacuum feature only works for a short time, and then you have to take out the filter and clean it. It was such a G-d-awful mess to clean, that I can't imagine why anyone would go to all this time and all this trouble, rather than just use a mop.Even returning it was a pain. Once the upper handle is snapped into place, it cannot be undone. I verified this by calling Hoover.So that meant that the box it came in would not fit it for the return.I did manage to get another box and shipped it back. Goodbye and good riddance."},{"rating":"1","title":"STINKS, wait til you need service","review":"Doesn't clean worth beans, it fell apart. I called customer service, on hold for over 40 minutes, then told \\"SORRY\\" they are in a conversion, customers aren't important, I can take it to Montreal Canada for service!!! This thing is less than 6 months old, I live in MAINE!!! Warranty? There is NONE! They were SO RUDE, so uncaring. I will NEVER buy a Hoover product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Money or Time Saver...........Works for Me","review":"Before purchasing the floor mate. I was a swiffer user. And a happy one. However the cost of swiffer products can run high. When one uses them five days aweeks. We just laid new tile floor in 2/3's of our house. So I started looking into floor vac's for hard floors. Upon checking out the floor mate. I learned I wanted the Hover Floor-Mate 800...It seemed to do it all. And it does. Having the hose use as well helps to get around the toilet. We also tiled the shower walls. The floor-mate cleans the walls effortlessly. I did my homework and shopped around for the best pricing. Which was found at Amazon..saved on the shipping as well as the total cost of the floor-mate..I'm now able to get a drity job done with ;ittle effort and very little cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product!","review":"The newer model is 90% better than the first model.The tank for the cleaner and the tank for the dirt and cleaner are so much easier to remove. The control for the wash cycle and pickup cycle are so easy to turn than the older model. One complaint the stop valve in the pickup tank seems to shut down the pickup before the wash tank is finished. I always feel like the floor is cleaner than using a mop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe we got a defective unit","review":"We had this for over a year. It worked just fine until one day when I was cleaning it caught on fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never worked right. Started smoking.","review":"This item never seemed to work right. Did NOT pick up water well when cleaning. Then one day it started smoking so I think something was never right about it but I waited too long to return it.I will not buy another one which is too bad because the OLD was a work horse although not as wide and no accessories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy in AZ","review":"I was in desperate need of clean tile floors! I chose this product based on product reviews and comparison shopping - there isn't anything else out there to scrub tile floors. My tile floors were filthy and I could not keep up with weekly mopping. There are 2 adults, 2 pre-teens, 1 dog, and 3 cats. We live in the AZ country - which means we have a lot of dust and dirt that gets tracked into the house. We have about 1500 sq ft of coarse tile and unsealed grout. Although this product isn't the greatest ever - it keeps me from having to hand scrub or killing my back and arms from scrubbing with a mop. I was also pleasantly surprised that the hoover cleaning products work just s well as/better than Pine-sol, Clorox bleach, and Mr. clean. The hoover grout cleaner works the best on the tile and grout - just can't find it in any local stores! The only thing I don't like about this product is that I wish the brushes were harder - so they would clean more into the tile and grout."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got old used Vaccum Cleaner while I paid for brand new","review":"I got Hoover FloorMate Spinscrub 800 Wet/Dry Vacuum cleaner which had tale-tale signs of being used in the past without its original packing or box. When I called customer service at Amazon, I was informed that product has been discontinued. I was given a refund of $40. This experience has shaken my confidence in online purchase. When I paid for a brand new item, there cannot be any reason for Amazon to send me a used product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted 6 wks - calling for repairs - keep looking.","review":"I ordered this at the end of January and was very pleased with the ease and convenience especially since my home is filled with tile floors. Unfortunately, the durabilty of the product is questionable at best. A mere six weeks later and it works but makes a HORRIBLE sound - the motor seems to be giving out after using it an average of 2 or 3 days a week for six weeks....possible 15 times. As others have mentioned, the water container is small but I dealt with that okay. The tools are a bit of a gimmick but since the main machine was okay - I wasn't worried. On the other hand, spending $150 for roughly 15 cleaning periods makes this a bit on the expensive side to say the least. Quality is simply NOT there. Compared to my roomba's which also give out after awhile, this is FAR inferior. They both lasted at least a year with frequent use - six weeks for this item is a new low. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second H3060 Floormate SpinScrub 800, same poor quality","review":"If I could rate this lower than one star I would. The first quit working just past the warranty period. It would cost more than it was worth to fix. I figured fluke-they can't all be like this, right?. Now the second one is leaking water from inside behind the tanks in an inaccesable location and guess what? Right, the warranty is over.I have written to Hoover and they have not even bothered to write back. Apparently they make enough money on one or two time sales they do not have to worry about brand loyalty.I know they lost mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item good but Is that price right?","review":"I might be mistaken but are we talking about the same product? $499.00 for the Hoover FloorMate Spinscrub 800 Wet/Dry Vac cleaner with tools, H3060????????Walmart is selling it for$164.00Hoover FloorMate SpinScrub 800, H3060Most of these Floormate SpinScrub models sell from $129 to $199."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice improvement!","review":"I had one of the first Floormates which I purchased when they first came out.

It was great. I use to wash the tile floor by hand as so not to stain the grout, but with 1500 sq ft of floor it was a bit much. The floor vac works just as doing it by hand without soar knees. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Unit","review":"My unit was obviously defective. Brushes would spin, but no solution dispensed, as well as the unit turning itself on and off. Went thru all the trouble-shooting techniques in the book, nothing worked, although the attachments/hose dispensed fluid and had suction. Must've been something wrong in the connection in the fluid-flow switch on the handle. Thank goodness for Amazon's return policy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"it's a really LOUSY dry vacuum","review":"It is bad vacuume for Dry floor. If we spend money for a Vaccum cleaner, we expect that it should do atleast the basic work, that is vacuum the dry floor quick and best. Washing comes next. But this is a very lousy dry vacuum. It pushes the dust away rather socking. I think the claim of dry vacuum should be taken away. For Washing and wet socking is good, but not good for dry vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and buy a Scooba instead","review":"I purchased 2 of these when they first came out. I gave one to my mother. Within about a year they both stopped working. They easily become clogged and try as I might, I just couldn't return the suction to any level. It just pushed dirty water around the floor. I contacted Hoover and they could care less. So I threw them both out. Total waste of money.I have since purchased 2 iRobot Scoobas and they have been outstanding for over a year and a half. Not only do they clean better than this piece of junk ever did, they are completely automatic. set it up, come back in 45 minutes and the floor is clean and dry! All the areas can be easily cleaned so you never wind up with the situation that happened with the floormate. Also, it takes up less than 1/10th the storage space.Do yourself a big favor, before you invest in a Floormate, checkout the Scooba.No, I don't work for iRobot. I just hate being ripped off like I was with the Floormate!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Floormate","review":"I had the old floormate model 3000 for 2 years..But the switch that controls the wash and dry vacuum would get stuck..and finally the vaccuum wouldn't dry up the foor or wet it. I bought the new 800 floormate and they redid the switch..made it a knob..which I think is better. The new floormate seems to work alot better..the base is a lot wider..and the attachments make it easiler to get into tight spaces like behind tables..The only thing is the cord gets in the way while cleaning..Otherwise it's great for tile floors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"My wife and I have all hard wood floors and have tried several methods to clean. These include mop, wet swiffer, and vacuums. We eventually resorted to hands and knees scrubbing with a sponge. This took a long time and was hard work.

We vacuum first with a more powerful dry vacuum then use this to clean, which is why it is only four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Very light weight, easy to use and does a great job.

I had an older floormate for years and finally upgraded to this one.

The attachments are virtually useless--they do not spin or scrub. You are better off purchasing hand scrubbers from Walmart. They'd be cheaper and occupy less room. The cleaning solution that is made for it is also worthless. It is possible to use tile cleaner instead (it won't damage the machine!) and this works better. I still have to use a hand scrubber in combination with the SpinScrub in order to get my tile floors clean!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why'd they wait so long....","review":"This piece of equipment should have been invented about 50 years ago! I started with the original FloorMate, which was wonderful. This one is even better because it has the wand and attachments. This would also be great for someone in a wheel chair.

You fill the clean tank with water and solution, turn it on and start scrubbing. However, the scrubbing brushes barely touch the floor. This machine does a great job on moderately dirty floors, but if there's any sort of heavy dirt - the floormate does not scrub it away. I've been using the floormate to do the general cleaning on my floors, but then I have to get on my hands and knees and manually scrub all of the tough stains. A Mr. Clean Magic Easer took out every stain that the floor mate could not.As for the scrubbing attachments, they do work well (especially the grout tool) but they seem a liitle flimsy and I hope they last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Greatest Invention","review":"I bought this for our small office with linolium tile floors. The unit is not heavy enough or have stiff enough scrubbing bristles to be very effective. After trying several times and going very slow unit would not clean drip spots or scuff marks. A good old fashion mop did a much better job. Unit would probably be good for only mildly dirty floors. Vacuum feature would pick small light items such as loose dirt or dog hair but not a small leaf. I am packing up item for a return and see if there is anything heavy duty on the market at a reasonable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor performance.","review":"I set it up by the manual, but the performance was poor.

It would be better to use a mop."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't know how dirty my floors were","review":"I am another person who took a trial run with the Hoover and almost threw up when I saw the dirty water in the tank. That reinforced our need for this product! The key definitely seems to be going back and forth slowly. And, make sure you clean all of the parts after every use! They get really disgusting, but they are fairly easy to clean just by running them under hot water. I use ammonia as my cleaning solution -- it's cheap and effective, and unlike other products, it does not leave any kind of a sticky or waxy film.The only cons: like others, I think the grout brush attachment is pretty much worthless. Also, if I stop using it for a few minutes, it will leak some water droplets on the floor, but I just wipe them up with a towel after I'm done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover 3060- Great for Floors!","review":"I have used all of the floormates from the first they came out with.

The paper is whiter than standard inkjet paper, giving better color brilliance. Ink dries faster than with glossy paper, also.

The photo sequences are the best I have seen in any martial arts technique book, although you must read the labelling key first! Ed and Tim wear different color gis, the picture angles and sequences are very well done, and all in color - which make the moves easy to follow and understand. The text is well written and easy to comprehend. The book is mostly focused on sport jiu-jitsu techniques to pass the guard, however there are follow on submissions, escapes, sweeps, blocks, etc that are well described. This book reminds me a little of The Fighters Notebook by Kirik Jenness, but with a more focused subject and better pictures. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weller blends 3000 years of history with contemporary life.","review":"Travelling along the GT Road is an expirience that one never forgets.The author gives an historical perspective of the points along the GT Road.

What he puts into words is what I thought but could not expess myself, both humorously and insightfully. I had lived in India for two years while serving in the Peace Corps.

My first introduction to Mahabhatha was listening to an old family member ( My Grandfathers relative) aka \\"Kathaipatti\\" narrate Mahabaratha to the cousins in Nagapattinam.

I am saddened that it is rewritten as 'the narration of the factual events which surrounded the speaking of that illuminating text [Bhagavadgita]'. The epic was created, told/retold in various phases. It is a well accepted fact by scholars that Bhagavadgita was added way later in the formation of the epic. It is most definitely not written around Gita. Mahabharat is a masterpiece of an epic that beautifully develops characters in shades of grey, not black and white. Portraying it as evil vs. good and as a fancy cover to Gita is horribly misleading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the best!","review":"Although condensed from his previous version, nothing appears to have been lost! This edition is so exciting, from beginning to end, it's just as hard to put down as Krishna Dharma's other books (full version of Mahabharata and Ramayana). For people who can't see themselves reading 960 pages, this smaller version will be thoroughly satisfying in under 300 pages. The author's writing style keeps the suspense going, making this ancient epic as thrilling as any modern blockbuster. The spiritual message of the Mahabharata is threaded throughout the book, which only adds to its entertainment value. Mahabharata is a wonderful and intriguing saga that gives us all that we expect from a great novel, while simultaneously moving the reader to introspection and meditation on the spiritual.

I got nothing but the runaround and never a straight answer. I eventually returned the camcorder for another brand.I never had the chance to extensively use the camcorder, but I did tape about 10 minutes and it seemed fine and easy to use.However, I would be leary about a company that will not stand behind a product nor give a consumer a straight answer.Bottom line: fine enough camcorder and terrible customer service.

Sony refuses to acknowledge that they are aware of the problem and they say I have to pay $216 for labor since I am past the 3 month labor warranty. Again a nice camera, too bad it is made by a company who won't stand behind their product.

I'm not sure whether to attribute its problems to lack of skill on Agatha Christie's part or the expectations of the time it was written, though I lean towards the former.Basically, Anthony Cade jumps at the opportunity to involve himself in the convoluted goings-on surrounding the political future of an imaginary Balkans kingdom, saving the day with good old English pluck amongst a succession of silly characters and foreseeable plot \\"twists\\". Tommy Beresford works as a character, Anthony Cade doesn't. It's a very personal thriller, with mighty events hanging upon the actions of one man; perhaps an attractive idea in the 1920s, but one that doesn't sit well these days.A curiosity more than anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Concerning the AudioBook CD Edition","review":"This comment specifically concerns the AudioBook CD edition read by Hugh Fraser. As an avid audiobook listener, I would like to post a comment about this edition:Fraser is not the most versatile voice-doer I've listened to, and that can be distracting at times. There is little change in pause length between sentence and paragraphs. Also, until you get used to the subtle difference in tones and voices, it is very hard to follow in dialogue who's saying what (especially when there are more than two characters conversing), and very easy for your mind to wander off, victim to the monotonous reading style. Overall, I give the reading effort 3 out of 5 stars.Whether you should purchase this or not is up to you, but at least you've been cautioned. I recently heard The Body in the Library, read by Stephanie Cole, and the quality of the reading was excellent.

I bought it for my daughter in '05 and even by the standards of those days the pictures that came from this cam were worthless. You can get something so very much better than this for pretty cheap nowadays so don't bother with this one. A used Canon point-and-shoot with at least 6MP can be had for next to nothing.

If you're new to digital, or just want something simple, this is the camera for you. All the other reviews are correct, though, the batteries don't last long. I took 4 pictures of my daughter, then brought it to the zoo the following week and took 60 more pictures and the low battery indicator is now on.

One is 7 and the other 9 years old. The camera is very strong and has taken a lot of dropping and mishandling. Young boys tend to be that way. We are very pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this camera","review":"We bought this camera 18 months ago. It takes OK pictures and is easy to use, but the body is a thin plastic. The battery hatch door on the bottom is very vulnerable to breakage. Drop the camera once and you will easily crack the door. You might think with a big company like Kodak that it would be easy to call in and get a new hatch door mailed to you. The part is worth maybe 2 cents. I tried and was told no, you have to send it in for repair - for which there is a $50 flat fee!Also - don't bother installing the Easy Share software on your PC. The Windows Picture It software is free and much simpler and faster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk Camera - DONT BUY IT!","review":"This is a complete waste of money.

We paid for it in a few months of buying and developing pictures - and he would rather see them on the computer. Even though he was only 7, we tought him how to take care of it and how it can easily break. After creating his own library in iPhoto on our mac, he has all his pictures isolated (not mixed up with mine!) and we all love it. We've had it for 5 months now and it's been great - just be sure to buy some rechargable bateries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke before the first battery charge wore off","review":"I was really disappointed in this product. It worked great when I first got it. But before the first charge on the batteries wore out it stopped working. It was more expensive to return it or have it repaired than it was to buy a new camera. Like I said, disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Gong this book!","review":"This book and Confessions of A Dangerous Mind are both hybrid books. They run on fiction and non-fiction fuel and frankly you never know what is truth and what is at the very least an active imagination when it comes to Chuck Barris. I really read this book for the parts about Chuck's showbiz and personal life and I was not disappointed at all. I found myself furiously turning the pages to find out more about Chuck's bar-mitzvah ruse to forestall marriage plans to the lovely Becky Ballard. I could feel Chuck's angst as he kept putting Becky off yet knowing deep down he was fooling himself. The entire Hebrew school and bar-mitzvah section and its aftermath was truly riveting. The sections on the CIA serve their purpose in the story. They are brisk and fortunately don't break up the momentum the rest of the book has in store for you. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for an entertaining reading experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an unbelievable liar","review":"First of all, Mr. Barris needs to stop drinking or doing drugs. He is blending famous people from later decades into the story line. Charles Barkley was probably in high school in 1978 but Chuck drops his name as though he was a famous pro basketball player in 78. Oprah Winfrey, had no idea who she was prior to 1986, yet she is also referenced as a famous person in 78. I know I am nitpicking here, however, reading a work of fiction requires a certain suspension of disbelief and Mr Barris ruins any hope through bad time distortion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad Grass Never Dies.","review":"Good book. I just want to comment on David L. Vasser's review where Barris names a \\"Stechkin revolver\\" with silencer as his favored weapon for \\"close work.\\" Only one revolver is silencable and it isn't a Stechkin.I did some research and found that in the 1980's a modification of APS, known as APSB (silenced APS) was adopted to use with external silencer and a special butt-stock (not a heavy wooden holster, but a metal butt-stock much like one used with many modern SMG's)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong part did fit properly","review":"The Beck Arnley 090-5020 Speed Sensor DID NOT FIT my 1999 Toyota Camry, 4-Cyl, Automatic Transmission.

These should inserted completely or else they sound very tinny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing -- Even When Free","review":"I too got these free from Crutchfield when I bought a pair of Infinity Speakers. At retail ~$100 I figured that they would have to have some redeeming qualities, but I have to agree with everybody else: they have no bass, and sound tinny and scratchy even when properly inserted into the ear canal. I tried both tip types to no avail. I even tried removing the filters with the supplied tool, hoping that would improve the bass; no luck. I compared these to a no-name $9 pair of iPOD-type earphones and the cheapies won hands-down. About the only good thing to say about these is that they come with an iPOD/headphones zippered case that would otherwise cost ~$15."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"i too recieved these with purchase of infinity speakers, and let me say that i'm glad i didn't pay the [...] list price that amazon shows. for a set of earbuds at that price (or any price above [...] bucks) they are horrible. the noise isolating feature does work, and they are comfortable enough, but the sound quality is lacking (again for a set of earbuds at this price point) if they were [...] bucks they would be awesome. sorry, but i'm going back to my bose earbuds, well worth the money there."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY UNHAPPY!!!!!","review":"Harmon\\\\Kardon seriously let me down with this below standard product.

The come in some fancy case that I don't care about because you cant use the case for any thing. But the sound quality is just sooooo poor. I tried every different eq setting that I have on my ipod, but none could make these earbuds sound worth a crap. They have no bass, no distinction what so ever in levels of music. I listen to all genres of music and none of them sounded worth listening to. I used them for about 5 minutes and went back to the earbuds I got with my ipod that hurt my ears.

B.C. Brown has created something that goes much deeper than \\"pop art\\" as the review claims. The packaging is so spot-on that it induces double-takes...and it is, of course, a sly nod to the fact that women have been judged by their \\"packaging\\" for a long time. The stories are gems.

McBrien brings to the ordinary reader the benefits of his comprehensive understanding of Catholic history and theology. He demonstrates a pastoral sensitivity and leads the reader to explore what the saints heroic example says to the readers spirituality and faith. Lives of the Saints provides all with valuable insights into the great figures in christinaity. There is much here that will interest Orthodox and Protestant Christians as well as Catholics. This is a wonderful resource especially for religious education and parish libraries. It will serve all Christians as a great source of spiritual reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"This book is a worthwhile guide to McBrien's odd biases. As a noted 'dissenter', this book should be a great comfort and resource to like-minded people.To those looking for a credible, well-written guide to Saints - those chosen by God as exemplars off heroic virtue, the book will not do at all. A few lines on great, wildly popular modern saints such as Faustina and Padre Pio? But longer disquisitions on McBrien hobbyhorses such as Albert Schweitzer. Martin Luther King, and Cardinal Bernardin? Please."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Thank You","review":"This book should be carefully avoided. It has a modernist bias and seems to almost criticize the Church's holy saints. A perfect example is the passage on St. Louis Grignion de Montfort and his treatise on the Virgin Mary \\"True Devotion to the Blessed Virgin\\", which according to the author, \\"waned considerably in influence after Vatican II, when emphasis was placed more on Jesus and the Bible\\". Pope John Paul II has used De Montfort's motto \\"Totus Tuus\\" throughout his pontificate, not to mention the fact that \\"True Devotion\\" is interlaced with exhaustive scripture quotes and references, from both the Old and New Testaments. \\"Lives of the Saints\\" is not a Catholic book; I don't know what it is, but don't line a birdcage with it.

This band (although sometimes cheesy :)) does an awsome job of producing the 'typical' 80's album. The songs are sometimes repetitive, and I sometimes wonder \\"Didn't I already hear this exact same melody on the second track! \\". I would have given it 5 stars, but the fact that so many of the melodies on some songs sound identical, i'd have to give it a 4. But all in all, its a great CD if you like the 80's fast paced synth-pop sound. Also great for workouts! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Look no further...","review":"Josee, Monkey-Dance and 3D-Dance are incredible stand-out from this hard to find gem but you'll buy this to be Living (still) in Video...

After 5 minutes, the motor stopped completely. I let it cool down, but it would not work again after that. Sent it back to company under their warranty. Postage was at my expense, plus I had to send them a check for $4.25 to cover the return postage! They sent me a new compressor.

To me it amounted to a piece of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Worthless","review":"Do not buy this.I can't imagine this ever working. The compressor is so small, it must take an excruciatingly long time to get any pressure built up.

This made it impossible to actually get any air presssure built up, IE. make the product usable."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Time Use","review":"I agree with the majority. This device is almost worthless. I really expected more from a name like Motor Trend. I've had mine for about 2 yrs. Fortunately, I was able to use it once to jumpstart my car (actaully my 1st use). At that moment, I was so pleased with my purchase. I had no idea it was a one time use device. It has not recharged fully since that day.

When something goes wrong on an instrument like this (which it inevitably does) most repair shops won't even work on them, because they don't want to be liable for anything on an instrument that will sooner or later disintegrate. I speak from experience here.I'd avoid this and go for a seemingly more expensive but in actuality much more quality Yamaha, Bach or Getzen. You get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrated","review":"My son saved his money up to purchase this trumpet. He currently plays 6 different instruments, he wants to learn as many as he can. He purchased this with the knowledge that it was a \\"student\\" type trumpet, not like what we get from a professional store. The trumpet comes, everything looks great, even sounds good when he plays it but the valves are sticking, which is something that happens, hence the need for valve oil. He keeps oiling it and it will continue to stick, bad. Took it to our local music store for advice and they said this was made in China, the parts are not \\"stock\\" and we will not work on it and it will be hard to find anyone who will. My son is extremely frustrated because the instrument looks great and sounds great, but he can not play with out stopping to wait for the valve to pop back up!

It appeared to be a rugged, quality product which I thought would work well. Unfortunately, I was mistaken, and wish I would have never purchased it. Due to its construction, it is very hard to use on dual rear wheel tires to obtain an accurate reading. The bleed valve which I thought was a clever idea, never worked properly, and if you overfill a tire and have to release pressure, I still had to do it the old way. The gauge started leaking air where the weaved metal hose attaches to the handle, and is now useless.

As some of the other posts stated, the hose leaks when bent. I emailed the mfg and after no response, re-sent it with a bit stronger message...got an answer very quickly and a new hose. The only things I don't like about it is it reads upside down the way I use it (not a big problem) and the display could stay on a tad longer. This wand works better than my previous gauge due to the angle. I have to remove the wheel covers and remove an aftermarket TPMS, so maybe that is why the wand works on my Dodge. I wouldn't want to have paid more for this thing but I'm happy with it so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality Gauge","review":"I purchased this gauge to check the pressure on our motorhome tires. This gauge does not freeze the PSI reading so you must hold the gauge in one hand while pressing the other end to the valve stem which is difficult due to the fact that the gauge has to be turned upside down to read the digital PSI and this reduces the effective length of the tube by half.

The writer fills the book with lots of macho interchanges between himself and other smokejumpers, acronyms, procedures and buzzwords. However, when all is said and done, the reader is left with insight into what it is like to be a smokejumper that equals the knowledge they would receive listening to a nun trying to explain an orgasam.The author spends considerible amounts of time feeling sorry for himself because he can't begin or maintain a relationship because of the life he leads. I thought the book was going to be about smokejumpers, yet large parts of it read like a 15 year old boy's diary.Completely unsatisfying. I'm truly glad I didn't pay full price for the book.

Murry Taylor does a good job in telling about his work, however, for me, it was more like a textbook as the vocabulary was firefighter-eze and the detail about exact locations and the descent from the airplane to the ground was so intense that you could draw a map of what was going on. I am not a topographer and that topic does not hold me.The writing effort is heartfelt, but I couldn't keep going after page 71."},{"rating":"2","title":"You're gonna' like Murry","review":"There are many things I like about this book, starting with Taylor's descriptions of scenery, which are often poetic. I frankly did not expect this kind of sensitivity and language command from a macho man.He also provided a clear and concise overview of what smoke jumpers actually do. I was expecting some terrifying escapes and high level danger and there is not much of that. But that is OK. He gives enough to keep an excitement junkie turning pages but also offers a surprisingly in depth portrait of the jumpers and their attitude toward work and bravery.Wildland fire fighting ain't pretty, it's dirty and hard work and it takes a special kind of person to do it.

Vivid stories, lightly interetwined with the rollercoaster love life afforded by wildland firefighing, help propel this wonderful book through its chapters.Taylor became Alaska's oldest Smokejumper in 1995, yet continued until his retirement at the end of the historic 2000 season. Even if you've never been on a fireline, eating smoke and chasing down flames, you'll enjoy Jumping Fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jumping what?","review":"This book is more devoted to lamenting over failed relationships than earning our respect for a respectful occupation. The only page turning that was going on was flipping past all the frivolous sexploits and side-jinks that belonged in a man's version of Cosmo magazine. The best fire stories in this book are told second hand by other men's experiences. I suppose this was an attempt to bring some virtue missing in the majority of this book. Then we're brought back to the girls. I was not interested in reading about what I've already heard before at frat parties and dorm bathrooms. If you want to save your respect for the honorable and manly occupation of smokejumping and firefighting read the Maclean books on fire. Although these aren't perfect the Maclean books are actually about firefighting while keeping manly honor, virtue, and sacrifice intact."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Accessories","review":"I purchsed this thinking I too would receive all the items the non-reconditioned unit had....it does not.

It was the last fiction he published in his lifetime, and like much of his later work, it's slightly cynical and very sarcastic, although more upbeat than, for example, _Letters from the Earth_ -- mankind comes across as looking fairly silly overall, but on the whole positive.Probably of most interest to Twain fans who want to read everything of his that they can, or to scholars writing on Twain's religious views, more than to casual Twain readers. It's mildly amusing throughout, but no more than that, and Twain certainly wrote many other works that were more entertaining and more insightful.It's a fairly short read, at 630 kindle \\"locations\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Focus on Technology","review":"This show tells the story of D-Day, with a strong emphasis on the development of new ideas and strategies for dealing with the problems caused by launching such a large invasion.

Land at low tide!The stories behind some of the new technology are reviewed in depth: the \\"Higgins Boat,\\" which was modified into a landing craft; \\"floating tanks,\\" which would be launched at sea and hopefully would make it to the beach and lend vital support to the infantry; and Percy Hobart's many innovations for overcoming obstacles on the beaches: the \\"flail tank,\\" the \\"Bobbin tank,\\" and more. Also included in the program are interviews with several veterans of the battle, including one old soldier from Germany.

Even now, he finds himself and his implacable nemesis locked in a deadly battle. The backdrop is a secret war of terrorism waged by an insidious mastermind combining the bloodiest back-alley tactics of Irish republicanism with the sleek financial machinations of Wall Street.

Seriously the book asks what adaptations will an aquatic animal need FIRST in order to adapt to an artic enviroment. I took the SAT bio and it needs you to know the general concept of evolution not how particular animals specifically adapted to a certain enviroment. Then, some of the questions were wrong, graphs were labled incorrectly or not labled at all in certain areas where they needed to be, questions were asked poorly.

What he encourages readers to do is marvellously simple and profound. This book includes the contents of two of his workshops and several interviews with him. This brings out a side of Harding that has not always been accessible in his other books. He is an excellent writer but the spontaneity and liveliness he shows in person really comes across here. He also addresses many questions that people have when encountering his work. I think this book would serve equally well as an introduction to Harding's work or as an expansion on it for those already familiar with it.

Then the second half is a collection of speculations about what may or may not be in the basement at Wright-Patterson and elsewhere. The only chapter that I found interesting was section III, ch 3, discussing how \\"alien\\" physics is not the same as \\"our\\" physics and why we have not been able to duplicate their propulsion system, material, etc. That alone would have made a great book.

In this manual, he introduces us to the two-handed longsword, one of the primary close-quarter weapons of the Middle-ages and Renaissance, a weapon highly prevalent in many ancient European martial texts.Mr. Windsor's text explains the history of this particular sword, with commentary on the philosophies of Italian fencing-masters who wrote some of the most influential early fighting-manuals. Inside, you will recieve instruction in drills of footwork, armed-practice (alone and with a training partner), principles of fencing, and warm-up for sword-practice.Thoroughly illustrated with black & white photos, as well as historical line-drawings from the original Medieval manuals, you will find this to be a true gem among the new wave of Eurocentric martial-arts books.Also to be recommended: Medieval Combat by Hans Talhoffer, translated by Mark Rector"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"We bought this for my elderly mother, who was no longer able to squeeze the prescription eyedrop bottles effectively. She's been able to use this quite well, and it's enabled her to continue self-administering her drops. I suspect that with the crimped plastic hinge it won't last a long time, but it's still an effective tool. It's cheap enough to just replace as needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh.......Paul","review":"When you hear the name Paul Di'anno, there is probably only one thing you think of...IRON MAIDEN. And this DVD has shown me the reason why you don't think of Paul's solo career...because, to say the least, it is not good. This DVD is full of not-so-great loved-up tunes, in which the keyboard will probably turn you gay if heard for more than 15 minutes straight. Now, one of the reasons this DVD is bad, is because the music sound very dated. When I listen to bands like Iron Maiden, Dio, or Judas Priest, I don't think \\"this was the 80's.\\" I think \\"this is some pretty awesome music.\\" But when I hear the music on this DVD coming out of my speakers, it just sounds to much like the 80's. I immediately think of hot pink tights, poofy hair, and other stupid 80's cliche fashion trends. Maybe it is just me...but I don't want my music to sound so dated"},{"rating":"1","title":"The dictionary is published in 1973","review":"The dictionary is published in 1973......The use by such dictionary has brought to me more harms, than advantage.

This video is not even close to being a beginners video. The instructor teaches by telling you what fingers to use in a very quick and unclear manner. Since notes are never displayed, I could not figure out what note he was really instructing me to play. It was not only difficult trying to figure out what note he wanted me to play, but also what count to give the note. The instructor says to look at his fingers, however the video is not presented in a manner that allows that kind of clear view. I became so frustrated by this video that I didn't even bother to watch the whole thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"Some of the stories are so short, they seem like a newspaper article, rather than a short stories.

Kelly is a highly regarded Regency romance author and several of these stories could be considered outstanding romance short stories, the others, however, are simply fascinating tales. All of them are deftly written, well-plotted, engrossing, and very moving. Carla Kelly is a major talent. This collection will be enjoyed by anyone who likes to read about the American West, the lot of woman in the past, military history, or likes romance short stories.

I just bought it in June, and for something with a cord, it worked just fine. However, I quickly found that the material was hard to wash and stuck to most anything, no matter how undesirable. I had to remove the batteries or turn them upside-down to keep the thing from running in my drawer when I wasn't using it. Then, to top it all off, the vibrating bullet died at the worst possible moment, which was a huge disappointment.

Great idea to keep away from children.Then I used Mirilax, it's great, nice soft gentle release but the effect is not 100% guaranteed, sometimes it will take a few days of taking it before I could see and feel the results.The Dulcolax is right inbetween Ex-Lax and Mirilax time to effect with a gentler reaction then Ex-Lax but not as gentle as Mirilax.Also Mirilax has no taste (you add the powder to any drink) whereupon this tastes horrid and leaves a greasy feel in my mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Godsend!","review":"My medications left me terribly constipated.

It quickly had me excited to pee outdoors, lie about my name, and sneak into empty motel rooms to take a free shower (this coming from a girl who normally obeys speedlimits, pays bills promptly, and is always so polite and tragically walked all over by authority figures).

The basket is one size and the interior liner with which it arrives is another smaller size that does not stretch. so when you stretch it to fit over the sides of the basket, it buckles and breaks the cheap woven material of which the basket is constructed. I would return it but the manufacturer but they will not refund postage in wither direction, and it arrives in a big box. So by the time that postage is accounted for I would ultimately be refunded $15, and out the time of dealing with this. It looks cute but turned out to be a waste of money and time.

It advises wives to stay in abusive marriages even when the husband abuses her and the children, which is DANGEROUS.One particularly appalling story the book upholds as a shining example of submission is the wife who remained submissive even as her husband tried to kill her with a hammer to the skull.If you still are tempted to buy this book, please google Caritas in Birmingham and Terry Colafrancesco before reading the book.

Many new monsters, friend and foe alike, can be found within the 224 pages. However, a great deal of the monsters that grace the material are of the outsider/demon/devil types, or are undead.

Unless you like to throw random monsters at your players (which is a lame way to DM and is even more boring than fighting the same monsters again and again) this book is just too bizzarre.

If you want real historical fiction, true-to-life characters and atmosphere, go search somewhere else. Although the storyline is within the popular historical myth (or not myth, but I'm afraid we shall never know for sure: That Henry was Mathilda's and Stephen's son etc), the way characters act (especially Mathilda, although she is the King's daughter, would not be allowed by standards of behaviour of her time to spit her newly-wed husband, the King (!), in the face, nor would he tolerate it), is completely unpersuasive.

For all the research touted on the back of the book, the author clearly made up most of the story, and in the process, trivialized the lifes of some of the most fascinating people in history. Perhaps, had the writing been good enough to carry the story, it would have been worthwhile anyway, but unfortunately, it was not. I was unable to make it through more than half of this book before I threw it away.

It is great for distracting your collegues during long meetings, delighting younger children who should be concentrating on other things, and annoying your spouse who is trying to pay attention.Get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Price","review":"This is a children's cookbook, so be forewarned (something I did not realize when I purchased the item). While the instructions and introduction to Brazil are \\"nice enough\\", the number of recipes are sorely lacking. This book does not give a reasonable cultural or recipe sampling for the asking price.I lived in Brazil for a number of years and was looking for a recipe book that was in English to share with friends and family that do not speak Portuguese, as well as recipes that I remember from my time there that I do not have in my collection. This book did not meet that expectation in the least.I was definitely expecting something much more intensive and voluminous. Even as a children's book it is light on the recipes.Not worth the money whatsoever. You would be better off printing recipes out online. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete rip off - do not buy! Nao comprar!","review":"$25.00 for a 72 page book? What are the publishers thinking? What was I thinking when I ordered it? I expected a full-fledged cookbook, something with chapters and many recipes per chapter. There are exactly 18 recipes in this child-sized volume. I see on the back of the \\"book\\" that Lerner Books offers over thirty titles in this \\"easy menu ethnic\\" series. Incredible that they can sell so little for so much. It is the only title I have ever returned to amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty average","review":"If you consider the target audience and the size of the book, it is not great and by no means intends to be an authority of the subject. Contains some OK recipes but on the whole they seem a conglomeration of African and general South American dishes. Even the Feijoada does not look right and the deserts are sorely lacking that Brazilian richness.This is available in places as a PDF so look around and get yourself a bargain rather than the expensive hard copy book (I have the entire library of these books)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A long search ended.","review":"Back in the eighties I saw this on cassette tape once then never again for nearly 30 years. Then I found it affordably priced on Amazon on CD. I jumped for joy!! I've always liked Tony Carey from his days in Rainbow to his solo work to the first PlanetP Project cd. now I was able to get the second Phase of Planet P and believe me I was not disappointed. The long wait was worth it!! This takes me back to when albums were produced to sound especially great on headphones and this is one of them.You just have to take the time out to put on the phones sit back and enjoy this sonic masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tony's Masterpiece","review":"Any fan of Tony Carey/Planet P should make it a point to add this disc to their collection. It is an excellent concept album and a great followup to the Planet P debut. Why MCA Usa has not released this cd in the states is both a tragedy and a disservice to Planet P fans. Sound quality is very clean but the booklet has no lyrics. A must-have."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is This Garbage","review":"Everybody for many years have been telling me about this planet p project album called Pink World, I resently bought it and after playing it quite a few times to get inspired, I found a rehashed old story about nuclear holocaust and stupid story about a boy who cant talk but knows everything, apperantly getting all the knowledge from the \\"big shots\\" per say. Don't buy this cd, despite what people are saying about it, acid heads go for it full force, it will warp your mind for damn sure and probably send you on the worce damned trip of all time, Thats it."},{"rating":"2","title":"THERE'S A PINK WORLD COMING DOWN...","review":"I have a maximum of a 1000 words to talk about this album but I need only one 'BRILLIANT'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is a fantastic album. for you lovers of pink floyd and anything else that is wonderful 80's music then this album is for you!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tony still goin' strong.","review":"Probably won't appeal to many, but I loved it! Needs to be played LOUD!! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"It rolls like an avalanche and it will sweep us away","review":"There's a time in everyone's life when you hear an album, or a song, and cannot speak or think because the genius of it is so powerful. Pink World provided that experience for me.Twenty-six tracks, some around a minute long tell the story of Artemis, the boy who can't talk and his ascention to God-like status amongst the survivors of a nuclear holocaust.Heavily keyboard based, the songs are dark and moody (how can they not be with that story line?). Almost like a broadway musical, parts of the music are repeated throughout the story to bring a cohesive feel to it.Unfortunately Pink World was not a success when it was released. When hearing the name Planet P Project many remember the early MTV hit 'Why Me?' off of the first album and not the musical masterpiece that followed.Last piece of advise, listen to the cd LOUD with the lights off and picture the images that Tony Carey creates in the songs. It is powerful and emotionally moving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Putting innocent peoples lives at risk","review":"I bought this video out of the dumpster at Wally World. I guess the producers of this film thought it would be great to have some of the riders going down the highways of No. Calif. at 65 mph doing wheelies in the fast lane with traffic all around them. One of them even crashed right in front of a car. Back in the 60's and 70's it was the outlaw biker clubs like the Hell Angels that gave motorcylcling a bad name, now in the 21st century it's idiots on sport bikes. Don't waste your money on this dog!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Organ Donor's on Wheels","review":"I wasn't sure what I was getting, but it looked intersting. The box indicates many form of extreme motorsports, but it is 90% crotch rockets with idiots destroying perfectly good tires for a minute smoke, and trashing expensive bikes, while endangering other bystanders..It is truly amazing what these guys can do on bikes and bounce back for more. I remember driving the interstate through Chicago when this loud roar comes up from behind and passes us going at least 90mph. About a dozen bikes pass with 3-4 doing wheelies. I immediately decide that if one goes down, I'll just have to run them over. I wasn't about to risk my life and my passengers lives and the lives of others, by swerving. This movie depicts illegal, exceptionally dangerous behavior which should not be attempted by anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent!","review":"Everything was great! Thanks!

I found the writings of Mr. Lee both facutal and enlighting to my spirtual desire to seek God. This book is not about cults or how to be in cults. Everything I read is in the bible, in sripture. In fact Mr. Lee sights his reasonings from scripture. As someone who has studied over 150 religions I belive I have some idea of the reality of these writings. Any person who is a follows Jesus Christ will only enhance there growth in Jesus Christ by reading his books .Thank you. A reader in Arizona."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh no! Not another cult!","review":"... This is perhaps the worst bit of writing ever to blight the English writing. At best, it tells nothing new of the Bible. At worst, it leads the reader down the darkling path to a cult-trap.Lee is obsessed with bitter hatred of God's finest creation: man. Lee preaches the complete destruction of all of human nature, especially his mind. The goal is the loss of the human soul. Lee preaches when the human body is removed of its soul, the spirit of his god will move in, producing a god-man. Demon-possession, no less!He tells each cult member how to do it.This expensive series is a first step to soul-death. It also is important source of funds for Lee's church, the Living Stream Ministry, and its Local Church subsidiaries.Read Chuck Palahniuk's _Survivor_ instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible story of one week in the life of an autistic boy","review":"This most wonderful book should be read by anyone and everyone who has ever been in contact with autism. Whether it's family or acquaintances, you will get so much out of this book.The effect that an eight-year old boy has on his family during his summer vacation is heart-breaking, joyous, sometimes funny, and eye-opening.Excellently written, reads very easily. Makes you want to rush out, buy more copies and distribute them to all of your friends (because one coopy is just not enough).An amazing book. Read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps a bit","review":"My dad has various health issues and takes tons of tablets a day. He is severely constipated most of the time.

But I will say this... when I have trouble, i take two of the 100mg stool softer and it works like a charm the very next morning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another mindless vanity biography","review":"I fail to see what on earth a fourth-rate soap opera actress like Hunter Tylo has done in her life to warrant an autobiography, much less a pseudo-frank, self-pitying, narcissistic pile of swill like this one. Only fans of the pretty-but-vapid actress will find anything interesting in this amateurishly written piece of junk. While her daughter's cancer is terrible, Hunter seems more intent in getting pity (and attention) for herself than for the afflicted child.The account of the Spelling trial conveniently neglects to bring up an important point: Hunter was fired because she disregarded a stipulation in her contract where she agreed she wouldn't alter her appearance--something she most certainly did by getting pregnant. Sorry, Hunter, business is business, and portraying yourself as a victim of pregnancy discrimination when you're actually a victim of your own carelessness won't change it."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor writing and poor editing","review":"I couldn't get all the way throught the book. It was poorly written and poorly edited. For example, Michael's sister was Terry on page 96, but Teri on page 118.Why isn't Hunter Tylo ashamed to tell about all the public tantrums and fist fights between herself and her husband? If I were Michael Tylo, I would be embarrassed.All and all, a boring book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Vapid Tale of an Ageing Soap Star","review":"If I were Hunter Tylo, I would be ashamed to admit that I act the way she says she does--drugs, drinking, fist fights with my husband, aldultery on both sides, and that's just for starters. This book paints a portrait of two very vapid, vain, self-centered, selfish and ageing actors who are struggling to come to terms with their last gasp at glory. All I can say after reading this trash is that I really feel sorry for the children of Hunter and Michael Tylo. No one should have to endure what these kids do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enough Warmth","review":"There are two things about this book that disturbed me immensely. One is the quality of writing - which I could get over - but the other is how self-involved she is throughout the book. The latter I could not get past.

The only thing I would add about this book is that the writing is poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mission Accomplished","review":"Hunter Tylo, wildly hailed as one of the world's most beautiful women, reveals all in her autobiography that gives hope to many; it takes a lot of courage to admit to unflattering episodes of your life but Hunter did it in a born-again Christian manner which inspires all. The result is an instant classic, a triumph of God and the human spirit.It is hard to see His will and plan when you are going through a tough time, but her faith in Christ shone through it all. While it is very easy to fall back to one's old ways, Hunter tells us the need to repent. A woman of such great beauty is so easily caught up with all the attention and admiration. However, she humbles herself and credits God for everything.If you are looking for sheer inspiration, this is the book for you. It's neither self-serving nor self-righteous. It's just an honest account of a lost sheep gone astray. And what an account indeed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Want To Judge But...","review":"I try never to judge others, but Hunter Tylo has put herself in a position to be judged by writing this book about herself. END"},{"rating":"1","title":"There Are Many More Worthwhile Biographies","review":"I thought this book was poorly written, poorly edited and very shallow. The self-centeredness of the principles portrayed shows me the victims are the Tylo's four children. There are many other better written and more worthwhile biographies out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"Of the EMT-basic textbooks that I've seen, this one is the best. The photos and illustrations are exceptional, and the text is presented clearly. For some topics, I would have liked to see a little more depth of coverage, and perhaps more focus on questions of why rather than simply how, but this is true of all the introductory EMT textbooks that I've seen. While we used a different book when I took EMT class, I picked up a copy of Brady's anyway, and use it for review of the material. I don't mind that it is not as concise as some books that are designed specifically for review, because in my opinion this one is well written and enjoyable to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Book but Paperback is not Good","review":"I can't believe they made a huge thick expensive book that is only made by Paperback. They should create a Hard Cover because I always carry and drop my Emergency Care during training and Emergency that can ruin the book easily. In regards to the CD, the CD has lack of information.

Don't throw away the packaging. The cutomer service ask for the numbers in the manual etc. Overall, I would highly recommend this product if you have the time and patience to assemble it and figure out on your own.

It was kind of a pain to put together but I think that was just because it is built so well and I was doing it by myself. I can not stress how durable this is. It has survived several nasty storms (live in NE US) and 3 kids who are hard on everything they play with. The performance isn't perfect as the backboard has a tendency to flex a little bit when the ball hits it hard but for the durability more than makes up for that minor issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Packaging","review":"When I received the package the box was torn open and a pipe was hanging out of the box.

What it is though, is perfect for most familys. Especially for the price. It is very windy where we live so I was a little worried about it blowing over. Rather than fill the base with sand or water, I decided to fill it with concrete. It held 8 sixty pound bags (480 pounds). I took a Dremel tool and cut a 5\\" x 5\\" square in the top of the base and poured in and mixed my concrete there. Then I set the piece I cut out back in place and sealed it all with silicone sealant. It baked the concrete like an oven. Two men can move it, barely, so put it where you want it first. It as now solid as a rock. Hurricane Ike couldn't move it. It is just the right size without being to much.

I'm sure that this hoop is great, but because of the inconvenience of having to put it together without specific items required for optimum performance --- I have to give this item 1 star.
