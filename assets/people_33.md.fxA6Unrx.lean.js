Having played a lot of different kinds of board games with them, I know what they like and can tell how they feel about games.This game was way too much work for the amount of fun it delivered. The banker is working all the time, giving out money, taking in money, and a zillion other duties. Nearly every turn on the board necessitates financial transactions. There's not much suspense or competition--when someone won it was almost anticlimactic. I doubt the kids are going to be playing the game much. Sure, it's educational--but they won't learn its lessons if they don't play it, and if it isn't enough fun, they won't play. You can't fool kids.

Each player gets a game board big enough so they cannot all fit on the same table.

The beginning is a good warm up with interesting Tai chi moves. The dance part is all instruction on learning one routine, taking 20 minutes, then executing it only once. I was sweating very little. The camera angle moves right when you really need it, away from the dancers bodies , to thier faces. I would not recommend this video. However my 7 year old liked watching the group C-Note perform at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This is a terrible workout video unless you like to learn the moves and then do them on your own. First of all the moves were hard to pick up because the camera is viewing at terrible angles and half the time an information screen blocks out the whole picture.I spent a lot of time jogging in place or doing my own thing while C note stood around blabbing. The program is very disjointed. If you appreciate the fluidity of going from move to move like Tae-Bo then you'll be bored out of your skull with this video.There are many better videos out there. Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A NO-BUY!","review":"When I bought this video, I expected it to be great. I love kickboxing, and I have been dancing since I was three. (I am thirteen now.)I am an advanced dancer, and the moves were nearly impossible. This is not because they were too difficult, but they only show you the move once, and then go into \\"hyperspeed.\\" Also, the awkward camera angles were horrible. Half the time they showed C-Note when I was trying to master the steps.C-Note is a joke. They talk about the ancient martial art forms when it is obvious they have no clue what they're talking about. And if I hear those guys say, \\"Y'all\\" one more time, I'm chucking the tai funk aerobics tape out the window. That movement with my arm would give me about the level of fitness I reached with C-Note."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Complicated","review":"The only thing I like about this video was the beginning warm up with Chi Kung. That part was something to learn and use regularly. The workout is just a group of people teaching us one section at a time of a dance routine which is kind of complicated. After finally getting it down its not something you would want to do again. I was really dissapointed with this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"grind workout: Tai Funk Aerobics","review":"i found this workout hard to folllow. the instructor doesn't really tell you how to do the steps and it moves very quickly. they also do not repeat every step from the start when you put it together. only the new step and the one preveious are repeated so you dont get a lot of practice on the first steps. the camera also moves around too much making any effort to try to watch and learn very difficult."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste money and time with this one","review":"There are much better workout video's out there.

Not!","review":"I bought this DVD because there were only 2 other exercise DVD's in existence at the time. \\"MTV\\" seemed to imply a vigorous \\"youthful\\" workout. I'm 47. I didn't even work up a sweat. The first 30 minutes revealed routines lasting from 12-15 seconds, repeated only twice. The last 5 minutes consisted of four 40 second routines. This is not what I call aerobic exercise. Save your money! Shame, MTV!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING!","review":"I have four of the MTV workout videos, and this is BY FAR the worst. As other reviewers have noted, the camera angles are ridiculous--they make it impossible to learn the moves since often the camera is only focused on faces or upper bodies. The steps are VERY difficult and the instructor never \\"breaks them down,\\" only does them twice \\"slowly\\" (not very slowly). The \\"warm up\\" did not warm me up at all. C-Note is silly and boring. In my opinion, the earlier videos with Tina Landon leading the group are the best. HEY MTV, BRING BACK TINA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than it looks","review":"I bought this workout because it was one of first dance-aerobic routines available on DVD. It looked fun and intense. From MTV, I expected something very up-to-date with good moves and better-than-average music.It wasn't as good as it looked. Strange camera angles make it difficult to learn the moves. Often, the camera cuts away to an info screen and there's not enough verbal instruction to keep up without any visual input.Some of the instructors were quite good, giving clear explanations of how to get the most out of the steps they were teaching. However, many of the moves were taught by CNote members who, while fun to watch, obviously didn't really know what they were doing.I would have expected the workout to be a bit more intense than it was, but with practice it's probably possible to funk up the moves enough to make it worthwhile. Overall, the DVD may be a worthwhile investment for CNote fans, but probably not as a fitness tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Try it, it's something different and fun","review":"I have been doing kickboxing for a long time and it can get very boring. I did this video and it gave me new inspiration because it added the element of fun as well as being a good cardio workout. Anyone can count 8 punches but add in a dance move (they are easy to follow) and you'll see how much more fun it is. I love the people in it too! The trainer Heidi has alot of great energy and the guys from cnote look like they are having a blast. I got a great workout once I got the routine and having all those cool people to watch helped motivate me. I also really liked the self defense segment at the end. Unlike other videos like Tae Bo this one actually shows you what the martial arts moves are supposed to do in real life. That makes so much more sense to me! I have ordered tons of workout videos and this is my favorite.

His tone is particularly unstable, and not very even, his soprano playing is miles better than his alto however. This is a real shame, as the primary solo instrument in the saxophone family is the alto, anyone beginning study in classical saxophone would need to get this sorted first. His tuning is barely acceptable, but only for a jazzo, he would be shot if he played so out for a real saxophone teacher. Please have a listen to some real repertoire for saxophone, played by a real player, such as Bornkamp, Rousseau, Delangle, Fourmeau, Michat, Londeix, etc. This is a good INTRODUCTION to classical music, if for the first time, but please don't accept this as being the be all and end all of classical music, and of saxophone."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant","review":"Branford Marsalis is possibly one of the most complete and fluent sax players alive. Marsalis is a prime example of a musician who can transcend boundaries and produce great music regardless of the genre. Having served in Stings band in the 80's, adding a glimpse of class to an otherwise dismal Jay Leno show in the early 90's and a stellar career as the leader of a premiere jazz combo throughout, Romance for Saxophone is scenic stop in his tour of the modern musical landscape.The works in \\"Romance\\" are brilliantly adapted for the soprano sax, many of them from vocal, piano, flute and oboe solos of some of the most popular late Romantic works. These works precede the invention of the saxophone, so great care must have been taken in arranging these peices for the sax, as to not compromise the spirit of the works.Marsalis is a technically brilliant player, and other players would be wise to refer to his pure sweet soprano tone ( as opposed to many of the nasaly \\"smooth jazz\\" players out now)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Far worse than I expected...","review":"This album is very disappointing. The soprano saxophone's nasal oboe-like sound on this seems quite out of character with the music it's supposed to be playing. The \\"snippet\\" or \\"best-of\\" approach to classical music this disc takes is also lacking in any regard for the integrity of the music. If you want to hear Bradford Marsalis in a classical setting, get his cd \\"Creation,\\" with the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra.

I bought two of these AT&T models and two from Uniden. Now the two kids who received the AT&T models in their rooms always have to use the phones in their Uniden siblings' rooms, because these AT&T models basically suck. And indeed, every time I've tried to answer the phone in a AT&T kid's room, without fail the caller asks me if I there is another phone I can use since they can barely hear me. Every time. If you're looking for an inexpensive, corded phone, go with a Uniden."},{"rating":"1","title":"Static Electricity will Kill this Phone -- Quickly !","review":"My wife bought two AT&T model 210 Corded phones, from Amazon, in the last month. Both died in less than a week. This model of phone appears to be EXTREMELY fragile, where static electricity is concerned! One time they may ring, and work; and the very next time, you pick them up, and they are dead. We do live in a part of the country that is very dry; especially in winter. As a result, static electricity is inevitable here. If you are aware of even small amounts of static electricity in your part of the country, I would urge you NOT to buy this model of phone. Sadly, it really is a ridiculously fragile piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Junk!","review":"Do not purchase this phone - it is a piece of cheap junk - dial tone button hangs - I took to next door neighbor, former SWB repairman, he took a look inside and said it was not worth throwing away - I did anyway and made a trip to Radio Shack and bought another phone, probably another piece of foreign make cheap junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother trying to wall mount this","review":"The product description says \\"You can place the base on a convenient surface or easily mount it on the wall, saving on counter space.\\"NOT TRUE.We bought this phone specifically to mount on our kitchen wall, but it doesn't work at all as a wall mounted phone.Well, yes, you can mount the base on the wall.

The problem is the phone when plugged in the wall jack it falls out of the receiver . The small hook to keep it in place does not hold it and we had to resort to duck tape to keep it in place. We have tried to adjust the plastic hook and if the phone gets bumped it still falls out. The plastic hook seems to move and it will not stay in one place. So if it is too far in the phone falls out or if it is too far out the phone will not sit in the receiver. And the worst part is we have realized that if it is not just right we cannot get incoming calls. The person calling hears a ring then a click then nothing. I know it was a cheap phone but now we need to look for something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"AT&T Corded Phone","review":"Bought this for emergencies when the cordless phone servies are interrupted during storms.

I mounted the phone on the wall. The phone does not want to stay in the cradle on the wall. It falls off a lot. Also, sometimes when it does stay in the cradle, it does not fit in well enough to keep the button pushed down that disconnects the call. So, I hang up the phone and go on my way.

Then suddenly, it simply died. Phone lines are working, checked everything with other cordless phones, etc., even the phone connection cord works on other phones. The phone unit itself died after just 3 weeks of use. Since this is supposed to be my corded phone for emergency situations, this is a definite problem. But lesson learned - you get what you pay for... since I didn't pay much, I didn't get much. This time, it'll be a trip to a local brick&mortar store for a replacement, so that returning anything defective will not be such a hassle. Perhaps I'll finally learn the other important lesson - never buy anything electronic through amazon. I've yet to buy anything that plugs in to electrical or phone jacks through amazon that has ever worked for more than a few weeks/months.

I tried it in several jacks and the buzz is in the phone, not over the line. I am dissapointed.

But this phone is clunky and feels cheap. One of the features I needed was the lighted numbers, because I get phone calls for substitute teaching where I have to input a lot of numbers. But the lighting feature is so poor, I have to turn on the room light, anyway, which defeats the purpose of having lighted numbers for me. The ringer is obnoxious and seems to echo.

There was a rushing and clicking noise in both phones. At first I thought it may have been my phone line, for how could both phones have the same exact problems? My neighbor and I tried the phones at her house with the same results. This model of phone has problems. On the plus side, I can say nothing but good things about Amazon and its return policy.

I did some research and decided to buy this one as it had many good reviews, and size/color/design matched what I was looking for.This was my very first purchase of furniture through Amazon and I was concerned about shipping damages, but the item was packed very well and no damages were found except the corner of the bottom board which was peeled off a bit - I am not sure if this happened during the transit and did not claim since I cannot see the part from front.I am usually good at assembling but this one took me almost 4 hours to assemble by myself (female). The last part where you assemble glass doors was the hardest but I was kind of watching TV at the same time!) It was quite a work but it was worth it and I am very sartisfied with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reqires some handyman skill","review":"This unit is heavy! So if you're not fairly strong, it will require 2 people to safely (for you and the stand) get into your home. The packing is not the most sturdy but seems to be industry standard. Mine arrived somewhat tattered and battered by the trip but intact on the inside (UPS.) My home is ground level and I am somewhat larger than average so I had no problem bringing it inside, but stairs without a hand truck would be a real problem. Assembly is on the IKEA level of complexity. I recommend using wood cement on the dowel pins and wood to wood edges to make the unit tighter, but it was sturdy and attractive. A good buy for the money: stout, attractive, room for all the electronics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Cabinet","review":"This is a beautiful, sturdy cabinet. However there are a few things that need to be addressed.

Once I opened the box, I found most of the pieces were either scratched, or the corners of the top portion of the stand were bent upwards. Most of the small bags containing the screws and such were torn open, leading me on at least a half hours worth of digging around to find loose screws and fasteners through all the packing material. Other than that, it's a very sturdy and nice looking stand for my flat screen TV. A 47\\" LCD fits perfectly on top. I don't know if it's how the company stores the furniture, or how they ship it, but it was completely ridiculous the condition I recieved the product in."},{"rating":"2","title":"TECHCRAFT Has a Winner!","review":"Took awhile to assemble; but so worth it!!More attractive than picture displayed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Techcraft wide credenza","review":"Once again a very nice product and it looks terrific in our living room.

I didn't really understand why these speakers where pricey but I decided to get them because there are no more REAL floor standing speakers in the market anymore!! I'm glad I made the decision to purchase these. They deliver way better bass compared to the old Mitsu's I had. And the tweeters produce a very rich, but not over the top sound.

However it is a rare occurrence when one finds a field guide that is as useful to identify species as it is to educate. Bill Branch has written such a book about the reptiles of southern Africa. The author has provided informative sections on identifying and collecting reptiles, and on the vegetative habitats of southern Africa which determine the distributions of many species. In addition the book briefly covers the evolution and breeding biology of reptiles. The photographic plates are separate to the text and allow one to quickly scan the pages to identify the species of interest. The text section of each species covers distribution, breeding biology, taxonomy and interesting facts of relevance. Whether you are visiting southern Africa or a resident, this book will spur your interest in herpetology and allow you to identify reptiles with confidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"dosent last long","review":"good system but lasted about 2 years. it was left in the same spot and suddely the cd door became jammed and it slowly fell apart after that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marketing Tool - Caveat Emptor!","review":"This is simply a marketing tool for the MLM \\"Young Living Essential Oils\\" and most of the positive reviews here from probably written by shills of the company.

This teapot met those requirements. I should have had a few more requirements to aid me in my search.Teapot lids traditionally have bumps on the bottom that correspond with notches in the top of the pot. Together, the bumps and notches--when used correctly, keep the lid in place. This pot has badly placed notche: the direct front and the direct back. These notches should be on the right and left side, or 9 and 3 o'clock if you prefer. This creates 2 problems: the tea dribbles out of the top of the pot if the pot is less than 3/4 full, and the lid falls off easily. Not acceptable for any teapot.For now, I've given up on using my tea cozy and am using a teapot from Bee House. It's not as pretty but it doesn't drool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just right","review":"Best teapot I've ever had... I'm impressed with the quality.

The distinct lack of narration and guidance allow Andre and Calvin to lead the viewer through the communally warped and surreal psyche of a pair of ruthless and motivated teenage killers. Not since the original Blair Witch Project have I seen a film that has been successful in maintaining the illusion of being amateur film re-assembled by professionals, and this one being based on a tragic string of events that we're all aware of is particularly haunting and surreal. The two young actors do an exceptional job and are very believable.

I can't believe a publisher or an author would let something as error-laden as this go to market. The numerous typos pulled me out of the story--and it was so bad I felt I had no other choice than to return it and insist on a refund, even though I only paid $3 for it. It's a shame too, because I was really excited about this author and had every intention of reading all of her books.

But there are so many to love.The closer, \\"Valentines Day,\\" always leaves me in tears. The song order for this CD was exquisite. You can see the effort in \\"One Step Up,\\" the bitterness in \\"When you're alone.\\" The finality and pain in the last song is a brilliant end.This CD didn't sell as well as its predecessor, \\"Born in the USA,\\" but it's a a brilliant, enduring collection from a man who's given us his heart in his work through the years.Rebecca Kyle, May 2008"},{"rating":"2","title":"Special Love","review":"Can't say enough about this cd!!

Interesting... anyway, the whole damn thing is smothered in '80's production, which is one count against it. The lyrics, which were supposed to be personal but turned out weak, are another. To make things even worse, Clarence Clemon's doesn't play a NOTE on this recording. The silver lining is Brilliant Disguise, which is indeed brilliant, plus he cooks up a nice extended metaphor on the title track. Even then, the tune itself is thin. This is easily Bruce's weakest - I'd go with Born to Run, Born in the USA, The River, Darkness at the Edge of Town or The Wild etc. instead - hell, even mediocre stuff like the debut and Lucky Town are better."},{"rating":"2","title":"One step up and two steps back","review":"Bruce Springsteen is the man!

The desperate, consuming mood of \\"One Step Up\\" is one that most people who have suffered through a dying relationship can relate to. \\"Brilliant Disguise\\" & \\"Tunnel of Love\\" are some of the best lyrics he's ever penned. They both cut like a knife.

It's really for married Christian men. (Latter stages of the book go into anatomical detail and sexual specifics, and I have to wonder what the author was thinking if his intent was to reach--in a helpful way--single men struggling with temptation issues.)The opening chapter \\"Why Naked Women Look So Good\\" ranks up there as an all-time low (for a number of reasons) in Christian publishing.

Instead of helping me combat thoughts this book put new ones in my head. Half way into the last chapter I tossed this book in the trash. It was very unwise for the author to do what he did considering his audience... shame on you Mr. Perkins.I would ask all men to be extremely careful if you decide to read this book. You may be doing more harm than good. I implore those who purchase it anyway to skip the last chapter, in the name of Jesus.

He blames lust on either mans biological makeup or on the devil. He seems to consider lust as only a male problem. And claims that lust can never be overcome but only controlled, and only with Gods' help. He has packed it full of bible scripture and clearly places men at the top of the human order. Not as an equal too women but as better than. I'd say this is a book that has been written by a man that clearly does not want to accept any personal blame for his lust or ignorance. About the only positive thing I got from this book was his references to what sexual socialization and pornography does to our thoughts and moral character.

I visit my girfrients house and use her Black and Decker which was under $20 and purchased before I purchased my first Rowenta. Never ever again will I buy a product from Rowenta.

I thought the stainless steel soleplate would be nicer then others but it just makes it less smooth. I now own the TFAL (lavender one) that sells on Amazon for 30 and it is vastly superior in quality, features, construction, etc. Also, I also contacted Rowenta and they did absolutely nothing to help resolve the problem.

I am glad I didn't get burned but feel I did on the price and quality of this iron. I would never buy another Rowenta product again. I had trouble from the beginning with this iron,it stuck to everything!!! Very difficult to clean off the soleplate. I had to keep adjusting temperature for every item so the iron wouldn't stick.

This iron was impressive out of the box but quickly became a less than stellar performer. I followed all instructions to the letter and after 3 months the iron produced less than half the steam it did when new. I used the self clean function but to no avail, the iron simply stopped producing steam like it had originally. Then came the infamous Rowenta water leaks and now the iron no longer heats at all. I will never buy another Rowenta product based upon my experience and the support from their customer service. Two and a half years from a sixty five dollar iron is less than acceptable.

It heats quickly and glides over clothes effortlessly.However, about a year ago it started leaking. Since then I haven't used the steam feature, because of the terrible leak. It's almost as if the iron has lost all capacity to hold water. I've seen the whole water compartment empty even when I don't use steam. It doesn't do much good to iron something and then throw it in the dryer to dry.My mom had the same iron prior to mine and her's did the same thing. She bought a different brand, and I think I will too. It's unfortunate.

With few exceptions, they more often than not fail to offer new musical insights in the subject being covered. 'Reproductions' is inexplicably different as it offers novel interpretations of songs that were sometimes regarded little more than novelties of the times. But each song here is a miniature delight in and of itself (most are tastefully brief), and all blend equally well to create a cohesive whole. The genius (if you will) of the Human League is power of their simple hooks, the allure of their sing-along lyrics and the durability of their pop vision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, when works","review":"THE GOOD:This light transforms your pool into a light show.

The album was titled \\"Be Thou My Vision: Great Hymns of Faith\\", released on the Benson label. These songs are not among Debby's best recordings. These versions are very \\"respectful\\": proper, but not terribly exciting. Her earlier Christian albums are more spirited (in every sense of the word).

The sound quality is excellent, better than some more expensive phones I have used. I love the three speed dial keys located on the top of the keypad; they are so handy! The only reason I did not give this phone 5 stars is because it has no mute button. A mute button is nice to have for when you are on a phone call and don't want the person you are talking to to hear sound going on in the room. However, this is no really big deal. Overall, this is a very good little corded phone to have in your house. Everyone should have at least one corded phone in case of a power failure, when most cordless phones don't work, and this is a good choice. It is simple, and you don't get bogged down with a bunch of features that are difficult to understand, not to mention easy to tear up. This is a dandy simple little phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Hiking/Camping Buddy","review":"I love this spork. Don't know why but I've always been fascinated by sporks, crazy I know but I'm just strange like that. I purchased it as a lightweight alternative to a fork/spoon combo while going bike/hike/camping in False Cape State Park located in Virginia. This thing is uber lightweight and an excellent companion. Some people complained that it was too short for them but the length is just right for a stow away utensil. The clip on the end is pretty much useless as it kept coming undone during use so I just removed it. But it sure does make for a great beer bottle opener :)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Advertised. Wrong Picture. Rip Off!","review":"Ok. Let's start with what looks like a good product. Spork/Bottle opener with a clip to attach. Sounds good, looks good, BUT it's not what they send. They send you a spork that is better suited for the back of your silverware drawer. It doesn't have a bottle opener or clip to attach to your gear. Just a plain goofy metal spork. So I called the \\"customer service\\" number. A lady says she will have the correct product shipped out to me the next week. I get a box (by the way, these come in HUGE shipping boxes, very wasteful) and find the exact same WRONG ITEM once again. I call back and get the same lady who assures me that she will go and pick out the RIGHT product herself and send it on the way with a shipping label to return my new accumulating spork collection.

Used it today to build sliding kitchen storage units. The 32 oz. model is comfortable, not too heavy, has an easy to grip diamond patterned handle, and is very effective at nudging and adjusting wood pieces without fear of marring them, as a regular hammer would (provided that you strike the work piece \\"square\\", and not at an angle or on an edge or corner). Unlike a rubber mallet, the material in the head (sand?) provides more inertial force and prevents rebound and recoil. The hammer is totally enclosed in a very durable, thick, impervious plastic which will never rust or crack, and its bright orange color makes the hammer easy to locate and hard to misplace. The Fuller hammer replaces the clumsy old metal hammer-plus-block-of-wood method, which required two hands. Any serious wood worker should have one of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"REALLY STRONG SMELL!!!","review":"This product says it has a \\"fresh clean scent\\" but it's SOOOOO terribly strong that we could hardly stand to sleep in our bedroom adjoining the bathroom for several nights after applying, even with the bathroom door closed, and even after having an open window and a bathroom fan running all day. We purchased it because it said that it removes soap scum and mineral build-up, both of which we were having problems with on our ceramic tile. It did not take care of either of those issues and we subsequently had to purchase another product. It might work well enough for just normal clean-up, but because of the strong odor, I threw my can away and won't even try it for our continued maintenance cleaning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure opinion","review":"If personal opinion and biases and subjective thought are worth reading, Perrucci is worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A work of profound sadness, ordinary people, and extraordinary reflections","review":"What gripped my about this novel was the absolute ordinariness of the characters. Despite the fact the main character, Allison, is a former model, the characters felt very real and familiar. Mary Gaitskill has a way of stating a profound thought that almost causes one to gasp out loud with the painful, yet welcoming realization, that maybe we are all just secondary players....not really standing out, just part of the background. She provokes the reader to see the beauty in ordinary things.The ending is very open to interpretation, it left me feeling neither hopeful, or hopeless...just ordinary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poetry and Fiction blend like Mustard and Mayo","review":"There are some poets who can write fiction even if they aren't really poets. Marquez, clearly, is one. His sentences are poems. And yet somehow these poems cohere and tell a story that is beautiful and intelligent. Mary Gaitskill tries to pull this off in Veronica and fails miserably. The poetry is, at times, beautiful, and the story, at times, is interesting, but together they form a sloppy lit mashup that's ultimatley unrewarding on all fronts. Skip it, read here stories instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this book...","review":"I have nothing against stories about \\"the dark side\\" of life, and I really wanted to be moved, or at least intrigued, by this one. But frankly my dear, I don't give a damn about it. The author can't write two paragraphs in a row that are not overflowing with pretentious, baffling, \\"poetic\\" prose. Wading through all of that leaves the reader no time, energy or interest to care about what the author might actually mean.Every once and a while, Gaitskill hits the nail on the head with a razor-sharp metaphor or insight. But most of the time, she sounds like a stoned tenth-grader. And since you know from the start that everyone is doomed, there's not even any story to make slogging through the writing worth it.The fact that this book was shortlisted for this and a finalist for that is proof of the literary world's motto: \\"If it's unintelligible, it must be good.\\" Ms. Gaitskill should get a copy of Myers' \\"A Reader's Manifesto\\" and learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't wait to be done with it.","review":"Although \\"Veronica\\" is beautifully written, the actual story left much to be desired. I began reading it and kept giving it chance after chance to \\"pick up,\\" but ended up making myself finish it (it took me a whole month and a half to read, and I usually finish a book within two weeks). Parts of the book were confusing... Gaitskill jumps from flashback to present time to flashback again all in the span of half a page. \\"Veronica\\" was at times dark, depressing and unreadable and actually left me longing for some \\"chick lit!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Just so so","review":"I cannot say I liked this book very much. If you enjoy reading experimental fiction and style, then you might like this book. However, if you are looking to connect to a character, then this might disappoint. I was. I found that character development was lacking and 2 dimensional. I just found the book very negative, and the characters uninspiring. For example, why did Allison run away at first? You just find that she's unhappy and self-destructive but you never really know why. Also, Allison and Veronica have this strange relationship where Allison in the end discovers that she cares so much about Veronica, but I never fully followed what drew her to Veronica so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I just don't get it","review":"This book is disturbingly and explicitly sexual, but not the fun variety. It's depressingly narcissistic, though darkly poetic. Veronica is obviously a secondary character to the wonderfulness of the author, who is nice to her because it makes her (author) feel good. No Pollyanna here--I wonder at all the accolades for this book from all the critics who evidently saw something a hell of a lot more meaningful than I did.

The characters never jumped off the page, least of all the namesake of the book. The author jumped around so much I found myself not caring what decade I was in. The only reason I finished this book at all was out of loyalty to the book club, and after we discussed it we all threw our copies away."},{"rating":"1","title":"An impressionistic portrait of despair","review":"I came to this book with a lot of excitement. It has been so well reviewed, and I've liked Mary Gaitskill's previous works. But this book disgusted and frightened me. It must be one of those critical darlings that repel the casual reader. It isn't that I'm not interested in prose poetry, which this, at times, becomes. It is that I can't stand sloppy sad prose poetry. Impressionistic prose on the subject of violence and despair and cruelty and wasted life is unbearable to me. This is a portrait of a woman with a moral disease. A disease of the consciousness. And the prose takes you right into her interiority, a mute place that lacks insight into anything but the force of despair and terror on the surface of things. Maybe it is a social comment, but I couldn't stand the sensibility and, in fact, I didn't really connect with the most poetic or \\"original\\" parts at all. This book gave me the creeps."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best I've read all year.","review":"Mary Gaitskill's \\"Veronica\\" was an absolute joy to read. Her prose takes some getting used to - I sometimes found myself reading and rereading some of her sentences until they could be completely understood - but this book is well worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short and choppy often sloppy","review":"I read this book. I read it about two weeks ago. Sometimes I would read it at my desk. The lamp on my desk shone on the book. If you enjoyed that style of writing - which I call \\"laundry list style\\" - you would get into this book. Short choppy sentences abound! That's not the only problem here, some sentences aren't sentences but a dependent clause. Here is one from page 11, \\"Once we were leaving a movie theater after seeing a pretentious movie.\\" It is also hard to follow this book at times due to the quick switching of gears/scenes. I feel that no flow ever develops. I could care less about the characters, no drama or suspense is ever built and the writing lacks. Instead of Veronica buy a harmonica. Even if you never learn to play well it will be better than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"I've enjoyed Gaitskill's writing before in some of her short stories -- at her best she's edgy and dark, but here's she's slipped from dark to just plain dreary. I tried to think of something interesting about the book to give it even 2 stars, but it isn't possible. The writing about a woman dying of AIDS is dated and cliched; the model bits are mostly silly and insulting to even the most shallow of models; the parts in present tense are nearly unreadable; and the characters are simply dull. There's not a surprise in the book, not a sexy scene, not even a believable character to care about. Be warned - I read a good review of this, but I suspect that the reviewer just didn't know what to make of the subject matter, and given Gaitskill's name, probably tried to be cool by making it seem profound. But come on, we live in a post-\\"Angels-in-America\\"-on-TV world, a story about the 70's-80's + needs to be a whole lot sharper than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I read the whole thing","review":"Veronica is my introduction into the worlds of Mary Gaitskill and her writing left me... not wanting anymore!Alison's narrative is narcissistic drivel without redemption, without humor and worst of all without irony.

I also read 1 biography or non-fiction a week, so I have been exposed to many writers and many syles. I'm not finished with \\"Veronica,\\" and I'm not sure that I will finish it. So far, I truly dislike this book. It is so disjointed, has not one character that I could relate to or even care about. I guess I just don't get it, which really surprises me. The timelines are incorrect and, as another reviewer mentioned, inaccurate. There is no continuity or depth of character. This is not the book for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two stars is being generous...","review":"I was actually really excited about this book, but stopped and read Memoirs of a Geisha halfway through. Finally picked it up and finished it, but didn't really want to. Not really a conservative person, but every other line has some kind of sexual reference in it...and it just kind of gets to be too much. Basically just the random ramblings of a shallow and narcissistic woman. Makes a lot of references to people who were actual on the modeling/Studio 54 scene at the time the novel is set...great reference to Gia who is ever so cleverly referred to as Pia in the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life's a Bitch, then you die","review":"If only Veronica had a sense of the absurd or a comic sensibility--then maybe it could have saved itself. But it doesn't. Although, after two hundred pages of despair, dirtiness, and despondency, I almost thought the book was trying to be satirical. It wasn't.Reading this book is like walking through a graveyard at midnight in the pouring rain as the graves open up and the dead come pouring out at you; but you're not frightened, you're horrified.Whatever you do, unless you enjoy reading about a self-centered model who thinks her beauty is a curse (how horrible!), then skip this novel. Let the judges esteem it, but you don't have to. It's bad, awful. The writing is over-the-top, melodramatic, imprecise. The characters are laughable, caricatures, really. And Veronica? She dies of AIDS--ain't life a bitch...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Book","review":"I read the review for this book in People magazine some time ago. It was a favorable review, and the idea of a model, heroin, AIDS, and hepatitis sounded good. Yeah, I like those twisted drug books. I purchased the book and read about a hundered pages of it. It was so boring I put it down. I just didn't care for any of the characters or their storylines. In the first hundred pages there is not much about the heroin or AIDS and the book is only a little over two hundered pages. There is nothing worse than spending time on a boring book. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"I really gave this book a shot - but i was completely confused. Too many characters, too many settings. I didn't like the R-rated writing. Enough references about anal sex already! Way too confusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just throwing another 1-star into the mix","review":"Why on earth does anyone think this is good writing? There are enough painstakingly wrought similes and metaphors here to serve at least five novels. They are sometimes good, but for one slim volume, it's WAY too much. The reader is hard pressed to believe that anyone, no matter how frustratedly poetic, would reassess his/her life in this style. More largely, the characters and \\"plot\\" lacked life, the sex and sleaze failed to deliver their intended dose of shocking realism. Sigh, yawn. Didn't bother to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"Mary Gaitskill is best when she's poking fun at herself a little bit. She doesn't do a lot of that in this book. I recommend the story collectionBecause They Wanted Tofor more self-aware work by Mary Gaitskill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beauty of Words Beyond the Beauty of Form","review":"The prose of the novel really draws the reader in. Usually, when the subject matter revolves around the 80's, we are often given pop culture references for laughs. Veronica, however, makes you want to cry.It's a story about a girl who wants to be pretty, and by all accounts is, and famous. Gaitskill does an amazing job giving depth and breadth to a character we all too often assume as being flat and thin.This isn't a story about purposeful self-destruction; rather, it is a narrative of how we lived during the 80's--carpe diem, living for the day, living for the self. It is a parallel to those Horatio Alger stories we all used to read and love, only Gaitskill follows the trajectory of the one who failed.I love this story because it paints the world in all its ugliness and yet redeems it through the beauty of words rather than the beauty of form."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Exceptionally Talented Writer","review":"\\"Veronica\\" is my first exposure to Mary Gaitskill's prose, but it certainly won't be my last. Her perceptions and abstractions make this book an utter delight to read. Though the character of Allison finds employment as a model, do not be deceived into thinking that \\"Veronica\\" is a fluff piece (\\"The Devil Wore Prada\\", it isn't.) And it's not a novel so much as a character study(s). Gaitskill provides deft and enlightening portraits of her creations, and her sentences are breathtakingly descriptive without being verbose.However, the book's strengths might be considered weaknesses to some; if you're looking for a once-upon-a-time and happily-ever-after formula, you likely won't find \\"Veronica\\" to be suitable reading material. On the other hand, one may discover after exploring \\"Veronica\\" that one-dimensional novel/fairy tales don't quite cut it after all. It takes an especially gifted writer to broaden a reader's horizons thusly, but I dare say Ms. Gaitskill qualifies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horrible, fascinating story","review":"Gaitskill has permission to be the most honest, and haunting, of authors. Her seering penetration into the life of a narcissistic, talented, beautiful woman who has little control of her life has reprecussions for everyone -- author, reader, and character alike. All great lierature creates this feeling of compassion and culpability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beauty and the Beast in Man","review":"Gaitskill's central theme is, I think, the relationship between love and lust. Is being beautiful a fatal gift? The main relationship she describes is between Alison, the former model, and Veronica the unlikable AIDS infected proofreading temp, but there are multiple other dyads and triads, all illustrating types of love.This represents an advance in Gaitskill's work in many ways. It is more ambitious and profound, but also, I am afraid, a little less readable than her early work. If you're new to Gaitskill I would recommend starting with her earlier work, such as \\"Bad Behavior\\" which is written in a more straightforward style (and also contains more humor). In this one she uses a fancy-shmancy system of flashbacks, so that sometimes you don't know whether what you're reading is about the framing day in California, or reminiscences of Alison's childhood in New Jersey, or experiences in New York, or San Francisco or Paris."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snore...","review":"I was on the fence about buying this book, until I found out that Gaitskill wrote the story that became the movie SECRETARY, at which point I bought the book and jumped right in, hoping it might have some of the wit and humanity of that terrific little movie. Alas, it did not. \\"Veronica\\" is a novel that charts new realms in humorless navel-gazing. Time and again Gaitskill sets up scenes with great dramatic, comic, or erotic potential, only to abandon them in favor of some trite observation about decaying trees or city bus drivers. And her characters evaporate the moment you turn the page. Whatever happened to STORY? Whatever happened to CONFLICT? This book has neither...just a lot of fuzzy imagery, and really good jacket copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary talent","review":"Gaitskill is amazing. This impressionistic, Pollack-esque \\"novel\\" really hits you in the solar plexus. She captures the blight, emptiness, and fun of the 80s without sentimentalizing or sanitizing it. She is scarily talented the way she can depict loneliness, despair, vanity, vapidness and what Styron called the visible darkness. Touche."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetic Grit","review":"A dark, gritty underworld brought to light in this confessional of a lost soul. A tour de force of style, wit and poetry, placing Gaitskill among the most talented writers of her generation.

I called Rowenta, and they had me send it in for service. Most people only have one iron, so this was a real inconvenience. It was repaired; three months later I had the same problem. Rowenta's customer service representative was extremely rude, complacent about my recurring problem, and gave invalid excuses for the malfunction. He told me to send the iron in again. It would cost me another $10 to do so; and, again, they were not going to pay for postage. So, after deciding I did not want to go without my iron again and investing a total of $20 in postage I opted to throw it in the garbage.

There's way too many prolonged, how should I say, 'acoustic' moments, and when the 'heavier' parts kick in, it sounds pretty tamed and standard. The progresiveness factor that characterizes this band has almost dissapeared completely. While it's hard to argue that their best material was released in the '80s, the '90s still saw them being a bit creative. Don't get me wrong, this is still competently played and will appeal to you if you are into the lighter side of metal, or if you like decent music that's very accesible and doesn't necessarily requires a tag attached to it. Otherwise, stick with their classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't see what all the fuss is about","review":"I bought this after reading the reviews and frankly what a load of tosh......it was instantly off the CD and felt what a waste of money.I've been following prog since 1971 and have a fair amount of experience but this does nothing.

Why should I spend a wad of cash for an appliance to do a job that I hate! I was wrong. The weight of this iron enables it to glide effortlessly across the fabric. Cottons actually press crisp and wrinkle free. I find that I don't have to use spray on ironing aids nearly as much. Because of it's superior performance I spend far less time ironing. If this one ever dies, I'd buy another in a New York minute."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"If you want an Iron that will last you for a long time, this is the one.I actually have the DM860 Model but don't see any differences.I bought the Iron about a year ago and just love it.

The self cleaning function is a great addition, since some of the older Models did not have that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might work as a door-stop","review":"My wife purchased this iron, and for the first 3 months it worked great. We didn't use it that often (maybe two or three times a week), and after about 3 months, it completely stopped heating.Emails and calls to Rowenta produced very little. Instead of replacing the iron, Rowenta told us we would have to ship it to a repair center (at our cost) and they \\"might\\" be able to fix it.For an iron that sells for over $100, I estimate that it cost us about $3.50 every time we used it, so I don't recommend this product, and I don't consider Rowenta's customer service to be much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think carefully","review":"I have an older version of this professional model purchased for about $139. I guess I expected too much. I will not purchase another Rowenta iron. After a year I had to have it repaired as it just stopped working. That cost $40. I have used it for about a year and a half since it was repaired, doing light ironing on weekends. Just now, I plugged it in. It crackled like fireworks, sparked and shorted out. Quite frightening. That's it for this iron. It was also heavy. I had more success with my inexpensive Black and Decker."},{"rating":"1","title":"1st impressions great ... survivability HORRIBLE","review":"we use an iron about once a week and initially this was everything as expected after about a year however ... the iron suddenly quit working ... warranty is only in northern california (500 miles from me) and 2 other places and requires 2 weeks, so unless you have a \\"backup\\" iron, it is essentially worthless, tech support is NON-existant and the service rep claimed this problem occurred due to hard water even though our last iron lasted over 10 years with the same water.I offered to follow any diagram or instruction that they could or would give me but they said \\"if the iron won't heat, it REQUIRES shipping to service facility, no exceptions or assistance available\\".The iron looks brand new, it jest doesnt work ... i suggest great care in paying a \\"premium\\" price for a \\"non-premium\\" product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Performance","review":"Within less than several months of using this product, performance problems began.

Trust that it will not be this brand. A relative also purchased this iron and she, too, had problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short service life - Avoid Rowenta","review":"I bought this item thinking it was a premium product. After about a year, it stopped heating. Recently, I took it apart to figure out why it conked out. I think it was an overtemperature cutout switch. The problem is, that cutout switch doesn't reset! So if you have one temperature excursion, you have a paperweight.I kind of fixed it, but it has no overtemp protection now. Pretty lame.If this typifies Rowenta design and workmanship (it was made in Germany, for gosh sakes), I'll never buy Rowenta again. Poor reliability, hard to fix, no spare parts...

It has a wonderful design and when new, functioned admirably. Well worth the 100+ dollars spent. Unfortunately, the service life is extremely short. Used for household ironing only, and not very much in my opinion, the on-light now frequently cycles between red and orange so you are never sure if it is heating properly. The performance level is terrible at this point. I tried calling Rowenta customer service but the auto answerer told me they were \\"all out at a meeting\\" and then hung up on me. Not a very good start. They could certainly learn a customer service lesson from Eddie Bauer, LL Bean, Land's End, etc. I will try one more time. Currently, I recommend that you avoid this product unless you like buying new ones frequently at a premium price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this iron","review":"This is my second Rowenta Professional Iron. I was tired of the small, lightweight, low steaming domestic irons, and was very pleased after purchasing the Rowenta. I iron at least 3 hours per week, and definitely need a good iron. It does a beautiful job on table linens due to it's weight, size, and great steaming. To fill it with water is very easy, and it has a little cover to prevent the water from escaping. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the first iron only lasted 6 years. Maybe I am from the \\"old school\\" where appliances lasted longer, but I didn't expect to replace it so soon. However, it didn't prevent me from replacing it with the same iron."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Iron but ... Poor manufacturer response","review":"I loved my Rowenta Iron ... But, when it started leaking water my husband tried for one year to get a response from the manufacturer on how to get it repaired. It still gets hot but, the wonderful steam it used to produce no longer works as we never were able to get any assistance from the manufacture for replacing the water tank. The iron was never dropped and neither my husband or I ever figured out what caused the leak.Would be a 5 star item if the manufacturer stood behind their product."},{"rating":"1","title":"No stars if I could","review":"I was expecting great things, between the price and the Rowenta reputation.

Spits - leaks water when pressing, this pressing cotton on the cotton setting. Every time I make a pass with the iron it leaves 2-3 water spots each the size of a dime. It also occasionally leaves a dark smudge as if there were dirt on the sole plate. Then on dark clothing it spits out some white substance that looks like it might be calcium deposits - though I don't use hard water in this iron.Feh.

My question is \\"who wrote this book???\\" Not Mercedes Lackiey - unless it is something from her very early writings. Her usual savvy style, humor, and rich characters are totally missing in this book. And the abundance of typographical errors indicates lack of care or a \\"copy and paste\\" of manuscript bits from several sources. Perhaps because I am such a great fan of hers, I expect more from her books. One thing I will say, the cover is absolutely gorgeous."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of Lackey's Best","review":"This is a really well written book. This was just an exceptional piece of writing for her. I enjoy her stuff normally but this one was quick and fun to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Lackey lackey","review":"I've always shied away from Lackey's novels in the past. I hate to admit it, but the cover art just really puts me off. But a moment of weakness in a checkout line provoked me into buying this one. Hmm...It had me hooked at first, but halfway through the novel the story line just fell apart. I love a good underdog-makes-good story, but her plot devices required too much of a leap of faith at times; the largest being an eleven year old dragon drudge hiding a newly hatched and RAPIDLY growing dragon under the noses of a strict dragon culture. Nope, didn't work for me. Aside from the fact that a book buddy caught me reading it and teased me unmercifully for days, I just might see what the Valdemar (sp?) fuss is all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, but not great","review":"In \\"Joust,\\" Mercedes Lackey creates a world very similar to Ancient Egypt, but with an added twist. Vetch is a serf, bound to the land, and to his cruel master, when he is rescued by a \\"Jouster\\" - a sort of knight-equivalent who rides a dragon. Vetch is a very likeable, pragmatic character, and Ari is a fascinating one; someone who doesn't fit the mould of his society. Lackey really excels at world-building and description, but this book is a little thin on plot. I especially enjoyed \\"listening\\" to her characters' ethical reflections and dilemmas, though. This is a very good, interesting read, though not one I would buy in hardcover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid coming of ages story","review":"It was a treat to see Mercedes Lackey leave the familiar world of Valdemar and venture into new territory. The world she has created for her new series has an Egyptian feel, which gives it a unique flavor. Much of the action follows the standard fantasy conventions, but the characters are well drawn, particularly the narrator Vetch.I enjoyed this book and am looking forward to the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tale of the Two Kingdoms","review":"The story (or at least the beginning of one) of a young serf and his struggle for freedom in fantasy depiction of the Ancient Egyptian Upper and Lower Kingdoms while they were at war.There are alot of positive things that I can say for this work. For starters, the characters aren't all superheroes- they are very human in their thoughts and depictions. For another, while the descriptions are colorful and vivid, they aren't long-winded. The story is easy to follow.However, some of the descriptions and phrases are repetitive- but not to the point that it really stands out. It simply appears after a few readings of the material. Also, towards the end, Jouster Ari tends to go... mushy.However, overall, this book was a wonderful creation, and I am very much looking foreward to its sequel (for she left a very open-ended story, perfect for a sequel.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"great dragon scifi adventure!!!","review":"Great dragon scifi adventure, the series looses some steam in terms of interest over the four books but I love the world that she created!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites.","review":"This book is amazing.

It's definitely one of my favorite series. If you love books about dragons, I recommend this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coasting by on Name Recognition","review":"I have been really disappointed in many of Ms. Lackey's more recent books. Too many of them seem contrived--just \\"money books\\" that she knows will sell on the basis of her name. This book is just more of the same. I didn't feel that it was original or fresh or even that well written. I am particularly tired of the excessive use of italics in all of her works. People rarely think or talk in italics.

Her Heralds of Valdemar and Last Herald Mage books are among my all time favorites. This book, hoever, must be among the weakest of her works that I have read to date.

Sad to say, that brief description completely encompasses the scope of this book. There is NO character developement, no plot development, no surprises. If any of you have ever read Jane Yolan's Dragon Boy ( title may be incorrect but I think i got the author right) then you have read this story and in a much better form.

I purchased \\"Mercy\\" before it was released and was not disappointed. I did the same with \\"Killjoy\\". Big mistake. I found very little to like about this novel. It started well, but with each chapter it went farther and farther downhill. But, I kept hoping and then by page 300 I simply gave up. The story didn't connect me with the characters - I really didn't care what happened to them. The plot was so over the top that I kept wondering if it was all a joke. My recommendation - skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad book from a good author","review":"A strange and violent story from an author I'd come to enjoy reading. Usually Julie Garwood mixes humor and mystery with a fairly believable plot. Not this time. The plot was just ludicrous, the humor lame, and the characters might have been cardboard cutouts. If this is the path she's following, I'll look for someone else to entertain me."},{"rating":"1","title":"LUDICROUS!","review":"This is right up there in the top five of the worst books I've ever read. (Actually, I listened to it in audio format.) Amateurish, childish, clichéd prose, unbelievable characters, a stupid plot, and the most hilarious dialogue. If this is the way people speak in historical romance novels, I'm glad I don't read them. But this is supposed to be a contemporary setting and no one in real life talks the way these characters do. The descriptions of sex and romantic scenes made me laugh out loud.How do writers like this get published? This is a royal stinker! Don't waste your time. If you want a good suspense novel, there are hundreds of better writers out there than Ms. Garwood."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a killjoy","review":"As a longtime Julie Garwood fan, I buy her books as soon as they are available. I wish I'd saved my money this time. This book was a total disappointment. The story rambled, the characters were so boring I was cheering the hitman on instead of the hero and heroine. Everyone has a miss now and again, this was Garwood's. She was so caught up in the elaborate plot and subplot she completely lost her way and her reader. My advice to readers, if you want to read it, borrow from a friend or the library, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun storyline!","review":"I enjoy anything written by this writer as a rule and KILLJOY is added to that list. I enjoyed reading about the new characters in this story as well as some characters the reader was already introduced to. If you enjoy a good time while reading then you should read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Julie Why","review":"Killjoy is better than Heartbreaker by half a star, which isn't to say it's any good. Our hero and heroine are one dimensional, there is a psychopath killer and another psychopath telling the killer what to do. Boring. Our hero is the strong silent type and our heroine is another leggy blonde who isn't as useless as she looks. Honestly. Julie Garwood tells the reader every chapter how not useless, just leggy, she really is.If you don't like character development and prefer action this is the book for you. If you are a historical Julie Garwood fan and looking for romance avoid this one. Borrow it don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"Have read this book from the library and decided it was time to own it myself. I Love to reread the entire series each time a new installment comes out. I received this book very quickly in excellent condition. Thanks a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killjoy is a joy to read...","review":"Although I am a diehard Julie Garwood romance fan, I have to say that I enjoyed this suspense novel as well. Julie has gifted us all with her talent for many years now and I feel she has done well with her leap into a new genre. KILLJOY was a great adventure read and one that kept me coming back for more. I do hope Julie will still write a straight romance soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh uh","review":"I didn't care for this book at all. After Mercy, and her other earlier novels, which were good, this was a real letdown. Compared to other authors mystery/romance novels, this was a disappointment. Garwood's characters and plot were not believable. I hope her next novel gets back to her norm."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is suspense, people are really dense","review":"This book sounded like a good suspense novel....I could tell the plot early in the book and even skiming it didn't lose anything. I was never so disappointed. I could tell the whole plot and it was wordy and so stayed.....I see no need to finish it because it's so transparent...... I quess I should stay away from romatic suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened???","review":"I have all of Julie Garwood's previous historical romance books. And for the last 3 years i have been waiting for her to realise that everyone has a special talent and one should stick to them, and that her talent is writing historical romances, and that she should leave contemparies for people who specialise in it. Not that itz unreadable or anything, but she shouldn't be wasted on something that she's ok at, she should do osmething that shez BRILLIANT at, like writing more historical romance, to save me from bending the spines of my books from too much re reading.For the last 3 years i have re-read her previous books countless times, i probably have them memorized by heart!! It is sucha disappointment!!! What happened to her idea of wanting to write a sequel for Saving Grace?? And perhaps a new historical romance??? What happened??? What happened????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, brother ...","review":"This was the most disjointed book I've ever read. Cardboard, almost caroonlike, characters. No real humor, lots of repitition (\\"oh, brother\\" and \\"suck it up\\") and very little suspense. It did have a great cover, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable","review":"I really wish Ms Garwood would stick to historical romances instead of contempary, at least then the heroine in the book is in context to the language. I am sick and tired of reading a woman in this day and age speaking like some goody goody girl in times gone by. Who in this day and age says \\"Goodness\\" repeatedly? And I sure there is not one woman alive on this planet that yells \\"Heavens to Betsy!\\" when she orgasms. Either stick to historicals Ms Garwood, or bring your contempary heroines into the 20th centuary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Thirds of This Book Is Pretty Good","review":"After a slow, and unfortunately mandatory prologue, this novel becomes a fairly pleasurable quick read. I guess you could call it a \\"riller\\", a cross between a romance novel and a thriller. The main characters talk a great deal about how good they are at their respective jobs (big bad dude and beautiful FBI analyst). Neither prove their mettle in proportion to their boasting, although the heroine displays a couple of spurts of yoga-transcendental-meditation-mediated mental acuity. I've never read a romance novel, so I was surely surprised to note that a woman's lips could be swollen from kissing. And there is a lot of smooching; pages of it, with tongues reaching so deep that I suspect that livers were licked. Lastly, the ending was told in the style of a flashback reminiscent of the events, which was a somewhat disappointing departure from the style of the rest of the narrative."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC BOOK","review":"This book has the best dialogue between its characters. There is mystery, romance, and humor. I have read all of Julie Garwood's books and she just keeps getting better and better. Do not miss this one, it was a true pleasure to read it. I can't wait for Ms. Garwood's next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's my First Time","review":"This was my first time reading this author. I must admit, it was an interesting book, until I started forseeing events before they happened.The beginning of the book got me interested enough to read the story, I mean Avery's mom was a real trip. I was thinking Carrie was going to be one way and then she did a 360 on me. I was like oooh I don't like her, she acted like a spoiled, I've always had everything all my life and I need this done right now kinda of person, she could have been a bit more humbled.Then the whole Avery and Mr. ex-FBI, southern talking, jock falling in love while jumping in rivers and down water falls, yeah right!I did enjoy the whole evil sister parts,I thought she was just delightful.I wanted to know was was in the third letter.It was a fun quick read, no Jackie Collin's Lucky though, but okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF TIME","review":"Violent - Worthless plot - No Romance - Poor Writing ...What ever happened to the warm, romantic historical novels that Ms. Garwood wrote so well??This book was a waste of time and money !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great read","review":"I recommended this book to anyone who likes a good mystery. I could hardly put it down. It kept me occupied for sometime. I really think you will like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would Make A Great Movie","review":"More of a suspense story than a love story Ms Garwood almost seemed hard pressed to import the romance. But the story was definitely riveting. This book could so very easily be turned into an engrossing movie. It begs to be written as such. The focus shifts from the victims to the villains and back to the protagonists. Kept things hopping right along. Moreover the psychopath's history with the heroine adds greatly to the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"How does this tripe get published?","review":"This is my second and last novel by Garwood. When I read Mercy, I was willing to give her the benefit of the doubt, and figured it was just not her best. Killjoy was even worst. The writing is all passive, more telling than showing. This author has the oddest way of circumventing her own suspense by undercutting the action. She rarely follows through on the action scenes; instead, she tells the reader about it. The dialogue is laughable and the villians more silly than menacing. Avery (the heroine) is the only decent character in the mix, but she can't come close to saving this book from the trash heap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gil Evans presents Cecil Taylor - Great avant garde jazz","review":"This is, first of all, not Gil Evans writing, but rather Cecil Taylor as arranger for a medium size jazz ensemble. The music could be described as cubist jazz. There are elements of traditional jazz riffs juxaposed to non rhythmic playing. It is not as chaotic as some avant garde jazz and has some nice moods. It played on the radio this morning and I had to stay in my car listening in the parking lot even though I was late for a meeting. Good stuff -- IF you like avant garde jazz.P.S. Half the record is Taylor's writing the other half is by another arranger whos name I forget, sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy and Slow","review":"Bernstein treated Gershwin with awe and reverence. These recordings were an attempt to sell Gershwin as a \\"really important composer.\\" In those days that meant that all jazz influence had to be carfully filtered out. What is left are tempi so ponderous that the music becomes nearly inert. There is nothing left of the propulsive energy that is so central to the Rhapsody. If you envision Gershwin and Bruchner as soulmates, then this is the recording for you. For a recording of the Rhapsody exhudes the brash insouciance of the 1920s, consider Michael Tilson Thomas and the LA Philharmonic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Showcase","review":"This album shows Gershwin, Grofe, Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic in characteristic form.

The technical issues are invisible to the listener as Kavakos tells the story so artfully written by Ysaye. Especially memorable are the Fugato movement of the first,the Sarabandes of the Second and Fourth. The popular Ballade is a tribute to the performer's expertise and taste-truly superb. The last two are fiendishly difficult, and Kavakos throws them off in true prize-winning fashion. This is a MUST for anyone that enjoys violin performance at the highest level of power playing,passion,and enthusiasm. The love and interpretive respect for Ysaye is clear throughout the entire program.Kavakos is not yet a household word....and he should be!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Recording","review":"Of course Kavakos was the winner of the Paganini competition so it is no suprise to me that he played so well on this disk.This is the best set of the Ysaye sonatas ever recorded but listen to Shumsky's CD also."},{"rating":"2","title":"A FANTASTIC COLLECTION","review":"In 3 DVDs , for a very good price, you can watch the complete series of Playboy Wet & Wild : 10 titles, some unavailable, from 1989 to 2002.These titles, in my opinion, are among the best of Playboy (a must for PB collectors): the playmates, as usual, are gorgeous, but there is a richness of cheerfulness, innocence, joie de vivre, lacking in more recent Playboy productions."},{"rating":"1","title":"posing posing posing - boring!","review":"Although the girls are beautiful and sexy, I thought the description of the movie was more \\"girl on girl\\" soft-core.

We all owe our lives to him. It is a book for the hard working and the pampered, for nations that cut funds for their Veterans Administrations like the United States has almost continually done, and for parents who wonder how much more to pamper their little darlings so that they will be loved as fathers and mothers. Montgomery beat the best that Hitler could send against him and us, and he did the same wherever he was sent. His expertise was strategy, not politics, not taking advantage of interns or skipping out on his wife.

The choice was pretty easy for me -- I enjoy Omnia (original), I appreciate Alberto Morillas, and the deal was too good to pass up (about 20 bucks for 2.2oz).Crystalline & Shi are similar - clear, clean, watery, soft florals that stay close to the skin. However, Crystalline is done much better than Shi, in my opinion.Last summer I went through a bottle of Crystalline in less than 2 months because I continually applied it. I really loved the notes and development, and I appreciated it more each time I wore it. But it was an EDT. I want (and need) something with more projection, a quality that neither Shi or Crystalline has.Crystalline isn't a go-to, everyday fragrance for me. In fact, I think this whole class of aquatic fragrance isn't for me, but Crystalline is among the best of its class."},{"rating":"2","title":"LIGHT FLORAL SCENT","review":"Amazon is really offering a great deal.

Would not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hardcover \\"Vintage Style\\"","review":"Since I loved the \\"Vintage Style\\" pattern collection enough to commit right away to three different projects, I couldn't resist purchasing this new hardcover edition. It has at least one important correction, because it includes the yarn color key to the chart for the Kaffe Fassett vest that was inadvertently omitted from the softcover edition. This is not a book for brand-new knitters, because the patterns use light- to medium-weight yarns, include shaping, and may utilize \\"advanced\\" techniques like intarsia. However, the finished garments are well worth the effort! Many of the patterns can be previewed on the web sites of Rowan yarn retailers that carry the \\"Vintage Style\\" pattern collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled -- this is NOT a new book","review":"Unfortunately, this is NOT a new book from Rowan. It was first published last winter (2004) in the company's usual paperback format as \\"Vintage Style.\\" It is still a lovely book with several attractive designs to knit, but it's the exact same book most Rowan fans already bought last year. I am extremely disappointed in Rowan for misleading its customers with this repackaging effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sizing problems","review":"I was surprised and disappointed to find that instructions for all the women's sweaters in this book top out at what is labeled an XL but which fits only a 40\\" bust, comparable to a size 14 dress or a medium t-shirt, and which is a measurement I haven't been able to claim since the eighth grade. I don't buy the usual excuse, that people were smaller in the past, for tiny-sizing vintage patterns: my grandmother, born in 1889, and my mother, born in 1923, were both 5'11\\" with figures proportionate to that height, just like me born in 1951. So unless you are a small woman or are knitting for a kid, this is not the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely patterns... but too small","review":"I love the patterns in this book, but they run too tight through the chest for most of my family. The instructions are clear, well written. Nice, but I wouldn't recommend the patterns for anyone who is above a B cup. They pull at the armholes and they simply don't go large enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must-have knitting book","review":"Hi. I'm a knit-a-holic. I love to knit, and I am always on the lookout for a new pattern to make. Knitting books are expensive, though, so I usually check them out at the library and rarely make a purchase. Well, this books impressed me so much that I bought it--and I'm glad I did. The patterns are lovely, and many have a timeless quality to them. (I will be able to use this book well into the future, since the pieces won't go out of style.) There is a nice mix of easy, intermediate, and intense level projects. I especially love the fact that there are patterns for masculine sweaters that even my hipster boyfriend would wear. (And he's picky!) Perhaps the best part about this book is the photography. The whole book is in color, and the pictures show off the pieces well. The models are (relatively) normal sized, so you can get a sense of what the pieces will look like on a real person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very vintage, very British, very nice","review":"This book is lovely to look at. I haven't knitted up anything yet so I cannot comment on how well written are the pattern. But as far as I can see, the book is a good keep if you are a Rowan-style fashion fan. It is nice even just to look at it without knitting anything (just yet). With all the big designer names, it can't be wrong. One more good thing about this pattern book is that, the FO are shown by real modern time models. It might come to a surprise to you, but there are many pattern books out there just put the original picture from the original pattern. Very difficult to imagine how it is like on real modern time body."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic designs, but the one I was looking for was not here","review":"I am a fan of Kaffe Fassett's designs for knitting, needlepoint, and knitted clothing offered by Peruvian Connection. I saw a beautiful knitted long coat with multicolor leaves in the design that had appeared in a vintage Rowan booklet designed by Kaffe Fassett. The coat is featured in this book but the pattern is not offered! I specifically wanted that pattern, because I would love to make that coat. I have looked for the original booklet on Amazon, ebay, etc. and that one issue is not available. So the beautiful pictures are a tease and only a few basic designs are offered. The patterns offered are nice, but I was very disappointed that the one I loved most was not available. This is more of a book about Rowan and their history than a pattern book, but it is inspirational."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Trio Style.

It's hard to call anything this masterful guitarist does uneventful- sheer technical mastery alone makes that impossible- but next to most modern Metheny stimuli this rests with the most relatively mediocre."},{"rating":"2","title":"much to enjoy, but a bit uneven","review":"Pat Metheny is the best in my book, but this disc is not quite up to the simple beauty of Missouri Sky or the haunting and evocative recordings with the Pat Metheny Group (Offramp is still my favorite). The reworking of Lone Jack is great and Travels is quite beautiful. Some of the other pieces are less accessible to a non-musician, non-jazz aficianado like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another masterful album from the guitar virtuoso","review":"Trio 99>00 is, simply, Metheny's best trio album yet. The man is an endless well of melodies. It's quite a stripped down, raw affair compared to the production values we normally associate with the Pat Metheny Group, and what a refreshing change it is! There's a wonderful immediacy to the album. I can't stop listening to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highs and Lows, But the Lows Are High","review":"Pat Metheny creates some of the most complex and rapid-fire guitar improvisations the human ear can digest. And he can play soft and slow, with unerring feel. This album mixes both types of songs. The result is not quite the the sheer beauty of Missouri Sky, but it is much richer and more rewarding than lots of Pat Metheny Group compositions. I hear new things every time I listen to this album, and I think I am likely to hear new things for many more listens. Some songs are more appealing than others (isn't this true for most albums?) but even the less appealing songs are worth listening to and pondering. Pat Metheny is a world-class musician."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Jazz","review":"I have a lot of Pat Metheny CD and most are what I call \\"world jazz\\" which personally I do not like. However, this is more like my other favorite Pat Methany CD called \\"Questions & Answers\\". This is pure jazz. Guitar, Bass, Drummer. It's great background music at a party or at work. I only give this 4 starts because I felt the Q&A album was better, just my opinion, and there was no 4 1/2 stars. If you like the guitar jazz, also check out Jerry Garcia/David Grisman album \\"So What\\". Just awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"A long-awaited release","review":"Just glanced at a website that dismissed this Oliver Nelson reissue, which I've long awaited, saying that \\"nothing exciting happens.\\" I'd dare anyone to listen to the band's version of \\"Milestones,\\" with the dueling saxophones of Nelson and, I believe, Tom Scott, and not become excited. Check out Nelson's soaring poignancy on \\"I Remember Bird\\" as well...Now his fans need \\"Black, Brown and Beautiful\\" released from whoever owns the defunct Flying Dutchman catalog."},{"rating":"2","title":"This recording is PRICELESS!","review":"I bought this on vinyl in 1968 when I was in the south in the Army, and couldn't believe it when I saw it out on CD just now! Now the lucky drivers around me are going to hear \\"Down By The Riverside\\" blasting out of my car everyday! Any fan of big band jazz should buy this CD for \\"Down By The Riverside\\" ALONE! That trumpet section just simply screams on that cut. Their ensembles, solo choruses and the \\"fours\\" they alternate on are the best ever recorded in my opinion, and my father was a jazz musician, my ears have heard a lot of fabulous jazz.If you have a good system in your car you can educate thousands of drivers with this CD on what American music should sound like, and man, play it as loud as you can! One last thought: if you only can buy one more big band CD in your lifetime, make it this one...you owe it to your ears and to your soul.Dean Brassfield"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book light","review":"I've had mine now for years.

He speaks with my husband (native) and this is how I want him to hear the Italian in the dvds. And what actually does make me mad is on the dvd is claims to have native speakers. Most Americans would never know, not very ethical.My two year old loves the songs, but it's also very annoying and not practical that the learning quiz sections stop the dvd so I have to come in and skip them one by one for my two year old.

On the occasions I have picked one up out of boredom when I've had nothing else to read, I can't say I was ever really impressed. Until I was stuck on a plane for 8 hours with nothing to read but the mislaid copy of \\"Flashback\\" by Nancy Warren. I have to say this is a great read. The character of Laura is so likeable, you just want her to get her man and find true love. And the hunky Jack is someone you yourself wish you had in your life- sexy, passionate, built, but still beautifully gentle and loving. I think Nancy's writing is brilliant. She keeps the plot unravelling at just the right speed, the love scenes just erotic enough and the characters consistently riveting. I loved it and would highly reccomend it. I couldn't believe how it got my busy brain focussed on romance and desire. I can tell you one thing, my husband is sure glad I read it!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun, sexy read.","review":"This is a great book, even for those who don't usually read romance.

The album benefits from having an excellent rhythm section that is already a band so the tunes are pacy and keep their shape and the three additional wind instrument players know how to play avant guard without making it sound like a strangled cat.

So, Amazon there I came. In an almost serendipitous action I picked Cho Liang Lin and the Leonard Slatkin CD. Remarkably it was a choice made on Mount Olympus by the music gods.The passion with which Lin created his interpretation of Bruch,the lyrical context of the adagio movement, and the climactic allegro, the tapistry of sounds created by the Chicago SO back up, and even the ambiance created by the CD cover was far more than I deserved, for the price I paid.

This man is fascinated by Sammy Davis, Jr., and there's a lot of him (Billy, that is). Eugene Levy, Christopher Guest, and even Brother Theodore -- laugh-out-loud fun. But the second half is a stand-up concert at some high school or college, and Billy's material is weak. Most of it is the Fernando character, but interviewing members of the audience. I've never liked the business of interviewing members of an audience, going back to Johnny's show. Billy does do one of the highlights of his many-years-later Broadway show, involving home movies.

The students often find the exposition incomprehensible (as do I). The authors frequently pull results out of thin air when a few lines of derivation/explanation would have made things clear. The problem sets are generally useless as they are routinely too difficult or too easy. The choice of topics is over-reaching. Care should be taken with fundamentals, then applications and variations on a theme can be introduced. This book makes the fundamentals a mystery, then piles on one topic after another before the end of the chapter. I can't think of anything good to say about this book. No real online support.

Here are some of my favorite tracks: All Saints delivers a very well composed, very dreamy and enchanting track, \\"Pure Shores\\", a definite feel good song. Leftfield gives the ambient track \\"Snakeblood\\", the CD's opener, a very wanderlust feel, which makes the CD's overall listening experience more excitng. Moby's euphoric ditty, \\"Porcelin\\" just screams paradise. You'll know what i mean once you hear it. Blur's \\"On Your Own\\", remixed by William Orbit, has an electro- magnetic pulse backed by hard drum and bass and guitars. A definite breakthrough in electronic composition. This album never gets boring. Its a guarenteed Top Ten in the soundtrack catagory. If you like dreamy ambient, techno or electro- funk beats, this album is for you. A definite keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best film soundtrack ever!","review":"I actually bought this before I saw the film and I've been playing it ever since. It's got everything you could possibly want, from lazing-on-the-sand tunes (Pure Shores) to delicate piano-led gear (Porcelain) to sunset theme songs (Spinning Away). Faithless's Woozy spaces you out, while Leftfield's Snakeblood is a powerful opener. My overall favourite, though, is New Order's Brutal, the title of which pretty much describes the caning I've been (and still am) giving it. Tracks 8 and 11 are well dodgy but overall, this CD is absolutely top - get it even if you're not interested in the film. By the way, this would've got five stars but it lost one for not including one of the best tracks ever made: Out Of Control. Why wasn't it on here?"},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL!","review":"Finally someone has mixed Leonardo DiCaprio's voice on a dance track.

It's dark, happy, sad, and energetic. Leftfield's \\"Snakeblood\\" starts the disc with a gloomy feel. This begins to change with the next few songs including \\"Pure Shores\\" from All Saints, Moby's emotional \\"Porcelain\\"(which is THE best) and Sugar Ray's \\"Spinning Away\\". These songs inject that sensational feeling of being on a beach....just close your eyes. Blur's \\"On Your Own\\" and \\"Woozy\\" from Faithless begin to direct the mood towards the chaotic side. Hard beats, fast, and disorienting which, in the end, leaves a sense of \\"panic\\" over you. The last song, \\"Beached\\" falls under the ambient/dance catagory. The perfect closing track. I bought this soundtrack primarily for Moby's \\"Porcelain\\" (in search of it ever since first hearing it in a commercial). I was worried about being disappointed with the remaining tracks, but the entire disc turned out to be fantastic. This is definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"incredible","review":"This soundtrack is incredible.

Most of the tracks have a pleasent sense of exotic relaxation and tropical shores which obviously fit the movie (which isn't very good). There are some tense, dark tracks too. Everything on this cd is really good, even All Saints, which suprised me. It's mostly an electronic/ambient vibe, but don't be put off if you're not a fan because this music is very accessible. And NO there's no 'alternative'/grunge slop on this cd which makes it very refreshing. Most people posting reviews seem to be making a fuss that the song by Live, 'Dolphin's Cry' isn't here, even though it's in the ads. The song just doesn't fit on this soundtrack.

I found myself liking songs which I didn't think I would, for example, Sugar Ray's take on \\"Spinning Away.\\" Only a few songs didn't grab my attention, or maybe they just work better when listened to while watching the movie, and don't make the same impact when heard by themselves. One song that would have been *perfect* for this movie (although admittedly out of place) is Toad The Wet Sprocket's \\"Walk On The Ocean.\\" In any event, this is a fun soundtrack to play while driving or simply sitting alone. And you don't even have to like the movie to enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not really a review","review":"This is in response to a question someone had about the music used in a commercial for \\"The Beach\\". The song is by a group called VAST. And no, it is not on the soundtrack. At least not the US version.

Hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's got new New Order; of course it's worth getting!","review":"The Beach soundtrack contains \\"Brutal\\", the first song New Order has released in 5+ years. Not a bad one at that, as we find the band digging into their postpunk rocky roots to throw out a tune that's not as polished and shimmery as their synthpop fare, but just as good nontheless.Other than that, William Orbit dazzles us with his writing/producing skills. The man can even make All Saints sound good. Wow.Sugar Ray's \\"Spinning Away\\" also soars above and beyond anything they could have done under their own power. The song is written by Brian Eno, Mr. Ambient God himself.Moby turns out a less than stunning track, \\"Snakeblood\\" by Leftfield is a great opener, and the rest of the selections run the gamut from inspired to pathetic.Overall, very worthwhile. I'm so glad soundtracks are no longer being used as excuses to compile as many top 40 hits as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth and Groovin'","review":"This CD provides the perfect blend of moody techno, trip-hop, and upbeat dance tunes.

Murray Perahia captures the breakaway spirit of Mozart wonderfully in this fine release. K. 413 is quite impressive, filled with many delights. The slow movement of K.414 is based on a theme by his friend and mentor, Johann Christian Bach, who had passed on January 1, 1782. Both first and last movements are bright and lively. Concerto No.14 in E-flat, K.449, was written early in 1784. The success of The Abduction from the Seraglio seemed to inspire Mozart to new dramatic heights, as evidenced by the tension and dramatic changes in the opening movement especially. As always, Perahia and the English Chamber Orchestra provide distinguished accounts of these early Viennese masterpieces. This CD is warmly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good problem set, more than adequate solutions","review":"problems are dated, but it helped with my thermo class.

Russell is an amazing talent when it comes to chord melody playing. His voicings, along with slick tricks using harmonics makes for a beautiful addition to the standard approach to playing jazz guitar chord melody. What makes this CD difficult to listen to is his playing in time or with the rhythm section. His lines are mostly un inventive and have a very awkward feel. It does not have the feel of say, Grant Green or George Benson. It sounds as if his picking is not worked out well and subtracts from the over all rhythmic feel of the music. I would love to hear a record of just solo guitar from this artist!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jazz Muzak","review":"I dearly love jazz guitar and I also dearly love the ballad format, so I eagerly plunked down the money and ordered this album. I put it in the car for a long trip, but could hardly get to the end of it it was so deadly boring. It seems Malone is more interested in doodling and making a few pretty noises than he is in performing cohesive songs. This is the kind of stuff that gives many daytime FM stations a bad name.

I do not know if my body chemistry or sense of smell has changed but I am wild about this fragrance and I have been wearing it every day. Very strange indeed.

I'd heard wonderful things about it, read countless reviews, but couldn't find it anywhere in stores in my area. Finally, I decided to buy it scent-blind.Instead of a deep, introspective or even melancholy scent, I got powder and musty, artificial florals. After several hours, it still smells awful. I realize that everyone experiences fragrance differently, but I really wish I'd known how cloying and powdery this perfume was. Thankfully I ordered from Sephora and they do returns free of charge.I respect that others love this perfume, but I strongly encourage anyone who hasn't personally smelled it to order a sample first, or order from a store that's forgiving when you want to return an item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to have access to this beautiful, once hard to find fragrance.","review":"This is a friend's favorite scent in the whole world.

But she was thrilled with the gift. Before Christmas last year, I happened to notice her bottle was empty and I was THRILLED to find l'Heure Bleue a. on Amazon (so accessible) and b with FREE SHIPPING.

Good cock[it presentation on the 737-200, but not on the 727.The only negative is that much of the cockpit chatter and a lot of the ATC chatter is in Spanish, so you may have trouble following it."},{"rating":"2","title":"waaaaayyyyy underated","review":"ok, i first heard about this band a few months ago, so i got one of their songs off their second album wyrd, another 5 IMO, and was totally mesmorized by it. You can trust me that you've never heard anything like this band before, and when i say its good trust me, im very picky with music, and wouldn't readily give much 5 stars, after listening to this band for the last few months they've easily climbed to my favorite band ever. The musicians are extremely talented, but more than that, they KNOW HOW TO WRITE SONGS, an element that seems to be missing in alot of bands who rely heavily on talent. This band posseses both factors. And once again trust me, im not a bandwagon fan who listens to something catchy and gives it 5 stars, buy this album along with their other album wyrd. If you like good unparalled metal, buy this cd without hesitation, though it seems its out, so buy wyrd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised--stay away!","review":"Instead of handsome red ball illustrated on box, received a greasy, smelly EVERLAST (not Bally) ball, the pump was different and hard to work, than the one illustrated on the box and there was no instruction sheet on how to use the product included in the box as advertised.

Found these Novus products to work well on heavily scratched brass, carbon steel and stainless steel as well as paint and clear coat finishes.

I wanted to keep the desk and this made it more ergonomic. It's a great product for the price. It doesn't glide smoothly like the higher end keyboard trays, but I didn't expect it to. The only problem I had is that the mounting brackets meant the required space for installation was actually 1/2 inch wider than the dimensions advertised for the product listing.

What Jaws did for swimming at the beach, this does for camping trips and zoo visits. Try it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yikes !","review":"I didn't feel that the book started out slowly. I felt that it set the stage. I haven't been to Glacier, yet, and it took me to the park. I met the people, the bears, and I could picture the scenery.

The magazine article had a few exceperts of this book and in only a few exceperts of this article I had to purchase this book.After I read this book I was utterly engrossed in Jack Olsen's writting style of what happened in that horrible summer of 1967 in Glacier National Park. It was fascinating to hear about the events that lead of the events that lead up to the writing of this book.It was deftly written account of what happened that summer with more suspense than most horror movies. I would recommened anyone who is a outdoors person to read this story, or anyone interested in nature. The book doesn't make the bear the enemy, which is difficult in light of what happened to 2 unfortunate campers.I highly recommend this book, but not while you camping in grizzlie country, it may make you a little paranoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bureaucracy Run Amuck","review":"I read this excellent book in preparation for my first trip to Glacier and Yellowstone. From page one, I was mesmerized. Nothing could have torn this book from me. After Grizzlies, I read everything I could find on bears. I also returned from Montana with ten copies and assigned them to my staff to read. Why? Because this is a classic tale of bureaucracy run amuck. I am a conservationist, a naturalist and a lover of wildlife. But I am also a manager of a large operation with many employees. Grizzlies taught me I must always pay attention - always watch for the danger signs - listen to what people are telling me. Not that I must manage in fear, but that there are always signs of impending disaster. We can avoid that disaster if we pay attention. This point was clearly and brilliantly made in 1997 by Gavin DeBecker in Gift of Fear. I recommend it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exciting account of two bear attacks in Glacier Park.","review":"The best non-fiction book I have ever read.

I was reading this book the evening we arrived at Glacier (poor planning), and continued reading while my boyfriend set up the tent at a campground. The book was so engrossing, I read through dinner, and continued to read after he turned in. I finished at about 1:00 am, but was too frightened to walk the 20 feet from the car to the tent, so I spent the night, freezing the whole time, in the car. The next day we set out for the trailhead, and I've never, ever been so frightened on a backpacking trip.

It gives a number of a screenwriters who have written screenplays you will recognize, and they comment on how they work, what inspires them, how they think up new ideas, how they keep their creativity flowing, etc. It also tells you how discouraging screenwriting can be -- which is good to know up front, in case you may think you don't have the stomach for this endeavor.This would be a fun book to read even if you WEREN'T interested in becoming a screenwriter!

It looks like something from 1984, when shoulderpads were wider than doors and glitz and glitter were in high demand.There is nothing remotely good about this book other than the fun it is to mock every page. If you're having a Dynasty-themed Christmas Day potluck, then this is the book for you, because the decorations would totally go as backdrops of those good old catfights on TV.If you think style is sold on QVC and the Home Shopping Network and the highlight of your life is calling in one of those shows so they put your call on TV, this is the book for you.What a piece of crap!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Whimsy, wacky and it is So Me!","review":"I loved this book.

And get this -- in the Joan Crawford tree, they have swan ornaments which -- everyone will know when they see them -- represent Ms. Crawford's transformation from ugly duckling to swan. Or how about the Lucille Ball tree -- disembodied hands holding brushes sticking out of the branches. I won't even get into the Cher tree, because it scared me. These people need to be visted by the ghosts of Christmas and have their heads straightened out. Please don't judge Los Angeles by these people -- I've lived here all my life and have never seen anything like this.

It's the pinnacle of rock band equality--but also codependency and this album makes love sound like one long drink of gin...partly thanks to Sue Minichiello's Jersey Queen vocals (one of the nicer things to happen to female vocalizing in the name o' rock since Denise James).

This diaper pail is awful. The flaps that are supposed to trap the odor in get pulled apart by the weight of the diapers in the trash bag after only a few diapers are in the thing. Then the smell escapes freely. Our baby hasn't even started solid foods yet, and already the smell is unbearable coming from this pail. I'm throwing this pail away and going to try the Diaper Champ. There is a Diaper Champ in our pediatrician's office and it never smells."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let me know when they fix the springs","review":"We liked the idea of using standard trash bags. However the spring loaded plastic ramps used to seal the bags came loose too often to bother fixing. Also, the latch that keeps the lid close has broke... letting our 18 month old put toys in the diaper pail. It's no longer kept it in her room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"I originally registered for this diaper pail because it only requires regular trash bags and I thought it would be both easier and less costly than the ones which require special bags. However, I found that the round ball that is supposed to block in odors kept falling off. It actually fell off into the bag with the diapers and was thrown out one day before we knew it was missing. After that, the pail was useless as it no longer blocked odors. I also found that the lid always closed on my hands whenever I was changing the bag. Needless to say, I now have a different diaper pail."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Great!!!! and easy!","review":"I love this diaper pail! I could never figure out how to use the diaper genie, and it didn't seem to hold many diapers. So I decided to try this dipaer pail and it was also cheaper. It has been the wise choice. The diapers are odorless once in the pail and it is so easy to use. I also love that you don't have to buy expensive, specific refills. I can just use the trash bags I buy for my kitchen. I will say however that the smell can leak out if the pail gets too full and the odor gaurd is obstructed from shutting all the way. But hey, that is the time to change the bag. The top of the pail does twist to seal the bag before you pull it out of the pail and therefore seals in all the smell. One downfall.. I have now had it for 10 months and would like to get more of the deodorizer discs but I can not find any place that sells them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Working great but it's only been 2 months","review":"We have this product in our bedroom not too far from the bed ( as this is where most of the diapers are changed.)

So now I am interested in finding a replacement odor absorbing chip but have not had any luck. I am still very pleased with this product and would definately recommend it so far - with our first daughter we used another pail ( hint it needed special replacement bags )and it smelled from day one. By the way our second daughter is bottle fed and her soiled diapers could clear a room..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best choice","review":"My husband and I picked out this diaper pail when I was pregnant with my son because friends told us to get one that uses regular garbage bags. That turned out to be the only perk of this diaper pail. The springs have been popping off since about the first month. My son is now 10 months old and recently one of the springs broke, which completely gets rid of the supposed \\"odor-free\\" feature (which I found wasn't exactly true either). Now that we are expecting baby #2 I am going to have to buy another diaper pail to replace this one. My advice: Don't waste your money. It's just as efficient to throw your diapers in a regular trash can."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Good points: holds a lot of diapers, uses regular trash bags, inexpensive.Bad points: Does not contain odors AT ALL!, cheaply made therfore it breaks, the lid does not stay closed, toddlers can open it very easily.I have a son and also work in a day care where we use this pail. Of the 4 that I've come into contact with...they are all broken in some way. The one for my son can not stay closed. We have to put the wipes on the top to keep the lid from popping open. On all 4 pails, the springs broke and the inner contraption had to be removed. This pail does not contain odor at all! I don't really think any of the pails will completely keep odor at bay, but this is the worst! I am going to try the Diaper Champ.

It holds about a weeks worth of diapers and really minimizes the smell. The kitty litter box has more odor than this pail. I decided on this pail rather than the diaper genie since it uses standard trash bags - much easier and cheaper to get a box of those than a refill for the genie. Only issue I have had with this pail is the lid sometimes pops open, but it is easily closed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odor-Less Diaper Pail-Safety First","review":"My husband and I bought this because, as new parents, we wanted to save money on baby equipment. As many of the other reviews have stated, the low price and the fact that you can use regular trash bags in this is a big draw. Please, do not get sucked into getting this pail. In fact, if you really want to save money, don't get a diaper pail at all. Manufacturers of baby products make you think you need diaper pails, just as they make you think you need changing tables and diaper wipe warmers! Use a plain plastic grocery bag, hang it on the door knob to your baby's room, and put diapers in it. When it gets full(or too stinky!), simply take it to the big garbage can outside. This diaper pail made my son's room smell horrible. As soon as I went to go upstairs, I could smell the stink coming from his room. I sprayed the pail with Lysol almost every day and washed it in hot, soapy water weekly, and it still didn't help. Save your money!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who is surprised that diaper pails sometimes smell?","review":"I've had this diaper pail since my 6-year-old was born, and I'm now using it for my 5-month old. You don't have to buy expensive special diaper pail bags that aren't sold at the grocery store and that cost an arm and a leg. It holds a large amount of diapers. It has a spot to hold a deoderizer (yes, you should stick some form of air freshener in this - but you can use almost any one on the market). Of course, baby sometimes creates something that smells - even the Diaper Genie isn't magical enough to handle that. That's when you take the diaper straight out to the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only good for the first year","review":"I've had the same problems with this diaper pail. The springs constantly pop off, the lid opens too easily, and once my daughter started solid foods the smell was unbearable. The whole upstairs smelled like diapers.

Within the first month, one of the springs on the diaper drop broke and, subsequently, became not odorless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustruating!","review":"I bought this thinking it was a wonderful design & idea. It was pretty easy to assemble & use. However, once the diapers fill up the bottom of the bag then the claw-like contraption that is supposed to seal out the odors doesn't close completely & you get the smells. If you continue to use the pail after filling the bottom of it (like I just mentioned) then the diapers start to pull on the bag & that causes the spring that holds the claw-thing in to pop out thus defeating the odor control purpose. Putting the spring back is no easy task. If you manage to do that the claw-thing permanently doesn't close all the way. I went through 2 of these, with the same problems, before I resorted to a regular garbage can. I never did see any refills for the scented disk that goes in the top, either. I have no idea where anyone would buy them. I'd suggest finding something else to use instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odorless - NOT!","review":"Odorless is a joke with this diaper pail. I started with a diaper genie for the past 3 years which I loved but didn't like the expensive refills. Also, after 3 years the container has absorbed the ordors and it's no longer very effective. Bought this because it was cheaper and hoped it would work better. Needless to say, I have called the company and am getting a refund because it did not contain odor for longer than about a week. Maybe mine was defective but it sure didn't contain any odor. The flaps won't stay together, which is how the odor is supposed to be contained and the disk didn't seem to help at all. I don't recommend this product. I'm either going to get a new diaper genie or try the diaper champ which I've heard is great! Good Luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks!

It's gotten good revues."},{"rating":"2","title":"No stink!!","review":"I love this diaper pail! There is no smell even when I open the top.

I had used a diaper genie with my first 2 but had desided to cloth diaper my third, that ment no more diaper genie. (thats ok, it was too much hassle any way, but thats another review)To make this pail work for me, I first pulled out the flaps under the lid, the ones ment to hold in odor, those are useless. Then I got an industrial strength deo disk to keep the odors away. If I am not careful when I empty the pail I end up dumping the disk and the dome cover into the washing machine(fishing them out of that laundry is not pretty). This is not a toddler proof pail by any means! It is better than the trash can, but only by a little.Some good parts are: a place to put a deo disk, the easy pop up lid and a fair amount of room for a few days worth of diapers.Good Luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy!","review":"I originally bought this pail for our church nursery; when I was purchasing one a Mom approached me and said she loved the pail and it had taken her through 4 kids! When I bought a second one for the church at a different store, another mother had to stop and tell me how great it was. She loves it and suggested using the Stick Ups Air Fresheners in place of the deoderizer disks. I decided to get one for myself, and it has made a huge difference! My 2 year old can have some smelly diapers and this pail is just awesome in absorbing the odors and keeping them inside when I add another diaper. It fills up fast, but you need to get diapers out of the house anyway; also my son is very agile and while he can pop the top where you insert diapers, he cannot open the main lid and it has worked great. The Stick Ups work well with it, too. I highly reccomend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Stinks!!!!","review":"I got this diaper pail because it thought it would save me money. I would give it 0 stars, it really stinks. My son was breastfeed, so his poop didn't really smell. But once he began eating solids and later table food his poop began to really smell and this pail did nothing to hid it. Once there is a few diapers in it, the &quot;odor locking barrier doesn't stay closed. We had to change it after 1 or 2 poopy diapers so it didn't save much money. If we didn't we had to shut the door to his room to keep the smell in there! By the time he was a toddler and I had another son on the way I had enough and got a diaper genie. I should have done it much sooner, I love the diaper genie! It may cost more but it is so worth it.

Trust me spend the extra money."},{"rating":"1","title":"If the top stayed shut, maybe it would be oderless","review":"The top does not stay shut on the daiper pail so any and all oders do come out.

To my disappointment it was nothing it was made out to be. While it is very convienent because it uses regular kitchen trash bags, it just doesn't hold in the oder! When you open the top to put a diaper in you get a not so nice wiff of dirty diapers! There is nothing to hold the oder in, there are openings on the side of the flaps that you are supposed to push the diaper through so I'm kinda missing the point. I've also found that I can get smells from it when it's closed if you have a couple stinky diapers in it. I usually end up having to empty it before it's full because of the smell. I definetly DON'T recommend this diaper pail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinky!","review":"This pail stinks up the whole room! Do not buy it. The only thing good about it is that it holds a lot of diapers. The old saying, &quot;You get what you pay for&quot; is definitely true for this one. You would be MUCH better off with the Diaper Champ, which costs about $30. My sister has this one. It seals the smell in really good. You just set the diaper in a hole, grab a handle and move it front or back. The odor does not even have a chance to seep out. You can use garbage bags with it and don't have to pay for the costly refill bags like you do with the Diaper Genie. I'm going to switch over to this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Diaper Champ is much better","review":"The Diaper Genie is as oderless as you are going to get, but who wants to buy all those refills?

Then the twisting mechanism broke making the pail changing process very smelly.

This was our third diaper pail and I am disgusted with it. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was that it does do an ok job of containing the odors - but as for durability, it is not worth the plastic it is made from. I loved the design at first - it has spring hinges that hold the inner barrier closed, that is until they start popping out of their respective locations. Every time I changed the bag (which is usually twice a week) I have to snap the springs and the barriers back into place and now after several months, they are no longer snapping into place. Unfortunately when I replaced our last two pails (one of which was a diaper genie - another waste of time and money), I bought two of these pails - A BIG MISTAKE on my part.

After about a week the springs started constantly falling off of the thing inside that supposedly keeps the bag closed and the oder out so it doesn't do any good. Yes, a plus is the using regular bags, but so does the Diaper Champ and it also keeps oders in much better than this. I'm definitely going back to the Diaper Champ; I only bought this one because it was the only one at my store, now I know it was worth the wait for the Diaper Champ in the mail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly ODORLESS!","review":"My husband and I bought this with the hopes that it would keep the odor inside and we could save the money on refills. Well, it did not control odor. The plastic disk that is included to neutralize the odor works for about a week. The odor escaped even when the pail was closed. You do save money on refills at first. But when the diapers become stinkier as the baby grows, you have to change the bag more often. I used A LOT of baking soda and Lysol spray to help control the stink.Also, the button on the top that opens the pail can fail easily, and it is also very easy for a child to get into once they start pulling up on things.I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"OKAY diaper pail","review":"This is an OKAY diaper pail for the money. It doesn't TOTALLY eliminate the smell and the bags are hard to change. I don't even try any more to 'twist' the bag, I just take the lid off.

Also it claimed to be odor-free. The first pail I got I had to return to the store before I even used it since the \\"latch\\" would not stay locked, or even closed. The next one I got just broke--after four months of use. First, one of the inside springs came off and then half of the inside \\"bag closer\\" flaps has completely fallen off.....meaning the bag is not held closed any longer. The deodorizing disk did not last long either, and the Sassy refills I bought at a baby store did not work at all......Likewise, I too noticed that you can only get use of half the garbage bag as the pail itself is not tall enough....I am trying to track down cost and location for another pail called Diaper Wizard which claims to also accept regular garbage bags....and opens and closes by itself with some kind of motion detector........"},{"rating":"1","title":"IS THERE ANY REFILLS FOR THE DEODERIZER?!?","review":"FROM THE TIME WE BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT IT HAS BEEN A PAIN?

So, I would advise buying a different diaper pail!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"This has got to be one of the worst cases of false advertising I've ever encountered. To call this pail \\"oder-less\\" is a joke. The only way that I have found to keep it from not stinking as much is to put everyone of my daughter's diapers in a scented diaper bag,tie it up, and then put it in the pail. And don't even think about putting a really poopy diaper in it. I've learned to to take those straight to the garbage outside. Aside from all that, the garbage bags are almost impossible to put in and the flip top lid likes to flip open by it's self. More trouble than it's worth when you have a newborn to take care of. Save your money and buy a diaper genie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good diaper pail...you get what you pay for","review":"At first, I bought this diaper pail thinking it was an innovative contraption with the ease of using regular trash bags and the easy pop-open top and all you have to do is twist the top and the bag closes up to hide the stink of the nasty diapers inside. Well, we lost springs and the plastic part inside the pail came apart very soon after we bought it. Too bad it was too late to take it back. It really doesn't hide the smells that emminate from it. This is a [poorly made] diaper pail and I do not recommend it at all.I ended up getting a \\"Diaper Champ\\" pail at my 2nd baby's shower and I like it a lot more. There's nothing that falls apart at all, and you can use regular trash bags for it too. You can smell it after about a week, and by then it's time to change the bag anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"We received this diaper pail as a shower gift and have been using it for 5 months now. I had originally considered exchanging it for a diaper genie, but decided to give it a try since I could use my own garbage bags instead of having the expense of those refills. I really wish I had made the exchange. For the first couple of months it worked great. However, it has really begun to smell even when it barely has any diapers in it. My daughter's whole room smells and our entire upstairs is beginning to smell. Yuck! It also began to fall apart after the first couple of months. The springs on the inside continue to pop out and the flaps that close the diapers off keep falling out. I would not suggest buying this diaper pail."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Stinky Pail!","review":"I sent my husband to the store to get the Diaper Genie, he came home with this. The first time my husband went to use it the button to open it didn't work and he had to push so hard to open it that the area around the button cracked, but hey, at least now the button works. The odor barrier doesn't close all the way, even with one diaper in it, so you can smell the diapers. And I have also found that smaller diapers do not go all the way to the bottom, so I have to actually stick my arm through the odor barrier (yuck) to push it down to the bottom. Also, I have found that this pail holds far less newborn diapers than a Diaper Genie does. My advice, pay the extra for the refills and get the Diaper Genie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purchase an inexpensive pail such as Safety 1st","review":"Initially my husband and I decided not to purchase a diaper pail because we wondered what was the point, diapers stink and no matter how much money one spends on a diaper pail it's going to emit odors and smell bad. Then, when we were changing diapers ten times a day we decided it would probably be easier to have one, especially for the middle of the night diaper changes. Several of my friends disapproved of the Diaper Genie and recommended we purchase an inexpensive diaper pail that uses regular garbage bags. We took that advice and selected the Safety 1st diaper pail and we are pleased with the product. Odor-Less - No. We empty it as needed, usually once a week, and realize it's a diaper pail - just as our garbage pail in the Kitchen needs to be emptied daily someday so will the diaper pail. I place an aroma jell in the little basket which helps with the odor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odor-FULL Diaper Pail","review":"This diaper pail definitely does not live up to its' name! This pail will smell with even one dirty diaper in it. We have been throwing our soiled diapers in our regular trash instead... it smells less there. The deodorant tablet is held in place by a cup that kept falling into the pail until we finally just took it out completely. Our 1 year old son has no problem opening the \\"child resistant\\" closure. The lid doesn't always stay closed... it often pops open a few seconds after you close the lid. All in all... we are definitely getting a new pail before our second child is born and we have even more diapers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinky","review":"We bought this pail for wet diapers while we used our diaper genie for messy diapers (we were trying to cut down on buying diaper genie refills).

It is great that you can use standard garbage bags, but you can only get 10 or so diapers in it. The \\"odor-less\\" part of it is a joke.

That is the only good thing this pail has going for it. My son is 8 months old, and the springs keep popping off of it. This diaper pail does not keep the smell out, either. The opening that the diapers go into will no longer close, so each time you lift the lid you get a whiff of what is inside. You are supposed to be able to \\"twist and seal\\" the trash bags when changing, which doesn't work. Each time you change the bag, you have to pull it out, and when you replace it you have to thread the bag through the top. This diaper pail is smaller than \\"standard trash can liners\\", which means when the pail gets full, you pull out the trash can liner only to find it is only half full of diapers. I'm ready to throw this diaper pail into the garbage, which is where I've been putting most of the dirty diapers directly, anyhow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par!","review":"Pro: Inexpensive and can use regular household 13 gallon garbage bags. Can add any odor disk in an available cup provided.Con: Does not mask odors. I have 8 month old triplets and it doesn't help at all. Even with one baby, to change the bag daily is a waste of a big bag unless one baby goes through tons of diapers a day. With my triplets they still don't fill the bin in a day, about every other day. I have the original Diaper Genie with my 10 year old but thought against using it since we'd have to buy the refill bags so much more often with triplets. The old Genie doesn't hold as much but it sure holds the smell better. If I had it to do over again, I would not buy this pail, which I bought two, one for upstairs and one for down.

Looking inside the pail, it doesn't even look like it is capabe of containing odors. The plastic piece which is intended to separate the diapers from the top doesn't even cover the entire opening. After 2 weeks, this one already smells worse than our old one did.

But this is the review of the eureka and my experience is that for cold climate is not suited I slept in one this winter and it was -22 celsius, it was like sleeping outside, with all the mesh, no heat was trapped inside and we had ice forming on the inside of the outer layer.All in all not a tent i would recommend if you are going to use it in extreme conditions (aka I won't bet my life on it for sure).for all other uses it might be fine but the weight is just a lot, on the other hand the price is interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rough shipping and thin plastic","review":"UPS left this table at my front door with both ends of the box open and contents coming out. I'm an environmentalist at heart so the idea of swapping this out for a new one didn't appeal to me. The legs and top had minor scratches, but not enough to justify the bother and waste of a product return. Assembly is easy with a screw driver only - takes about a half hour. What I didn't like is that the plastic on the frame is so thin in spots that most of the mounting screws don't tighten down. In other words, they strip. The screws are not critical for structural support but over time the seats could loosen up. With a molded product like this, it would be easy to simply mold in thicker plastic where the screws go. Disappointing. Otherwise, table is level and attractive as advertised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny","review":"The table lives up to its description and to the many excellent reviews of the product that I read before purchase. I have no idea if it was easy to assemble because I had a \\"handyman\\" do it along with many other jobs I needed done. I know that it didn't take him long at all and when he was finished he commented on how well it is constructed. The description says 6-person, but I can easily see 8 people sitting at it if necessary. I'm very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great table","review":"The picnic table is great.

Aside from that it is a great table."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good table.","review":"Table is of good quality and seems to be just what I was looking for.Delivery was made in a timely fashion, but the carton was in rough shape.Upon opening the carton for assembly I noticed there were a couple of dents on the top of the table. Said dents are cosmetic & I don't feel they will weaken the table over time, but are something I will have to look at nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just What I Needed","review":"This portable/foldable picnic table is the best for your money. It was easy to assemble, sturdy, and rust and warp free. It's light enough to move around easily, while being a full-size table. I got this after a bad experience with a wooden picnic table that was not pressure-treated wood, as it turned out, and it warped and grew fungus outside in the weather. I only wish this table had come in different colors.

It's has a lifetime guarantee for TWO YEARS! What a joke. All the directions are in pictures - no words, and pretty vague. It's pretty flimsy. Also, had some dents and scratches on it from shipping. Pretty much a rip off for $236.00. Made in China, of course!! May be worth about $75 tops.

The table needed a powerwash but other than that seemed solid .. I couldn't tell if it had been there for 3 or 10 years and the thing looked indestrucible. It was obvious that a powerwash would clean it up nicely. The only problem was.. I couldn't help but feel like I was sitting at a plastic table. For me it just didn't work. There are lots of simulated and/or lifetime wood products that ARE plastic but they don't feel like it and give the impression of sitting on wood. Even if it might last forever and were easy to hose off,I didn't want this big plastic thing in my yard.

I own all of her guidebooks and would recommend them to anyone. One of my favorite pieces of information that she includes is how long a hike will take which makes it nice since I can plan better. This book surprised me with some of the hikes found within. I grew up in Salmon and spent my summers hiking the mountains nearby yet Margaret had some hikes into areas I hadn't explored before which comes to show you that it takes a lifetime or more to discover all of Idaho's secrets. Pick up the book and find some great places that not many know about.

By her own admission Carolyn Lake says the diaries - on which this book is based - for the period up to 1890 were burned. No diaries for this period leaves me questioning the entire Arizona period. For support of this let me quote from Philip L. Fradkin's \\"Stagecoach: Wells Fargo and the American West.\\" On page 104, Fradkin says, \\"Even Fred Dodge, like Wyatt Earp a professional gambler, gets far more attention than (Bob) Paul. Dodge later became a Wells Fargo special officer but claimed at the time of the robberies and killings that he was working undercover in Tombstone for Wells Fargo.

Certainly Nichols is no Shackleton. Rather, Sea Change is a shuffling of Nichols personal difficulties and colorful yet sad reflections on his failed marrage, and some recounts of his sea voyages of mixed interest. There is indeed some interesting information in regard to solo sailing across the oceans and the management of collision avoidance. Yet beyond this the read is dismaying instead of heartening in terms of human survival and energy of the sole. I'd skip this book and move on to truly dramatic accounts.

He provides every account of his musings on his failed marriage and on other more interesting journeys across the Atlantic. His insights on his marriage, the journey and life seem commonplace, rather than enlightening.His writing isn't that great and in places made me groan.

But for lovers of Murray Perahia who cares."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought it for the concertos -- ended up liking the solo pieces even more","review":"I am a big Mendelssohn fan and Perahia and Marriner do a great job on their rendition of these concertos.

The bottoms seemed great, but later the balls of my feet hurt, too. Also, the soles were much thicker than I'd anticipated. But the real issue is the lack of \\"butter softness\\": a total misnomer. There's no way I can begin to break them in: my feet will bleed and I'd be in too much pain. I was afraid the part between the toes would hurt; that's fine. It's the rest of the shoe.

Sabato rails humourlessly against modern mass media, showing no conception that tools like the Internet can be put to positive use. We're ponderously told that our present crisis is due to \`exploitation of man', as if that's insightful, or specific to our age. He yearns for times past when, supposedly, people \`worked at a more human level' and \`were freer than the man of today'. In our own hopeless age it's supposedly impossible to transmit values to new generations. Even smallpox eradication is decried as making room for cancer. Reminiscent of William Morris, Sabato looks forward to returning to the Middle Ages (\`una nueva Edad Media'), which he thinks would be curative (\`sanante').

The joy of life according to Sabato can be found on simple things but sometimes we have so busy life we are not concern about it. Culture, technology, values, life, mass media, education, government, exploitation and economic issues are discussed in this excellent book. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different Sabato, not better, not worse","review":"After reading \\"The Tunnel\\", the last thing I expected from Sabato was an optimistic and mystical reflection like the one in \\"La Resistencia\\".

My son has a Logitech MX Duo wireless set on his Mac, so I tried this set using his receiver and it worked, but with a great deal of lag. Besides that the mouse and keyboard both felt rather flimsy. I now have a Logitech G5 gaming mouse with the USB Overdrive mouse driver and I love it! It is so much smoother than any other mouse I have tried except an MX518, and it really makes a difference.

As it turned out my boyfriend's brother has a different model of the logitech wireless keyboard and mouse duo and when I plugged his receiver into my computer my keyboard and mouse began to work again. I wrote to logitech asking if I could buy a replacement receiver but have had no reply. I just wanted to warn everyone of the perils of wireless hardware.

The layout is awkward to make room for the media keys on either side. The printing on the keys themselves looks pretty bad-too bold and too small. Some keys wobble more than they should as well. A bit loud when typing fast, but acceptable. The driver software provided by Logitech is inexcusably bad. Crashes too often to make use of the configuration utility. If you actually have the patience to finally customize your mouse buttons and keyboard media keys the software confuses, ignores or forgets many of your selections. Forget about having unique actions tasked to each button for different applications either. Logitech's software can't remember what key was assigned to what application. Tech support had no one to help a Mac user at the time I called. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"fix the @#$@ing driver!","review":"Bought this because of the logitech rep and aesthetic appeal for matching my new macbook.It worked flawlessly on startup - but after shutting down the computer and restarting, it is no longer recognized through the control manager.

Now I am losing connectivity every so often (once already during this review - and yes the batteries are 3-day fresh). There is quite a bit of input lag as well - something I could deal with if it wasn't plagued with so many other problems already.I'm going to try to revert back to the older versions of the LCC and see if that fixes anything, but if not this is going back.If you can get it to work well - its a nice feeling/looking set, but these control/driver problems are too much to deal with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Logitech Cordless keyboard S 530 - IS NOT FOR MAC-INTEL","review":"I ordered a combo set of this keybd with wireless mouse and had to cancel the order hours later after reading a review of incompatibility with Intel based iMac.I immediately called the vendor and their tech support confirmed that.Apparently, when used with Mac-Intel machine, some of the special keys will not work at-all even with a software update.

The book explores the relationship between two families over a period of time, and while yes, there is the regional part also to it, it is rather secondary. Spring explores more the emotional ties between the two families - how their lives gt completely intertwined. The romance is captured bautifully- and it is with a pang that you close the book. It is a tragedy - and a very sad one. But then, most beautiful are those prose which are sad in nature. Pretty apt here. This is a bautiful, lyrical romance of a England gone by."},{"rating":"2","title":"The right book for a silent evening with a glass of whiskey.","review":"I've read the book now for several times, but everytime again I'm getting the feeling of a deep sadness about the irish history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fortune","review":"I had missed this one in my collection, so I had to buy it and fill in the blanks. As always, Ms. Myers kept me chuckling the whole way through. Once I got started, I literally couldn't put it down. I was glad to find out the details about what happened to Aaron (the rat!). I love her characters (especially Freni) and the humor is terrific. I'm ready for another one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fortune cookie say, \\"Have hernia in head to buy book\\"","review":"I love a good \\"who done it\\", and its even better if it adds a little humor. But come on! This story had more loose ends then a ball of yarn that my cat Socks just finished with. Tamar introduces a character and then they disappear. She starts a story line and then stops it. She uses more worn out phrases then 14 grandmothers at a AARP meeting. I did get a laugh here and there, but most of the story was spent trying to understand the lastest branch of her tree. a couple of the sub-characters are ok, the police chief never develops, her sister never develops and the deal with her husband already being married just lays there. Summing it up. A good idea for story line, too many weak characters, and too many side trips. I do have to say that a book is like a work of art, some people love it, some hate it and a few like myself would rather have had eggroll."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magdalena jumps to conclusions and solves the murders again","review":"This time around Magdalena is assisting the police at their request after she happens upon a dead body in downtown Hernia. She is distracted from her sleuthing efforts by her father-in-law's sighting of a flying saucer, her guests' outrageous offspring, her sister's depression caused by lack of male companionship, and her own mixed thoughts about her marriage and perhaps too much male attention from her very own Pooky Bear. Teenage Amish wild oat sowing, a flash flood, a doctor selling back braces, and Magdalena's new red BMW all help stir the plot, but the solution is Magdalena's own. Now if she can just get Freni to unquit her job as cook again and stir up some more broken-heart healing gingerbread!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Between a Wok and a Hard Place","review":"Tamar Myers has too many sidelines in this book. Too much about too many other characters and not enough attention paid to the real mystery in question. I found this book an entanglement of Magdelena's relationships (good and bad ones) and the history connected with each one. This book was a downer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magdalena Deputized!","review":"As in the other books in this series, this book is really thin in the plot area, and in this one the motive for the killing is not plausible, but it's still a funny story in it's own way. Readers must be die-hard cozy fans to enjoy this series, and they must be willing to give the author a lot of latitude since Ms. Myers really needs an editor for her books. This book is about what appears to be a hit-and-run murder, and at first glance it looks like it might be local Amish boys that did it. That is why Melvin Stoltzfus deputises Magdalena to help him solve the mystery. I'm really not sure about this series. Each book seems more disjointed than the last one, and they make less and less sense. But I do finish the books, even though it seems like an almost guilty pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"The groove never stops","review":"This is my third MMW CD, and I cant really pick a favorite, but I like this one a lot. The funky B3 always sounds so great and soulful. The cool grooves really set a mood the puts me in my own soulful mood. There are quite a bit of styles here, I hear some hiphop along with the funk stuff. The best tracks are \\"Is There Anybody Here That Love My Jesus\\" and \\"Bubblehouse\\". \\"Friday Afternoon in the Universe is also a good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong organ trio. Great grooves, interesting stuff","review":"Compare this to Niacin (Novello, Sheehan, Chambers) to see what an organ trio should be.

The grooves are dull and repetitive, and the tracks never, ever go anywhere. I just don't see how any MMW fan who has enjoyed Tonic, Friday Afternoon, Notes, Dropper, really anything but the remix + greatest hits albums, can tolerate this stale crap. Essential for the unimaginative listener, or those who think MMW is a hippie groove band rather than a creative jazz trio."},{"rating":"1","title":"good cd, rude band","review":"I like this ccd alot. It is too bad to hear about how good these guys are live: I won tickets to see them in LA and they cancelled 20 minutes before the show because they \\"didnt feel like playing there.\\" We had driven an hour each way to get to the club.

One thing I can promise you is that you don't recognize half the stuff on here by the titles or artist names. However you might recognize these tunes after listening. Many of these songs have been used in samples for classic hip-hop songs, others have not.I had never herd of any of these songs before purchasing and i highly reccomend it. It's great that these songs have been unearthed by Darge and Pete Rock for us. Of the two halfs i actually perfer Pete Rock's picks.

It definately is a GREAT compilation of (then rare, dunno bout now and bootleggin, 45's put together by those who have the few original gems).

There's a lot of crucial jams that never made it south nor west. This is a decent compilation, but it could be better. I keep looking for the ultimate rare isolated grooves, that have been neglected for so long.We used to have talent shows when I was a little kid. My cousin Derrick was the falsetto and I (the only girl in the group) hit all the notes to compliment him. The older boys took care of the rest.

Nevertheless, I can tell you why you shouldn't bother: It is most dull in its literalness and occasional spikes of melodrama."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy of your time and money","review":"This work sheds very little light on the real work of managing project portfolios. Way too much of the text describes basic PM tools such as gantt charts, network diagrams, and work breakdown structures that any decent project manager already knows. Further, use of such tools by themselves does not make a portfolio manager...managing of with organizational strategies/goals and proper management of sponsor and major stakeholder expectations are equally, if not more, important at this level - and this book completely misses this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their World Is Inviting!","review":"Add water, stir, and let it flow...these guys are amazing together. Some incredibly high moments occur in \\"We're So Happy\\"- beginning w/ the funky drummer embellishment and chaotic interplay of the upright/keys and on into the churning in/out of the main funky drummer groove, turning your world upside down, then rightside up ( a strange journey indeed). Check out the sexy-low-down groove on \\"Sequel\\"- the bass line is sooo nasty it's good for you...completely reminds me of the Darkk Bros. vibe (similar group out of Chicago). This was the CD that turned me onto these three groovesters. And if you enjoy this then do yourself a favor and check them out live! Guaranteed to shake out the dust! This CD contains a nice balance of textures and rhythms... a must have for any worthwhile Cd collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands down the best MMW!","review":"I have all the MMW albums through the latest - End of the World Party - and Friday Afternoon in the Universe is, in my opinion, their definitive album. It has all the elements that make MMW special - sensuous, funky grooves flowing in and out of free-form improv sections, a sense of freedom within structure and perfectly demonstrates the band's passion for their music. Three consumate musicians playing with supreme intuition and a overriding feeling of joy and discovery. I'm a drummer, and I can honestly say that Billy Martin never sounded so creative, so alive, so inspired. And even though I'm not a keyboard player, I have to say that this is probably John Medeski's most varied, most transcendant, most adventurous playing on record. If you are buying your first MMW album, this should be it. If you are already a MMW fan and are considering picking adding this to your collection, do it IMMEDIATELY! You won't be disappointed. This is pure MMW at the height of their game."},{"rating":"1","title":"say huh???","review":"Just for starters, I am an avid MMW fan, and I need everyone thinking about getting an MMW album to think about this......DONT start with this one.....I have a real hard time understanding the other reviewers because to me, this is the least comprehensive album of their genius ever put out by them(I have every MMW release). Im not saying its bad, but if you want the best start with Uninvisible, Combustication, or End of the world party (if you dig grand piano, go with Tonic)....the other reviews are totally mad. Claiming that this is the most inspired and round about album they ever made is like saying the Beatles made better albums before Revolver.....take it from someone who has seen MMW five times in three years and skip this one for next to last (last being Shackman) However, I am not so corny to think Im always right, and in dealing with jazz albums, it is totally subjective as to what is the best...."},{"rating":"2","title":"christophe says real music in here!!!!","review":"MMW are artists with a cause.

I called the telephone number in the manual and reached WMH Tool Group. The circuit breaker that protects the drum motor is bad on my tool. I was told by WMH Tool Group that the circuit breaker was not available by itself and that I would have to buy a new motor at a cost of approximately 1/3 the purchase price of the tool. I have tried to find the circuit breaker on-line from the manufacturer in Taiwan but I have not been successful. It is much easier to replace the circuit breaker than the whole motor and a fraction of the cost. I think it is inexcusable that the circuit breaker is not available and I would never buy another JET Tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX!","review":"IT WAS A TOSS UP BETWEEN THIS MODEL, AND THE DELTA.

Murray Perahia has that rare ability to coax out of each note breathtaking tone, and for these two concertos by Chopin especially, the result is perfect. Perahia plays the Romanze movement of the E Minor concerto with breadth, his pacing of the haunting melody natural.

Solid (real wood parts!), well-designed, decent instructions, etc. I'm pretty handy so this was not too difficult to assemble except for positioning of the front end pieces with pulling the two sides together via the long retaining bolts (took a little tricky hand / tool work). Manufacturer supplied parts and tool were great--extra 2 wheel axle caps a very good idea because I broke one during assembly and they thoughtfully supplied a spare.The best part, though, was the look on my grandson's face at his birthday party (his 1st) when we pulled out the assembled car--priceless! It was so intuitive he immediately turned the steering, pushed the horn button, etc. In no time he was pushing the car around by the back handle, too.This car was such a hit that at one point adults were separating 3 cousins (all under two y.o.!) from trying to get into the car and play with it all at one time.

My son is tall for his age but at 13 months cannot quite reach the floor sat in the toy, so he still needs to be pushed around, which he loves.

He stretches the guitars timbral palette by using a myriad of effects processors including phrase samplers and his trademark volume pedal.

My son is tall for his age, but has trouble sitting all the way back on the potty. He ends up sitting on the edge and tipping the whole thing forward. The pee guard is absolutely worthless...falling off into the potty resulting in leaks and, the extra height makes it nearly impossible for my son to clear the top. Also, when I seat him properly, his feet don't touch the floor. My son is 33 1/2 inches tall, so perhaps this potty is intended for taller/older children!

She never felt comfortable on this potty - the two pieces don't secure together and most times she sat down, the whole thing came apart. But, she loves the step-stool part and the potty seat on the regular toilet. The handles are nice, she climbs up to the toilet by herself and steadies herself holding the handles. This design is very sub-par when used as a stand-alone potty. I like that it has a lid to close so we can keep it on the toilet in her bathroom and keep the lid down."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I bought this potty chair trusting the Safety First name. What a disappointment! My daughter is 20 months old and 23 pounds. She is interested in sitting on the potty but she is intimidated with the design of this chair.

First, the product was not stable; it did not adhere correctly to the floor, and would move left or right every time she was trying to get on it. Secondly, I had to remove the lid, which kept on closing onto her back.

The first potty we tried -- another brand -- was incredibly unstable. This potty is very stable and easy for the child to use. We have had no trouble in all the months we've used it with tipping or with the latches -- I think people who are complaining aren't putting it together right (though it's simple to do). It's also very easy to take the pot out. The best part is that when your child is ready to use the toilet, you just put the top of the potty on the toilet (the handles make the child feel secure) and use the bottom of the base as a step stool. The step stool is very wide, allowing the child ample room to step up and actually turn around to position herself over the toilet. All in all, this is a simple, inexpensive, well made product that follows your child every step of the way through potty training. Good baby products like this are hard to find -- I highly recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this potty!","review":"This potty is no good! My 20 month old boy has had more trouble with this potty! The pee guard is useless, the hole is too small, if he lifts up the potty by the handles to carry it the top comes off of the base, the lid falls and hits him on the back as he is trying to sit down, etc. Do not waste your money with this potty! I recommend the Graco soft seat potty and step stool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing :o(","review":"We purchased this potty because it had all the bells and whistles others have noted. However, it is nearly useless for the main reason I got it; to use as a potty trainer. The seat whole is round and simply too small. We have to be very careful to position by daughter on the whole depending on what we are expecting her to do. If she is too far forward, urine spills over the seat and onto her clothes and the floor. It is very disappointing to a toddler to have made it to the potty and done everything right, but have to change into dry clothes anyway. My friend bought a Graco Soft Seat Potty and Step Stool, and it is so much better. This Safety 1st model is worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best on the market","review":"We purchased this potty as well as another model, using this one in the 1st floor powder room. I liked the idea of step stool plus potty, and now am sorry for the purchase.My daughter is tiny for her age [barely makes the 3% level for 3.5 year olds] so the size isn't a problem. The problems we have had is that the angle of the hole in the potty [or lack thereof] causes the stream to aim out of the bowl, down the front of the potty and all over her clothes and the floor! Not the best design! As for cleaning, yes the 'pot' does come out easily, but with a beginner-potty user, I find that it isn't a sealed pot, and leakage occurs into all sorts of crevices that probably weren't expected. This seems to be a case where design doesn't meet real-life use! We much prefer the other potty we bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"At first I thought this was a great product. Until after a few months of opening and closing (to dump contents) one of the hinges broke. No big deal unless you are moving it, then you have to make sure it's closed all the way and is snapped in the front. But when the guard broke I was very upset. Having a son, this is a crucial part of the potty. I tried emailing Saftey 1st many times. They wanted product numbers, well with the box disgarded months ago and no numbers anywhere on the product I was lost. I would not recommend this product for little boys. After 2 weeks of messy potty breaks still waiting to get a replacement guard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too sturdy","review":"I took my daughter out shopping for potties and decided on this one because it looked like a toilet, had arm rests and seemed sturdy. When I brought it home I was not impressed. I could not get the top portion of the potty to sit correctly on the bottom without a lot of manipulation. Many times the potty simply collapsed to one side or another. My daughter tried to pick it up and the whole potty just came apart. I will be returning this potty for one with less functions and more stability. I think this potty sacrifices good potty functionality for the ability to be later used as a step stool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Affordable....not practical","review":"Our two year old began showing the \\"signs\\" about a month ago. He seemed excited at first but when I sat him on it he was uncomfortable and the basin is just too small to cover the front and the back. He tried but has since lost interest. I can't say that this won't work for another parent but I wish that I would have thought of the time involved for the first several attemps and bought one with a padded seat and more room to go in. He is 32\\" inches tall and 32 pounds. I don't know what they were thinking when they designed this but I wasn't thinking when I bought it either."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Pain!!!","review":"I bought this potty last night, all excited to have my 20 month old daughter begin using it. I ORIGINALLY liked the idea of having to lift the toilet seat lid to remove the \\"cup\\". I thought that would make it difficult for my daughter to empty it herself. Well, it take two hands to lift the seat because you have to hold the base still, the seat comes unhinged from the top, and the \\"drawer\\" that holds the \\"cup\\" does not slide well. I am just glad we have not begun using this because I am going to take it back and get a different potty seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good potty for boys!","review":"I bought this for my then 13 month old son. From the first day I brought it home until now my son doesn't look at it like a potty but a toy. He flips down the lid and stands on it. He pulls the splashguard off very easily and walks around the house with it. It tips easily and is just poorly made. I would definitely recommend the baby bjorn potty instead. Its very sturdy, comes in great colors, and only has 2 parts to it. It also has a splashguard that isn't removable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not designed well","review":"We tried....and my daughter who is really taking to potty training keeps getting hit in the back with the seat lid while going.

No matter what you do, the pee splashes underneath and it is just gross. We threw it out after the first month. And it is not a great step stool either. I like the baby Bjorn little potty a whole lot more for a potty chair and a first years single step works better for a step stool. Even better than the little potty is one of the seats that just fits over the opening of the toilet. Then there is no clean up at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for my short lil girl","review":"This potty was the one I wanted to use. It is an all in one. She is short and fits her well.

Maybe it has something to do with the comfort of the seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chair a pain for training boys & very cheaply built","review":"I'm not satisfied with the construction of this potty chair at all! The little shield that attaches so boys don't pee all over is a joke. It comes off way too easy and ends up landing in the bowl of your child's waste. My 2 yr old is always pulling the sheild off, and it isn't pleasant at all to have to fish it out of a bowl of poop. The chair also comes apart way too easy-making learning to use the potty undesirable. This potty chair has gone in the trash and I purchased the Royal Throne instead, which I would give 5 stars to. Since originally writing this, I have edited it, and I wouldn't give The Potty Step N Stool any stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible potty.","review":"This potty is poorly designed for toddlers.

It was the first of three pottys that I have bought. This does fall apart very easily - frusterating to a child who is trying to learn something new. The deflector shielf falls off if you look at it and the seat doesn't fit on the base very well. I tried to use it on the \\"big\\" potty but it seems to be made for toilets with a round hole, not oblong.

I'm hoping to get a quarter for it at my next yardsale."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR BOYS!!!!!","review":"I bought this thinking how ideal that it converts from a potty to step stool and you can even remove the top and put it on the big potty. My opinion now is that I would never buy or suggest it ever again! I have a little boy and EVERYTIME he sits down to go potty, he takes out the little piece that guards him from going potty on the ground (the piece between his legs). It ends up in the potty or the toilet, whichever he's on and poop gets on it and then he goes potty on the floor because there's nothing to keep him pointing in the potty. I have to invest in another potty now and I really think I'm just going to toss this one. I wouldn't even give it to another person!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty Design","review":"I bought my son this Saftey First Potty 3 in 1 because it was inexpensive and had handles to hold on to. When he sat on it, it tipped over because the base is much smaller at the bottom. The seat kept coming off due to weak support straps in the rear. I wasted no time returning to the store the next morning and purchasing the Baby Bjorn for it's simple design and because my son could sit in it inside the store for me to see first. He has very successful since. However, I do not feel a molded, plastic seat with a removable, plastic bowl need be priced [so high], but I found no other simplistic designs in the store. I felt it to be the only choice I had other than traumatizing my 16 month old with another faulty design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money, you can have ours!","review":"This has to be the MOST frustrating potty ever!! Seems to be a common thought with us moms of boys! Not only does the lid fall on him and the whole thing shifts unsteadily, but the deflector pops right off and, like the other reviewers said, ends up in the potty or on your floor, in the tub, etc. Potty training is difficult enough without having to deal with a frustrating potty! If you REALLY want this potty, feel free to come and get ours!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have a boy DO NOT buy this potty!","review":"I strongly suggest, especially if you have a boy, that you buy a different potty. The worst feature for this and any other potty is the removable guard. This one can be easily pulled off and either ends up in the potty or in your toilet. My son has done this so many times that he eventually broke one of the prongs off that holds the guard on. I have finally caulked the guard to the seat so that it does not come off and urine does not get behind the guard which is another bad feature. If you have a boy I suggest that you get a potty with a permanent guard and avoid the hassle. I am waiting for our baby bjorn potties that have the permanent guards. I will be happy to throw this one in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd pass on this","review":"Okay, my daughter loves this potty and is 99% potty-learned, but I can't wait to get rid of it. The inner compartment has several crevices that make it difficult to clean up spills (which occur every time she closes the lid to use it as a step-stool). I have to spend way too much time cleaning this. We have another one that I purchased at a discount store for less than half this price and it's a lot easier to clean, although my daughter does prefer using the safety first potty because it looks more like a real potty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"Connection between seat and base is an issue. It doesn't always join evenly (unless you play with it) and has scratched my son's thighs when not perfectly closed. Before this incident I noted that the guard is easily removed (a toddler past time), tips into the toilet, and too high to leave connected between trips if you want to encourage independence. The inner pot is easily removed by a toddler. The design does prevent floor spills but can result in collection of urin within the unit. It does seem to work okay as a step stool its only current function."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ironically not safe","review":"I'm trying to potty train my 25 month old and as he was stepping down from the stool he turned around and the entire stool shifted from underneath him and he busted his lip on the tub.

I like how it will fit over the big potty later and I've already tried that just to see and it fit perfectly.I recommend this one.

The truth is, ours is just a piece of [cruddy] plastic. The top portion does not fit well on the bottom, they dont even match up well, so they're constantly coming apart. Others seem to not always have this problem. I can sort of wedge them together but my son likes to carry around the potty by the handles and it all comes apart. The two hinges in back definitely do not hold it all together. The splash guard, like others said, pops right off and my sons tends to want to remove it (who wrote that they just said \\"no\\" once to their son? if that solved your problem you do not have a normal two-year old!!).

Our first potty, a shower gift, was the Fisher Price Royal Potty and although we loved it, it was too small for my 21 month old boy who is a little stocky. His legs are thicker and he good size. So we kept it for my girl. Then we bought this potty just for him because it is bigger. It does have ample room for stockier kids. But the spash guard design is awful. All he as to do is brush against it when he sits down and it falls off. If you have a girl this would be a great potty with the handles and fold down lid. But if you have a boy...go another route. We are still looking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"big mistake!!","review":"We bought this potty as our 1st try. First of all it is extremely difficult to empty, you have to completely take it apart to empty the pot. Not to mention pee gets into every nook and cranny.....the whole inside is hollow and full of these squares that you can't possibly clean in less you soak it in hot soapy water. Just a pain!! The opening is smaller than most and completly flat. Very difficult to use. We bought the graco soft seat potty. What a HUGE difference!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Sturdy and Poorly Built","review":"My twin girls had this thing busted apart the first day I brought it home. The hinges were the first things to break off and because the lid never fit on right, they would fall off when they tried to use it as a step stool. They were getting hurt on it and wouldn't use it as a potty so we threw it out. I bought another one for $10 and it works great and is very sturdy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for bigger potty trainers","review":"I bought this and immediately returned it. The hole in the \\"seat\\" is way too small for any sort of potty to go through, especially for larger toddlers. My 21 month old daughter is big for her age at 36 pounds, 35 inches tall, so this potty chair did not look comfortable for her and actually tipped forward when she sat on it. Also it seemed odd to just have a tiny hole in the flat seat top without the traditional rounded or padded seat that toilets have.I bought the Graco Rewards instead and it seems to be the right size with no problems so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Multiple Issues","review":"The hole on this potty chair is ridiculously small. There's no way that my son can poop and pee in the same seated position. He has to move a bit back to pee in the potty then forward to get the poop in it. What a hassle while he's learning potty skills!And the pee guard is worthless. It falls off ALL the time with just barely a tap but it is SO tall that it gets in his way when he's trying to sit down so gluing the darn thing into place isn't an option either. This chair was a serious disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable","review":"We bought this seat thinking the side rails, ability to plant feet on the floor, and flexibility to use the seat topper on the \\"big potty\\" were good features. While it works fine for the standing position, my son (2+yrs) complained almost right away that sitting on it hurt his bottom. He also gets frustrated that the lid won't stay open and taps him on the back when he goes to sit. He resists this seat, but has successfully tried others at relatives and daycare. We are going shopping for a different seat so we can resume potty training at home. NOTE: The Baby Bjorn soft topper met with my son's approval and seems to be the frontrunner. Though it is more expensive, we would have saved money, and possibly expedited potty training, by buying it in the firstplace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nightmare to Clean","review":"My daughter likes this potty and it has worked fine for us, except for the fact that it is a nightmare to clean. There are a bunch of nooks and crannies inside the potty and when something gets in there it is almost impossible to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good if you have a very small child","review":"We purchased this because it looked sturdy and had a lid so it would be good for travel.It is only good if you have a small toddler or are training at a very young age, The hole is really small so if you only want to train them to pee in the thing then you are ok otherwise you will have a mess to clean!We returned it the same day we bought it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design makes this a frustrating chair","review":"This chair is poorly designed, and I don't recommend it.The top and bottom do not fit securely, which means the slightest wiggle from my child means the top half will go askew. The lid doesn't lean back far enough, so again, the slightest wiggle from my child means the lid falls forward, hitting her in the back (which distracts her and makes her wiggle more to turn around and see what just hit her). Pull out the \\"drawer\\" in the base to remove the potty bowl, and the whole potty chair separates into its various components. The chair is hard to clean (full of nooks and crannies--how sanitary could that ever be?) and the whole thing needs to be disassembled to empty the bowl. I ended up buying a Baby Bjorn (two pieces, easy clean, and never falls apart! aaaaaaah) for regular potty sessions to save my sanity, and now use the top half of the Potty-n-Step stool on the adult toilet (the Baby Bjorn potty can't be used on the adult toilet due to its sleek design)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great choice","review":"This potty seat is designed to meet several needs, which sounds great. But it doesn't do any of them very well. As a stand-alone potty seat the hinges are not at all stable. We barely used ours and it was falling apart. The step stool can only be used when you're done with the potty and it's so short so it doesn't do much, plus it slides around on our tile floor. The seat didn't fit all that well on our toilet, so my daughter feels unsteady. Three strikes! This one sounds good on paper but I ended up tossing it and buying all three items separately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best for a Boy","review":"I bought this for my almost 3 year old son and it just didn't work. I took it back to Walmart for a refund. The pot and hole is too small for a big boy and the deflector shield didn't want to stay on very well. NOT GOOD!! Could have been a disaster but I always caught it before it was. It IS a sturdy seat and doesn't move around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has been great for two kids-and on a boat!","review":"This potty is great-first little toddlers can learn to sit and go on the potty on the floor then the seat can be removed and snapped onto the toilet seat and the base flipped over and opened as a step to get up to the potty! And with built-in handles, little people can hang on! There is a removeable cup inside the potty that has to be emptied/rinsed/cleaned after every use but that has never been a drawback for me. It is much easier to clean a removeable cup than a whole toddler potty! We have even taken this potty out on our boat with us. Toddlers will not use public park facilities but ours were happy to use their own familiar potty! I would buy this potty again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poop Purchase","review":"I made a mistake buying this item, I hope my comments will help others. The potty comes apart too easily, the wee gets everywhere, so does the poop which makes it very difficult to clean. I would not recommend this item.

And if your son has chubby legs like mine, it pinches his legs when it is on. The hole is much smaller that most potties. The top does snap securely onto the family toilet, however it's no fun retrieving the splash guard from the toilet water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guard falls off!","review":"This would be a good potty seat for a girl, but it is useless for a boy. The guard falls off everytime my son moves. Also he has learned to take it off since it's so easy. It ALWAYS falls into the potty so if you use the top on a regular toilet, you will have to get it out of it too. I liked the idea of basically 3 products in one but overall, unless you have a girl, don't bother!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless!","review":"I bought two of these (one upstairs and one downstairs) only to have to give them away because they fell apart every time my child sat on it. The design, while in theory is a great idea, is very poor. Also, the guard to keep little boys from urinating on the floor is quite sharp on the edges and my son became afraid of it quickly. We have the Bjorn and the Once Upon a Potty potty now and he much prefers those."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Enough","review":"This is the 2nd potty i've tried. In my opinion this one is a lot easier to clean. When I first introduced my daughter to the potty I had her sit on this because she was scared of the \\"big one\\". Once she got familiar with it I would take the top off and sit it on the \\"big one\\". She felt comfortable because of the handles on this side. Right now she uses it as a stool and I think I'll be using it when our new little one is at that stage.My dislike about it is that when anyone would pick it up you have to becareful how you hold because it will come apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this!!","review":"Nanna purchased this for my daughter. She can remove the top from the base and carries it around. I am in the process of looking for a \\"solid\\" potty."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would highly recommend the Pottypal instead!","review":"I purchased this item last year and was less than impressed with its quality and functionality. It was too small for my elongated toilet and not quite large enough for my round toilet either. Further, it is less than sanitary since it is partially sumberged in the bowl and thus sprayed with emissions. The stool is too bulky to be used reasonably and scratched my walls. In sum, it is of poor quality.I just purchased and highly recommend the Pottypal which can be used to the age of seven to lessen the size if the bowl and eliminate the fear of fallin in. I fould mine for $18.95 on ebay! You can see it's usefulness on pottypal.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy another potty!","review":"This potty is terrible! It was acually the first one I tried, thinking that it looked the best, but looks are decieving! The potty container and seat were so small; I can't see a average size child even sitting on it! It also was such a pain to clean, too many parts. Plus, to convert it into a step stool was so complicated! Take my advice and don't waste you time with this potty; there are better ones out there. Happy training!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great potty...","review":"I received this potty as a gift for my daughter. We both hate it. The base isn't wider than the top, so it often tips forward when she sits on it. You also have to lift the \\"toilet\\" seat up to take out the container that actually holds the mess. The only good thing is the conversion to a two step stool. I'm thinking of trying the graco brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"caused a rash","review":"I had no complaints about how sturdy the potty was, or how well it worked. My complaint is that about a week after she started using it, my daughter got a rash in a circular ring on her bottom that matched the potty. We stopped using it and the rash cleared up. We tried it again and she immediately got the rash back.In the end my daughter was potty trained without a potty seat on an adult toliet (it can be done) and we only used the step stool part of the potty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good potty/Bad step stool","review":"I bought this potty when my son was 14mts and he loved it and was potty trained by 18mts with the occassional accidents, and night time diaper use. When he was about 2- 2 1/2 I used it as a step stool, and he fell, the step stool slipped and kind of collapsed under his weight. (he was of average weight.) He did not get hurt because I was standing behind him and I caught him. But he was so tramatized that he didn't use the big potty until he was maybe 3- 3 1/2 yrs. I took off the lid because it was just a nusiance.BEWARE this is dangerous as a step stool.My son is now almost 8 yrs old and I am suprised this potty is still on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST PRODUCT EVER.....","review":"I thought that this would be the ideal product with it able to convert to step stool.

Now she is afraid to sit on the potty for fear of falling off!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to clean","review":"I bought this chair as a second potty to keep in the car. What made me buy it was the fact it turns into a step stool and then a toilet insert as well. What I didn't know is it is a pain to clean. I have another potty which a much simpler design and I love it. You can clean it in 2 seconds flat. When I first brought this potty home, I was going to see which one my twins daughters wanted to use in the house (the other would go in the car), but after 1 use this potty is for sure the one going in the car. I would not buy this potty again."},{"rating":"1","title":"So many flaws. Not a practical potty, especially for BOYS!","review":"This potty has so many flaws.For one, the opening is just tiny. My son ended up pooping all over the seat because of that.For boys the splash guard is a real problem. If you don't have the splash guard on, of course he pees all out the front, but it flipped right down as my son sat down, so not only did he pee all out the front and on to the floor, he also peed on to the splash guard.It comes apart so easily, and it doesn't go back together all that well.And YIKES! All the places the germs can collect! There are so many little places for bacteria, both on the inside and outside of this potty.We gave ours away and got the Baby Bjorn potty instead, which is awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"The seat does not stay locked in place and moves at the slightest touch. If my son moves/wriggles while sitting on it, the seat often moves from side to side/front to back. The pee guard also comes off at the slightest touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put your money towards something else","review":"We have had nothing but trouble with this thing. Like other reviewers said the part that lifts up to empty the potty is not convenient. The latches on back to keep it together are very flimsy. The step stool only works when you take the potty apart and turn it upside down. The only time its convenient is if you are ready to move the seat to the adult toilet and use the step stool part as a step stool full time. But the worst part of this thing is the splash guard. My son never played with it. But once it was moved to the big toilet it would often come off and fall into the large toilet all on its own as my son was trying to get down. One day it fell off while I was taking him off the potty and I flushed before I realized it was in there. No, I didn't expect the chair to potty train my child for me but I certainly expected something that wouldn't fall apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible potty","review":"I've had this potty for awhile now and today our new one came and I could finally throw this one in the bin where it belongs.The biggest problem I had was that the wee seemed to leak from the pot into the outta casing, meaning that it had to be dismantled and hosed off after EVERY use. If you didn't realise this had happened you would on your next trip to the bathroom as the whole room stank of urine....took me awhile the first time to realise where it was comming from!I have now got the small baby born potty and it's wonderful...simple design and so easy to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"deflector?","review":"i just bought this potty today for my 23 month old son. when i was putting the deflector on-it never stays up, so how would this work for him-would he have to actually hold this deflector up when hes trying to train? i will be trying to get ahold of the company monday to have them send another deflector-maybe there is something wrong with the *peg* things..i dont know, but its frustrating"},{"rating":"1","title":"notahappymommy","review":"I bought this from the store near us, thinking that it was simple, but had all the basics and my daugher seemed to like it as well. We got it home and in less than a week the hinges broke. The bottom has no resistance to slip and when she tries to sit down it just slides out from under her. And there is no good mechanism to keep the front closed.

There wasn't a great selection at the store, so I chose this potty because I noticed that a friend had this one. As soon as I took the potty out of the box, I was very disappointed. The splash guard does NOT click into place. The seat does NOT lock into place and that spells disaster for a curious toddler. The hole is too small in my humble opinion. The only thing I like about this potty is that it has a lid like a real toilet. Don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE FOR BOYS!!","review":"My son was ready for potty traing & very excited about using the potty chair. The splash guard is a nuisance. It was almost impossible for him to sit down with it on and it always fell on his penis when he was sitting down. After several attempts to get it to stay up it became a frustration for both of us. Needless to say, my son lost his enthusiasm for the potty. I quit using it after 3 days. I should've stopped using it on the first day!I ended up buying a Royal Potty, which is excellent for boys, but my son now has an aversion to sitting on the potty and tries to sit himself as far back as he can away from the splash guard whether it is there or not. I'm sorry I ever bought this. It's set me back in the training process more than I'd like. I wish I had read the reviews before buying it.

Being a mom of 3 boys, two of which have long since been potty trained...I have seen many potty chairs and this one is the worst yet. I purchased this one for my son who is now 22 months, and he cannot even fit properly on this chair. Being a boy who needs to use the deflector shield, there is absolutely NO ROOM for him to sit comfortably and keep his parts behind this shield. He is an average size baby and we utterly had to put our training on hold because of this problem. Not to mention the deflector shield falls off again and again...probably because there is insufficient room to sit comfortably on this chair. For girls on the other hand it might be ok. The chair is sturdy and nicely made..but other than that worthless. Thanks for listening..hope it helps!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No problems here!!","review":"I don't know if I have a newer model and they've fixed some bugs, but I don't have any problems with sturdyness or leaking at all!

However, we've never had leaks or had it tip over...and that's with a toddler and two hyper cats running in and out of the bathroom.The lid does sometimes have issues staying up, but my daughter loves to put the lid down like on the big potty when she's done, so I don't view that as too huge of a problem. And I love the lid, because the bowl doesn't collect dust and things while it's not in use.I definately agree with an above reviewer who suggests doing a \\"test drive\\" in the store.

When you manage to get it on, it tilts in ward touching our sons body, which makes him scream. It also falls into the potty which makes me scream! Withought the guard the pea is EVERYWHERE! My son is trying, this potty isn't helping! Also the sliding draw with the bowl has sections, if the bowl is not fitted 100% correcty, the pea leaks into the bowl and into all the sections of the draw making cleaning rather difficult. And if all that isnt enough, the hinges of the seat don't stay in and tend to pinch your childs rear end, all leading to a very upset 21/2 year old boy!

I would not reccomend this seat at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and buy something else","review":"I bought this product for my 16 month old son just to begin acquainting him with the concept of using a potty. He loved it. Within five seconds he achieved a grand sense of accomplishment having dismantled it from top to bottom and distributed the pieces across three rooms. On top of it everytime he tried to sit on it, it made a popping noise from the seat not fitting securely on the base. Then when he tried to lift the lid it kept falling back down, sometimes it fell on his back when he would sit down. No matter what, he always would jump up from it immediately giving me a look of displeasure and mistrust in this product. It has nice handles for the kids to hold on to, but my son NEVER felt comfortable on it long enough to exercise that feature.Take it from me, this seat is a waste of your time and money.

She wasn't interested in using it at first but did enjoy removing the entire top section to see what was below. Unfortunaly due to the fact that there are very flimsy plastic straps holding the rear of the seat to the base this caused a problem. After less than a week of using this toilet I now have to check very carefully to be sure the top is on properly (a huge pain when she is in a hurry to go to the bathroom) or we risk having her end up on the floor. The straps no longer hold the top in place properly and every time my daughter sits down the whole front of the toilet slides forward.

She comes from the leading (if not bleeding) edge of jazz with melodic, lyrical and harmonically very inviting music. Not that she panders in the least, but she seems to have a natural knack for extroverted playing and composing, not unlike her mentor Henry Threadgill. She's also a terrific pianist who might remind you a bit of a more fluid and concise Cecil Taylor or harmonically wilder Don Pullen, but I wouldn't call her an imitator of anyone.On this recording she's joined by some very fine horn players (Dave Douglas, Chris Speed), and she lets them play. Her own playing is at once virtuosic and effective. There is a free, improvisational feel to this music, but it always holds together with just enough structure.Good stuff - we need more musicians like Myra Melford."},{"rating":"2","title":"stunning","review":"I have Amazon's recomendations-system to thank for this gem. It was suggested to me as a fan of The Bad Plus, Gerri Allen and the like - and never has a suggestion been more justified. Splendid stuff!! Strong, engaging compositions, with gorgeous melodies and more than enough room for improvs that get pretty dang free in places, but never turn freaky, because this band is as tight as any band could be - and there's always Michael Sarin's drumming to keep it all together.Great performances throughout, but the show gets stolen by cellist Erik Friedlander on the last, 24 minute track. Very, very inspired playing, moving and exhilarating at once.One last name that should be mentioned is sleeve designer Mary Ann Southard, who gave this album the artwork it deserves. Great for staring at as you play this disc again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I came here to write a review, only to find that R. Shultz of Chicago had already written it! I agree completely, and I don't think I can say it any better than Mr/Ms Shultz did. I wanted to like this book, but I could just not get through the extraneous drivel, repetition of cliches, poor organization of the chapters, inane jokes, and the author's pompous apologies for the inane jokes. I ended up doing a lot of skimming because I just didn't care what music accompanied each autopsy. The book should have been interesting, but it was boring. It would have greatly benefited from a good editor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story with some drops but overall greatness","review":"This is one of those books that you really do not want to put down and can't wait until you have the time to pick it up again.

The chapters are brief, and the writing style informative and friendly. The text is full of examples. I would heartily recommend this book to someone who is curious to begin studying Psalms in a more technical manner while seeking healthy interpretation of the text spiritually. It could also help the reader start to build a context and framework within which to put information gained in future and perhaps more heady studies of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Symphony in Three Movements","review":"Stravinsky's reading of his Symphony in Three Movements with a pickup group of Los Angeles studio musicians called the Columbia Symphony Orchestra is white hot and the best version around so far.

This disc is an excellent refutation of the old canard that Stravinsky couldn't conduct."},{"rating":"2","title":"A prized recording","review":"Igor Stravinsky conducts three of his own masterpieces in this compilation of recordings from the 1960's. SYMPHONY IN THREE MOVEMENTS was inspired by wartime newsreels. The vitriolic outer movements show definite jazz and big-band influence - which the CBC orchestra glories in - while the second movement is of a classical tranquility and grace. The elegant SYMPHONY IN C was meant as a tribute to Haydn and Bach; but the haunting, unresolved bitonal chord that dissolves into silence in the end makes the work quintessentially modern. And the SYMPHONY OF PSALMS, one of the great religious works of the 20th century, is heavenly music; Stravinsky and his forces give it an austere reading of almost chamber-music clarity. These performances leave nothing to be desired. This CD has become one of my most prized recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thumbs Up for Lady Raya","review":"Lady Raya's book is one of the best that I have seen on the subject of Wicca and the \\"Old Religion\\".

He puts so much heart in to this song that it can and will make a difference in many people's life. This C.D. is an absolute wonder and I highly recommend buying it. This CD represents almost every childs wish in this new Millenium. The wish that they can have one whole and happy family, and who better to represent this dream than a child himself. And what a child this is, one with incredible hope, an incredible voice, and more importantly incredible heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"::::::can't handle this album anymore::::::::","review":"oh it's so bad! don't buy this! little screechy child, and to make it worse, it's country; like a ho-down on seasame street.Could it get any worse than one voice or i think she likes me?

Instead of One Voice, maybe the CD should be titled One Song. The rest of the songs seemed to be a quickly put together complitation of old songs that are inappropriate for the singer's age as well as his ability. My advice: Skip the album, buy the single."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Voice Was Heard.......","review":"...unfortunately, it was Billy Gilman's. OK, he wants to be a singer. Great, more power to him! Sure, he sings on key, which is accomplishment enough for a child. But that doesn't necessarily make a true artist. I'm sure he'll sell plenty of albums due to the \\"cute factor\\". But a professional singer? No, not yet. Maybe years from now he'll be a star. Right now he just a novelty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like a hen laying an egg.","review":"This sounds more like a hen laying her first egg more than anything else.

Yeah, I can see Billy lighting up a crowd of real honky tonkers in Oklahoma...right before the headliner \\"Barney the Dinosaur\\" lays it down. Somebody give this boy a box of legos and a diaper change and tell him to call us in about 10 years when he hits puberty!!!Makes me want to spew"},{"rating":"2","title":"incredible! WHAT A VOICE!","review":"This little guy has it all!.A disc that takes you from toe tappin, to really rockin, to tear jerkin in a matter of seconds. A voice so pure with perfect pitch and a soulful delivery no matter what the tempo or topic. You don't have to be a country music lover to love this album.It will bring enjoyment to teenyboppers and senior citizens alike. Although One Voice is the title song there are many tracks that are much better, in fact every song is a jewel. Leanne Rimes and Charlotte Church can't hold a candle to this kid! He is truly a treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Power beyond words","review":"The debut CD of twelve year old \\"Billy Gilman\\" is simply phenominal. The young country music star had me sold on any future albums from the first time I heard him perform \\"Roly Poly\\" on the ACM Awards and later when I saw his \\"One Voice\\" video. The power with which Billy delivers the touching ballds of love and hope and the energy of the more upbeat songs guarantees him a career of longevity and success for so long as he wishes to keep it.I hear tell of the label \\"pressing\\" him to put out more records (which he denies), but there is already a Christmas album in the works. Hopefully they don't work the kid out of his passion for music, but I'm sold on that album already and I simply cannot wait for it and other albums to be released."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD has got it all!","review":"Five stars isn't enough for this CD. From light-hearted tunes like \\"The Snake Song\\" to tear-jerkers like \\"Oklahoma\\", this CD really does have it all! His rendition of the Tammy Wynette favorite \\"'Til I Can Make It On My Own\\" is excellent. Tammy would be proud. It is hard to believe that Billy Gilman is only 12 years old! The CD is incredible, and a must have for your CD collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL!","review":"Every time I hear the song, \\"ONE VOICE\\" on the radio (CAT COUNTRY, of course), I get goosebumps!

The voice of Billy is unique and you most have this cd if you are a fan of pop-country music. In this cd you can find all kind of songs from romantic ones to happy songs, and also balads. In my opinion this cd has everything you need to have hours of hearing good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"this little boy has a beautiful voice! this song has so much power and truth packed into it. I could listen to this over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Voice","review":"Country music in particular needs an emotional \\"hook\\" along with artistic merit in order to be successful, and this single clearly makes the grade on both counts. Who knows what young Mr. Gilman's career will look like in a few years after the effects of vocal maturity and the music business take their inevitable toll. For now maybe it's enough to just enjoy a fresh clear voice while listening for the echoes of our own lost innocence.So it's Country. I liked it. This kid is good. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"I listened to this album over at a friend's house. Billy Gilman's voice is like an angel's! Beautiful and powerful!

It really hit me. He is such a talented young kid and I encourage everyone who reads this to buy his CD or wait until May 8th to buy his new one, \\"Dare to Dream\\". So after I heard him sing \\"Warm and Fuzzy\\", it was love at first sound. I hope to pass this experience to anyone who buys this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD","review":"I was wary of this new child artist, after being thoroughly disappointed by LeAnn Rhimes. But after hearing the title track, One Voice on CMT, I HAD to hear the CD. I was NOT disappointed!

LOL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Billy Gilman's Debut a KNOCKOUT","review":"Rhode Island's Billy Gilman offers us his debut LP, and it is everything his single \\"One Voice\\" promised...great songs, super production, and an amazing voice. The song selection is great, from the title track, to the cover versions of \\"Little Bitty Pretty One\\" and \\"What's Forever For\\".

I bought this cd and have played it over and over. What an amazing voice and what an amazing child. I loved the songs with One Voice my favorite. The cuteness of The Snake Song is catchy and Oklahoma is so moving. There's a Hero should capture anyone's heart. This child will go far and I wish him much success.

This is the first real \\"get high\\" album since Cypress Hill released Black Sunday. If you thought Jay-Z Vol. 2 had some of the best guest mc's on it think again, Billy lines up some of the flyest guests you can think of. His usual friends include JT The Bigga Figga, Skull Duggery, UGK, and Gansta Harmony. I am really suprised with track #5 when he teams up with the Chipmunks and even more suprised to see former Vancouver Grizzley Brian \\"Big Country\\" Reeves spit out some bars with the kid they call Billy.The Best part of the Album is where Billy tries his hand at freestyling when he battles Methodman and Redman. Billy offers up two remixes on this cd, the first of JT Money's Who Dat and second of Mack 10 Bang or Ball.

I was in the store when I saw the cd. I was so thrilled because I remembered the last conversation I had had with \\"Joanie\\".

It is also a promotional book for the author's building company. Aside from learning that ladder trusses are also called Larsen Trusses and that they are non-load bearing, I didn't get much out of the book.

At times it's like a compressed serial; at times it's a musical; at times it's an infomercial for the US postal service. All of this is incidental, because Lugosi is on hand, giving his characteristically intense and sincere performance. What's deplorable, however, is the print quality. It's absolutely awful, one of the worst I've ever seen on DVD. Some scenes (or, often, parts of scenes) look like they were shot through waxed paper. Would that some philanthropic movie maven would squander his inheritance on making GOOD restorations of these old gems!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare gem for Lugosi!","review":"I am a big fan of Lugosi and I have all his films.Some of the cheap ones he made I admit are notvery good except for the fact he is in them!I know many don't like this but I think thisis one of his best.

The presentation is a flat monotone with no attention to relative importance of events discussed. It's as if the authors had daily news bulletins spread out before them, and then give us a synopsis. There is no analysis of significance and import of the events, or background explanation of Israeli and Palestinian personalities, politics or issues. What commentary that is given is by way of quotations (or paraphrases) of recognized authorities in the field, and often this material is without source attribution. Unless the reader has some significant prior understanding of the Israeli/Palestinian situation, much of the book will be confusing and of low informative value."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON\\"T BUY THIS BOOK!","review":"I got this book as a first step towards understanding graduate school.

Combining biased school reviews, (a large number of top schools including Rockefeller, Scripps, Baylor,Tufts, and Einstein are wholly left out), school/location@descriptions that read more like gossip and heresay than objective observation, a paucity of program listings and desriptions (many program listings are merely the schools all encompassing website address), and straight out poor editing make this book better for starting a fire than trying to get an idea of graduate school.

For year after year high quality television was produced by these guys, never once insulting the intelligence of their audience. When I saw there was a book I couldnt wait - I ordered it with great expectation and waited impatiently for it, but what a terrible surprise I got! To Shandling's great shame, this book is the exact opposite of his show - the jokes are obvious, lines are predictable, the whole thing is sophomoric and embarassing to read.

Perhaps that's why this book is so disappointing. Though you may laugh out loud once or twice, the impression is that he dashed this off in less than a week. Unlike his show, this book IS insulting to our intelligence. Read this book back to back with a brilliant master like Dave Barry and you will immediately see how not funny it is. The premise that he had sex with every beautiful hollywood star, as funny as it may seem, is a sorry pretext for an entire book. Don't waste your hard earned money on this one -- I'm happy I read it in the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few laughs and mercifully its over quickly","review":"This is a strange genre - an autobiography of a fictional character. Add to this that the fictional character is Larry Sanders, a paranoid, insecure, and egotistical host of a late night talk show! Fortunately, the large print face, copious white space and 82 pages of pictures contribute to making this a quick read. The humor would be the sad type of laughing at some obnoxious, insensitive bore, except we are saved from feeling bad about this by the fact that the object of the joke is fictional. This is supposed to make laughing at him acceptable. If you can get into the premise there are plenty of funny jokes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd","review":"How could this work? What made the Larry Sanders show funny was it's cutting satire in allowing us to see the flip side of Hollywood.

Why didn't they at least wear bikinis, for crying out loud?! And I'm not so much bothered by the raininess, except that the camera lens often has a lot of water drops on it, and what's the deal with the light in quite a few scenes causing such a bad over-exposure?

The workbook that comes free with the DVD is not a workbook, but a booklet that fits in the DVD case and isn't very helpful.PROS: The main characters in the show are obviously native speakers and use normal informal Japanese that children would actually speak.

The sound is awful, some parts very soft some parts very very loud. The songs are annoying. The boy main character is annoying and mumbles. Yeah sure, in real life people mumble and I guess if you really want to learn to speak a language you should learn how to understand mumbling people but I think that's a more advanced skill. For a kid video, I think it's better to have the actors speak clearly and a little slowly.My child was not entertained by this at all and even I lost interest before the whole thing aired.Overall I would give this a big fat LAME and wish I could return it and erase the memory of it from my mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Into the modern world","review":"I view Stravinsky as being a gateway to modern music.

However, our son is very active and is constantly on the move. We could never get the booster seat strapped to any chair tight enough to keep it from sliding around. One evening, our son managed to throw himself off balance by rocking in his booster seat as we sat near him. The chair he was in fell forward, and he landed on his mouth on the floor. He lost his first tooth that night and had his first trip to the emergency room. Unless you have a very docile child, do not trust a booster seat. Invest in a real highchair, sacrifice the space and convenience and put your child's safety first!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tray is awful","review":"I purchased this item 3 days ago and it is going back!! The overall quality of the seat is okay, but if you plan on using the tray it is awful!! I placed my 11 month old daughter in this and was unable to get the one side of the tray to fully latch. Well after I finally got this thing to fully latch guess what.......I couldn't get it to unlatch to get her out. The tray slides on and off REAL hard and the levers for the latch are small which make it hard to pull on them. I have an older model of the same chair which is probably 6 years old and love it, but the new and approved is WORTHLESS!! So back to the store this one will go and I will look for something different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorta liked it until I tried the FP booster","review":"The \\"small compact straps to chair\\" element is a plus, but after comparing this to the Fisher Price booster, there's just no going back. This flops all over the place when it is \\"folded\\" and has many nooks and crannies where food gets lodged, and where, if you just put it in the sink to hose it down, water will get stuck. The straps fall off every time you wash the seat down, and the tray is difficult to get on and off quickly. Just can't stand the thing, really, not after trying a *real* portable high chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"great for grandparents house","review":"My son needed a chair to sit in otherwise he would not eat, so I bought this chair when we were visiting the grandparents. The chair is adequate but unless I pick a faulty one I find the tray very difficult to get on and off, the plactic levers are very small for those with arthritis. I don't know if there are any chairs that are better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tray is a pain in the neck","review":"I received this booster seat as a shower gift and while I love the convenience of it, I have to admit that the tray is nearly imposible to get on and off which makes it less of a convenience and more of a hassle. My mother in law has the booster seat made by The First Years and is much easier to use. I called Safety First to get a refund and they would only refund me the manufacturer's cost without proof of purchase. Who has proof of purchase when it was a shower gift and now your child is 18 months old. What choice do I have now? Keep it or get less for it. Overall, I have been pretty unsatified with ALL Safety First products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible seat!","review":"I bought this seat for my 11 month old. Food got stuck in every little crack on the chair, and she was too big for it. The tray doesn't adjust, and it cut into my daughter's stomach.This chair seriously sucks. Don't even waste your money.I took it back and bought the Fisher Price booster. It's so much better than this POS.I had to give it one star. I wanted to give it zero, but, apparently that's not an option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Travel Chair","review":"This chair is terrific! We go out to eat a lot, and my 7 month old is still too small for the restaurant high chairs or booster seats - she pretty much slides right out of them. The three point harness keeps her in the chair, and the tray keeps her from leaning too far forward, as well as giving her a focal point. Since she can't reach beyond the tray, anything that goes on the tray can go in her mouth.There are also two height adjustments and it folds well for easy carrying. The only thing that keeps me from giving this a fifth star is how hard it is to put the tray on or take it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"I liked that it folded so easy. But it seemed like it was kind of flimsy when I folded it. I didn't like that food got stuck in it, and I'm not thrilled that the straps are white (as they are on most these boosters) and got grimy fast. However, I like that it's so easy to take to another place. However, I ended up giving it away, because I don't go out that often, and the hard plastic wasn't as comfortable as another seat I found."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Buy!","review":"This is a great chair for the price. I was skeptical at first but reviews were good so I went ahead and bought it. It's perfect for my sewing room. It's comfortable and easily adjusts to the proper height.

It's well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Chair is Soooo Comfy!","review":"This is a very comfortable chair. I work at my desk and, therefore, sit for very long stretches of time.

Everything needed is in the box, no additional tools needed. It feels comfortable but only been on it for 45 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Nice, But Really Uncomfortable","review":"I bought this chair based on all these positive reviews. And I don't get it. This is one of the most uncomfortable chairs I've used that I can recall. I had to switch chairs after less than an hour because of the pain. It's fine if you need to sit for twenty minutes, but I sit at a desk all day. I actually gave the chair away.On the plus side, it was simple to assemble, and it looks much nicer than in the picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does its job but broke after 2.5 years","review":"The chair was not as comfortable as I had thought after reading the reviews. The cushion was not great -- as time went on, you could feel the screws protruding through the cushion into your body. But for 40 dollars, i think it is a reasonably good chair. Expect the chair to fall apart in 3 years (assuming average use)."},{"rating":"2","title":"CONFORTABLE CHAIR.","review":"A good price and very good product. Very useful for your PC activities at home or office."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comfortable chair","review":"So i saw this on amazon with good reviews and decided to check my local Target store and I was happy to see that they had it in stock. Bought it and got it set up in less than 10 minutes--assembling this is cake. I took a seat and it felt really comfortable, the seat cushion is really made with quality and it feels good under your buttocks. The back support is flexible and is capable of stretching back a couple of inches for ultimate back comfort; it has little holes for ventilation which is a plus for those who sit on it for a long time and get sweaty back. For this price, and this quality...it's a steal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Chair!","review":"I actually went straight to Target to get the chair. It was easy to put together. Light weight, not too heavy or too big in size. I didn't like those really big, tall office chair and this one was perfect. It has also great back support. Lastly, the price fits the pocket. I really recommend this product. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"MILLER SIZZLES AGAIN!","review":"This is a hot and sexy read and one of Miller's best. I've read most of her books and be it contemporary or historical, she delivers! Amy Ryan knows what she wants and she's not afraid to get it, Harry gets her hand but don't know why the relationship is going astray - some food for thought for modern couples out there. Wild About Harry shows that you can still find love after your heart's been broken, and is a fast read for those who don't have too much time to spare. Only grudge was the book had to end. Get it and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot and Spicy!","review":"This is best romance I've ever read! It was funny, sexy, and very, very hot! It made me fallin love with Austrailia and most of all Harry. I couldn't put it down. I've read all of Linda Miller's books and this one is my favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"That was the question I was constantly asking througout this book. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why anyone was doing anything. The characters were weak, and their motivations were non-existant. The choices they made seemed little more than weak plot devises to stretch the book out beyond a short story into a complete novel. From continent hopping to unplanned pregnancy to early marriage, to other problems, WILD ABOUT HARRY seemed to jump jerkily from one event to another without any explanation. The only reason this book got more than one star was because I did like the Ghost, and it was funny that the only time anyone in this book seemed even remotely real was when they werer chatting with the dead guy. Skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Vol.1","review":"This volume is better than the first, but you must read the entire run, especially vol.3, because it's the best one. Great story, not too good art, but acceptable. Recomended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to wash baby...","review":"I bought this bath seat for my 6 month old, the closed design made it difficult to reach the already hard to reach places. He also kept sliding to the front of the seat, I tried putting a wash cloth down before setting him in but that didn't help. The three decretive shapes left red marks on his belly. So, we used this seat several times and ended up going to Target to get a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhh","review":"I'm not impressed. My baby is only 7 mo old and it is cumbersome to get him into this seat. Other revewiers are correct when they say that the green portion of the seat it much, MUCH larger and it takes up half of that open space where the legs go. I wish it was more like the picture shown because then my baby would have had no issues fiting. I don't see how this will fit a baby at 16mo like it states. The \\"toys\\" on top are a bit hard with a very pointy and unfriendly way about them. I don't want my baby chewing on them. The product would have been next to perfect tho if it weren't for the green portion of the seat taking up too much space. UPDATE THE PICTURE!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This product shipped promptly and met description. However, I was unable to use it because it would not stick to my bathtub. I believe it is because I have a textured floor and the suction cups would not work. Most disappointing was that I was unable to return this product. Check return policy carefully! The return date was 2 days after I received it. Now I am stuck with an expensive product that is useless.....disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"its ok","review":"I like this chair but it does move a lot in the bathtub when baby moves around the chair tilts a little. for the price, I dont recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for us.","review":"We used it once when my son was first learning to sit up, but he didn't really like it, and the suction cups didn't work on our textured bathtub. so we went back to using his \\"Whale of a tub\\" and that has worked great, and now that it's too small, he has no problems sitting up on his own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect bath ring","review":"I really love this bath ring.

The product I received is the same upon first glance, but there is a MUCH smaller space between the seat and the top rail. The green part on the actual bath seat is much bigger and makes a much smaller space for my son's legs. I had a hard time getting him in and getting him out was almost impossible. I got this bath seat b/c my son had outgrown his other one (he has some chunky thighs) and this one looked to have a lot of room for big legs. If you have a chunky baby, this will not work for you.

Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for cleaning baby","review":"The chair is helpful for baby to sit in and play, though I had to stick a folded towel down the back to make my 6 month old fit snuggly. However, when I went to wash him, I found it was very difficult to wash below the waist. So ultimately, the chair is not very useful for bath time. Maybe a baby bath tub would be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well - simple","review":"Works well. It's really a simple chair that allows a baby to sit up in a batch.

I purchased this item as a present for my friend and obviously can't give it in such condition. Only at this point I read reviews and learned it is available at BedBath for 29.99That's one I didn't expect to see on Amazon - price to be twice the retail price.Very unhappy. Still would return and purchase at BedBad, because even with nonrefundable shipment, 10% restocking fee (for a scratch item) comes out less than just having this item replaced.Read reviews before buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"You should read consumer report","review":"I think this item has a good purpose but not safe for babies.

She can play and splash and I don't worry about her slipping and falling into the water. My only problem with this seat is she leans over the bar and the little toys poke her and rub her chest so it's red when she gets out. But she doesn't seem bothered by it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's Up With the Pricing","review":"I don't get the pricing on this. First of all the blue model is $56.00 vs. the pink model which is $48.98. The only difference I can see is the color. Secondly, this isn't worth $56. BuyBuy Baby sells them for $25, which is much more reasonable for the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it, baby did not","review":"This is a great, sturdy product and I think everyone should have one to try. HOWEVER, the first time we used it, my son was scared. I think it is all the water in the tub and it was a bit overwhelming...something I did not think would happen.There's a line on it that says do not fill above and I did not fill water near it so maybe he would have liked it more if we had more water in the tub? I was afraid of him tipping over- which would not have happend- I was just worried, I guess, lol.My son likes to splash his hands in the water and he couldn't in this. I will give it another try with the water deeper and see if he likes it.It is a great product, but costs so much to put a gamble on whether your child will like it or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"baby bath ring","review":"I have been looking for this bath seat since my grandson was born 6 months ago.

First and most importantly, when my daughter (who can sit on her own) was in it she immediately slid around in it and seemed to land so her little girl parts were racked by the center 'bar'. Completely unacceptable. Seems that if they have to put that center bar there they would make the seat with a more gripping surface or tilt it to the rear just a bit. Also, this seat is designed for modern plastic tubs. Does fine in the one tub in my home, but wont stick to the old clawfoot tub and the tub bottom is too curved for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work out for us","review":"I bought this for my grandson. This product did not work out for us. The suction cups will not stick to a tub that has a non slip surface on the bottom.

We're hoping to donate this to someone who can use this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratches all over both babies!","review":"My neice used this seat and my sis-in-law loved it, so I bought one for my daughter. She ended up with scratches on her legs that she received from this chair when trying to reach out for toys floating in the tub. I put the seat away for 2 years and tried it again on my son. After 1 use he recoved a huge scratch on his thigh!! Maybe I just received a faulty one, but I felt complelled to submit a review.

The talent of this group is spectacular. Don't miss out on this experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunningly Beautiful","review":"A story and characters that could have been trite and cliched, but, instead, are breathtakingly real. Ms. Williamson's character devleopment is exceptional from the major characters to the minor ones. They are then all woven together to form a beautiful tapestry set against a turbulent time in America (the late 19th century). The action is just enough to garnish the story without drowning it. At the heart of the book is life, death, love, the hypocrisy of the social classes, and the capacity of the human heart to have more than one great love in a lifetime. Her cadence is lyrical and sweeping without being corny or maudlin. I was left breathless, in tears, and wanting more of Shay and Emma at the end of this book. Definitely a keeper to be enjoyed again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story is good, KINDLE HAS RUINED FORMAT though","review":"Just a warning to anyone buying this on Kindle, the chapters are OUT OF ORDER! It is horrible, for about five or six chapters the story would be in line and then suddenly you'd jump from chapter six to chapter fourteen...and it isn't easy to figure out where to pick up because some (but not all) of the chapters are mislabeled! HORRIBLE experience with Kindle but a good enough story that I was willing to sort through the hodge-podge of chapters looking for the right ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your usual romance novel","review":"It seems most romance novels are all the same - the great cookie cutter approach. This is definitely not the case with this book. The characters really come alive and seem like people not cartoon characters. This was a wonderful and poignant tale that should be read by the kleenex box. Fans of Cathy Cash Spelman should enjoy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, did Matt's dog write this book?","review":"Well, the title of this book pretty much describes it. It is about an angel who falls from the sky. Yup, that's about it. It is basically a rip-off of Dante's 'Divine Comedy', as well as 'Air-bud' (the movie of course). An angel falls from heaven, loses it's wings or something, fights Satan in a one-on-one duel with lightsabers and telepathic powers, and then goes out to eat. This book is only worth it if you are his mother, because, well, it is horrible. Instead of buying this book, go buy advertisements that state how you shouldn't read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super","review":"I feel that without this book, my son would have never learned how to read. I believe that it is terrible how everyone has given this novel a bad review when a majority of them have not even read it. Because of these criticisms, the author now spends most of his time posting on internet message boards, poking fun at people he feels have inferior tastes in music. I can only hope that Matthew comes to realize that he himself is an angel that has fallen from a cloud, right into not only my son's bedroom, but also his heart. My son cannot stop reading the book, and even sleeps with it, although this has become a problem after his mother found him dryhumping the front cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy, rushed work even for a 9 year old...","review":"It is apparent this book was simply thrown together to make a quick buck - not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm not quite sure","review":"I read this book in a matter of 2 minutes... the i read it again and again and again.

There is no other book like it. Be aware that most of the text is in Japanese, but It contains thousands of photos, as well as drawings, imaginative collages, and unique layout. It covers mostly small buildings - homes, barns, sheds, yurts, treehouses, tipis - and just about anything visual that caught the photographers' and editors' eyes. The layout is imaginative and stunning. The book makes the reader wonder how anyone could gather so much information, and then assemble it into a cohesive whole. In addition to architects, I'd recommend this book to builders, designers, artists, photographers, and anyone fascinated with the visual world. Unique and inspirational.I understand an English language edition is in the works (probably by 2005)."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good deal","review":"This book is an effective way to educate my patients.Cheap price with good quality materials.Love to order more as a gift for my graduate students."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chaotic relations","review":"Bausch's stories provide the certainty that you can eavesdrop on any life and find something worth hearing.

Technique and skill is nothing without warmth and the awareness to live in the moment of ectasy is the heart of expression between two lovers.

The book covers a whole lot of material and therefore it is great for an introductory course but does not get into them too deep. If you need further explanation on something there are references listed at the end of each chapter.There were two major problems with this book however, one of them being some of the examples used in the book are too simple and trivial and the tougher problems are left for the reader as an exercise.

I bought this recording specifically for the 'Lincoln Portrait' narration, expecting excellence. Not so. Mixing of voice and orchestra is unfortunate: volume must be pumped up to hear Fonda's voice, then cranked down to save eardrums from Copeland's orchestra.

There's an entire chapter dedicated to on-line poker and the author's first bit of advise is to learn how to turn on a computer. That's the caliber of skill this book is aimed at. You know what?

I'm quite surprised Cardoza Publishing, which made the authoritative bible on all forms of poker \\"Super System\\", would bother to publish this scant piece of work.

Just because they chose outside doesn't necessarily mean that they don't have a great impact on the black community.

Bernstein went to Harvard and lived in New York, but probably should have been alive 80 years previously in Vienna (except of course for his ethnicity). There aren't a lot of works that can carry the full load of Lennie's emotional style, although it is always interesting to experience his approach. This is one work that is actually larger than Lennie can fill. Note especially the trios, which will raise the hair on your neck, as well as Placido's early tour de force as the setpiece tenor. I've also always imagined a not entirely comfortable relationship between the Vienna and Mr. Bernstein---at least in my imagination, this adds a tension to their collaboration which brings the music to a high pitch of realization. A lush and complex work interpreted by a lush and complex conductor."},{"rating":"1","title":"The bad review is right--sorry","review":"This set is terribly let down by the two leads. Ludwig sounds like an Octavian stretching to become a Marschalin--it's a great stunt but the voice isn't right. Gwyneth Jones is a curse, with hher sqawlly, unfocused singing.

Well, the voice is still here (of course, much deeper than in her sassy and romantic youth, but who cares?)Apparently, majority of people commenting this album online are quite thrilled... I appologize, but I'm not.Maybe it's because I'm primarily jazz-oriented Sarah Vaughan fan, althoug I like some other forms of music as well (blues for instance)... I have nothing against bossa nova and other forms of Latin music, but this is, basically, a pop album with light Brazilian touch and even lighter jazz touch...Even when Sarah goes on short wordless-impro flight, for instance on \\"Love and Passion\\", it is smothered in electric sounds of elevator music...

And if you have any chance of seeing him live, do that too."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this cd...","review":"For some reason, the convention is that bands make more rocking music and solo artists do mellower stuff. I was expecting this to be soft and pretty and something I could fall asleep to, but it's actually a warm, punchy alt rock album. It's got big guitars and a lot of choruses that stick in your head. It seems influenced by rock from the 70s and 90s, but also sounds fresh and not quite like anything else I've heard. It's melodic, catchy and has memorable lyrics. Emmich's voice and songwriting skills are what really make this record. The band is tight too. The production is subtle and just lets the infectious, well-written songs stand on their own. Standouts (to me) are \\"Bury Me\\", \\"Privacy Attracts a Crowd\\" and \\"A Voice\\".

If you use it, and the bi-pod it comes with, I suggest setting your camera to a 2 second delay so that you can remove your hands as they will cast a shadow on your subject.For the low price, I would suggest purchasing this.

I saw peoples'reviews and was certain that this product could fulfill my expectations(which weren't that high), but in reality, it didn't even come close. First of all, the product came with no directions of any sort. Not that it's rocket science setting it up, but it seems pretty obligatory to include some sort of directions. Secondly, the white \\"sheet\\" included does not even remotely white-out the background, which is black. I think you would be better off spray painting a cardboard box and creating your own studio. By far the worst product I've bought on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"is it 'Photo Studio'. ha, ha, ha!","review":"I even did not understand why it is called 'Photo Studio'. Nothing common, wast of money! Yes, it is cheap, but when you buy a pen for 50c, as minimum you expect that you can write something with this cheap tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I bought this lightbox thinking that it wouldn't be bad for photographing things and I could get more work done at night and not be so reliant on daylight. Wrong.First of all, the design of the box is all wrong. There are three white panels but the top is the black part that houses the accessories. Causes shadows and also causes the box to bend even when it's empty. It never stands straight as in the pictures.The lights are nowhere near bright enough to get the photos of fabric to the colors they need to be. You could add additional lights but it just wasn't worth it to me. I think the money would be better spent buying super heavy duty lights and worrying about the light box later.This one went back quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Photo Box","review":"I bought this asap, because I need it in my Jewelry Photography at home. The price is very affordable, I love the box, it's very handy.The other light, it's bulb is kinda loose, I need to tighten it up every time. I bought improvise lgiths for my studio, coz' I need white light not yellow. I bought the 2 clip on reading light ( 100 watts each, big enough to occupy the whole side), one on each side, and 1 ordinary light for the top ( 100 watts ) . Over all, I made a right choice that i bought this."},{"rating":"2","title":"great pictures!","review":"WOW this box really takes nice pictures..I got it to photograph products I will sell on the Web. I looked at more expensive products but this one really goes a very good job with my small products.

However, it is based more on hear-say than actual management experiences in Asia! For the novice to Asia it gives a good overview of what might have shaped consumer behavior. It falls short of acknowledging that Asian consumers quickly assume new roles outside of their traditional attitudes, more geared towards Western-style consumer motivation. Market realities quickly outlive the authors' assumptions already! Maybe the authors try too hard to construct fundamental differences, where there aren't. Looking closer, much of that are rather local facets of doing business in a global marketplace."},{"rating":"1","title":"No real pearl here.","review":"I was really hoping that this book would give me some real insights into Asian consumer behavior. Perhaps I hoped too much. Like what the other reviewers mentioned, it lacked examples, particularly on the effects of the 97' crisis. I would be the first to admit that good consumer behaviour books are hard to come by, but I really expected more - what this book does is actually give you some background on the asian culture and fit in bits of consumer behaviour terms in between. A summary would probably be: Asians thinks more about status than self actualizing themselves; and of course less \\"individualist\\" whatever that means. No real pearl in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timmy gives it a paws up","review":"My finicky daschund/chihuahua mix dog, Timmy, readily eats this food and digests it well.

The shows are very well written and very captivating. Couldn't wait until it came out on DVD and felt like it took forever. Unfortunately when I received it - it didn't work. I don't understand why this show is not done in normal DVD standards. I didn't realize it wouldn't work in my DVD/VHS combo. I never saw the disclaimer until today when I was looking at Season 2 and wondering why it was so expensive. If I put the disk in my portable DVD player first and then put it in my DVD/VHS combo it will work. This is truly disappointing especially since I love this show but will not buy Season 2 because of this. That is also why I only gave it 4 stars. Does anyone know why it was done in this format?

When I leave I turn off the Jabra and turn bluetooth on in my cell. It takes about 1-2 minutes for the headset to work with my cell but that's fine.My only complaint is that the velcro they give you doesn't work (not sticky enough). But for me the belt clip works fine as I use a cordless and don;t mind clipping them both on when I want to roam.

There are numerous problems with both the unit and the company. The boom phones are made with weak wires and plugs do not fit well. An adapter is need to hook up to most cell phones which creates a third wire. Their phones create a terrible feedback even when they are connected properly. Their microphones are truly excellent as long as you are not moving to disturb the connection. After numerous tests with different phones they at times create an echo effect for the person you are trying to speak with. The adapter method they use is ill conceived in that they are meant to work (with extra cost connectors) with all phones yet there is a problem inherent with any cell phone use. These headsets should be for desk use only and constructed as such. Their advertising is misleading. Light weight should be an excuse to sacrifice dependability."},{"rating":"1","title":"good product TERRIBLE service","review":"Good headset for voice recognition.

When I got the headset back it functioned for a while, but then developed significant background noise (sort of a low static sound). It went back again, this time for about 6 weeks during which time it got a new microphone. It still has too much background noise and I have given up on using it with my phone. It's too bad, really, because I was quite happy with the Boom's performance prior to this. In fairness, Jeannie in customer service was very nice and helpful.

The resulting battle spans two episodes and includes some important revelations, and the introduction of the very kyoot, VERY intelligent Washu, the greatest scientist in the universe. This video is classic Tenchi all the way, loaded with killer action sequences, intriguing character development and hilarious comedy. This is also one of three real battle sequences in the entire OVA series and in my opinion the best. Only a few things mar this otherwise wonderful video, other than Pioneer's usual B grade dub work, it can be extremely confusing on the first viewing and is pretty much unwatchable without viewing at least the two previous tapes.

No competitive analysis of products, no guidance, no meat!Don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative but short","review":"Some books are just plain too short and this is one of them. It's around 90 pages, though it feels even shorter. It's a series of 8 examples, about 10 or so pages each. Each walks through a very well illustrated example of taking a photo and either fixing it's flaws or tweaking it to have a more arty effect. One example is about making a panorama, in what seems like a very tortured way.The perspective of this book also bothered me. It's written from the perspective of someone who understands what needs to be done to a photo but doesn't understand how to get Photoshop to do it. If that's where you are, then you will like the book. But I think the majority of us need to start with analyzing an image to find out what needs to be done.

Some people love it some do not, myself I find the words to these songs are of high quality. I think Dan Toler's guitar playing is excellent, and of a very high quality. Same goes for Gregg's voice and organ playing, the band is very tight. I also find the overall sound quality to be top notch, this to me is one of Gregg's best solo albums. I think this cd is well worth buying, all the years I have had it I still play it a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Guitar Album!","review":"This is definitely a guitar players album. There's not a single song that doesn't have an outstanding guitar part. \\"Demons\\" is the first cut and Dan Toler's guitar just rocks all the way through till \\"Every Hungry Woman\\", the last cut which is a great remake from the Allman's first album. The guitar playing is so awesome that it's easy to tell that Gregg really appreciated his guitar players talents too and just decided that he was going to step aside and let him do his thing. Dan Toler, probably highly under-rated, is no doubt one of the best in the business. If you really like to rock, you're going to really love this album...if you're a guitar player, you're going to be totally blown away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"just before the bullet flys gregg allman","review":"great album bought it years ago in vinyl been a big fan for years. great doing business with you. thanks again"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of Breed","review":"IMHO Gregg's best recording and true High Fidelity.

My 2 cents of advise, Don't buy these speakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Power button is intermittent","review":"These speakers look good, have nice sound, have plenty of power, and are nicely compact and portable. The only problem is that the power button, which is push-on/push-off, needs to be pushed to the right and up to make contact when it is in the on position; it then will shift a little occasionally and thus lose power even though it is still in the push-on position. It is particularly prone to doing this at high volumes due to the vibration. This is a design or material defect which costs it a 5-star rating.JimUpdate June 11, 2012I finally got rid of them; the aggravation of having them shut themselves off was too much.Jim"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely unbearable headphone hiss","review":"The hiss when listening through headphones plugged into the front of these speakers is absolutely terrible.

To coutner the uplifting stuff are some freakin tight acid tracks with sick 303 sounds and pounding bass lines. CD 1 stands out more than cd 2 cause in my opinion it seems more energetic. If you like hypnotic dark trance you might want to pick up oliver leib's black album, Commander Tom live in the mix series (mor technoish) and Chris Liberator or mellow trax cds for you Acid heads. All three of these dj's/producers have live mixes out there which I highly suggest you find and download."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Niiiiice!!","review":"This one is definitely the best of the series! Because now you have Scot Project in the mix!! Very HARD, uplifting, and somewhat \\"dark\\". Some tracks definitely push to the max level of dark such as ASYS Acid Nightmare, Jay Frog Pushin', and my personal fave Angel Of Death. Now if Hypetraxx would've done us the favor and shut the hell up, this would've been the perfect trance compilation EVER! But oh well, he doesn't speak often, just in the beginning of the discs. Even when you listen to internet radio mixes you can hear the djs speak and make comments. Doesn't really bother unless they just keep rambling on. But all in all it's a very well put together compilation. Scot Project is the man behind Overdose Records, Germany. One of the best hard trance labels in the world!!! And he showcases his skills on the discs. Check him out live! Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection of the Quintet's Prestige Recordings","review":"This box set is a great value!

These sessions are:Nov 16, 1955May 11, 1956Oct 26, 1956In addition a forth CD is included that has live performances from three different points in the Quintet's history as well as transcriptions of some of Davis' solos in pdf format.If you don't already own all of the Quintet's Prestige albums, I highly recommend buying this box set!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music, Another $$$ Grab","review":"The labels will be repackaging Miles long after I'm dead, and I'm relatively young. The extras tracks here aren't particularly special (the Steve Allen intros are actually painfully clumsy) the booklet is a yawner (nice photos, tho) and the sound quality is only marginally better than recent releases of this stuff (and not as bright as the vinyl.)If you already own this in digital format, I see zero reason to make this purchase. But if you are a completist, or newly discovering Miles, it is recommended for the wonderful music. The tracks are packaged sequentially, rather than in original album order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Packaging issues - not the music!","review":"I've read mixed reviews about Prestige box set releases and I have to say, the packaging for this set is HORRIBLE. The cover is nice - Miles Davis artwork, but the inside contains unnecessary CARDBOARD holders for the discs, unlike the clear plastic ones Columbia uses. One of the cardboard holders isn't even lined up right. It looks like an elementary school art project. The booklet slides into a cardboard sleeve as does the fourth disc. It's... weird.

I definitely recommend this for all kids- it's a nice change from all the crazy shows they have now. I will always remember being fascinated by the girl who plays 'Mary', thinking she was so pretty and had the prettiest voice.

The songs are so nice, meaningful and touching the soul.

The pewter is more of a teal than a pewter, which is where buying them in person came in handy. I purchased both the pewter and the bronze.

But it is much less a biography of Santos-Dumont than an account of the development of his flying machines. While the author provides detailed descriptions of Santos-Dumont's attempts to conquer the air, a fair amount of the history of manned flight, and even digresses about the development and the creators of military weapons (an interesting analysis by the way), we learn little about this extraordinary man and his activities outside the aviation realm. The years before his arrival in Paris and those after he built his last airplane are condensed in only two chapters.The tale of Santos-Dumont's endeavors in Paris in the early 20th century is thrilling and admirably recounted by Paul Hoffman, but my thirst for learning more about Santos-Dumont's life was far from quenched."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Wings of Madness\\" good review","review":"Alberto Santos-Dumont was a great man with good ideas.

One of us CANNOT open them without pulling the knob off of the stove, the other needs to stop cooking and concentrate on the proper amount of force to apply in order to open them.Overall, these knob covers are very good at covering knobs, and preventing little fingers from turning them, but they are not very good at letting you use the knob in a manner that will permit cooking.Take a little more time and look for the larger, easier to open Safety 1st knob covers (with a thumb-sized push-pad)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"I cannot for the life of me even open these covers.

But overall, he played a Saint. This movie he doesn't. He's a bit older in it and so is Peter Graves. But the movie is well worth seeing.

The premise--forgotten descendants of lost empires still clinging to shreds of their heritage in distant and remote lands--was enough to make any adventurous reader salivate. But the payoff was disappointing. Mr. Orizio's characters are two-dimensional and his style rambling. We learn very little about these real people; not enough to learn to care about them very much. This ought to be riveting stuff, but the literary equivalents of archeological relics glitter only rarely. Despite solid historical information, all of it news to me, I came away feeling I'd been on a tour bus that never stopped long enough to see much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genetic Heritage","review":"When dreams of empires get displaced they leave behind buildings and monuments that become destroyed or just wither away. But they also leave behind a genetic trail: the descendends of conquerors and dreamers who the former mother country forgot or never acknowledged in the first place,This excellent book visits six of those lost white tribes. Their history is sometimes bizarre (Confederates in Brazil), sad (Poles in Haiti) or just a tale out of a time gone by since centurys (Dutch in Sri Lanka). The six storys vary in their mixture of the author's account of his search for and visit with the lost tribes and the history of those people. The quality of the information is somewhat uneven. One sad impression is universal in all the six tales: the tribes discribed are not only forgotten, but will very soon cease to exist.However this still is a very interesting, fascinatig to read book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fair Account of Colonists Decendents","review":"The book gives a fair account of the decendents of European colonists in remote corners of the world.

It has been required reading in the senior seminar class I teach, one that requires students to demonstrate core competencies in critical thinking and analysis and oral and written expression using a cultural conceptual framework. The book was used for background and as a reference; however, students found it less than engaging, principally due to its comprehensive nature and historical detail. It is my opinion, that while the authors/editor have targeted a broad general audience, this work seems most suitable for the more sophisticated reader and one who has more than a casual interest in China.

Something that traditional music teachers delight in. Even my beloved Mom, with her BA in Music, gave this to all her piano students, including me. That is why I wrote on the front \\"In case of fire, throw in\\". I wrote that on the front of a couple of other \\"technique\\" and \\"warm-up\\" exercise books as well.

If you can get through this book and you can read music, I'm a firm believer that you will be able to play most anything that you wish to...The drills contained in this book can knock 5-10 years off of taking piano lessons etc. There are generally two aspects of piano playing, reading music and technical ability and dexterity... This book can help elevate your technical ability and dexterity and confidence very effectively in a relatively short period of time with focused effort... It's a great book for the practicing technical pianist!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A big helper!","review":"I really like this book because of the exercises are set up in a way that get harder as your ability develops.

As a serious pianist, I practiced Hanon for about an hour a day hoping to strengthen my technique. During this time I noticed an increase in independency and dexterity, as promised. However, after learning the entire volume, I found it very inefficient to practice the entire book through. I recommed that pianists only use the first section for musclar relaxation and practice only the later examples daily. One may also find that at a point it is more rewarding, technically and musically, to study Chopin, Liszt, or other etudes instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A serious warning must be heeded before reading this book!","review":"A serious warning must be heeded before reading this book! The reader must be sure (this is vital, no joking around here) to empy his or her bladder before reading this book. While it's true that there are a great number of people who don't enjoy this type of humor (fools, all of them!), I am confident that they wouldn't buy the book, leaving copies for the survivalists, like us. Won't we be laughing when they're being eaten!Read the other reviews for an actual book review.

I didn't purchase it from Amazon but bought it in a bookstore and am reviewing it on here. A must have, amazing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could've been better.","review":"This is a well written, serious book. Max really compels someone to doubt the accepted fact that zombies are a physical improbability. The only reason this didn't get the 5th star is the inconsistency in describing zombie's. For example Max stated that only one in four zombies are able to use a ladder yet in general rules of escape over water he tells people to watch they're anchor line, if very few zombies are able to climb a ladder wouldn't none be able to climb an anchor?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny book","review":"This book has a lot of dry humor that I think is great.

The writing is so witty and detailed. I wonder how long it took Max Brooks to write this book. It's a very quick read (I read it in four days). The only change I would recommend is to add more \\"historical accounts\\" of zombie occurrences at the end. Those were great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Common sense, but presented with style.","review":"I was given this book as a gift by a friend who knew my love of the zombie genre in film and writing. The book is well written and funny, as I should expect considering the author's father, but being a 'zombie nerd' I found it....uninformative? My fascination with the subject has led me to most of the conclusions he has come to. In fact, I think my 'Zombie Apocalypse' plan is superior! Funny book, but you would have come to the same conclusions were you to live for the first few days of the coming of the zombie hordes! Or better ones!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fact-filled advice for surviving the coming outbreak!","review":"After reading this guide, it makes one wonder whether the spate of new zombie movies is a coincidence or the Government's way of preparing the population for the coming Class 4 outbreak.

The actual survival portion was good but the best part, in my opinion, was the section on real life zombie encounters throughout history."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little TOO deadpan for it's own good.","review":"I wanted to love this book... I really did. As a fanatic devotee of all things zombie related, this seemed like a slam dunk. The problem is that the book is written so dryly, that the deadpan humor that should be inherent in a title such as this is absent. Even more bothersome, is the repetition in the topics. That is : here's what to do on 10 different types of terrain when you're fleeing from zombies. Now here's what to do on those same types of terrain if you are hunting zombies. And again, same terrain, if you are establishing a stronghold. We get it... swamps suck.Is it a lousy read? No, not at all. I just feel it could have been so much more with a little more black humor and a little less repitition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of a waste of money....","review":"I must say, I felt kind of ripped off after buying this book. Thought it would be a bit more satirical, but it was very repetitive. Seeing as It was more \\"informative\\" I would have expected little things like no contradictions in the text (Fire example: Build A fire to scare away the zombies; earlier- zombies do not notice fire.) I dunno... Good conversational piece?"},{"rating":"1","title":"ZGirl","review":"This book is mean to all zombies. I have two zombies living with me right now. They are totally harmless.

This book is good if you believe that zombies feel the need to hurt people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"I couldn't make it through this book -- it was BORING.

The information given might as well have been in bullet points. The little fictional background given is mildly entertaining at best, and dreadfully boring most of the time.Much of the \\"advice\\" is either irrelevant to any zombie fan, not amusing, or just plain silly.I was really hoping to enjoy at least one chapter of this \\"guide\\", but unfortunately I did not. Just finishing it, and it is not a long book by any means, was a challenge.If you were thinking about picking this up, pick up 'Zombie Haiku' instead, it is not only funny, witty, aesthetically pleasing, and creative, but much more worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but lacks certain information.","review":"I found most parts of the book enlightening, and am glad that I read it. However, it still makes me wonder about what there could be faced should a different kind of zombie come about. Say the 'virus' mutated, and allowed for faster and semi-intelligent zombies. Although much of the book could remain unchanged, there would still need to be some tinkering too plans should this arise."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay","review":"I bought this after reading world war Z which is the sequel to this book .

It's written as a straight survival guide, complete with campy pen and ink drawings illustrating such vital points as keeping your hair cut short and the importance of physical fitness.What surprised me was how *good* the advice was! If there were a zombie invasion, you could actually use this thing. Let me put my review in context. I live on a semi-remote parcel in South-Central Alaska. I'm off grid, and I've learned about survival the hard way. Much of the advice from Brooks rings true to my experience (though I have not encountered the undead yet). Brooks even knows a thing or two about firearms, which isn't what I would expect from such a dazzling urbanite. He also offers sound advice regarding the need for clean water, food, and good off-road transportation.Anyway, thanks to Brooks, I'm ready! Bring on the hordes of undead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Zombie Survival, Seriously","review":"Most books are funny because they don't take themselves too seriously. What makes this book funny is that it does take itself too seriously. It doesn't actually tell many jokes, (the few that are in there are very subtle) rather it takes a completely off the wall topic and tells you all about it with a completely straight face.You'll be surprised with all of the information you'll know about zombies afterwards.

Mr. Brooks provides a historical perspective over the millenniums of documented Zombie attacks and what to do and more important not to do when the real judgment day occurs as the dead rise to increase their ranks. Filled with tips on combat (if a choice flight rather than fight), key supplies (two pairs of socks), and how not to lose loved ones to a Zombie. Readers will find this an amusing satire on survival, horror movies and books, and George Romero as obviously Max squared have insider information that a zombie traitor must have leaked, but the humor holds up better by reading small bites over time.Harriet Klausner"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hubby can't put it down!","review":"My husband and I love everything about zombies so, naturally, I decided this was a good xmas gift and I was right!

This item is great even if you don't believe in some kind of biological outbreak. It has great survival skills in it in case anything were to happen. There are very detailed descriptions on what you need and why you need it. It even goes into telling you items that you may think would be a good idea to have may not be the best.

So, I thought I'd check out the Zombie Survival Guide as a fun goof. What I really liked about this book was how serious the writer takes surviving the Zombies. He is so immersed in the Zombie culture that as I read it, I started thinking more and more that these living dead creatures must be real. Although I guess it is considered humor, I found it fascinating and kind of chilling. I just couldn't put it down and in a weird sort of way feel more prepared for life's unknown eventualities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dry and Hilarious","review":"There are some jokes that just get funnier the longer you draw them out, and this book is a perfect example of this. It's not the kind of book you sit down and read in one sitting. It's better to just carry it around to consult when you need a laugh - or when the zombies are after you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satire to the nth degree","review":"The word parody is thrown around alot with this book but I tend to look on it more as a satire that sits way to close to the truth. The truth being the survivalist movement. I found it to be more of a satire of the survivalists and it rings very true after the Y2K hullaballoo. The zombies are thrown in just to have something to survive. This is a funny book but don't expect huge belly laughs. Truth be told, when the zombies do rise, this book may prove valuable.

This book captures those conversations perfectly and elaborates them with real imagination and with an unnerving touch of reality. Again, as many reviewers note, you start reading it for fun, but as you let yourself get immersed in the ideas, and you relive your own musings on the theme, you find yourself starting to seriously consider your options in the light of this comprehensive survival guide. It is funny in places, no doubt, but it is also a great addition to the Zombie genre and a new take on an old theme. Well written, great little illustrations and well thought out ideas make for an enjoyable read. Worth a go.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny yet dark, some parts boring but overall pretty good.","review":"I'm near the end of this book. Overall I liked it. Not in my Top 5 but a good read if you like Zombies and/or Max Brooks. Some parts are very funny, but most of the book reads like an actual military manual, which is funny when the Zombie element is added. Sort of like if you were watching a cooking show on TV showing you how to cook roadkill but taking it totally seriously, it would still be strange and humorous. Also a lot of this book is standard survival guide stuff, which could actually come in handy if there was a nasty solar storm that caused a long power outage, or a big flood that wiped out a lot of local resources and you had to face starvation and bandits until FEMA finally came through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Book","review":"I got this book as a fun, funny Christmas gift and it was a hit.

This book takes something that is fun, interesting, scary, funny, and explains everything about it. Isn't that what makes it fun, the fact that it's unknown? Lets see if I can make a good comparison. Take sex, then explain everything that could possibly happen and how to deal with it in a really boring guide book. Now you have...well...sex, but it's just not as much fun anymore.

Every possible connection with zombies is analyzed with exhaustive and painstaking detail. I was absolutely fascinated by the descriptions and in particular the uprisings in history section of the book. The book is totally engrossing and really gets you in the author's frame of mind. You can tell that this is something close to his heart or else he wouldn't have spent so much time on it. I know zombies don't REALLY exist, but after reading this you won't be so sure anymore. But as the book says, you better be prepared just in case they do, and this is the best way to get ready! Buy it, read it, know it, live it! Uh oh, they're coming!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good parody of a survival book. It feels real.","review":"This book is really good. It almost makes you want to drop whatever you're doing and beging preparing yourself for when the zombies come.But it also feels so serious. In some parts it gets kind of boring. Not enough for me to drop it, but still. It takes itself seriously enough to give detailed information about nearly anything related on zombie anatomy an behavior. Also every option you may have to survive a zombie outbreak is also thoroughly explained, with many possible outcomes.The description of recorded zombie outbreaks through history is very, very cool.But from a literary point of view, this is a really outstanding book. It doesn't matter how big of a parody this is, it never drops the straight face. It will always tell you the zombies are coming and what your best chances of surviving are. It will never crack a joke nor break the fourth wall. Not even in the acknowledgements.For Mr. Brooks, as this books is concerned, the zombies ARE COMING."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"I am not even a reader (at all), but once I picked this book up I couldn't set it down. I read more than half of it in one night, very informative as well, the information doesn't just apply to Zombie survival, but survival in general as well, which could be detrimental to you. The actual physical quality of the book itself is pretty legitimate as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Book","review":"This book is well-written and much more interesting than I would have originally thought. Brooks has a way of bringing you into the reality of a zombie apocalypse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good summer beach reading for a guy","review":"The rating is 4 instead of 5 only because it is meant to be silly comedy.The book was meant to be humoristic, male, recreational reading. Age range appropriate for males from 14 to 50.I have great sensibilities, am well educated, and have a well-developed sense of homor.I loved the book, thought it was very complete, too long, and enjoyable from beginning to end. One can read part, put it down and come back 3 months to a year later then pick it back up and continue.

It IS fun and very informative, great info for people who do not ever consider themselves survivalists but one day may appreciate that \\"blades don't need reloading\\". You will start to matter of factly think Zombies are real as you go through this book. If you want a even creepier angle to read this from, try imagining your closest slum without food for a month on the march and headed for you. Get a copy for your \\"out there\\" friends and your \\"uptight\\" friends as well, odds are they will have a fun read also.

Most of the book is filled with dry content like \\"Chainsaw- A heavy weapon effective at cutting through attacking zombies, but limited by it's range and weight.\\" Following this would be an entry of another item with the same sort of superficial description. The illustrations are meant to be humorous, and admittedly some are, but most aren't worth paying attention to. There's limited variation in the style of humor employed throughout the book, so punchlines quickly become a chore to get through.If I wanted to introduce my friends to the zombie genre, this definitely would not be the book. It in no way made the zombie world come alive in any sort of imaginative way. Shame on you Max Brooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Seriously.

Wow. My ribs hurt.","review":"I'm going to go ahead and give away the only mildly amusing thing in the 247 unfunny pages of this book. It takes itself seriously. It's an *actual* guide to zombie survival. There you go. Personally, that made me dryly chuckle for the first 5 pages. After that, it got annoying really, really fast. If you liked this novel, don't forget to pick up Max Brooks' other fantastic offerings:- The Unicorn Husbandry Guide- Trapping Leprechaun's for fun and profit- Pixies vs Fairies; which side to take in the coming Global confrontationThis book wasn't just bad, it was violently suckworthy. Whenever I see the name Max Brooks again, I'll be reminded of the old adage that talent skips a generation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak, boring, and unfunny","review":"As a fan of zombie movies, I could not believe how badly Max Brooks botched the chance to write a funny book. This book is dry, dull, and drones endlessly on about boring details when it could have been the next Shawn of the Dead. Worse, as other reviewers have made clear, it doesn't even succeed as a serious book - the basic facts are poorly researched and sometimes self-contradictory, and it certainly isn't scary.Writing a book with this title is a golden opportunity to be hilariously tongue-in-cheek. Either Max Brooks decided to operate under the delusion that zombies are a real threat that requires actual preparation, or his tongue was so deeply embedded in his cheek that his laugh lines are completely indecipherable.If you are attacked by a zombie, give him this book to read. It will bore him to death."},{"rating":"1","title":"An odd little book","review":"\\"The Zombie Survival Guide\\" is quite an oddity. Not really funny enough to really be a successful parody and not serious enough (because, let's face it, the odds of an actual zombie attack are essentially nil) to be of any use. The book's main draw is that you can see Max Brooks' working out the material he'd put to vastly better use in his living-dead epic \\"World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War.\\" So, I'd only recommend this to major fans of \\"World War Z.\\" If you haven't read \\"World War Z,\\" then you absolutely should read it before even considering \\"The Zombie Survival Guide.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't deliver.","review":"I lent this book to my sister and it didn't work for @#$@#.

The zombies are coming!","review":"Off of a whim a friend decided to pick up the Zombie Survival Guide as a present for me. I'd previously read a few pages and enjoyed it. Needless to say, I now love it. The guide is incredibly detailed with the survival methods listed. You'd swear you were reading a book for surviving in the wild really. Everything from avoiding infection to finding shelter to surviving in a zombie world! The best part is some of the humor within the guide. Occasionally, you'll run into a particular scenario where the author will throw a bit of humor into the scenario or have a picture that can crack you up. Still, Max Brooks has brought a very serious issue to the forefront of my mind. In short, get your guide, sharpen your machete and prep for the apocalypse! You can be too prepared!"},{"rating":"2","title":"zombiapocalypse","review":"Fun read. Quick and easy. The survival guide portion of the book gets a bit tedious but i understand the authors intentions. I have seen these guides in various forms in my local subversive book stores, and i can happily say i will never have to read one. The book takes off in the last chapters with the case studies. Apparently this is where WWZ starts? Whatever, grab it if your fascinated by the prospect of a zombie apocalypse."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read","review":"If you're into the zombie genre, I recommend this book. Weapons, zombie extermination, and defenses are some of the subjects covered in this book.

My eleven year old son liked this book too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Infantile","review":"This book was recommended to me as I enjoy most zombie films. I was grossly disappointed. The reading level is grade-school, the material is repetitious, graphics provide further filler material, and the information provided is no more incisive than watching any zombie movie - even a bad \\"B movie\\" at that!The tone of the book is not humorous, grotesque, frightening, clever, dramatic, serious, creepy or any other adjectives except... boring and bland. Also, The author attempts to supply first-hand, historical accounts of zombie attacks, but the wording of the quoted passages is anachronistic and still within the writer's \\"voice.\\"In sum, I learned nothing from this \\"survival guide\\" and I was not entertained in the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"not much of a survival guide","review":"ok, i was pretty disappointed with this \\"survival guide\\". especially compared to the amazing \\"world war z\\" book. the narrative style of the guide is very dry and boring, the illustrations are horrible (just should have been left out), and most of the content is repetitive (aim for the head/brain, aim for the head/brain, aim for the head/brain). the book had little humor to it (which would have made it more interesting) and very little in the way of usable survival information (you could get more useful information in a basic camping/outdoors book). i know the author is trying to explain how to survive fictional creatures, but it could have been better mixed in with real-world information to make it more believable.it's an interesting companion to WWZ but very disappointing compared to that book. i recommend that one well over this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even slightly funny","review":"I read this having heard that it was a humorous satire. This reads like a navy SEAL writing about how to survive armageddon except insert \\"zombie\\" for \\"arab\\", \\"liberal\\", etc. Not a laugh to be had and frankly something only a zombie fanatic or crazed militia member could even get through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down","review":"Well, I'm not surprised the majority of the people gave this 4 and 5 star ratings. The majority of Americans are just plain dumb. This book is like the rantings of a prepubescent kid who just saw his first zombie movie, and feels it's his duty to \\"educate\\" the masses.Pretty much like the other 1 star reviewers have said...boring, not funny, not entertaining, not enough detail. I stopped reading when it got to underwater zombie fighting, which of all things, he felt it deserved 10 pages to explain.Bottom line: If you can think for yourself, take an hour and jot down a few ideas of what you would do in a zombie apocalypse (or any other epidemic) and you would have just saved yourself 10 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not humorous at all.","review":"I can't remember laughing once reading this book. It is a decent horror book and the stories in the back are an okay read, but the bulk of the book is a waste of time. I hope that people don't take the book serious. In one chapter he describes that cooking and excercising should be done in the basement only to later tell you to hide upstairs and chop up the stairs so zombies can't get you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetition over and over again","review":"Of course it is a useless book but i was hoping that it would be more entertaining!

Basically saying, this book literally could've been a list of do's and don'ts regarding a zombie attack instead of ~200pgs. I was expecting more based on the reviews, a lot more.He spends a lot of time analyzing dumb weapons you shouldn't use rather than playing with it more. I could see where he was trying to be funny or satirical but he only hit the mark with me a couple times. The other times I was just rolling my eyes.

Unfortunately, my high hopes were dashed. Although the dead pan delivery is amusing at times, the book's quite boring. And even more irritating, after I bought the book, I found an excellent site where just about everything Brooks writes is there and for free ([...]). From home defence to choice of weapons, it's all there. Finally, this is a book for Americans, with their [..] and gun stores and huge outdoors. Not for the majority of humanity who live in smaller crowded countries with far stricter gun laws and less of the great outdoors to escape to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent...","review":"Listen...I'm not a huge horror fiction fan, but this was very well done...Just like a proper survival manual, FUNNY!

Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative, well written, funny","review":"Max Brooks has created a survival guide that can answer nearly any question you may have about how to survive a zombie apocalypse. Thing I never would have considered were covered in detail, and were surprisingly funny. A great weekend read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"This is a witty, well-written book that appeals to people like myself who grew up fascinated with the classic zombie movies by Romero and Fulchi. As crazy as it sounds, I have played out many of the scenarios from this book in my mind, and it is written with a serious enough tone that it could almost be mistaken for reality. Although this is classified as a comedy, most of the humor is derived from inside jokes such as indirect references to classic zombie movies and little-known zombie facts. I loved the appendix which detailed the zombie incidents throughout history, and would love to see some kind of a followup book from Max Brooks on the same subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"A valuable guide for the coming apocalypse","review":"This is a great book. Written in a straightforward, dry manner, it never breaks \\"character\\" and is all the better for it.

Heed its lessons well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My friends laugh, but when the Zombies come, they'll be sorry","review":"I loved this book, its exactly what a \\"survival guide\\" should be like.

It's an easy read, has lots of good tips, and I love the historical records section.One criticism: Brooks shows is New York city-dweller-ness in the weapons section.

Didn't give it 5 stars just because some notions about zombies that I personally like some other way like dealing with memory, physiology, etc. The \\"chronicles\\" in the last part of the \\"guide\\" are by themselves very good stories that could manage to really scare you.Most important; with this book you'll learn all the \\"do's\\" and \\"do not's\\", you'll learn to sense if something is happening, what to do if you're catch unprepared, how to defend yourself and your loved-ones, how to fight-back, how to hunt them, how to destroy them! Know your enemies and what them are capable of, what them really are, and ultimately how to remain alive.I assure you this: once you have finished, you'll pack your stuff, get your weapons ready, and by all means you'll escape... FAST, QUIETLY, FAR AWAY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amusing and makes you think.","review":"This book is a must have for any fan of the living dead horror genre. Max Brooks deftly weaves historical and scientific fact with zombie fiction into a convincing backdrop for this satirical look at worst case scenario survival.While The Zombie Survival Guide is not laugh out loud funny, it's dry humor is more apt to start the gears turning in your head. The funniest part of the book happens after the last page is turned. The reader is left with a compulsion to start researching the facts and historical accounts outlined in the book. (Incedentally, solanum is a real virus. Fortunately, it only affects potatoes though.)The Zombie Survival Guide is highly recommended for those who can appreciate dry cerebral humor. And in the off chance that the living dead do finally overun the Earth, the instructions described would be sound advise for survival."},{"rating":"2","title":"I better watch out.","review":"This book is a good source for anti-zombie warfare. I was interested on it both because of its topic and its author; Max Brooks is Mel Brook's son. I was expecting a book with open jokes and perhaps a parody, but was impressed when I saw how seriously the author dealt with the topic; it was almost convincing, actually. Aside from the smooth writing and interesting detailed information about defeating the undead, I was also quite pleased at how Mr. Brooks would every now and then, while explaining some feature about zombies, pinch us humans with sharp comments, as, for example, in the statement \\"Americans have a special relationship with handguns\\" (page 47). People wishing to create good zombie stories should consult this book; also, the \\"Recorded Attacks\\" add a touch of realism and perhaps some ideas for good plots. This book may not cause severe laughter, but its refined humor added to very properly divided chapters and good writing are sure worth the money and time."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Kill a Zombie","review":"When my friends introduced me to this book, I thought it must be a work of humor written to make light of the world we now live in. Instead, I've come to the conclusion that this is one of the few books that have survived the trials of history, written long before the zombies and their vampire overlords left the shadows and engulfed the globe.These pages include extensive information on zombies. The author covers the virus that consumes a human brain, kills the host's consciousness and (shortly after the body passes) re-animates it into a ghoul--they who are the children of Nzambi. It includes ways to survive, areas to avoid and how to defend against the living dead. It even includes ways to HUNT them, giving lengthy details all combined with a sense of humor that can only have preceded \\"The Rise\\".To all those who still live, don't pass up the chance to read this book. It may make all the difference between life... and my machete thru your skull."},{"rating":"1","title":"This books pretense is almost as big as it was dissapointing","review":"The book was amazingly lame, and boring.I feel ripped off. Infact I have been! Take a look at all the reviews here. They are mostly 5 stars, and written with the same manner, tone, and style. Then there are a group of reviews(real ones) which take the complete opposite view (the book is terrible). The amount of these reviews are around the average amount that an unimportant book like this would receive. Obviously the author has just been compensating for his own incompetence by adding fake reviews.In summary: DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"I just like this book.

I guess in a tongue in cheek kind of way. Yes I am into the zombie genre of fiction. Yes I have read World War Z. So why no 5 star rating like most of the others? Well the author doesn't know much about firearms for one thing. He doesn't know much about combat for another. And lastly he knows very little about survival. So in a tongue in cheek sort of way it is entertaining. If you are looking for a survival book check into SAS survival handbook or something of that nature. If you want an entertaining read. This can kind of give you that. But it is a very short book, the information contained is inaccurate and it comes off as a little silly. I couldn't give it 1 star because it does actually have some entertainment value.

It is frustrating going for a zombie's jugular, when he just keeps on coming. Now I know to aim for the head. That has been such helpful, my kill rate has gone through the roof. It is reassuring to know that a zombie's life span rarely exceeds three years, which is longer than I give the economy.

Fear not, many have checked his sources and found they are all ficticious. Well, with a father like Mel Brooks, what can you expect.Don't waste your money. See Night of the Living Dead instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knock, Knock... Who's There... Zombies","review":"Zombies make honey and others don't. This simple line yields more humor than the entire book. I expected that this would be hilarious because the concept is so ridiculous, but instead the author chooses to write a pseudo-factual book for actual survival. The problem: there are no zombies and we don't really need to prepare. It is weighed down by unimaginative explanations for the genesis and capabilities of zombies. Often, opportunities for creativity or humor are competely missed. Many, if not most questions of how one can avoid infection or conversion are simply answered as \\"You can't.\\" If you are looking for a survival guide, check out the SAS Survival Handbok. If you like zombies get Night of the Living Dead. Waste neither your time nor your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are looking for humor, avoid this!","review":"Jeez.From reading the reviews, and looking at the covers, I was expecting a good laugh or two out of this book, and perhaps some chuckles about bad zombie plots.Be Warned! This dude is SERIOUS! This book is written AS IF zombies were real, and were ACTUALLY ATTACKING people. I couldn't believe it.. so I kept reading and paging through it.. and nowhere do you see the tongue-in-cheek!Its not funny, mildly amusing in a few places, and that's about it. Print off a copy of the back cover, and save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, Funny, and Informative","review":"The author has a very strong tone, stating zombie facts as if they were real, or are they?!The book sometimes reads like a Mad Magazine, but there are some portions of the book that are fact based and you do not need an undead foe to use some of the survival tips. For example, when you get word of some calamity about to occur, fill your bathtubs with water just in case water pipes break. Eat your perishables first, and leave food items in cans last because these have a longer shelf life.Includes true accounts of zombie attacks!I'm contemplating on reading World War Z next. Hopefully they will make a movie out of Max Brooks' book series.

It is like reading one of those \\"pocket MBA\\" books, which just tells you terms and procedures. Don't expect to read this book and be able to transact \\"foreclosed and bargain homes\\". It is far from that! For instance, the chapters on how to identify and find a \\"bargain\\" home comes down to this: look it up at a bank, MLS, or internet. Heck! I could have told you that for free! Given that that is the most important step, I was really disappointed with this book. Don't waste your money...If you want to buy an overview or basics book on home buying I sugget the \\"Unofficial Guide to Buying a Home\\" which is much more detailed and straightforward about buying a home.

It may be just me, or I may have just made a bad purchase, but I'm so sick of DJs choosing too many tracks with too many vocals for their mixes. Avoid the diva thing and stick to the music. On a more positive note, the mixing is good (enough raw spots to make it sound legit) and several tracks toward the middle are great.

Imagine running the car, in a light rain, from the safety of a porch, and through some very shallow puddles.If you have a child who is not an RC buff, then the novelty might wear off quickly....say even before the batteries run down.

As a cast member of a recent production of this show I can say the music is not only challenging, but beutifully composed with a music theory that relates closely to the central themes of the play. This recording is very well done and includes songs that are no longer used in the production (Hard to be a Prince, Cherry Street Cafe, and Yankee Boy). I firmly believe this show would be a great success on Broadway with it's new script revisions and a strong cast."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best scores ever written by Strouse!!!!!!","review":"I can\`t understand that anyone could not like this wonderful and most beautiful score.

When I saw that T. Davis Bunn was associated with her writings, I was a little skeptical of how well this book would be written.This is my first experience with T. Davis Bunn, and I am very satisfied. This book particularly touched me with characters who were refraining from the easy entrapment of bitterness and unforgiveness. Grandma, with who she thought was the love of her life, displayed emotions so close to what I felt with \\"my first love\\". Subsequently, she showed how important it was to give forgiveness to someone who had abandoned and hurt her so much.I recommend this book to anyone who has ever been hurt in relationships where there was abandonment or a lack of committment.I plan to read more of T.

The book is replete with typos and poor grammar. I understand wanting Daly's \\"voice\\" to come through in the writing, but at times, the folksy, down home, grammatically incorrect language is overbaked. I came away not liking John Daly the person. The book is full of self-pity and Daly seems to revel in his faults. I was very disappointed and I wouldn't recommend buying this book.

It is a cautionary tale about the frequently deadly synergy of fame, wealth and untreated alcoholism. The same story has been told many times and, almost always, with considerably more style and effect than this rambling and barely literate effort.I think that what I find most depressing and discouraging about this book is that it brings to mind stories that might have been penned by other hugely gifted talents like Belushi, Garcia or Bias if only they had had a little more time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Johnny","review":"Yet another fallen star collecting coin with a sob-story tell-some (not tell-all) book.

I also have followed him on tour and I have watched the Planet Daly program on the golf channel. This book is written in first person as told by J.D. himself. I personally could not put it down. The book describes his life story from beginning to present. I really felt like he was talking to me as I was reading the book. I give him a lot of credit for getting involved with this project. It is easy to see that he had alot of involvement with this book. His own personality really is displayed by the words written. I am surprised that he can remember all of what happened.

However Crystalis proves that a great story, lots of different types of enemies and interesting characters can stand up against flashy graphics any day.I've had this game over two months and still love it. It starts out easy and its an easy game to pick up and play. After a few minutes of play you'll be hooked. It only has a few voice samples (when you find a new sword) but the music is great for a Game Boy Color game. I highly suggest buying this game as well as Warlocked (see Warlocked for GBC). They will offer many, MANY hours of fun! Promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible rip off of Zelda","review":"This game cand not be compaired to Zelda. Just can't, and you know why. Because this is nothing of the a third rate game with dum monsters and no skill once or ever. Play The first Zelda game. Its way more easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the original","review":"This game was one of my all-time favorite games for the old Nintendo Entertainment system, so I was very happy to hear that NST was remaking the game for the Game Boy color. However, this version of the game spoils pretty much everything that was good about the original. The game holds your hand every step of the way. This new \\"feature\\" might be great for your average 5 year old, but it greatly tones down the difficulty and removes all sense of freedom and exploration. Also, the great music from the original has been removed and replaced with garbage. If you want to play a good version of Crystalis, play the NES version. If you want a good adventure game for your Game Boy, buy Zelda. As it is, this version of the game is a disappointment, so I can't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"Do not waste your time!

It's chock full of beautiful, inspirational short-stories of various real-life miracles that occurred during the Christmas Season.Each of the stories is relatively short, so this is one of those books that you can read a little at a time - perfect for those who don't have a lot of reading time. I also liked that \\"Christmas Miracles\\" includes miracles that happened to people of all different faiths & spiritual movements.Overall, I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is inspired by miracles - but make sure you have a box of tissues handy (smile)..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Levant is One of the Best Gerschwin Interpreters","review":"I first knew Oscar Levant as a film star. Never the lead, but a fabulous sidekick for many of the leading men of the era. He always took a turn at the piano in his films. When a movie features that kind of thing, it's usually a piece of fakery. I noticed, though, that Levant was actually doing his own piano playing.This led me to start looking into his career as a pianist. Turns out he's an incredibly good interpreter of Gerschwin tunes (one of my favorite composers).Two reasons I don't give this a five star rating: not all the recordings are ones I'd have chosen for myself and I wonder if they could have done better with the digitizing of the music. Nevertheless, this is an excellent addition to a Gerschwin collection. Unfortunately, it's also just about the only Levant music CD available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Levant had better recordings!!!!","review":"The ultimite recording of Rhapsody in Blue was a recording Paul Whiteman did with Oscar Levant for Columbia in the early 40's. That recording was in Mono and has long been unavailible appearing only once on LP. On the recording for sale here, the orchestra cannot keep pace with Levant! It's sad.Levant was the most underrated romantic pianist of the 20th century. Listen to some of his other recordings! I recommend this recording because the Whitman / Levant recordings are not around. Listen to the little bits of music in the movie Rhapsody in Blue. Big difference from what you hear here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This is an excellent cd.

The world is a much sadder place without this wonderful talent. Too bad the producers of this recording buried him with poor sound quality.

I put it on completely dry skin but within less than an hour of use, the adhesive wasn't sticking. Apparently, the body's natural oils and sweat makes this item not work the way it's supposed to. It's a bit of a gooey mess as well. You have to turn the roll-on ball with your finger to get it to move because it sticks to the opening of the bottle. Therefore, you get the sticky goo all over your fingers. Luckily, it washes off easily with water. Plus as I said before, it washes off easily with your sweat and natural body oils. So unless you have dry skin all day, this won't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Stays Body Adhesive is Great!","review":"Have been using this product off and on for years and have recommended it to others.

They were falling down before and were just a pain. Now, I don't have that problem anymore. The adhesive isn't so strong that it overly clings to the skin. A little bit of water is all it takes to loosen it's hold at the end of the day, and to take those instruments of torture (my name for the stockings I have to wear, not the adhesive) off. I did use it in another way to help keep one of my tanks in place, I don't know if I applied it wrong, but it didn't seem to work as well in that type of an application. Works great for the stockings though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Stays!","review":"This really works. For years I had tried many things to keep the right side strap of my bra from slipping.

Then, I forgot about it.Three weeks ago I got a total knee replacement. I have to wear \\"compression hose\\" from the toes to the butt. They don't stay up, and are a real pain. Last week, I noticed the \\"It Stays!\\" that had been sitting on the shelf for twenty years. I assumed that it would be all dried out, but, no, it was still wet. I used some, and it still works great!! It keeps my compression hose up, but they peel off without a great deal of pain, and both my leg and the hose clean off easily with water.If you are having trouble with your hosiery staying up, then give this a try.Mine cost about $6.79 in the mid-eighties, so it hasn't even gone up in price a great deal over the last twenty-five years."},{"rating":"1","title":"unhappy with results","review":"It does stay somewhat won't hold a size five tear drop breast form, can,t go braless.shipping was almost the cost of the breast forms"},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"I used It Stays for a dance show I was in on my costume.

I answer with a \\"Not particularly\\" but his shirt is already over his head like this was an episode of girls gone wild. My eyes are immediately drawn to a big fake nipple, glued on like he was the 3 breasted woman from Total Recall. It's hanging by his chest hairs, as it has already removed itself from his body. So I grab it off, taking his 3 chesthairs with it. I apparently didn't do this too gently, and he howled. I told him it's not a 3rd nipple if he elmers glued it to his chest, to which he disagreed.

It doesn't work for that purpose. It's not the companies fault,they never state that it will adhere breast forms.

Your sweat washes it away and your boobies will fall to the floor!(oops) Trust me, you will sweat with silicone against your body. Be aware of products that amazon puts together, giving you the impression that you will need this extra item. It's just a ploy to sell you something you don't really need.(I've come across this scam with them before.

The descriptions of functions are uneven and ambiguous, and full of questionable examples. Several of the descriptions of the functions are nothing more than assemblages of quotes and thin paraphrasings from Jung and other authors, strung together into long paragraphs that add up to nothing. The author also seems to have emotional biases toward and away from some types.One good thing about the book is that it quotes extensively from Jung's Psychological Types, and those quotes do make sense.

It is also downright annoying to see \\"Inebhedj\\" for \\"Memphis\\" and \\"Waset\\" for \\"Thebes.\\" These hypothetical phonetic reconstructions of toponyms serve no purpose except, I suppose, to demonstrate that the author has some nodding acquaintance with ancient Egyptian.

Some will complain that The Last Day isn't a literary \\"belle lettres,\\" but of the thrillers I have read, it is a page turner and one of the first and few to show significant innovation in theme, plot, and characterization (my sincere thanks to the author for NOT adding to the heap of alien intrusion, crazed pick-axe killers, CIA, Big Government Special Ops.,ad naseum conspiracy drivals still being passed off and published as thrillers.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"Kleier cleverly uses Scripture and history to knit a tale that you begin to believe is true!

It's quite a thick book but it reads very quickly; very fast moving. I should also admit that I was quite unable to put it down once I started it, something I've not fallen prey to for many a year. Without question, this is a thumping good read and one I'll recommend highly to all acquaintances.

Just how much have today's organized religions strayed from the original message? When you consider the wealth and authoritativeness of today's religious leadersit's difficult to recognize much of the poor humble carpenter of Nazareth in any of them. This novel asks some disturbing questions about organized religion that few modern day religions would feel comfortable in answering honestly. A thrilling mystery novel for working toward a better new millennium"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting and different","review":"By just about every measure, this is a fine book that I found exceptionally well written and thoroughly enjoyable. My only complaint about it concerns some of the more controversial elements it introduces. I didn't see the need to \\"stir the waters\\" to the extent this author has, but I admire the risks he takes in doing so, and the arguments that are presented here bear sober consideration. What I enjoyed most was the drama, which was high caliber, intelligent, and fast moving throughout. The story is very well told, and the tension at times is absolutely wrenching. Who--or what--this messiah really is, and how this involved (and involving) story resolves itself, makes for fascinating, absorbing reading. Warning: this book will upset religious conservatives!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boorish Nonsense","review":"This reads like a screed from a New Age born again simpleton. No doubt Christianity needs a comeuppance, but the alternative here is idiocy. I didn't finish the thing because it was completely vapid and banal. Organized religion deserves a horse whipping for its arrogance and this author writes with a wet noodle. Its got to be the worst novel published in years and one of the most overinflated exercises in bad writing, ignorance, and self-hype ever. I wouldn't look for that movie version of this classic until the next millenium."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real rush","review":"This is a well put together story. From page one you have no idea where the plot is going, only that it's hurtling on the edge of a cliff and all you can do is hold on for dear life. It takes you all over the world through an emotional Waring blender to a great climax, wrapping it up in an unexpected way, back where it all started. I enjoyed the relationship between the main character Jon Feldman and Hunter, his big, obnoxious guy, cameraman. One of my favorite lines in the whole book is when Cissy, Hunter's on-again-off-again girlfriend, describes his philandering ways. She warns another woman \\"You'll have to excuse Hunter's retarded social graces--he spent his formative years in a home for unwed fathers and simply doesn't know any better.\\" Fun reading.

The women were all airheads looking to some pretty stupid men for guidance. Why couldn't the female savior at least have acted like she had a brain. I could buy the evil cardinals' cabal, but that confederacy of cartoon dunces just ended-up lame. There are too many long speeches, too many dumb parables, and too many pages where nothing happens. It finally limps to a conclusion that is a real dud. So many here have mentioned the bad writing that I won't mention it again, but I was shocked something like this was actually in hardcover briefly. It doesn't seem likely that even one of those vanity presses would put out gunk like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Shame","review":"A shame to see a great idea wasted because the author lacks the skill and imagination to bring it off.

Subtle, it's not. Intelligent, gripping, stimulating and very controversial is what it is. The central idea revolves around what might happen if a possible messiah (a female, she could be the real thing, or she might be a hoax or a megalomaniac, you are kept in soul-twisting suspense throughout) were to return and confront the world and all its squabbling religions. This becomes very intriguing because, naturally, each religion on this planet happens to think it's the one that's divinely inspired with God's word, and the forthcoming revelations from the new messiah are not at all what anyone expects. Shocking, thought-provoking, very funny, spooky and often very disquieting, this book may even offend you, but you can't stop reading it. And much of what it has to say rings so true and hits so hard, it will linger with you long after you finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I Have My Money Back?","review":"I will sure take hysterically positive reviews with a grain of salt in the future. This below average potboiler overflows with bad writing and dumb characters. The author forgot the story and ended up writing a long, boring anti-religion screed.

I didn't particularly like the \\"messiah's\\" message, and I thought the author was a bit hard on organized religion. Read strictly as a fictional thriller, it was very entertaining. The ending could have been more dynamic, but I have to say the book held my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwritten and Silly","review":"I guess some fundamentalists find this book hard to take. Well, it' not that easy for some of the rest of us either. Such a good idea wasted! The author forgets to tell a story and becomes preoccupied with his dislike of religion. After 200 pages, his diatribes get old. The story ends up going nowhere and slowly. I kept expecting it to get better but it just got sillier. This is pretty drab stuff. Not a pleasant reading experience at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just What the World Wants to Hear","review":"The Last Day basically summarizes the New Age movement in America today. It's message tolerance for all religions is exactly what the world wants to hear. But folks, the fact is, their is only one way to salvation: Jesus Christ. We have all fallen short of the glory of God, and their's not a thing we can do to measure up. It is only through God's grace that we can be saved. And that is what the world can't bear to hear.

Robert Ewbank author \\"John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah!","review":"This book was bad. Not only was the plot predictable and the characters flat and stereotypical but the writing was full of cliches and unrealistic dialogue. I read the entire thing and feel like I wasted a lot of time. I liked the idea of the book and some of the messages of the \\"Messiah\\" as well as thinking about what I would really believe if the Messiah did come again during my lifetime, however at times I cringed at the descriptions of the characters and the things they said. The ending was completely lame and unbelievable. I didn't like or empathize with any of the characters and didn't really care what happened to them.My advice: ignore the hype and don't waste your time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and Silly","review":"This was not one of the better plotted thrillers I've read and it's terribly wordy. The author's sparse knowledge of the Middle East was distracting and he seemed overwhelmed by his subject at times. The critical approach toward the Church was refreshing, but it went on far too long and lacked research. The weakness of characters was particularly hard to take. I found myself quickly skimming pages, especially during a lot of the silly sermons delivered by Jeza (she is the worst part of the book). The media frenzy surrounding the millenium was interesting, but could have been better written. The ending was a real fizzle and by the time I finally reached it, it was clear that little could be expected. In fact, the target readers of this book appear to be those with small expectations. It does have offbeat humor, but it was where the writer attempted to be profound that the novel was really funny. Some of the dialog was so bad it had to be a joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking Faith on a Roller Coaster Ride","review":"Wow! If you like roller coasters, try the mystical version. It's all right here in this book. How would we really react if a \\"Messiah\\" appeared tomorrow? Watching the characters react was a great opportunity to study my own reactions. Incredulity fades into hope. Doubt inches in to be replaced by despair and renewed faith. Wow! A very, very impressive first novel. It echoes in the mind long after the last page is turned. Thanks, Glenn."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 10-plus! Humongously entertaining....","review":"One heck of a novel. The best I've read in many a moon. I've already got a line on who would be a mesmerizing Jeza in the movie version - Kate Winslet. She would be simply smashing. C'mon, bestseller lists out there! Why isn't this great book on any of them?? Thanks, Mr. Kleier for a terrific novel. The only thing that could top it would be a sequel (hint, hint! ;))"},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly","review":"This is the dumbest book I've read in years. The plot is based on an interesting concept, but the way the book is written makes for an unpleasant reading experience. It's simply crude, long, and boring. I'm no defender of the faith, but the bigotry toward Catholics was crass, ugly, and repulsive. The hamhanded writing, cardboard characters, and silly ideas were hardly worthy of the cheapest thriller. I suppose this was cranked-out for the millennium, but it will be forgotten a minute past midnight. For an intelligent novel on a similar theme, Robert Stone's Damascus Gate is challenging and thoughtful. Unlike Last Day, it will make you think about faith without playing on misinformed prejudice and nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Expect too Much","review":"It's been a while since I paid for a hardcover just because the story idea was hard for me to resist. I should have thought more about some of bad reviews that turn out to be so right. The idea of a female savior sounds good but this book drops the ball. A really stupid story and awful writting."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Gave Up","review":"After 200 pages of pseudointellectual pistol whipping, I quit reading. Kleier feel compelled to drive his point home-organized religion stinks- by beating you over the head with Jeza's incessant twaddle about Church misjustice. It wasn't long before I was fairly worn out and sick of Jeza. I would like some decent storytelling to ease the pain of the lectures. The point had been made clear, repeatedly, and there was a whole lot more book to go! No thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair but Unfair","review":"Seemed like an average thriller to me, distinguished by the author's personal vendetta against Catholics (which actually finds some support from reviewers). Otherwise, there's nothing special about this book from many other assembly line thrillers that have been ground-out by hacks to cash in on y2k fever. This one happens to play to the crowd with a popular prejudice. As to the anti-establishment rebel messiah, I preferred the original:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ponderous","review":"I think this novel is a dreadful, pretentious bore. I can live with the twenty cent theology lesson, but where was an editor? This seems to have tumbled out of the press like a road apple from a pony's rear-end. Lousy writing and editing really ruin books for me and this one is a lost cause. The author had something Important to say and he makes it clear we must listen. What astonishes is that a publisher can confuse ponderous with profound and have such rock-bottom standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mystery thriller with bite.","review":"As mystery thrillers go, most don't really get you personally caught up in a story the way this one does. This book deals with a number of controversial issues that you can't help but identify with on some level. The seamless way the story blends fiction with reality is impressive, but be warned: it has sharp barbs for some religious organizations and will shock and infuriate sensitive readers--particularly those who don't believe such topics are appropriate for novels or satire. If, however, you can accept the premise that unswerving religious ferver can sometimes be problematical and dangerous, you will find this a highly credible, frightening and fascinating read. Possibly the clearest, most effective religious critique to come along in more than a decade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I would have enjoyed it more if the author had created a more plausible messiah character. The whole story hinges on her and the fact she was hatched in a laboratory is a bad start. She is also unlikeable and hateful at times. Her tedious condemnation of world religion would have been better if it had been done with some compassion. Without any emotion and no sign of a caring nature, how could such a cold oddball be accepted as a \\"savior\\". The story is most interesting when it depicts the kind of media event the turn of the century may be. But with the centerpiece of the book being so off the wall (and biblically ignorant) it's just impossible to get into the story. A big disappointment to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deepok?","review":"Basically mediocre thriller where bubble-headed New Age hokum is spouted for many pages by fish-tank bred feminist messiah. Someone has read too much Deepok Chopra. The new parables are a real hoot. A more intelligent philosophy can be learned from any Hyde Park sermonizer. When not pouring vitriol on the Catholics, the novel bores readers with the love lives of the stale characters. There's a lot going on and none of its very interesting. The concept of this novel is fascinating and one wonders what a good writer could do with it. Unfortunately, the knowledge and insight needed to tackle important issues is not in evidence here, nor the talent to tell a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair","review":"Not bad for a thriller but a bit pretentious. The author's New Age nonsense tends toward the annoying as do the ill-defined characters. The book is far too long and the ending is simply not worth waiting for. The kind of thing one picks-up in a bus station to slog through on a very long, monotonous trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating, stimulating!","review":"This author has the heart of a poet, the soul of a philosopher, and the mind of a Sherlock Holmes! He tells a rip-rollicking story that pulls you in from the first chapter and propels you along at breakneck pace through some amazing situations and experiences. One of the most impressive aspects of the novel is its complex plot, which is totally unpredictable yet never forced or confusing. The writing is bright and lyrical, beautiful and the story is told with great clarity and power. This book has a ring of authenticism to it that makes everything entirely believable and the impact of the story all the greater. One of the best novels I've read in years. I give it my highest recommendation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting at Times","review":"A pretty lengthy thriller that could use more thrills and more substantial characters. The plot elements are a bit worn and the preachy sections worth barely a skim. Be warned it has an anti-Catholic premise that might hurt some readers feelings and the author is pretty insensitive. If not taken seriously, an okay read. Biggest critism: writing, characters, and dialog. Best thing: It was interesting at times and had an odd humor to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible","review":"Actually, I find the critical reviews for this book more than credible. When I read it a few months ago I thought it was a quick bit of fluff, although long and boring in stretches. The multiple star reviews are a bit odd but I guess this is great literature these days. The fact that some are offended personally by this book seems to bestow an undeserved significance to it that is as inappropriate as the rave reviews. It is difficult to get worked-up about a book that is neither terrible or terribly good. The reviewers defending the book find it necessary to do so in a personal way and that is quite curious. A review is simply an opinion and mine is as mixed as many. Read and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignore the Fuss","review":"Our New York Public Library Reading Club recommends you skip this turkey until Thanksgiving when it will come out in paperback.

Funny in part, but uninspired overall. The College of Cardinals are made to look dumber than they are (impossible) and as incapable of even discerning when the next millenium begins. Kleier is equally incapable of creating a single sympathetic character. I kept hoping the inept pope would stick a cork in her mouth and send her back to Patricia Ireland and N.O.W. Her groovy aphorisms were just too cute. And that sales figure from Publisher's Weekly (which panned this masterpiece) should read 1,500 copies sold, not _150,000_. Mr. Kleier has already presented this flat potboiler. No need, Glen, to cook anymore books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Staggering","review":"I was mesmerized by what passes for dialogue, character development, and story telling technique in this novel. Not one character behaves in a plausible manner, especially the putative messiah. One gets the impression that the author knows nothing about theology or the bible. Even more disconcerting is how clueless he is about human nature. Much of the book details the author's personal grudge against religion and other more interesting aspects of the plot are ignored. The plot potential is staggering and the inability of the writer to effectuate it is disheartening. I'm afraid Kleier is just not up to the task he set for himself either intellectually or in writing faculty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive","review":"I have to agree with the reader from PA who said that as a woman she found the character of \\"little Jeza\\" offensive. Jeza could offend anyone! This character proves the author understands as little about women as he does about writing. Particularly outrageous is that the females in this book are more concerned with their boyfriends than the spiritual significance of the messiah's return. This \\"but what about us?\\" attitude made me sick. Only the male characters have thoughts about the spiritual implications and these are superficial. All the characters are shallow but the women are really vapid. They are symptomatic of the unenlightened novel this author has attempted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only my Opinion","review":"At the risk of incurring the wrath of the passionate admirers of this novel, I would like to say that I did not enjoy reading _The Last Day_ very much. I am slightly bemused by the vehemence with which an ordinary thriller is defended here and the strain of paranoia characterizing some of the favorable reviews. Surely we all should strive for a more open-minded tolerance of one another's opinion concerning a mere novel. Any criticism I have as to the quality of the author's quality of writing or intended message would only repeat the essence of what has already been stated in many of the negative reviews on this page. But I believe each of us should feel free to express our ideas without the personal condemnation and bizarre recriminations of any angst ridden faction with persecution delusions. It is, after all, only a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Note","review":"Our university reading group here in Berkeley (32 members and a good cross section of students) read Last Day in December, 1997.

It is time to stop, to think, to rest. The world peoples cry out for peace and forgiveness, all here is old hates. Jews are stupid, they will follow blindly.

A no-nonsense look at what might REALLY happen, how people might REALLY react, should a new spiritual messenger appear. I am not a religious person, but I found so much food for thought in this book, I read it twice. One very appealing aspect, for me, was the even-handed treatment of men and women--as thinking, spiritual beings--by the new messiah. A book for the open-minded; and a book that might just open a few minds to some disturbing, yet intriguing and even inspiring possibilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most spellbinding stories I've ever read","review":"When I saw the huge volume of reader reviews on this book, I had to get a copy to see what was going on here. Now I understand. This is an unbelievably interesting story that deals with some very volatile, touchy subject matter. How would the religions of the world that are always trying to scare us into line with sermons about an imminent Judgment Day actually respond if it looked like it was really going to happen? How would the world respond? And what is really down there in the super-secret Secret Archives of the Vatican? This story is like a \\"Dr. Stangelove meets organized religion\\" complete with all the tension, insanity, humor and satire that goes with it. If you don't have a sense of humor about religion, don't read this book, it's not exactly a witnessing tool! But it is a fascinating, gripping read that will keep you guessing all the way through, and is over all too quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another point of view","review":"After reading the book and some of the other readers comments I confess I'm a little confused. While turning the pages my interest focused on the behaviour of the people and the roll of the mass media. One of the questions without answer that almost everybody wonders at least once in a lifetime is: What would happen if the messiah came back nowadays? And I have always thought it was a question about ourselves, about our society. I think that's an important viewpoint in the book, that's why all those pages about the Martins, and the roll of the WNN. About the book in general: sometimes the writting is too childish (that's not the exact word), the story predictable, and the author could have gone much furder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it or hate it, this book WILL make you think!","review":"Philosophy, theology, politics, the media. All are involved in this top rate mystery/thriller. This is one of the best books I've ever read. I don't recommend that the reader take it as prophecy and I don't believe that it was intended as such. It is, however, an honest, no holds barred look at the world we live in, how we live in it, how we treat each other, and how we make everything so much more complicated than it has to be. I also think it shows that, however disillussioned one might be, there is still hope for us to learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your Kidding...","review":"When some poor soul put this thing in the same league as Mann and Eco, I about choked. This novel is written so poorly, the characterizations so flat, and the plot so senseless, that it eludes adequate description. The authors mentioned actually address spirituality in meaningful terms. This incoherent mess throws new age mumbo jumbo like confetti. The criticism of the Church is certainly warranted but a bit of biblical knowledge would have strengthened the argument. Far be it from me to be \\"anti-Jeza\\" (lol) but the vapidity of that character was particulary painful, as were her cockamamy sermons. Even if one embraces the superficial philosophy and goony characters, the sheer length and awkwardness of this empty bombast is a killer. This dreck is the worst thing I've read in years and hopefully relegates its author to the obscurity he so richly deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Novel I'd Ever Recommend","review":"I don't know what this book is supposed to be but it struck me as stupid New Age nonsense. Whoever wrote the thing really hates the Catholic church and many, many pages are spent bashing it. That got very old. Most of the characters are unlikeable and the story was dumb and predictable. It's awful long for a thriller where nothing really interesting happens but the writer had a lot of prejudice to vent and endless ravings about religion. Turns out to be a mindless rant that left me feeling sorry for the pope and sick of Little Jeza. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below Average","review":"As a thriller, this is below average, lacking in plot, suspense, and interesting characters. As literature, it's a joke.

Crude writing and tends to get preachy. The author is insensitive to religious folk and is pretty brutish in his disdain for Catholics. The science fiction angle is clumsy and the romance stupid. It's ok as a timekiller but not recommended for serious reading as it's too long for a lite read and too dumb to devote serious thought to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overblown Junk","review":"Too silly, too wordy, and too long. With writing like this, only the publisher could seriously say \\"Kleier is a welcome literary voice\\". There must be a hundred reviews here that point out how poorly written this nonsense is, but I found the author's hammering and yammering about other people's faiths tedious. The alternative he offers in Jeza, the feminist messiah from Malibu East, is superficial New Age pablum. Kleier needed remedial courses in writing, comparative religion, and science before embarking on this ludicrous effort. His mad scientist scenario creaks with age, his characters are flat. This is one piece of junk that I sincerely regret throwing my time away on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overlong & Overblown","review":"If 200 pages were cut and a lot of the preaching left out, it would be an ok thriller. A good premise is, unfortunately, ruined by the author's ego and overwrought writing. Plot and charcters are equally thin and take a backseat to the writer's compulsion to \\"enlighten\\" the poor reader. His messiah, \\"little Jeza\\", is about as unlikeable and silly a savior one could imagine. Frankly, I was rooting for the pope! A real misfire as a thriller and as a satire. Heavy handed hokum and pretentious gunk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Premise - Fair Novel","review":"There is certainly no way this book could possibly live-up to some of the over-the-top reviews here. The premise is great but the potential is poorly realized, the research soddy, and the writing is indeed terrible. Whoever wrote that the superbly challenging authors Stone and Morrow are \\"safe\\" has not read them and has a low standard for comparison of writers who question faith and organized religion. This novel is actually \\"safe\\" as it attempts to cling to stereotypes, stock characters, and very old prejudices. The author lacks true insight and belabors his point, repeatedly, too often, and too long. I \\"got it\\" well before the long delayed and predictable ending. If this is honestly such a masterpiece to some readers, good advice would be to read more and discover the fine writers who have approached the same ground with the intelligence this author lacks.

Anythings possible... I guess. The only suspense in this thriller is just how much worse is the stupid book going to get. The novel is horribly written with abysmal characterizations. The silly New Age religion stuff doesn't help any, although the parables from the Newer New Testament are a hoot. I kept wondering if the author was actually serious. Sadly, I think he thought he was writing a deep and meaningful book, not a shallow piece of trash. I understand the author got a million smackers for this. For that much money I might consider reading the thing again and discovering a masterpiece this time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extraordinary","review":"Are we as readers so spiritually bankrupt that thit feeble-minded and ineptly written novel might conceivably appeal to us somehow. I have had flyers handed to me in the tube that were better written and more thoughtfully presented than this ridiculous diatribe against Catholics. If the author could write worth a penny, I might have listened to him. But this drivel must be an embarrassment to the publisher. I understand a motion picture company bought this? Good lord."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is It","review":"Well, it's here. The worst thriller I have ever read. The religious issues and condemnation of organized religion I have no problem with. In fact, that was interesting for a while. But it went on and on. And I absolutely hated little Jeza! People here have discussed the awful writing better than I ever could. At first I thought that was done on purpose but nooo. And I ended up cheering for the Church. If only someone had the sense to shoot Jeza at the start I would have been spared 400 odd pages of the boring shrew's philosophy. When the inevitable finally happened and everybody was redeemed I felt like I had put myself through hell for nothing. Please, grant it's another 2000 years until Jeza returns (and until G. Kleier attempts to write another lousy book!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Comparison Shopping\\"","review":"I agree with many of the thoughtful criticsms of this novel offered on this page. Certainly, the reader would do better to search Amazon for some of the far superior novels which address the same issues as Last Day, but with intelligence and fine writing. James Morrow, Daniel Easterman, James Halperin, and Stone's Damascus Gate, put Kleier's overwrought, flat effort to shame. I think superb, informed writing is more worth my time than a shallow novel driven by a concept jotted on a cocktail napkin. Manufactured thrillers like this are many, but readers will find something unique as well as rewarding in the alternate authors mentioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-Hum","review":"Fairly lifeless thriller with some cheesy writing and unpleasantly dull characters. At times the author's style is awkward, most often stupefying. The messiah named Jeza is one hellish nag for the reader to endure and her unending parables are as half-baked as her character. The book takes forever to go absolutely nowhere. The only place readers will be taken is for 20 bucks. A schlocky torment when it isn't plain tedious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning","review":"I suggest readers check the bestseller lists and mainstream reviews for themselves because this is a third-rate thriller by an author who had an attack of self-importance while writing it. I thought the idea here is to express an opinion, not attack and discredit those who think this book is awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nihilism+","review":"I don't expect those giving this book 10 to know what nihlism is, but what is found here is not offensive to organized faiths. The ignorance and arrogance of the author degrades feminism and Women's rights in general. By presenting a comical female saviour of such limited intellectual capacity, such low charisma, and such downright hatefulness (Jeza has attitude to burn), Klier just insults the reader. And yes, I am a feminist, but I'm only active when a male writer is this insensitive, stupid, and ugly towards more than women. This guy is just a bad writer and an idiot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash is Trash","review":"The 10+ reviews speak of this book as it were a great work of literature. Does anyone read anymore?! This isn't even a good thriller. I enjoy an intelligent religious thriller (Daniel Easterman, James Halperin) but this pitiful effort is stupid, crude, stilted, and inane. Not even entertaining, simply trash. And to the paranoid here, I have no religious affiliation. This book just stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"Others here have well described the poor quality of the writing and generally insipid content of this thriller. But I found it's ugly and hateful nature even more disturbing. This is a very dark novel, lacking the spark of hope found in even hardcore horror stories. The author expresses his distaste for faith and orthodox spirituality in a very offensive manner and presents a hopeless view of the faithful. I found his message superficial, his understanding shallow, and his arguments strange. Besides being a bad novel, I was left with a bad feeling. I don't remember reading any other book that was so silly yet troubling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reality Check - Please!","review":"If amazingly bad writing wasn't enough to kill a good story idea, the author of this book decided to create the character of Jeza and drive a stake through this novel's black little heart. Jeza, the female messiah, is a stereotypical feminist, an obnoxious twit who delivers parables for new age groupies and has the ability to bring to life for the reader the sensation of fingernails on a blackboard. Imagine 400 pages of that. I got halfway through this work of art, ignoring the poor writing as best I could, and finally tossed it aside during one of little Jeza's longer lectures on a bible she was obviously as unfamiliar with as the author of Last Day himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just About As Bad As A Novel Can Be","review":"The author of this book has managed to get published the worst writing I have read in years. The characters and dialogue are unbelievably shallow and silly.If any research was attempted, it sure isn't evident. I'd like to second the opinions on this page that found this thing to be less than a masterpiece and echo the thought that those who think this book is a 10 really need to read more (good books, that is). If there is a rally for the Conspiracy Against Bad Writing soon, please let me know so I might do my part! The ruse that every bad review is from a right winger is a little too cute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sit Down & Shut Up!","review":"It starts off as a good thriller, then it's like, I have something important to say so sit still and listen. I was offended by the writer's attitude, like I deserved his punishment for ever believing anything, than what he had to say. I just could not finish it. Long, boring lectures I have no problem finding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but I've seen better.","review":"The premise of Mr. Klier's story was a good one. Unfortunately, he did not execute it all that well. Parts of the story were exciting and tense and it held my interest for most of the book. The book starts out focusing on Biblical prophecy but in the end, totally disregards it. If a work of fiction references actual printed material, I feel it should remain true to that material. There was no mention of the Rapture, nor of Christ's (Jeza's) triumphant return with the saints. There was also no tribulation. Also, Jeza's sermons seemed a bit too 'New-Agey' for my taste. The messiah in the book does not in any way resemble what the Bible says about the return of the Messiah. Sorry, this book just didn't do anything for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair","review":"This is an okay thriller, but it isn't great. The characters are flat and lifeless, the writing pretty mediocre. The plot had some cute twists, but the lecturing was tedious. Jeza, the cloned messiah, was too much to take, as was the Vatican cabal of stereotypical evil cardinals. I guess disliking this novel reveals me as an agent of the religious right, but I actually just enjoy reading.I don't mean to offend fans of the book. I simply thought it was a below average thriller that was tough to get through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Dumb","review":"I didn't find this to be a novel of great ideas, as some have. In fact, the ideas, plot, and writing were of the same quality - weak. It was all very politically correct and the author picked a popular strawman for a target of abuse: the Church. Some of the criticism was dead-on. Some was off-base and ugly. I can't say I enjoyed the book much, but I'm not really into trashing other folks' faith. And there is prejudice here, plenty. It's been done before, much better, and this is not exactly the caliber of author to break new ground-LOL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting","review":"This novel had a strange effect on me. It was more than the suspense thriller I was expecting, it also managed to blend some intriguing philosophy into the mix. The book makes an intelligent argument against religious absolutism: Whether you listen to your church elders, a bible school magna cum laude, or the pope himself, you will always get a different take on what is \\"God's Will.\\" Move out the the Christian realm into Judaism, Islamism, or Buhddism, and the opinions get ever broader. Each has a different, if intelligent, perspective on what God wants from us. Confusing, to say the least. THE LAST DAY offers one of the most appealing and logical answers to that dilemma I've ever come across. It's very satisfying to finish a book that makes you feel as if you've solved a problem that's bugged you for years. That's how I feel right now. This book gave me great peace of heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a missed opportunity!","review":"A great idea that deserved a talented author! The opportunity was completely missed to say something profound about the hypocrisy of the Church and Christianity's failure. Instead, we get a rehash of old bigoted attitudes, feminist stereotypes, and a cartoonish thriller. I would give this five stars for inspiration and zero stars for the clumsy, hatchet-job attempt at writing. It could easily have been half its lumbering length and been half as bad. The author must hire a ghost writer if he has another good idea, or an editor with better sense and judgment."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Relief","review":"I read this novel with great anticipation. What a relief that I'm not alone in rating it so low. This is the worst thing I've read in years. Definitely not \\"the best book I ever read.\\" I don't care if the Catholic Church gets skewered, but at least put the barbs in the context of an interesting and readable story.I recommend Damascus Gate by Robert Stone (available here at Amazon) for an excellent millenium novel about the Holy Land and the meaning of faith. Now that is a great novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insufferably Pretentious, but...","review":"While I found Last Day strictly the work of an untalented amateur and glaringly pretentious, one must give the writer credit for addressing some of the excesses of the church. Whether discriminating readers are willing to wade through 600+ pages of terrible writing to arrive at all too obvious conclusions is doubtful. Such a windy, fitfully told story hardly does justice to the injustices of the church. Here, the issues are trivialized as semi-comic plot devices to advance a series of soap opera episodes involving many uninvolving characters. Readers may wince at this cliche ridden novel's crudeness, but it's badly written meanness permeates and obscures legitimate concerns. This subject deserves the attention of a gifted author instead of this third-rate thriller-with-a-message misfire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"Pretty fair sci-fi type stuff, way too long, and very, very long. The writing is definitely a minus and I got a little tired of the church bashing. Jeza, the clone that somehow is the supposed messiah(?!) was a major mistake and a nincompoop! Definitely not an earthshaking, life-changing reading experience nor a great contribution to literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pompous & Banal","review":"This isn't just a thriller! This book has important things to say?? Should anyone need help understanding the difference between reasoned, thoughtful criticism of organized faith and dull-witted prejudice, or for that matter, between tedious pseudo-philosophizing and real thought, this very long novel is here to clear the air. As pretentious as it is hateful and misguided, this fiercely anti-Catholic novel makes one wonder just which of the author's knuckles Sister Mary may have finally broken in frustration at his lack of writing talent. For those of us who left the Church, just get over it Kleier! Don't inflict unresolved bigotry on readers. Readers are supposed to believe that what makes this book worth enduring are its windy metaphysical meanderings, but these thoughts are so pompous and banal that they can't begin to redeem what is a very bad novel, full of bogus posturing and empty of thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful","review":"This is the worst writing I've read in years. A ridiculous plot, lifeless characters (especially that loony bombast messiah, Jeza!), and a hateful arrogance for anything but New Agey silliness. I hope the producer who bought this freaky fable was fired and the money refunded because it looks like the studio heard this one gobbling long before Thanksgiving. Maybe the movie version would have been better than this book - it would've been shorter, it would've actually moved, and it certainly couldn't be much worse than this trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impishly impious","review":"I had a ball reading this book. It's a great read, filled with wit, humor, and insight. The surprises come non-stop, from first chapter to last. Although quite frightening in places, the uplifting message more than compensates for the nail-biting. Suspense and satire blended into a terrific thriller. And there are enough pearls of wisdom here to keep philosophers occupied all winter. Certainly one of the most enjoyable novels I've read in a long, long while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kooky","review":"Dismal and depressing. A very kooky messiah is cloned in a fish bowl and gets a huge following in 2000 by acting out stereotypical female tantrums. That actually makes it sound better than it is. The people in this story are all one-dimensional simpletons, the bad guys right out of central casting. Some of this is amusing, but it seems eternal. The author has a lot to say, says it a dozen times over, but doesn't really seem to know much about anything, especially prose. It's all just too vapid and weird. You'll see the less-than-exciting conclusion trumpeted by page 50 and kick yourself for reading the other 600 when you reach the big letdown. The author seems to think there's a vital message in this book, but here's a better one: Read something worthwhile and save yourself the time I wasted on this turgid mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"not grounded enough in fact to make it believable","review":"would only impress someone without a working knowledge of theology..."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Bombast and Bad Taste\\"","review":"The above quote is from the Publisher's Weekly review. After reading this for myself, I've got to agree. The enthusiastic reviews here are certainly consistent: they all share the author's prejudice against Catholics. I'm not Catholic, but the bigotry displayed here and in the novel is unsettling. The amazon sales rating for this unpleasant screed at least is evidence that the vast majority of readers have good taste. Nice to see crudely written hate mongering doesn't go over well. As to the thought police nonsense, let paranoia and bigotry speak for themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done!","review":"Mr. Klier takes a challenging and very compelling topic and manages to serve up a feverishly paced novel distinguished by its balance and fair-mindedness. Well done, I say, and I look forward to more intelligent reads by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good!","review":"Much enjoyed this one. A fast read, well written. Keeps you on the edge of your chair the whole way. Plenty of discussion points. Could keep a whole philosophy class going for an entire year. Deserves the rave reviews and then some. When's the next book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overlong & Overwrought","review":"The basic story idea is interesting but the author's talent is just not equal to the challenge. What begins as a poorly penned thriller quickly becomes a very lengthy and overheated indictment of the Church. While the anti-Catholic message may appeal to those readers with such prejudiced inclinations, others are likely to become bored with the tedious ravings of the messiah, Jeza. The potential of this character is lost as she reveals her self simply a contrived stooge who endlessly preaches the author's simple-minded bias against Roman Catholics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Lord...","review":"At the risk of being burned at the stake as a \\"henchman for the religious right\\", allow me a voice in the wilderness here. When I finished this telephone directory of a thriller last night, I came here to comment on how much I disliked it. From some of the reviews, I thought I had the wrong book. To be accurate, unless I bought a misprinted copy of the book, the Last Day I read was written poorly, self-important nonsense, with a politically correct Jeza character (a female Jesus clone) who gave me the creeps when she wasn't making me yawn. The church bashing was funny at times, but seemed overdone and bitter when it went on too long. The author doesn't appear to know much about the bible, religion, or real people. If it wasn't so darn long, so difficult to read, and so self-important, it could be dismissed as a sub-par thriller. But since the book tries so desperately to be significant, I'll give it two stars for the effort. I believe I smell smoke, so on to better books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really, quite good","review":"I started this novel highly skeptical and ended up with a smile on my face. This is really quite a clever book. There is far more going on underneath the surface than I think many readers suspect. But even if you're not into all the intrigue and innuendo, this is still a well done suspense/mystery. It will keep your attention and interest all the way through, guaranteed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Daniel Easterman","review":"New Age pop guru raised by scientists in an aquarium spouts pseudoreligious nonsense so shallow it's silly and saves humanity from Catholic Church! Promising thriller stumbles badly over faulty scriptural references and laughable Christ figure who demonizes organized religion and is so obnoxious one would prefer damnation to this sort of so-called redemption. Read any novel by DANIEL EASTERMAN for a far more credible, accurate, exciting, and satisfying religious thriller. This absurd trifle isn't close to being in the same league."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay Thriller","review":"Dated now but still an okay thriller centering around the Milennium craze and the the Second Coming. Jesus returns as Jeza (a New Age Feminist!)and the rest of the plot is incidental and pretty darn familiar to readers of this kind of thing. I enjoyed some of this but it is overlong and preachy. The characters (especially the villains) are silly and their actions incredible. Jeza, however, is a hoot! You have to read some of her parables because they are priceless as Politically Correct versions of creaky old bible favorites. This is actually on sale for 1 cent through Amazon.com so what have you got to lose except hours of your life?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Some people have no sense of humor. This book is to the stuffy organized religions what 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' was to mental institutions. It's a terrific story, exceedingly well executed, a lot of fascinating, head-turning things happening here, and maybe it does tweak a few noses along the way, but folks, IT'S FICTION! I can't believe people are getting bent out of shape over this novel any more than architects were upset over Ayn Rand's 'The Fountainhead'. It's a fantastic book. Relax and enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seriously Folks","review":"This is very entertaining if not taken too seriously. Very well written and plotted. Only minus: the author gets too heavy handed at times and preachy. Except for that, it's a funny and interesting story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Bigotry in New Format","review":"Some of the enthusiastic reviews here are perplexing and must come from the publisher. Even truly great literature doesn't receive such raves. For an ordinary thriller, this novel has surprisingly touched upon and for a moment legitimized anti-Catholic bigotry for the narrow minded. The delight taken in this by certain readers is disturbing. In every other way the book is unexceptional, but the underlying prejudice, hatred, and venom towards the Church is unique. One would think people might be more tolerant and enlightened, yet this kind of thing is still embraced by some. This novel will encourage those that hold on to old hates and offend the intelligent reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Age Preaching and it goes On and On and On...","review":"I had a difficult time dealing with the New Age tone of this book and found the characters obnoxious, boring, juvenile. It seemed at times the author was preaching for hundreds of pages and it was pretty airheaded stuff. The character of Jeza was simply irritating and simplistic. But that pretty much summarizes this author's efforts. As I was reading, all I could think was that this was a wonderful idea that unfortunately fell into the hands of an inept first-time writer. What a mess!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time & Money","review":"About the most lame-brained thriller in years. The characterizations and dialogue are below the comic book level. In fact, the writing overall is as elementary as it gets. Bombast and overlength don't hold any interest for me and the only part of the book that works is borrowed from other, much better novels. The story is as ludicrous as the fact that this thing was ever actually published. A total waste as a novel, but some accurate criticism of the Church."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new idea","review":"For one not given to reading a lot of contemporary fiction, I found this novel quite fascinating. I enjoy books that push you in philosophical ways--even if they are a bit weird, as this book is. But I have to say, I ended up thoroughly engrossed. The unusual twists all have a purpose, as the writer takes you down a very nerve racking path that will keep you glued to the pages. I anticipated the ending about 100 pages out, but not the manner in which it finally took place, nor the odd--if plausible twist it took. All in all, this is a very fine effort and unlike anything I could anticipate. If you enjoy high caliber suspense and surprises, The Last Day will not disappoint. I give it five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"politically correct messiah ?","review":"The action was jerky, the plot thin. The theology was unscriptural. There are THREE persons in the trinity - Father, Son and Holy Spirit - not four. There is no daughter. If you want to read this, remember that it is fiction, and poor fiction at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calm Down!","review":"How can readers remain calm when a piece of great literature, the greatest ever written, clubs them with truth and revelation? Jeza changes the nature of one's very being! This book is spreading enlightement to our soon to be late great planet like the swine flu! The \\"thriller\\" aspects are easily dismissed as mindless drivel. It is the spirituality and deep thoughts of Jeza the Anointed One that teaches and ultimately saves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breaks new ground","review":"This book is so hot it sizzles! I've never read anything quite like it. Loved the complexities and energy. This author feels his subject deeply and never lets up on the power prose. Excellent, excellent book. I want more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unresolved Issues","review":"What must have been a cathartic experience for the author, resolving childhood issues with Catholic parents, amounts to an unpleasant hatchet job on the Church and unenlightening diatribes. With a thriller, I want to be entertained and maybe learn something, not be endlessly lectured. Klier writes with the subtlety of a battering ram and his Jeza character is a simpleminded mouthpiece for his anti-Catholic prejudices. If it isn't clear, I didn't care for this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant thriller","review":"The Last Day combines elegant prose with an entirely original plotline to create a classic thriller. This is a rare gem. Insightful, provocative, moving. The action is unpredictable, heart stopping and constant. They don't come any better than this. Highest recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Laughs","review":"I thought this was a very funny novel. Not as good as James Morrow, but good. The author gets to obvious for this to be great satire and lacks some basic skill and knowledge to really succeed, but a good effort. Maybe wait for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even Good Airplane Reading","review":"I don't really care about the religious overtones in this book as other readers did. I just thought it was bad. I found this book to be extremely poorly written. The dialogue was phony, the situations were contrived and there was absolutely no character development. It's easy to tell that the author is a Marketing professional. This book was all sizzle and no steak. A novel as a Jinggle writer would write it. Not even good airplane reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensational","review":"I don't care what anyone else says, any book that can make a grown man both laugh and cry is a hell of a read. I really enjoyed it and hope to see many more books from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing","review":"It amazing to me as an editor at a New York house that stuff like this ever gets published. The concept is excellent, but the author lacks the basic ability to tell a story. I doubt the best editor could have salvaged the kind of writing on exhibit here, but at nearly 500 pages, there is no evience anyone even tried. If a million was paid for screen rights, the author won the lottery."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful story","review":"I am so impressed with this book. It has much to say, and says it so well. One of my favorite quotes is where Jeza is confronted by a Palestinian terrorist. She says to him: \\"To you who pursue violence to regain your homeland, know this: your issues are worthy, but you yourselves are not! The acts of terrorism that you bring are abhorrent in the eyes of God. I say to you, let the persecution of the Jews and of the Palestinians, and of all religions and peoples, let it all end now, forevermore...until you and your brother Jew can come together with love...neither will know a peaceful homeland.\\" Now isn't that what we've all wanted to say to the terrorists all along? Tremendous book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just a great thriller","review":"The real reason why the Religious Right are trying so hard to kill this book, I think, is because it threatens to put them out of business. The finely honed point this novel makes is that people no longer need to be like sheep blindly following self-appointed, self-righteous (and self-serving) shepherds. (Take THAT, Pat Robertsons, Jerry Falwells and Jimmy Swaggerts). The novel inspires people to dump the \\"moral middlemen\\" and to take personal responsibility for our own religious convictions and salvation. That's a REAL scary proposition for the organized religions who thrive on our financial contributions. This is a first rate suspsense thriller with bite."},{"rating":"2","title":"A novel for the times","review":"This novel has been the subject of hot debate at our book club meetings. It seems that everyone who reads it interprets it differently. Regardless, it is a wonderful, highly entertaining read. It's like reading two books in one--an engrossing mystery/suspense thriller, and a dead-on accurate satire/commentary about current socio-theological events in the world. Few works of fiction make that kind of contribution to literature--Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, or Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged are two such works that spring to mind. The Last Day leaves you with that same sort of feeling; that you've just read a very special work of rare intelligence and value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"This book opens a can of worms about the frightening state of contemporary organized religion. It's an explosive story that dares confront secrets and intrigues few authors seem willing to broach. But all the seamy internal politics of religion aside, this is a dynamite story of one man's pursuit of truth in the face of staggering obstacles and ungodly challenges. I don't know where or how the author came up with such an incredibly unique plot, but this is a completely refreshing departure from all the same-old novels out there. I rate this one like the author Clive Cussler states on its dust jacket--\\"one of the most intriguing tales of decade.\\" Bravo, Mr. Kleier! Can we please have more?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Millenial Dud","review":"Of all the millenial thrillers I've read so far, this is surely the worst. Very, very dull reading. The author seems to have a sense of self-importance that has given him the mistaken notion that his ideas would be pretty dog-gone interesting. Well, too much opininating wears me out. It appears that little research was done before the word processor was fired-up with this book. Nor was a creative writing class attended. Raw talent is great in a first novel if well done. This is just raw. Maybe payment was by the word because if it were half as long it might be easier to bear. When a writer tackles science fiction, philosophy, religion, the bible, Modern Israel, and the meaning of life, a little knowledge would be handy, not to mention the talent required to write intelligently about the subjects. In this swirling river of ideas, you can see the writer's beanie bobing on a swell. Life preservers for author and reader, please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mess","review":"What a mess of a novel. Crude, slap-dash writing and a conglomeration of plot elements from far better thrillers. Seems to go on forever with its witless cast of stereotypes going beyond the call of duty to prove how stupid they are. Jeza, the feminist refugee from the New Age movement, offers many truly bizarre twists to Christianity and manages to be about the most unlikely \\"messiah\\" ever cloned in any mad scientist's lab. The book especially belittles every known religious faith, but is uniquely ignorant of and hateful towards Judaism and Catholicism. A very strange novel, a poor thriller, and an unpleasant, trashy reading experience. Mark Steinberg"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome Tirade","review":"This was a downright miserable read. The author's heavyhanded diatribes, new age silliness, and simple minded theology really left me ill. Poor characterizations, lame plotting, and clunky writing help to make this dumb thriller especially tedious, irritating, and 350 pages more than I could stand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roller Coaster Ride With Too Sweet An Ending","review":"A though-provoking mixture of science fiction and religion, The Last Day has major motion picture written all over it, with the exception of protests by Roman Catholic groups! The characters are interesting, the premise surprisingly \\"possible,\\" but the ending is devoid of the pyrothechnic special effects that the first 98% of the story implies. The final pages are more out of a \\"made for TV\\" after school special. It was a fun book that was hard to put down, but it does seem that Kleier has a whole closet of axes to grind with the Pope and his pals. If Speilberg wants to touch this one, the last few pages need a rewrite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much food for thought","review":"This is a book that is as thought provoking as it is entertaining. I found myself unable to slow down to make sure I caught all the little nuances and will just have to read it again. But it held my interest from the first chapter till the last unlike any book I've read in quite some time. Terrific suspense, fascinating characters, very fast paced, very tightly written and plotted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken Promise","review":"At first this debut thriller showed promise. Unfortunately, that promise isn't sustained as it reveals itself as a quite mediocre novel whose easy swipes at Catholicism deteriorate into boilerplate, sophmoric moralizing of the most smug kind. The author's self-indulgence is limitless as he berates one with his personal prejudices concerning the imagined evils of the Vatican. The book founders on its one-dimensional treatment of important issues, ones that seem beyond the intellectual scope of the writer. What might have been a fairly good story ends as an excuse for airing the rather vicious views of a religious bigot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gospel According to Beavis and Butthead","review":"Kind of a groovy, now kind of happening as Christ appears as a politically correct feminist who seems unfamiliar with the original Gospels. This time it's a way cool media event and Jeza (oh boy) is the pop icon that can save our souls with a little help from her friends, the Magog. Too much! Far out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jeza has Returned and She's Not Very Pleased","review":"Fundamentalist readers won't be happy with this attack on their beliefs and other readers may be just plain bored. The tirades about religion go on and on and on. No one could possibly buy the plot and paper thin characters. As someone who hasn't set foot in a church since Sunday school, even I found the bible references and Jeza's Newer New Testament off base and a real hoot. However, I really don't see such an inconsequential fantasy as being controversial or offensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Salvation Smarmy","review":"This is more of an anti-religious rant than novel. Redemption here is presented as a selfrighteous and hateful, lacking any sense of spirituality. I'm not Catholic, but I didn't particularly enjoy seeing a saintly pope humiliated by a David Copperfield/Koresh clone. I guess as the 20th century ends second rate writers will churn out millenial novels in abundance and they shall come upon us as the plagues in Revelations. Woe unto us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you think about religion versus money","review":"After reading this book, I have a better understanding of the impact a Messiah would have on the religious organization. When Jesus scattered the money changers, he was rocking their income boat. Would it be any different today if the Messiah returned? Would they welcome him/her or try to discredit and destroy such a threat to the statis quo? I hate to say it, but I think he'd have a real hard sell...if he performed miracles, it would be called a trick, sham, or the work of an Anti-Christ. A very disturbing and tantalizing read....I highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An intelligent foray into the supernatural.","review":"This novel is a spectacular look at something the world has feared for 2000 years. Exciting and thought provoking. Not a religious book, but it has a beautiful spiritual quality about it. Kleier is a masterful storyteller. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for everyone.","review":"What a book, what a book. I've never been moved enough to review a book, but this was a e-ride to the max. A fan of mystery thrillers, I expected a thrilling book but I also received a mirror to look at my life . Anyone who is curious about religion, international espionage with a love story thrown in, will love this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"An insightful, well written, philospophical thriller.","review":"This book isn't so much about the Millennium itself as it is about humanity's relationship with God and themselves. It is a 90's/Millennium version of Charles Sailor's beloved \\"The Second Son\\", with many great twists and lessons for us all! Too good to miss! PASS IT ON!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TRULY BELIEVABLE!","review":"This book was one of the best I have read as far as originality; although you start the book thinking it is just another \\"millennia book\\", you quickly learn that is not the case. This is one of the most engrossing books I have ever read and I would like to see a sequel. The most chilling part of reading this book was the fact that I agreed with so much of what \\"Jeza\\" had to say. I found this book to be truly believable (chillingly so)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Darn Boring","review":"Well, it's got a dumb plot, horrible writing, silly characters, and is so darn boring that I almost didn't finish it. That's about all, except this writer should do a little research and not limit himself to Cliff Notes next time. A creative writing class might help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair but Unfair","review":"This was a fair novel for what it is, but the anti-catholic elements were biased by ignorance and 1890's prejudice. As a former Catholic, I found that part of the book needless and uncalled for. The concept of a female messiah had a lot of potential, but unfortunately, the author comes up with an unbiblical bozo in Jeza, as well as a female stereotype.Parts of the story were fun, but I found the author's attitude too negative to really enjoy. This writer may consider himself a humanitarian, yet it is as well-disguised here as his reputed talent. At least 200 pages of the book are devoted to his unresolved bitterness toward the church, and that wore me down. Many of us are displeased with the church - Thankfully, all don't write boring diatribes and stick them as silly sermons in overwrought thrillers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreary","review":"An awful dreary, long, wordy book that depressed me when I wasn't dozing off. The author pushes a real anti-Catholic agenda that seemed creepy and unfair. I'm not into political correctness, nor am I Catholic, but whoever wrote this is a bigot, and I wouldn't recommend it for that reason alone. The story is standard millenial stuff, only not done well. Some of the writing was so bad it was distracting and none of the people in the story were credible. At times the plot made no sense at all and the messiah (she) made my skin crawl. Maybe the author would become a follower of this clueless boob, but I doubt any crowds would gather for her. I've heard there was a tv movie going to be made, but I guess the producers finally read the book. Proof that you can't judge a book by the blurb on the cover. Mystery Science Theatre could have had a fiesta with this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful author and humanitarian","review":"I loved this book so much. It is truly a special, special piece of fiction--well beyond the \\"suspense thriller\\" genre in which it's been placed. I read an interview with this author at Writerswrite website that just blew me away. The man is extraordinarily intelligent and funny, and genuinely concerned about the human condition, which, of course, is reflected so strongly in his novel. The interview gave me such an insight into why and how he wrote this amazing book. I encourage everyone to read The Last Day--it's the product of a very sensitive and brilliant mind with the power and the insight to change the world into a far better and more tolerant place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsophisticated Primitiveness (the Bad kind)","review":"With heady premise in hand, this author bulls into his story with the prose style of a Madison Avenue ad man. Subtlety is not his forte. An editor's blue pencil was badly needed when this monumental manuscript was presented - the writing is primitive much too often. Even in this genre, the plot is farcical (which would be fine if the author were not so deadly serious). Too many of the ingredients in this turgid potboiler have been lifted from other novels where they worked well. The effect is jarring and results in deja vu predictability. Stronger characters, people who are more than mere mouth pieces for delivery of speeches and sermons, were sorely needed. The book wallows in self-righteous unctuousness that leaves one praying not to be trapped next to this author on a long plane flight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Cleric should read this book!","review":"Every cleric should read this book.As a praticing agnostic I began to wonder myself if my posistion may also be suspect.As the world nears the millenium and more and more \\"cults\\" wiggle their way out of the woodwork I was left agast at how much destruction and how much hope they may have to offer for a troubled world.I am very suprised I have not seen this author or this book on any best seller list. For me it was like finding a polished jewel in a rock heap. I looking very forward to the next book that this author cares to share with us."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was entertaining and I could not put it down.","review":"I am a science fiction reader and I came upon this book by accident at a book fair. I bought it, and it was one of those books I could not put down. It is the story of Jeza the second coming of Christ. I was fascinated because it illustrates how the church has all this wealth, and Jeza (the real Christ 2) is commanded by God to have the Catholic Church \\"disband\\" and use all of its amassed wealth to help people in need.Now that is fascinating to me, and I found myself thinking about this book again now because of the Pope and what is about to happen. As with all science fiction there is some truth, and I think I received some insight about the wealth of the Catholic Church and it brought up the question \\" would Jesus be a member of the Catholic Church?\\" In my opinion I think not."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but that's it.","review":"Some of these reviews are mystifying when this is a pretty dumb thriller and hardly deep. As mentioned many times, the writing is plain bad. Silly characters and outlandish dialog galore. And the Catholic bashing gets old fast. I agree it's too preachy and the sermons gave me the itch to skip pages (I did, often). I sure wouldn't recommend this as some kind of great book! Very poorly done and way too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book cooks--","review":"I loved this book all the way through. Hot and unpredictable, nice mix of action and suspense, thrills and chills, plus a big bonus--IT'S INTELLIGENT! It actually challenges your mind. All told, one fine book. Get it, read it, think about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"A very odd thriller that doesn't really hit the mark. The author's Clive Cussler-like style lacks the magic of that popular writer and is uniquely nasty and mean. It was impossible to believe in the characters, particularly the women, or the way the story developed. Nothing seemed to ring true and the reader isn't drawn-in to the story. An author familiar with or who had researched Israel would capture much more the dynamism of the people. It definitely should have been shorter as the conclusion's disappointment is even greater due to such a lengthy build-up. Just too much of an investment of time for what it is: an unpleasant, unsatisfying, hyprid thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I can't speak to the controversy around this novel, but I can say it's one heck of an exciting ride as a thriller. It kept me guessing all the way thru. A challenging, surprising storyline that is as suspenseful as they come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story!","review":"Congratulations to Glenn Kleier! Terrific story! Took this novel with me on a business trip and didn't want to leave the plane! The suspense is excruciating and the action non-stop. Story takes you through a maze of experiences and places seen through the eyes of a TV reporter cuaght up in the ride of his life. The Jeza character is easily one of the most stunning creations I've come across in years. Her mind is brilliant and the twists and turns and surprises she takes you through is like having your soul strapped to a roller coaster. When's the next book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Offended Agnostic","review":"This was loaned to me by my inlaws, card carrying members of the 700 Club. They liked it! I expected to hate it. It turns out I just was disgusted by it. As an agnostic, I didn't give the so-called religious message much thought. But as Publishler's Weekly said in its review, this novel has such overwrought dialogue and poor writing that it's distracting. So is the deafening sound of all those axes grinding away. At least offer the reader a somewhat sympathetic central character. So this is one agnostic who is offended - by really bad writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea","review":"The idea that the messiah might return in the form of a woman is a fascinating one. As I was finishing this novel last night, I couldn't help thinking that the idea was squandered in a dumb thriller. A more capable writer could have brought such a character to life, explored a myriad of possibilities. Instead, heres a female messiah al a Gloria Allred, more a obnoxious fundamentalist who just finished the Classics Illustrated version of St. John than a christ. This is got to be the most ridiculous dialog I've read in years and certainly the worst researched thriller around. What a waste of a good idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than Expected","review":"Not much to this and what there is is much less than one might expect. A terrific premise wears thin after 400 pages and one is left asking \\"what is the point?\\" Maybe my expectations were too high, but this novel is just second-rate horror/thriller stuff that fails miserably as entertainment or mainstream fiction. Wait for the tv movie it seems to be a rough draft for. Maybe a skilled screenwriter can do something with it if the original author isn't involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Millenial Junk Food","review":"The end of the millenium is bound to attract the attention of many writers and there is an opportunity for a great book. This is not that book. The story here is pretty thin and its background is poorly researched. The author seems to have little understanding of his subject and his interpretation of church history, the bible, and Israeli politics is laughable. Some of the errors could have been caught by a good editor, which this novel needed badly. The result is a ponderous, silly, and superficial book that leaves the reader craving something more substantial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long & Boring!","review":"This may be some hot manifesto to people who like sermons but it sucks as a book. The way this guy writes reminds me of a newspaper or leaflit. I got the message but how about more story? This thing drags on forever! And so on. There's enough to make everybody mad - Jews, Catholics, Moslems - but nothing to make readers want to finish it. You don't have to be a bible thumping snake handler to say this book bites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk - Don't Bother","review":"This book started out fine but ended in total disaster. The ending was severely rushed and was poorly concluded. It reminded me of a television sitcom where the family crisis is quickly resolved and everyone joins in for a group hug because everything is good again. The scientific underpinnings were not clearly established well enough in order for this book to work. Furthermore, the author tiptoed along the lines of hypocrisy with regard to his use of religious scripture to prove his points. Whereas his disdain for organized religion is quite evident, he relies on theological points and scripture (that were a result of centuries of deliberation within the church) in order to boost the messianic credentials of his main character. In other words, the author uses theological points to puff up the mysteriousness of Jeza, but attacks the same church who originated those points. All in all, a major dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of a tree....","review":"Jeze, what a truly awful book. Bad writing, horrid dialogue, amazingly predictable \\"suspense\\", simplistic characterizations, insulting religious/ethnic generalizations and a plot that was so insanely contrived it boardered on farce. This book is pure bird cage lining. Truly one of the worst books I have had the displeasure of reading in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pompous Overkill","review":"A pompous, slow-moving, supernatural melodrama with a little comic relief from the new age messiah, Jeza. Incredibly verbose and pointless, pathetically written, and cornball. What little action in it grinds to a halt when Jeza gives one of her frequent stump speeches for the Equal Rights Amendment. Seems to glory in giving Catholics a gratuitous bloody nose as much as it loves to punish a reader with endless, convoluted prose. Honestly, only if you're desperate."},{"rating":"1","title":"bleh","review":"I find it puzzling that this book generates so much passion because there's so little here. It's poorly researched, poorly written, the plot is tiresome, and the whole thing is inexpressibly dreary. Oh, and did I mention tiresome? If you're curious, get it at the library, but don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware!","review":"What a provocative story! If the right wing religious folks are taking offense, it's no wonder. Frankly, I've been waiting my whole life to see their own weapons (religious mind control tactics) turned against them. So be afraid, be very afraid. And for everyone else, this is a page turning suspense thriller, thought provoking, intelligent and scripturally faithful. Read it and you'll understand why these people feel threatened."},{"rating":"2","title":"In a class absolutely by itself.","review":"I suspect Glenn Kleier must be a pen name for one off my other favorite authors. Perhaps James Morrow. (it has his religious style) or Marion Zimmmer Bradly. (It has her openess, depth, and beauty) Regardless, by far one of the most intriguing and thought provoking books I have ever read. I hope we hear much, much more from him."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've ever read","review":"I can't say enough about this book. It kept me glued to my chair until I finished it. It was one of those books you never want to see end. Thrilling, thought provoking, scary and funny all the way through. It will make you look at the coming millenium in a whole new light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outline for the TV show","review":"Reads more like a rough outline for the tv show it's destined to be than novel. One can imagine this \\"concept\\" being pitched at a studio. Once the idea was sold, a novelization is patched together for \\"prestige\\", and the publicity boys start cranking up the buzz (cooked-up controversy is good). I think the boat was missed here because the no-talent hack hired to manufacture this literary mess wrote an overblown, long, boring tome that lacks imagination and excitement. Wait for the tv show- it will be free and you can do ironing while it's on. Much more intellectual stimulation and less of a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie Idea","review":"In the hands of a professional screenwriter, the premise of this novel could be beautifully realized. Just keep the original author out of the creative process. The book is poorly written and aspects of the plot are silly. The basic idea has wonderful potential if the Jeza character is improved and made less of a freak. I'm interested in seeing the final result after a good writer salvages an excellent concept from this fiasco of a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lenten Sacrifice","review":"Having finally finished Mr. Kleier's turgid tome, I will now offer up the pain I endured reading it and hours lost trudging to it's inane conclusion as part of my Lenten sacrifice. I don't think I have before encountered such misleading positive reviews. As a book editor, I encounter bad writing often. This, however, sets a new low for publishing. It is certainly in my top ten worst books of the past five years. I've read better dialogue in the bubbles above Superman's head. The plot idea gets a 3; plot execution (now that's appropriate) a -10. Jeza save book editors from \\"authors\\" who are as pretentious as they are talentless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trash, but not bad","review":"I usually don't enjoy trash, but this isn't bad. Bad dialogue, a ridiculous messiah, and idiotic biblical references aside, the idea of Christ returning as a feminist and taking on the Vatican certainly held my attention. Overlong, but amusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy Cow!","review":"How many times do you pick up a book at bedtime and find yourself reading straight thru till dawn? If I hadn't the need to go to work today I would have finished it non-stop. As it is, I'll read a little more at lunch and maybe prop my eyes open with toothpicks tonite! This is as good as they get, so far. Hope it ends as strong, but I can't imagine how the author's going to get out of this one, shy of Armageddon. Don't want to see it end. Now I got to get a little work done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic","review":"What would happen if the Messiah were to return today and judge the religions of the world? We'll never get closer to knowing the answer to that great question than this novel portrays. Without regard to political correctness or popular opinion, Kleier trains a starkly bold and unblinking eye on the chicanery, hypocrisy and hidden secrets going on behind the veils of modern, organized religion. The story is logical, believable, and compelling. You'll stay up well past your bedtime on this one to get to a most unexpected (and satisfying) ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"What could have been a great book flops!","review":"I thought this would be a great book, a great topic was chosen by the author, but the development of the plot was way too slow and time consuming. I normally can read a book such as this in depth, but I ended up skimming many of the chapters to get to the meat of the book. When the author chose to, he was very good. This was not the page turner I would have expected (other than turning the pages to get to something that mattered!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lays it on the line--","review":"This novel tells it like it is, and I'm thrilled there are people in this world like Glenn Klieir with the courage and conviction to brave the bitter zealots and speak these truths. There is no better a novel, nor clearer or more powerful a voice in literature today. \\"The Last Day\\" is magnificent, and Klieir is a modern day prophet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Here than Some Reviews","review":"I consider myself an agnostic but I don't share the sheer delight some reviewers (and this author) takes in demeaning the faith of others. Especially disturbing is the way in which these beliefs are treated with such cavalier ignorance. Catholics, which is the only group the author may have a slight knowledge of (and have unresolved issues with from grade school) are treated in the most disturbing manner. This novel is amazingly misinformed, POORLY WRITTEN (other reviews dismiss that) and has so many axes grinding it ends up a personal tirade by the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important novel","review":"I loved it. This novel definitely has something very topical and contemporary to say to the many stodgy, paternalistic religions out there. It should be required reading for every ecclesiast attempting to convey the \\"word of God\\" to anyone. An exceptionally well written, prescient and timely work that affected me deeply."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless","review":"I enjoy a well-written thriller with good characters, realistic dialog, and an intelligent plot: everything this mindless drivel is not. More an anti-religious rant than novel (with a particular hatred for the Roman Catholics), this book is 250 pages too long. I appreciate writing that challenges my thinking and values. Unfortunately, this author simply spews interminable amounts of venomous prejudice and insults the intelligence of thoughtful readers. One that I sincerely wish I had missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking","review":"What an intelligent book. Inspires thought and dialogue about the role of organized religion in helping individuals reach a heightened sense of spirituality. After reading The Last Day, I understand why readers love it or hate it. Obviously there are those that disagree with this book's perspective--I'd invite them to share insight that's a little more substantive than \\"the book's poorly written\\". It's anything but and I recommend it highly if you're looking to be entertained, thrilled and challenged intellectually and spiritually."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misfire","review":"Unsuccessful as science fiction, thriller, or whatever else it's supposed to be. It's difficult to miss when your target is organized religion, but this \\"author\\" does a good job of it with some of the worst writing I've read in years. It appears that little research was done when this was tossed together. I didn't find it convincing at any point and the main challenge was actually finishing a book so redundant. My only problems with this book are that it's literary trash, not that it trashes religion. The right wing religious nuts may have problems with the latter, but I hate the former. I may be a free-thinker, but I do have taste:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book really rules!","review":"This book really rules! Technically superb and completely emotionally involving as well. Any open-minded reader will love it, at the very least as superb entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"An awful thriller! This book wants badly to be more than a thriller and ends-up very long and dopey. Forget the plot and clumsy writing, the characters are the pits. The religious ideas in this novel are truly weird and it appears the author is bent on selling New Age philosophy. Certainly his messiah is right off of Hollywood Blvd. I don't know what this fellow's problems with Catholics is, but hundreds of pages that have little to do with the story go after them incessantly. It was not a pleasant reading experience, nor an uplifting one. In fact, it's an amazing example of how bad a really bad novel can be. I didn't need to know that, but lousy writing and goopy philosophizing actually excite some readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long-winded Dud","review":"Very long and very dull. Amateurish writing that sets your teeth on edge and flat, lifeless characters. The sermons and ravings of the Jeza figure are uniquely bizare and stupid. An uninspired and gargantuan dud of a thriller that lectures rather than tells an interesting story. Please, no sequel until Y3K!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, fast-paced read with an intriguing millenial bent","review":"Beginning the book with skepticism, I was quickly pulled into the plot. I found the development of the story and the religious plot lines fascinating and the key to the story (i.e. whether the \\"messiah\\" is real)was kept in doubt to the end. The \\"wrap up\\" at the end of the book is somewhat weak, but on balance a well above average read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mother Theresa Endorsed This Book!","review":"This is the greatest book I ever read! A powerful, beautifully written novel that exposes papal conspiracies, Vatican cabals, and worthless superstitions. Mother Theresa loved this book, calling it \\"a wake-up call\\" for Rome. The truth of this book can be seen in the twenty positive reviews posted in the last four days. Not bad for a book that was published in 1997! The acclaim is universal and unanimous! Glenn Kleier will be a saint in the New Reformed Church one day because he has set all readers on a path of true awareness. No other book of this kind has ever been written, one which touches the very soul of the reader, and one which may well save us all! This penetrates a 1000 years of darkness with a beam of truth so bright that it will burn away the ignorance of all who dare condemn it.God bless Mr. Kleier for offering redemption, truth, and light to all oppressed by ancient nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Cup of Tea","review":"I really didn't care for this book. None of the characters are likeable, especially Jeza the messiah who is shrill, nasty, and boring. The action was identical to a hundred other thrillers I've read and nothing much was new. Somehow, I don't think the Second Coming will be this much of a soap opera. It just is superficial and silly. I felt very let down by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly and Time Consuming","review":"While I enjoyed some of the bashing of the Roman church, I found the plot pretty ridiculous and the characters unaffecting and stock. I agree the writing is amateurish and that this is third-rate science fiction, but the attempt at social commentary is commendable even if ham-handed. This has all been done before and much, much better in much, much shorter novels. Unforunately, this takes a while to wade through for a predictable climax. Definitely not for discerning tastes or religious right folks.Or me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! \\"The Greatest Book Ever Written\\"?","review":"Is there a joke here I'm missing? This and Furland's \\"masterpiece of literature\\" are the greatest books written in 5000 years? Let me catch my breath. This is more like The Hardy Boys meet Nancy Drew At the Apocalypse. If Franklin W. Dixon were a theologian and cultural observer, this would certainly be the case. Unfortunately, Kleier and Furland are now \\"enlightening\\" Mother Theresa! LOL! A big grain of salt for these reviews. Last Day neither expanded my mind or cured my sciatica, but then I'm not \\"a professor of literature at a major university.\\" Mercy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Second Rate Iconoclast","review":"This is pretty pale stuff when compared to James Morrow's brilliant Towing Jehovah or Bible Stories for Adults, two iconoclastic masterpieces. The author of Last Day bludgeons the reader with a elementary interpretation of the bible and open disgust for the \\"sacred\\". Morrow confronts organized religion with wit and intelligence, qualities absent in this novel. Where Morrow offers insight into Religious beliefs, this author offers very little. Morrow is a genious at exposing hypocrisy with wit, subtlety, and sheer guts, cutting to the sanctimonious bone. This author delivers a few bruises, but lacks the heart and soul of the great iconoclast. This is a loooong sermon against the church, without the style and talent for stepping on clay feet which Morrow demonstrates consistently. It's the difference between a skilled surgeon and an apprentice butcher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I can see where some people might find this book upsetting, since it pokes some irreverent fun at contemporary religion. At the same time, however, it is hard to ignore the fact that the novel is dead-on accurate in how it portrays the reality of contemporary society and its relationship to religion. More important, the novel blends all this into a first-rate mystery that broaches some of the most challenging and disturbing themes of our time--namely, what our we doing to ourselves following our present course of action. Change is needed, and the mad descent into panic that this novel portrays has a strong ring of reality to it. For a read that will keep you engrossed, make you sweat with fear and challenge your mind as well, this novel is uncommonly good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quality novel","review":"Simply put, this is an excellent novel that is as thought provoking as it is suspenseful and outrageous. I found myself unable to put this one down (literally, I took it to a play and actually read it during intermission, it's that compelling!) I've got all my friends reading it now so I'll have someone to discuss it with. This is the kind of book you feel you've just got to talk to someone about. Needless to say, I thoroughly loved it. Worth a second read--and maybe a third!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An anti-religion diatribe!","review":"The basic premises of this book are: (1) all organized religions are bad (particularly Roman Catholic); and (2) all the world's problems are caused by organized religion. Above the primary themes, Mr. Kleier has the new messiah preach a sermon of politically correct pablum: sleep around, have abortions, have a good time, but don't waste any time going to church. My best guess is that Mr. Kleier attended parochial school and hasn't been able to forget the nuns whose teaching so cruelly offended a sensitive 60s kind of guy. Nonetheless, Mr. Kleier doesn't waste a minute of his pulpit time to preach to us.As pure fantasy, this is a pretty well written book. It has an interesting premise, and a decent plot, with good charecterizations. But, even without the apparent anti-religion bias, the ending would be disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you, Mr. Klier","review":"Why do some people seem to hate this novel for what it has to say? If you ask me, it is a welcome slice of reality masked in fiction that tells a marvelous tale. This book, if you peel away all the intriguing layers, is simply a parable. A parable that cleverly reveals the often greedy, materialistic, power-consolidating underbelly of modern religious structures--organizations with an established history of greed, materialism and power-consolidation. Mr. Klier strikes a credible note of warning, calling us to be vigilant against the vicissitudes all men are susceptible to, whether they wear their collars forward or backward. Simply a wonderful and spellbinding story with a relevant and poignant moral."},{"rating":"1","title":"14","review":"I didn't care for this novel at all. It isn't a very good thriller or mystery and it's an absolutely terrible and ridiculous end times story. Some reviewers seem to think this book has something to say, but it all seems a little hyper to me. I don't think this author has much to teach readers and he fails to entertain as well. Wish I could say this is a fine first effort for this writer, but that simply isn't the case. He seems to have bitten off much more than he can chew and nearly choked. I wouldn't recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Age pseudo-religious blathering","review":"I must admit I was captivated by the storyline throughout most of the novel. I cannot say the same for the ideas proposed theirein however. The \\"messiah\\" is a thinly disguised postergirl for all of the NewAge-ism that many American sadly mistake for spirituality. The author is against organized religion and flagrantly anti-Catholic, and shows considerable ignorance toward Roman Catholicism, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Chasidic Judaism, and possibly a few other \\"hypocritical\\" religions that I might've forgotten to mention. Enjoy this book for the story, but if you want any real religious insight try Henri Nouwen or Thich Nhat Hanh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go, Jeza, go!","review":"How much would you give to have God Himself come down and expose all the phony, money-driven televangelists, prophets of doom and mercenary religious leaders of the world for the self-serving individuals they are? Well, here's your chance, in a novel that is hilarious, brilliant and as brutally honest as they come. Jeza, a female saviour, stands up to the biggest religious bigwigs in the business--and the results are often hilarious and always spellbinding. But this book is not without its darker, scarier moments, and you will squirm through some frightening wickets before you are allowed to experience the wrenching, mind-boggling ending. Some readers will take serious offense at the way this novel pokes fun at organized religion. If you have no sense of humor about your religion, read something else. But for the rest of the world, this novel will ring true, loud, clear, and fascinating!Also recommended: Bag of Bones, The Stand, Cryptonomicom"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I'm certainly no fan of organized religion and I enjoy seeing hypocrites get taken down a knotch, but this is a terrible novel. After some of the glowing reviews here, I was very disappointed. What begins as a run-of-the-mill thriller becomes a very long, boring, no-surprises, paperback trash read. The lengthy diatribes against Catholics seemed to border on bigotry and ignorance and made this non-Catholic wonder about the motives of the writer. Pretty vile stuff at times.I didn't finish the final 200 pages, but from flipping through them, they are as bad as the first 400. I just didn't want to invest more time in it. There must be a lot of readers angry at religion to generate some of the remarkably positive reviews posted. I love good novels and I'm just not angry enough myself to forgive this book its many faults and unfortunate excesses. Besides, its awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Idea!","review":"The book clunks along and the writing is ragged, but the concept of a woman messiah preaching femenine liberation and freedom to choose is a good one. Jeza's contradictory and irrational activism really sets the Church on its ear! If a reader will stick with the ax grinding and purple prose, this is amusing and occasionally thoughtful stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Entertaining/Make-You Think Book","review":"Not being a religious person, I was quite enlightened by this book. I know it's not meant to be the end-all word on religion, but it really gets one thinking. There was a very simple message about God at the end that left me feeling peaceful and hopeful (which is a lot of an old Athiest like me). This really is a thought-provoking piece and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern day epic","review":"This is a classic tale about societal paranoia and the powerful religious forces competing for the minds of the confused masses. A very believable and terrifyingly depicted story that grips you by the short hairs and doesn't let go till the final page. Thoroughly engaging and masterfully written. Four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A enjoyable read you should not take seriously","review":"The Last Day appears to be controversial in the eyes of some readers. I say, \\"lighten up!\\". The book is a fun and fascinating tale that one should read as entertainment not a religious text. The story is fast paced, intelligent, thought provoking (in a good way), and a great way to waste a few hours lost in a thrilling story. You find yourself rooting for Jeza, however, the development of her character deserved more attention than it received. I hope the author spins his next tale as well as he did this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"Having read several endtimes novels, I find this one particularly disturbing. The author have a very good idea for a book, but seems a New Age agenda has gotten in the way of developing a plausable story line. Microchip implantation, the cloning discribed, and the excellerated growth pattern of the clones were all interesting concepts, but the explination of how the clones managed to survive didn't come together in a believable way. Many concepts aren't believable. Shame on Glenn Kleier for the way this blasphemous book has slammed the Catholic's and their beliefs, and I want to say to all of you who think this book was an answer to prayers, stop reading trash like this when looking for religious enlightenment and read The Bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below Average","review":"Two stars is generous, believe me, for this so called thriller because the writing, characters, and dialogue just made me cringe. I think that most of the bad reviews are right on and that for a great novel about the millenium you should do what many of the readers suggest: look up Robert Stone's Damascus Gate and order it from amazon.com. It's terrific and you won't feel your intelligence has been savaged by the mindless junk Last Day amounts to. Spare yourself some painful hours and read one of the finest novels of the last year instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok I guess","review":"A stupid thriller that seems to have important things to say. OK if you've nothing to read but be prepared for terrible writing and a negative view of all religion from a pretty uninformed author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, it is a good idea...","review":"In the hands of a master (i.e. James Morrow or Daniel Easterman) this novel could have been a devastating depiction of a millenial Second Coming. Unfortunately, poor writing and heavy, heavy handedness ruins a great concept and the story possibilities are turned into a cheap attack on organized religion. Perfect fodder for the movie of the week which is its destiny, a skilled screenwriter may give the concept all that this book lacks: Sensitivity, Intelligence, and Depth. Hopefully, the original author, his narrow mindedness, and the airhead characters he created (or cloned from many other thrillers) will not be part of the tv movie's creative process. Don't just wait for paperback, wait for tv on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"God Awful","review":"A ridiculous thriller with a pretty offensive and bigoted \\"message.\\" I like the idea of a female messiah, but did little Jeza need to be obnoxious, anti-Catholic, and biblically ignorant? Her homilies are as shallow as the novel's characters, her philosophy steeped in New Age correctness and as shakey as the quality of the author's writing. The endless diatribes against the Church get tiresome and her belated but unsurprising finale is a welcome relief. Rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Would Agree With Others Further Down This Page","review":"What a piece of garbage. Poorly written and hardly researched, the author knows nothing of Israel and less of the New Testament. Designed to be controversial, it wastes a wonderful idea by becoming silly New Age mumbo jumbo. A time waster for the spiritually deprived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Figure","review":"Go figure the over-the-top reviews for a badly written, simple-minded thriller. As Second Coming novels go, this can't compare with Morris West's Clowns of God, but the author here is bent on presenting a long, ugly, anti-Catholic rant instead of an enlightening book. Pretentious nonsense, not literature, with incredible dialog, flat characters, and a female messiah that will make ardent feminists cringe. A great premise quickly becomes ludicrous as Jeza (Joan Rivers should play the tv movie roll) rampages through the Vatican and delivers inane aphorisms. The poor pope is horrified and who can blame him? Trash, and not even entertaining trash, without a trace of wit, intelligence, or humanity. And from the evidence on this page, highly overrated to an unbelievable point."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!","review":"Can you rate a book higher than a ten? This one deserves it. One of my favorite reads in years. Applause, applause!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My Humble Opinion","review":"The reader(s) who express their admiration for this novel seem to focus their reviews on attacking those who dislike it. There are many intelligently considered negative reviews on this page of which I agree, specifically as they register astonishment at the bad writing and lack of character development. On the basis of this being a flimsy thriller, I believe a rating of four is generous. As to the \\"great book\\" status, I can only express incredulity. The positive reviews seem very extreme in their praise, some slightly delusional. This is only a thriller, people. Good or bad, it's hardly deserving of such emotional notice. The idea that only one reader has written negatively concerning the novel is particularly ridiculous as at least three other members of our reader's circle have submitted some thoughtful criticism here and encouraged me to do so as well. It appears a one person campaign in support of the book is more is more in evidence and disturbingly odd if actual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"My compliments to the author for a wonderful read. I bought this intending to take it on vacation with me, started it and absolutely could not put it down. I can't remember when I've enjoyed a book this much. It had me going the entire time, I was never able to second guess it or anticipate the bizarre and very fulfilling ending. A great book and my top recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Lord","review":"As a English Lit teacher myself, I am horrified at the possibility that a fellow educator could recommend this tripe. Are we speaking of the same rubbish? I attempted to wade through Mr. Kleier's prose over Easter break and finally abandoned it for something more worthy. I can't see how anyone could mistake such blather as meaningful or even entertaining. Some departments must have thrown out their standards. I only comment now lest there be a misunderstanding: Last Day isn't a good thriller and it sure ain't literature! Writing like this is only a step above comic books. Thad Silver"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't See It","review":"I don't see how anyone could possibly consider this lackluster novel either well written or \\"important.\\" Pretensious and pompous, definitely. Long, boring, and amateurish, correct you are. Insulting to women, Catholics, and Jews, indeed. Entertaining, enlightening, or worth one's time, not a chance. I expected more after reading this page's outstanding reviews and I absolutely ended up reading a very large, tedious piece of garbage with nothing to recommend it. Believe it or not my paranoid readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"I have to compliment the author on an exquisitely written novel. This is a compelling story with fascinating twists and deftly rendered characterizations you just don't see in a first time work like this. The clever touches (easy to miss if you're not on your toes), the attention to detail, the complexities--all indicative of a master story teller. I look forward to the next efforts from this gentleman."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment","review":"Really below average and a let down after the stuff I read here. Not only poorly written, but dull and uninteresting. I have to say that whatever their sources, the bad reviews are right on the money with this book and put it pretty well. Just because it was sold to the movies doesn't mean the author can write worth a darn."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a chump!","review":"I've got to admit the right wing radical conspiracy stunt worked. I threw $20 away on this because I thought the negative reviews came from the fundamentalists. After finally finishing Last Day, I agree with those who have cited bad writing, amateur plotting, and excessive ax-grinding as criticism. The positive reviews make no sense at all in light of the fact this is an overblown potboiler that targets the church for the old Vatican Bank scandal. I thought the people and speeches were ignorant, especially Jeza, the supposed messiah who behaved like a vindictive child throughout. If I could do it again I would have ignored the ridiculous 10's and taken the reviews of 5 or less seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow Digs","review":"This amateur attempt to pierce the petrified hide of organized religion and expose inane sacred tenants is very feeble. Poor writing and superficial understanding defeats a clever plot. For wit and intelligence try the masters: Gore Vidal's \\"Live From Golgotha\\" and James Morrow's \\"Towing Jehovah.\\" These two novels are superior in every aspect to this nonsense and you won't be wasting your time or money. Last Day is pale in comparison and quite forgettable. Morrow and Vidal's work is hauntingly brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Art It Is Not","review":"This pretty bad writing and a waste of time as well. I'd recommend Daniel Easterman for a good religious thriller, James Morrow for cutting religious satire, and Robert Stone's Damascus Gate for an intelligent novel about the millenium phenomenem in the Holy Land. This author attempts all of the above for over 600 looong pages and fails because he lacks the skill, insight, and basic talent of those writers. The author is way over his head here and the result is pathetic nonsense not worthy of a comic book. Pure hype and tripe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outrageously brilliant!","review":"What an outstanding read! The most refreshingly original and honest book I've read in a long, long time. Disguising itself as a fast-paced suspense thriller, The Last Day is far more. Underneath there is a marvelous parable at work with a message that only becomes clear during the highly surprising climax. Full of clever intrigues and dazzling twists and turns that make it almost impossible to set the book down. The ending is absolutely superb and satisfying. At long last, here's a novel with the guts to tell the religious emperors of the world they have no clothes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling","review":"They don't get any better than this! There were times when my hands were literally shaking so hard I had to put the book down to continue reading. I haven't been so mesmerized by a story in years. Fascinating, surprising, shocking, gripping. I highly, highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of a kind story","review":"Has anyone come across another novel at Amazon that has as many reader reviews as this one? I haven't found any. This novel is certainly deserving of all the attention it's gotten and I encourage anyone who wants a good benchmark of the turning millennium to read this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Religious Ignorance Run Amuck","review":"The premise might yield a good and compelling story in the hands of an author who actually knew something about Jewish Messianism at the beginning of the common era and something about both the history of Catholicism and contemporary Judism.As it is the story is a really good example of anti-Christianity, anti-Judism and anti-history all garbed in a simplistic mellenniumism dished up as literature.The author would done well to have taken a course or two in historical criticism, or if he did it's a sad commentary on his teachers.This assumes that he is interested in something other than the power of money which he portrays as one of the pivotal motives of the religous \\"bad guys\\" he caricaturises in this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unsettling and accurate protrayl of modern religion.","review":"A great book. The religious questions considered were suitable for non-fiction work on today's religious mind. The novel format was a nice vehicle for much deeper questions re: our religious beliefs. I have been devoutly religions for all of my life and can not stop thinking about this book. I was disappointed that I found no information about the author or other works included in the paper back edition. I would like to see more of Kleier work and background. Thanks for a very though provoking book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Poor writing, superficial characters, female stereotypes, and dumb dialog highlight this silly, uniformed comic book story. Overblown, uninformed, and basically senseless. Two stars for a wonderful premise, wasted completely in an over-long vanity opus that is pretentious and embarassingly self-important. There's hardly a thing worthy of analysis here, but suffice it to say this illiterate mess is not \\"the best book I ever read.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done.","review":"A creative twist on Revelations and our times. Enjoyable and thought provoking. A new Sermon on the Mount that surpasses the legalism that plagues modern religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but everone it is JUST A NOVEL! Pure fiction.","review":"First of all I would like to point out that Jeza is a FICTITIOUS character.This tome would have been far more interesting and would have held my attention had it been half the length. 600 pages is laborious and presumptious. The characters were largely two dimensional. I had to force myself to finish this book, but some friends loaned it to me and wanted to discuss it, so I slogged through it.Less is more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is possibly the best recording made of classical music in history. The opening Toccata is backed by a number of excellent fugues, with the first track becoming extremely well known but usually not played in its entirety. What I really like is the futuristic gothic sound which is the look and feel I go for on a daily basis. The 1700s was right here right now but didn't date very bad at all. The sound is still modern and Bach is a lot better than Mozart. My social worker got me into some classical music, at least to the point where I wasn't shy to check it out at the library and rip it on my hard drive. Better than Handel's Messiah. I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It would be a terrific CD if....","review":"This CD release if NOT the complete double-LP. A number of tracks were omitted. As such, I urge you to procede with caution, by checking the track list against the LP to determine if any of your favorite tracks were chopped."},{"rating":"1","title":"this sucks","review":"my daughter got this for christmas and it started shuting off automatically in 2 hrs after she got it. do NOT waste your money on this. we have the vsmile console and it is great and she wanted the pocket version and she has cried since she got it. now she wants a gameboy. Please dont allow any more children to be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"3rd times the charm???","review":"We are about to return this for the third time. It just shuts down for no reason. We have not been able to get one to work for more than a month. Luckily we bought the warranty offered by Toys R Us but what do we do when that runs out? Our other V-smile system that plugs into the T.V. only lasted one year. They offer fun games but are very poorly made. We tried to contact the company but we were just given the run around. We will be moving on to Gameboy from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy LeapFrog instead","review":"I bought my child a Leapfrog Leapster L-Max for Christmas, and his grandparents bought him this toy. I must say that both me and his grandparents are unhappy with the V-tech. The graphics are bad, and get extremely blurry when the characters start moving. The game does cut off a lot, which may be bacause of the amount of batteries it eats or due to some technical problems that some people have been noticing. My son will play with it occasionally, but prefers his leapster. There are so many advantages that the L-Max has over this system, and they cost about the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Don't Waste your money!","review":"We had the game deck for vsmile, which stopped working after a year. rather than replace it, we decided that these would be great for our kids, and since we had almost all of the cartridges and nothing else to play them on, we got 2 of these.They worked for about a week. Now they don't work at all, even the games that came with them don't work, you have to reset them constantly. Frustrating for both parents and kids!I contacted VTech, (don't bother) they want me to pay to have the units shipped back, then they will check them out and IF they find them to be defective, they will replace them.What a scam. They rushed this to market and now alot of people have a defective toy and crying kids. i doubt I will ever buy a vtech product again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed in this system","review":"My Christmas I bought my granddaughter one. After about 1 week it just stopped working...I went and returned it to the store...the new one lasted about 2 days. I know how people feel about this item and we are getting ready to purchase a 3rd one. I figured if we waited awhile maybe the bad batches of bad one would be gone. I found out there were a bad batch of ones on a previous review. I guess I will wait awhile and then return it. I hope I eventually get a good one because we have like 8 games for this machine and nothing to play them on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money or time","review":"My 4 year old daughter received this for Christmas and was very excited. We put in batteries and tried several games, but it turned off about 2 minutes into playing the games. We purchased 7 games and none of them seem to work. If you contact the manufacturer, they want you to pay for shipping to mail it back. Wow. I exchanged it for another new one, it was the exact same. And the charger is crazy. It works sometimes. A friend and I have had the exact same problems with both the pocket v-smile and the charger. It seems that it's pretty common. They just do not work."},{"rating":"1","title":"More system board problems","review":"This is our third vsmile. We've had 2 of the TV versions and then one of my kids got this for Christmas. Less than a month later its now doing the same as both the TV versions eventually did. It will only turn on if there is no game in it. If there is a game, any game, in the slot nothing works. New batteries, using the power cord, hitting reset, or plugging it in to a TV makes no difference.Oh, and the LCD was really crappy. The viewing angle is terrible.So good games that the kids love, and really poorly made hardware."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's nice, when it works","review":"I got this for my 3-year-old son this Christmas. He loves it and I bought the ac adaptor cord so we don't have to go thru so many batteries. This is a real life-saver!The only problem I have with it is that it seems to be touchy. If he pushes back on the cartridge, it shuts the game off. Then we have to unplug it, plug it back in and restart it. He gets frustrated because he's in the middle of a game and has to bring it to me so I can restart it for him.It seems if this game is for young children they wouldn't make it so touchy. The cartridge is fairly wobbly in the socket and it's easy for him to push the cartridge backwards and disconnect the connection and make it shut off.Other than that, it's a wonderful game with good sound, decent graphics for a small screen and it's pretty easy for him to mostly do it himself.Hope this helps anyone out there who might be considering this game for their child."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"We've never owed a V Smile, but the V Smile Pocket is horrible! The graphics are so blurry that my 4yr old had a headache after 1 minute of playing. She told me it's too hard to see Pooh momma. So I returned it to get a L Max, I'm so glad I did. This is just not a good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"great game, if you don't mind hitting reset every 2 minutes!","review":"We have the Vsmile and the Vsmile pocket. Both great games, but you need to push the little pinhole-sized 'reset' thing in the back like every 2 minutes to keep the game working. VERY FRUSTRATING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great System BUT There's A Catch","review":"I have twin three year old girls that each have a pocket system. (They outgrew my first Leap Pad at 2 1/2.) The systems are great but the screens scratch very easily. The girls are supervised while playing because they are so young. I would recommend that parents buy the screen films that are used on pda's to protect the screen. It's too late for our systems. The 800 number is useless. Your call is picked up overseas and they repeat prewritten answers. The games are challenging and are great for long trips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"We have the regular Vsmile and bought the handheald because we thought it would be perfect in the car. We got it home, plugged it in and it worked great on the tv. We tried to use the handheld version and none of his old games would come one the screen, only the game it came with. My husband brought it back to the store and got another one.The second one worked fine in the store, and for one game at home, then again the screen would not show the game for him. We could hear the audio but not see the game. After two tries I think we are going to give up! What a waste of time and money!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a GREAT product!","review":"Absolutely love this product. Educational, portable, durable, you name it. Have had this since last Christmas and have had it beaten up by a [...] and a [...] and it keeps on ticking. Games are educational yet engaging. We take this on the road, and the battery life is very impressive - up to 4 hours on a single charge.Games are interchangeable with the V.Smile TV Learning System, which they both also enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems with VSmile","review":"I really like the V-Smile, the games are wonderful and my boys love it. I can't give it a better rating though because it doesn't always work. The battery compartment seems rather flimsy and the batteries slip out often causing it to freeze up. Then the panel needs to be unscrewed and the batteries plugged back in. Sometimes it freezes up and just won't work.

In the first 2 days he used it constantly and mastered the 3 games he got (Wiggles, Bob the builder, Finding Nemo) quite well. During those 2 days we went through a 20 pack of batteries like they were water and we noticed the game kept shutting off. We blew it off and thought it was just him messing with it. Now the thing won't work at all! If you jiggle the game it will come on for a bit, but the slightest movement and the thing shuts off. So, I've been spending my time with a toddler following me around asking me to fix his game. He loves this thing so much that I had to hide it from him and take him to the toy store to get something else!

She had a hard time using it. The control buttons were hard to use. The graphics were also disappointing. But, despite all of this she played with it for four days then it just stopped working. We replaced the batteries, reset the unit, etc. but it just would not power on. I read some reviews on the V-Smile and found that others experienced the same problem. We took the V-Smile back and I paid the extra money and purchased the Leapster L-Max. My daughter has not put the L-Max down since she got it. The graphics are so much better and she has no problems with the controls. The games are more educational and she enjoys playing them. She told me she likes the L-Max much more than the V-Smile.

Boy am I glad I did. He already has a game boy advance that we allow him to play for half an hour a day, and it has extremely crisp, clear graphics. The V Smile pockets' graphics are not so good. I had purchased two cartridges to go with it (Elmo and Pooh) and on both of them whenever the character moved at all he got blurry. And if you are in a part of the game that has a scrolling screen the ENTIRE SCREEN is blurry until you stop. I think this is a really great concept for a toy, but I think it could use some tweaking.

I plan to exchange it for a better one if it is even possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"Bought it this weekend.

She played it a couple of times a week for 8 months, until it abruptly stopped working. I believe it has a short in it because if the screen is facing down, it works fine, but if you flip it up so you could actually play it, it shuts off. The company recommended self-helps are worthless.My daughter received another one for her 7th birthday (gotta love grandparents), and that worked 4 days before it shorted out. It turns on just fine, but shuts itself off unless held in some bizarre, stationary position. Totally worthless for a portable unit.It's a great concept, but it's caused nothing but tears for my daughter, arguements with the customer service people in various locales over returns for me, and one worthless call to V-Tech. Too bad that a great product can't work a week.Recommendations: Get the base unit, which has lasted us 3 years+. Don't waste your money on the Pocket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!!!","review":"The game system is great that it can be used on the tv or portable BUT the quality is horrible.Like some of the other reviews say, it only works when it wants to and some of the games will no longer work on it either and those things were $20 each! I'm thinking of going and buying a leapter instead. We are on our second vsmile in 6 weeks! This is ridiculous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It won't turn off!!!!","review":"I just purchased the VSmile pocket for my son so he would quit trying to get at his Dads PSP. We got him the Vsmile box for christmas and haven't had any problems with it at all and he loves to play his games on it. However the vsmile pocket WONT TURN OFF!!! We haven't even had it 24 hours and there are already problems with it. It is a poorly built gaming device and the batteries won't stay in either because of the little metal loops that are under two of the batteries which makes it so those two won't stay in securely. It is a pain in the rear to have to unscrew the battery plate to fix the batteries. I will be taking this back and hopefully the store will give me a full refund. I'd get my son a gameboy, but the games available for it just don't offer the educational or skill benefits that the vsmile does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful educational video system","review":"My 4 year old son received this for Christmas. It has kept him entertained for hours while teaching him. The cartridges are wonderful because they feature the characters our children love. I only gave 4 stars because batteries die out very quickly. We were going through a set of batteries every couple of days. A pocket charger is available separately, but I think it should've been part of the package since most video systems come with the rechargeable batteries and charger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought it would be better","review":"I bought the vsmile pocket for my 4 yr old.

I am going to try to return it.I have the bigger V smile that connects to the tv. that works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what we expected...","review":"We have the original V-Smile console that hooks to the TV and the boys love it! We decided to buy the v-smile pocket so they could play anywhere. The screen was blurry when the games were moving. We also had trouble with the system freezing up frequently. We would have to push the reset button on the back to un-freeze it. This is frustrating when in the middle of a game because then you have to start over. We returned ours and luckily got a full refund from the store we purchased it from. While we love the original V-smile, I would recomend the leapster handheld (from Leapfrog) over the V-smile pocket. We have had no issues with the leapster system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun and education, but made poorly","review":"We got this for my 3 1/2 year old son for Christmas. He had been asking for it and he really likes it and is fairly good at the Dora game. However, after 2 months, the LCD is messed up (has a bunch of lines through it but the game looks fine when hooked up to the tv). Also, the system freezes up every once in a while even with brand new batteries. My son only played it maybe 2-3 hours per week for 2 months before it started doing all this. I would not purchase this item again, and I'm going to contact the manufacturer and see if they can repair it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks very easily","review":"My children loved this toy - but it sucked up batteries like crazy!

All 3 units have had the same problem . This product is terrible and V-tech should pull it off the market, do a recall and fix the problem. I would not buy this item.

Only. Reset didn't work. I changed the batteries twice. The AC/DC adapter doesn't help. Returned it. Against my better judgement, I purchased another one for him last week ... just in case we had been unlucky the first time. This one worked for all of one day. The company should be ashamed of themselves for putting this expensive toy on the market. We have a V-Smile box that plugs into the TV that just broke. But at least it lasted two years. This pocket contraption is a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money! Great concept poor quality toy!","review":"I had decided to purchase this toy for our 4 year old son's birthday. We already had the V Smile system (which stopped working correctly after 5 months), so I decided to buy this one so when we go long car trips he could play. Well the first time we tried to use the system it would not read any of the games or even turn on for that matter. The system would turn on without a game, but not with any games in it. Took it back and contacted V Smile about the issues I had with their toys and I was never contacted. Great concept, when the V Smile system works my son loves it but the company needs to fix their products!"},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"My 3 year son received the V Smile Pocket for Christmas. He played it for maybe 2 hours. The next day it would not come on. My husband replaced the batteries which lasted all of one day. We decided to get rechargeable batteries which only allowed play time for maybe 1 hour at the most. We decided to purchase the Pocket charger which worked great for a week then it started to turn itself off and on. My 3 year old loves to play on it when it works but you never know when it will work. We keep having to reset it and then it only lets you get so far and then freezes. Also you have to jiggle the games and sometimes blow on them to get them just to turn on. I would not waste my money on this. After seeing the other reviews of how V-Smile will not do anything about these so called \\"bad batches\\" I will purchase items by Leapfrog they stand by there equipment. Our next purchase will be the L-Max. It may cost more but in this case we got what we paid for!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"V-Smile Pocket Review","review":"My 3 year old absolutely loves this toy and the games are such that he can understand and play them. The games are educational and hold his attention endlessly. However, the game itself is cheaply made in that connections (such as to the television, to the cartridge or the rechargeable battery console) often don't work and have to be jiggled and moved around to get the game to operate. The company needs to improve the quality of the console but otherwise the game is fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"So many video games....","review":"Maybe my kids are just weird, but we got this for Christmas and it was played with once by my 5 year old and then never again. I checked it out to see if it was educational and it is, but my kids just don't seem to be fixated on video game systems like so many other kids are. It's pretty pricey, thankfully, I didn't pay for it. I just feel that some kids can learn better if you sit down with them and go through workbooks. I mean really do we need another gaming system that really only acts as a temporary babysitter. My kids get bored with video games very fast. Their new thing is using their imagination to ward off godzilla. Who knew that with all the toys out there they would rather play pretend."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAPSTER'S STILL THE BEST","review":"Vtech can try to compete with the LEAPSTER but there's no competition. LEAPSTER totally blows it out the market. The LEAPSTER is so much better and also has a larger game library. My 4 year old has played with his LEAPSTER since he was 2 and he still loves it.Soon LEAPFROG will be coming out with LMAX which is a handheld game like the LEAPSTER but it can also be played on TV like the VSMILE but 10 times better than VSMILE OFCOURSE. he'll be getting that one also."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome.","review":"This little gadget keeps the kids attention for a very long time. If my daughter could play it all day, she would. They learn how to spell words, add, subtract, use their noggins to figure out things and use their imaginations. Great toy, can be taken anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"SECOND ONE, BOTH QUIT WORKING.","review":"We love the Pocket V-smile...if it would only WORK!We first bought the regular V-smile that hooks up to the TV, and loved that they came out with a Pocket V-smile that we could take with us. Best of all the cartridges were interchangable between the two V-smiles. However, a few days after buying the Pocket V-Smile it began turning off on it's own for no apparent reason. We returned it for a new one and unfortunatly have had the same problem with the second one. We even bought the charger thinking it might have been a battery issue, but the charger only seemed to make matters worse.I hope they can fix the issues with this system, until then don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep your money.","review":"This product is a dud. It worked for less than a year. It consumed batteries and after buying the recharging station, the game system died. Save your money and buy a product from a different manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Built of iron","review":"Ok, so I'm not terribly impressed with the complexity of the games I've seen, but my son loves it! The really impressive piece is the sheer punishment-taking ability of the device. I have 3 kids from 5.9 to 3.o years of age, and this thing has rebounded from wall to floor any number of times. Re-seat the cartridge, occasionally hit the reset button, and it keeps on working. Why can't they build PDAs (grown-up toys) like that??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great games/kids love it - BUT It doesnt work","review":"I wish I would of read your reviews before I bought this, our first one just died, I bought another and within a week - that one just died. I feel so bad for my son because he loves the games, those are great. But, I am upset because I have invested so much money in the games that its just not easy to dump and purchase the Leapster, so I suggest to read these reviews carefully and think twice before buying this product. I had Vtech send me a new one, I am not paying for anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's was great while it worked.","review":"The V Smile handheld is a great option for younger children who like video games but need educational toys. The only problem is that does not work consistently. From the time it was opened on Christmas day until now we've had trouble with it. Originally it had to be reset as least twice daily until now when it doesn't work at all. For $[...] the game should work consistently not to mention that it is geared toward younger children who may not understand the concept of a faulty games."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply Made","review":"My daughter is on her 2nd V Smile and this one only worked for a day. Now she is out another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother!!","review":"We bought this for our 3 year old after he has been using my daughter's leapster. Well what a disapointment. The games are cute but who can play them with it so blurry. I mean the graphics are just awful. If you look closely when the characters move your head hurts. It runs through batteries faster then anything I have had before and we have gameboy and leapster and we use rechagable! The slightest movement and it shuts itself off. I completly suggest the leapster instead. If it is reccomended for 3 and up then it should be made for 3 and up. I am just mad that we through away the box and are stuck with this junk. Dont waste your money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"V-Tech needs to go back to the drawing board...","review":"V.Smile Pocket: First unit froze up in 10 seconds with the included game and it would not recover (even after using the reset and pulling out the batteries the unit was defective). So we exchanged it, but not much more luck: The 2nd unit freezes periodically with both the included game and with another game (Dora's fix it adventure). We've returned the 2nd unit.Overall very disappointing. We think V-tech will need a year or two to debug the code and get this thing right.Would advise using $80 elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"V-Smile Becomes V-Sadface","review":"We had built up a fairly large library of V-Smile games for the V-Smile console, and our son wanted the handheld version. It's not built well at all. The cartridges wobble around in the socket and constantly lose contact, so the thing either resets or locks up at the slightest touch.My in-laws bought my son a replacement, the version with the built-in drawing pad. That was no better in the stability department. These devices just aren't up for the indelicate play of children."},{"rating":"1","title":"A wonderful work but this isn't the best English version.","review":"The Conference of the Birds is a marvellous book--a sufi treatise on the spiritual life written in Persian rhyming couplets. This translation is not in poetry, but in rather dull prose. In addition the translator leaves out a number of the stories that make up the bulk of the work. He mistranslates at a few crucial points.I would recommend instead the extraordinary translation by Dick Davis and Afkham Darbandi. With great skill the whole work is translated into rhyming couplets like the original. Davis' rhythm and rhyme carry you through the work at a cracking pace, unlike the plodding prose of this version. Davis and Darbandi's translation is in the Penguin Classics series, ISBN 0140444343, also available from Amazon, where you can see a sample of their work."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the money I paid for this book, it was a bad investment","review":"The book jumped all over and didn't flow too well.

I decided to keep it and put clear packing tape around the opening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"Great product...just makes it a bit difficult if it is not a strip where plugs remain...to remove and then to put a power cord back in the strip takes some time but it serves it's #1 function to keep my toddler out of it and safe"},{"rating":"1","title":"For real? The baby's whole hand fits in this.","review":"Really? How could this possibly be useful? I saw somebody else post that the baby's hand can fit inside and I thought they were exaggerating. Really, I can reach my fingers in easily or poke a metal object through even easier. The baby's whole hand fits through the giant gap. Plus the thing is huge. Like almost as big as a shoe box. And really ugly. I don't know what we'll replace it with since the others don't sound better, but I know there is no point in decorating my living room with baby proofing for show. There's no way I could leave baby in there with this while I was out of the room, so I might as well just leave the cords as is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for powerstrips.........","review":"Although unfortunately for only medium sized power strips?

After not being completely satisfied, I decided to try out this Safety 1st Power Strip Cover when I needed to purchase additional covers. This cover wins out over the Mommy's Helper cover. The closure tabs on the Mommy's Helper don't snap very securely, but this cover has buttons on either side that must be pressed together to open the cover. It's also more sturdy and seems like it will hold up longer.A great feature you will get with this cover is it is expandable to be as long or as short as your power strip. This is really nice for small power strips. You won't have a huge cover taking up extra room.This cover is also wide enough to fit the new plugs that are turned sideways."},{"rating":"1","title":"It barely restricts access to the outlets!","review":"It's funny how many people have positively reviewed this. Yes, it's very convenient, easy to use, and fits well. What it doesn't actually do is effectively COVER the plugs! It's trivial for a small child to fit their entire hand in the rather large opening. In fact, I just plugged something in without having to remove the cover. If I can fit my hand in there, so can a child. And it doesn't even begin to protect against a child sticking a metal object in there. This product is, in a word, worthless.I recommend getting one of the power strips that has sliding covers on each of the individual outlets, or simply placing standard child-proof covers on the outlets of your existing power strip. But please don't use this product and think you are adequately protecting your child from shocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opening is big enough for child to get hands in","review":"This powerstrip cover is pointless.

When I received this bokken, I was not disappointed. The bokken is solid, although I won't recommend it for sparring, due to the finish. It's also heavier than my old bokken, which will help in my workouts (get those wrists and forearms bulked out, right?). The picture doesn't show it, but the bokken was even delivered with a tsuba (cross-hilt), and the attachment ring for it. I greatly appreciated that. Delivery was quick, and I really liked the quality of the bokken.The reason why I gave the bokken a 4-star rating instead of 5 is because I noticed while I was going through my exercises, that the wrapped handle was coming loose. I was a little disappointed in that, but nothing that a drop or two of super glue won't fix!Overall, a very positive experience and a great product. Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality for the money","review":"This sword is a good deal for the money. It is solid and has a few decorations.

It is comfortable to hold thanks to the braiding on the handle, which I believe is glued into place. I got two of these so my brothers could duel each other.

Also it has a cool design carved into the wood."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a Stick","review":"For the price, I shouldn't complain, but what the heck? What ever happened to quality control? It came double shrink wrapped. There was a plastic handle guard that didn't fit the sword, so I had to just throw it away. Very little pride in the product. The wood was roughly sanded before it was painted. Well, it's just a stick afterall. I'm just glad I did not purchase a more expensive item from this vendor, DreamObjects. Read their feedback responses -- sounds a lot like aggressive Ebay sellers who get their jollies replying to negative or lukewarm feedback. Sorry -- waste of my time and a few dollars.

When I got it, everything was here, and I was very eager to start making things. The book has instructions on how to crochet before learning to knit with the spool. There are tips on how to tie ends together, seal ends (you use nail polish to keep the ends from fraying), and a couple others. Then it shows how to knit with the spool, and has different patterns you can try with the many different colors of string and beads it provides. It doesn't have enough string to make many bracelets with the 4-spoke stitch, which was a disappointment to me. It was very hard to choose which string to use with the certain colors of beads. 8) All in all, it's a (as I've said before) pretty good kit. 8)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nancy King- A Pleasure to Hear","review":"Nancy King shows how a vocalist can sing with 'in the pocket' rhythm, deep emotion, and great scatting!

Mr. Shepard, I love this book full of tips. I recently wrote a short story for children in Spanish. Now I notice my many \\"errors\\" that I plan to correct. :O) As English is my second language, the chapter on rhythm and beats is a bit difficult for me to absorb. But I will.

This is the most complete, easy-to-follow and valuable resource I've ever read. And I've read A LOT of them. If an author follows this from beginning to end, s/he will be following a proven formula that works and is fun to do.

Why? Because, they are all straight to the point. The advice is not padded with trite page fill, such as, \\"Paint you home office mauve so you'll feel relaxed while writing.\\" You can pay for a thicker book, but you won't get more information. The Business of Writing for Children gives you the facts you need to set off on the pathway to success. What else do you need?"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTED","review":"Save your money! I was very disappointed with this product. Unfortunately all the Stanley and Thermos products are chineese made so that does not factor in to the purchase, as heartbreaking as it is. The real problem with this product is that it just does not work as advertised. The concept is great - heat yourself a lunch before work and enjoy at lunch time. In reality it does not work. I have tried two of these in case I had a defective one, but no such thing. I heat soup or chilly scalding hot and seal. Less than three hours later it is barely luke warm. And this is in a heated environment, someone who works outside might as well pack it with ice, it would be just as warm.I would give it ZERO STARS if that was an option.Regardless of color, the poor thermal quality of this product is the same.Put your money towards a Thermos Work Series. It may be twice as much and you have to heat using a different container, but your meal will still be HOT at dinner time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Food = Lukewarm - Chinese-Made","review":"It's true - this Stanley food jar does not live up to the name Stanley. Don't waste your hard-earned money for this Chinese-made plastic impostor of the original Stanley quality. I have this food jar and don't even bother to use it anymore because the food gets lukewarm in a couple of hours. You can spend less or about the same on eBay and get a vintage metal U.S. made Stanley Wide Mouth Food Jar that will keep your food hot for the whole day. I did that and am so much happier. I now buy vintage American-made Thermoses and food jars. All of them keep my food and beverages hot all day and the vintage thermoses even hot over night and into the next morning!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative 4 Stars - do not recommend","review":"Unfortunately this is not worthy to wear the Stanley name. It requires greater microwave time to heat the something as simple as chicken soup. Although I may screw the top on when the soup is still boiling inside, 4.5 hours later the soup is only lukewarm and the thermos has been stored in my office all day - not on a job site or in a cold truck. Don't think you can heat your food on the stove and then put it in this thermos after heating the thermos in the microwave with water because that doesn't work either. For all the bulk of it, it can't hold a standard 18.5oz soup, ie. Progresso. Instead of making my morning lunch prep easier and faster it made it harder and longer. I just bought the Stanley Outdoor Food Vacuum Jar 20oz - and am thrilled. It took me 5 min to bring my can of soup to a boil this morning - I poured it in the thermos and at noon it was still hot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite cd's and dj vic","review":"i bought this cd because I like the way vic mixes his music and this one came out good just like the past one he made \\"progressive trance\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This book has a great story to tell, but through the stalling and back-telling the powerfulness of the message is lost. I found that I had to force myself to finish hoping to be swept away by the ending, but was instead left wondering what I had missed. The narrative is confusing and lacks any passion on the subject at hand. However I believe this could be an intriguing movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Thing He Wanted","review":"This book was absolutely not good! It never made any sense and skipped around that by the time it got back to a certain person, you had already forgotten who they were and why they were significant!

With song titles like, \\"Medly From The Woody Allen Film 'Manhatten\\", at just over three minutes, and \\"Medly From 'Porgy and Bess'\\", the CD is a classy cash cow thrown together by CBS Records. Tilson Thomas' \\"Three Preludes for Piano\\", stops and takes a dramatic musical breath in the context of these slam-bang offerings. Truly bland CD liner notes by Bobby Finn and Kay Swift, whoever they may be."},{"rating":"2","title":"REA's Problem solvers Heat Transfer","review":"Very useful textbook.

I've purchased many cute ones over the years, but this isn't just cute, it is so soft and purely huggable, even the adults can't keep their hands off. I gave one to a friend's youngest daughter for her new little girl. Her also pregnant sister fell in love with it, so a month later I made sure her new infant son also had one of these adorable little ducks in his crib. Yes, they're too young yet to be holding toys, but when they're ready they won't want to resist hugging these wonderful baby ducks. Although different, my six year old grandson still sleeps with the duck which I had waiting for him in his crib when he came home from the hospital; his first toy. I only wish I'd found this duck for him. So soft you may buy two, one for yourself :))"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont watch if you need closure","review":"This is not your typical good guy/bad guy archetypal theme.

The SyFy channel airs lousy \\"B\\" rated cgi movies and shows about 80% of the time. Only good shows that are aired now are Eureka, Warehouse 13, Haven and if I don't fall asleep, Alphas. When ABC cancelled \\"V\\", I cancelled my pre-order of the 2 season of \\"V\\". Not to protest ABC decision to cancelled this great show, but I don't like buying something that will not have a good ending. In my opinion, \\"V\\" did not have and will not have a good ending. I bought the entire series of \\"Lost\\" because it was a great show and it had a good ending which was planned long before the finale.So here's a message for the yahoos at ABC.

Season One was pretty good and held a lot of promise. Season Two started off good enough but ended with a really bad cliff hanger that left three main characters dead and two more in serious jeopardy. And guess what? ABC cancelled the show.If you have not seen Season Two yet, be warned, if you are a fan of the show and buy this DVD, you are headed for a big let down. This is exactly why I don't watch network television. As viewers we find shows we like, get invested in the story line, and then the show gets canned and all those characters you like whose stories you got invested in are left in limbo with no closure. Thanks for watching our network! I should have known better than to allow myself to get involved with a show on network television.I guess the show wasn't \\"real\\" enough for some people. Sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review \\"V\\" Second Season","review":"In a review of \\"V\\" the rerun, second time around I was not impressed. The first one back in the 80's was much better, The acting in the second run was poor. They brought Jane Badler back to play Diana again and her character failed. Reruns on any series usually fail, I was not impressed with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great show - no ending - don't buy it!","review":"This is a fantastic show, stunning and exceptional SciFi ... that said, it has a major cliffhanger due to ABC canceling the series instead of giving it a third season finale arc. Unless you like a book with no ending, don't waste your money or time, you will be left wanting and likely will never get a finale. If another network buys it from Warner Brothers and continues it with a proper envtual finale - then by all means buy it, it is fantastic. If not, save your money for a show with a conclusion - in others words, wait and see - don't fall for this money grab without a guarantee of a conclusion.

The show had no sense of direction and while plot points were made, there was no follow through. Add an over zealous, but creative, fx company, TIIC at both ABC and Warners, mix in some greed and the fans lose out again.There's one or two good eps in this Season, surely not worth more than a dollar.Maybe if ABC was smart enough, they should of picked Kenny's V-TNG. V is his baby, let him finish the story. Instead they hire script writers and the show is plagued with micro management.All of this spells a disaster for any show.It's not that people have run out of ideas, the networks and studios don't want to pay for new ideas, just keep trying to make money off rehashing old shows or movies.People need to stop buying, watching warmed over crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please make season 3","review":"Support Project Alice to get a 3rd season of V.

He stresses the need for a return to the reformation view of justification by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone, by His death upon the cross alone. He notes how many have opted for compromise to try and achieve some form of unity within the Christian community. In doing so, they have weakened the gospel message and minimized the importance of personal faith and the imputed righteousness of Christ by God. While I would take issue with the author on a couple of minor issues, I find his discussion extremely helpful and convicting at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"FIRE\\" ....................

Easy as can be to install- just don't forget to keep the original outlet screw someplace you will NOT forget because you'll need it once the safety cover is no longer needed.

There's no way my husband can work it, for sure. In another review, someone said that with a little work, I can figure out how to \\"pop\\" it off but I'm not there yet.

Please check your outlets before ordering!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too hard to open, not suitable for all outlets","review":"I attempted to pop this thing open for about 20 minutes then gave up. It took both my husband and I 10 minutes to finally pry it open. Yes, it's childproof, but also adultproof too which is not convenient at all. It also doesn't fit all outlets. I ended up getting the Safety 1st covers because they don't have the sides that have to go into the wall, instead they protrude out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for small plugs","review":"Like most reveiwers have pointed out, it has a slim profile so it will only accomodate small plugs with normal gauge cords. No adapters, no fat extension cords. Not easy to open, but surely protects the plugs and outlet from baby hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Child and Adult Proof","review":"Bought this to keep my toddler from unplugging some important plugs (ie: tv, chest freezer, etc) It works very well and is extremely secure. I actually have a very tough time getting into this. The narrowness makes this not work for adapters or thick cords. And the two small openings at the bottom of the unit are for thinner or normal sized cords only. I had a hard time getting my thicker cords through (the surge protector and chest freezer cord). I actually broke the bottom section that separates for two cords off so the larger cords would go in more easily. When I did this I was actually only able to put one cord per cover.

There is a light that indicates when it is on properly, but once you got it on it would always pop off and then you would have to wrestle with it to get it back on. THen it never held a charge on a brand new system. It would turn off right in the middle of a game or not at all. Very frustrating for a 5 year old.

No offer to reimburse for postage! No apology for the hassles! No apology for the inconvenience!

The only thing I wish I would have known is when you push the charger down on the base you have to wait 30seconds to a minute for it to light up to show its charging. I kept taking it off and trying to reseat it expecting the light to go on quicker but once I figured it out charging is a breeze!

We have had it less than one month and the battery is dead. Regular batteries work just fine in it, but we bought the charger so we would not have to use them! I just emailed Vtech about this issue and I am hoping they not only correct it but do not make me pay S&H as they did another customer. It is horrible customer service to provide a faulty product (which they obviously are now aware of yet it is still on the shelves!!!) and then expect the customer to invest additional money to have the problem fixed. This is Vtech's problem - they need to sell a product that WORKS and for those who unfortunately bought the faulty product - replace it COMPLETELY free of charge.

The only way it would charge in the beginning was if we held down the console with our hands (naturally, that's not something I'm willing to stand there and do for several hours). The console isn't heavy enough at the bottom to push down on the button that activates charging. We'll try exchanging it for another one, but if the second one is just as bad, we'll have to go back to batteries.

Well, this one does NOT. Like many of you, we got a lemon. Charger light acts like it is charging, but it isn't. As such, it's only real value is that of a paper weight... have email into VTech... we'll see what happens. In the interim, I'd suggest just getting the 9V converter and power the thing with a plug when possible. Many of you already know you can buy an inexpensive inverter for your vehicle and simply power this (and other electronics) from the 12V in your car.

The topic is travel and far-off places, but the journey and connections with common (and not-so-common people) is the heart of the book.

I called Amazon,to get a return authorization to return the the bad product. They refused to take their product back.I can order damaged or faulty stuff from China and sell them on amazon w/o being responsible for anything.

If reading a series from the beginning what is the need for constantly repeating the history of the family (parents' accident; mother's turning in grave causing earth tremblings and quake (this is utterly ridiculous!); sister's misbehavior; etc, etc, etc). Perhaps it is to take up space and therefore make the current story line shorter and easier to write? Does the author think that everyone has a short term memory problem and/or is not very intelligent?!! This is just about ruining the series for me. Otherwise it would be mildly entertaining and vaguely informative regarding Amish and Mennonite lifestyles. If not reading a series from the get-go then it is up to the reader to figure out some of the past history and preferably start at the beginning. So the lesson of this series seems to be Repeat-Repeat-Repeat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the VHS version for now.","review":"I bought this at a 99 store and it was a total waste, since I already have it on VHS, and Family home entertainment made their VHS copy from a much better print. This has a lot of missing shots, terrible sound, murky color, green scratches down the entire picture, and I couldn't bring myself to give the rest of the dic a try. VHS has never looked so good as when I did a direct comparison to my VHS copy. I'm not sure FHE is still around, but their VHS edition was as beautiful as VHS comes, and, though competently authored with minimal artifacting, this source material makes it unacceptable.

The result is that all 12 feeding stations continue to have seed as the seeds are consumed. Most other feeders begin to deplete the uppper level ports, then the middle ones, and finally only the bottom ports have seed for the birds. With this feeder, each of the three levels individually are emptied out as the birds feed. Plus, holding 8 pounds of seed reduces the number of times it must be filled.

I don't see this as being able to withstand a lot of washings before the tube breaks.3) The birds will never be able to reach the last inch or two of seed... the lowest opening is too high. The seed will just sit there and go stale.Lucky for me this broke within the first 30 days, so I was able to return it to amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jabra BT110 too hard for others to hear","review":"I was very hopefull that this handsfree wireless headset would solve my problems.

The plot revolves around an Outlaw (Bardot)hiding out in a town, pretending to be a Doctor. Later, both women find out that there is oil on a property and fight over the land. The film is poorly dubbed, but much of the humor still translates into English. Bardot made two more films in '73, and then walked away from the silver screen forever.

She has to be one of the best songwriters -- and female vocalists -- ever. But this album is the beginning of her decline and eventual disappearance from the music scene. A lot of the tracks are simply tedious. It's almost as if she's lost interest in songwriting and is cranking out a few minutes of music. (Does anyone care to defend \\"Heads We're Dancing\\"?) Only \\"The Fog\\" somewhat holds my interest. This album makes me wonder what happened to Kate. What is she doing with herself now? It's as if the urge to express herself in her music has disappeared. Sigh..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars for a One of a Kind Album","review":"It's Christmas Day 2002 and I'm listening to one of the most exquisite albums not just of the eighties, but that I've ever heard. Kate Bush's Sensual World is not an album. The Sensual World is a state of mind requiring patience and understanding. With a beautifully rich sound and a group of musicians including Floyd's David Gilmour on guitar, Bush draws you into her world for 45 minutes with her voice of pleasure and a trio of hedonistic background singers. It really is listening pleasure. I'm encouraging Sarah, my younger sister, to listen and love this album, but it's like pulling teeth in that she is in the middle of the Aguilara and Spears moment. I hope she one day converts. I also hope you'll give it a listen. Remember; patience and understanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her best work to date. Haunting and sensual.","review":"This album was a departure for Kate Bush, which is why many people didn't like it as much. I feel that this was her best work to date, and I didn't like her earlier releases as much... while I can recognize their virtues and her talent, they weren't as appealing to my aesthetic. The Sensual World is aptly titled, and the title track continues to give me goosebumps. \\"Never be mine\\" is one of the most hauntingly beautiful songs I have ever heard, with gorgeous synth orchestrations and Kate's emotionally charged voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juast bad!","review":"This book is one of the worst I have ever read.

I will get a copy for each of them now that they are older and for grandkids. I think it's the illustrations and the simplicity of the book that babies and children like about it so much. There aren't a lot of words to it, but each reinforces what babies like and what babies do, even being naughty! Simply put, babies really can identify with the pictures and words...What baby doesn't like to be hugged and loved???One thing I think is miswritten is wher it says \\"Before you know it, they will be running and chasing all around, oh, so busily, and do lots of things by themselves.\\" I think it should say \\"doing\\" lots of things, not \\"do\\" lots of things.

If you loved this book as a child, don't think that buying this reprint will replace the one you had. This abbreviated reprint has been published with the same ISBN as the copy I have from 1985 -- fraud! They should have changed the ISBN to reflect the change in content. I'm not sure if the 1991 reprint had the missing pages or not. The new one sold now was printed in 2003. I'm writing a letter to the editor to ask for a complete reprint!

Heavy Vegetable, Thingy, Pinback, The Ladies, Other Men and his previous solo albums. There are certain things that he does that make his style stand apart from the bregga that dominates the pop charts and radio stations, although this album seems to lack them.I'd advise any fan to listen to all the tracks before purchasing this album because if they had made all the tracks available to preview, I would have skipped this one. There's a reason they only allowed one track to be sampled, and I should have realized that even IT wasn't good enough for my tastes.Let's hope he doesn't loose the edge he once had on previous solo albums.

I found this book a must read for anyone who has a developmentally challenged child or adult. In working with brain disorders and brain injuries, I always look to the bowel in the course of the examination because, 'if the bowel ain't happy, the brain ain't either!' There is so much more that is not in this book about the bowel that affects the brain that it would take several volumes of books to elaborate on what is already known today. If you or a loved one suffer from psychological ailments, brain disorders, IBS, or even just common irregularities of the bowel,reading this book is an appropriate start to gain an understanding of basic biological processes of the bowel.Also recommended: Biological Treatments for Autism, Tissue Cleansing Through Bowel Management,"},{"rating":"2","title":"the science of digestion","review":"This book describes the author's research into the function of the digestive system, with emphasis on the amazing complexity of its neural control, which operates largely independent of the central nervous system (and independent of our consciousness as well).

The author has a sharp wit and there were a few great take-aways from the first part of the book.

He starts out by explaining the inner workings of the intestines and then proceeds on with how it really does have a mind of its own.

From the trials and tribulations of George Washington and the Continental Army trapped on Long Island(?), to sailing the high seas with Ben Franklin and privateers led by the imaginary Capt. Biddlecomb, it doesn't get any better. I was gladly transformed back in time -- with my heart pounding, and my nostrils filling with the smells of the cool salt air, burning gunpowder and splintering pine -- as WE fought to gain just one more prize. And, oh ... don't forget the political intrigue. I've since read the other three volumes, all of which are great, but this remains my first tue love. In addition, you'll find any of these sea-faring novels much easier to read than O'Brien's.

The most simple color adjustment, where you can simply change the overall amount of red, green and blue, is gone. Instead, you have to go with the MUCH more cumbersome \\"Color Balance\\" tool, wherein you have three sliders, one for Cyan to Red, one for Magenta to Green, and one for Yellow to Blue. The problem is that you have to make separate adjustments for each tone...shadow, midtone, or highlight. In other words, when you change the color of the midtones, you are NOT changing the shadows or highlights. That's two more steps. Sound complicated? It is, and it isn't a very easy tool to use and so far I have not gotten anywhere near the results I have been after.On the next update, Corel should put this handy feature back. Otherwise, stick with PSP 9...a great JASC product.

I started out using it at work to touch up my photos for newsletters, reports and presentations. It is very easy to use and has a lot of neat tools that really enhance the quality of my pictures. I love the \\"clone brush\\" tool, because it allows you to remove objects from your photos so it appears as though they were never even there! Since using Paint Shop Pro X, I have received more compliments on my photos. I recently started using it at home too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I was extremely disappointed with PSP X. I've been using PSP for a long time, but for the first time, am incredibly disappointed. PSP X lacks MANY of the features I'd come to love in PSP 8. The brower is bothersome. I liked to keep my browser open but minimized. Can't do this with PSP X. The \\"one-step photo fix\\" is horrible! I found myself going back to PSP 8 for photo fixing, but guess what... the files aren't downward compatible! Even tho' they are both labled *.pspimage. How annoying! PSP X has built-in effects.On the positive side, I do like the PSP X layer palette better. and there are some nice new tubes, and maybe some new frames. And ability to filter tubes, textures & patterns is nice.

Corel seriously killed a versatile and handy tool. I get the impression they have tried to clone it into CorelDraw without making it too obvious.The only thing I have been able to do so far is open an image and zoom in and out. The browser is pathetic compared to the PSPro 9. One example: With the old version you could drag and drop images into various folders in the folder tree on the left. With the new version of the browser, you can, for a start not see the tree. After a lot of fiddling, the tree is now on the left. Drag and dropping of images doesn't seem to work.If you enlarge the area of the browser so that you can see a decent number of images in the browser, you loose the ability to directly open images. Oh-no, sorry I am wrong! It does open the images. Behind the browser area. So you have to close the browser to get to the images you tried to load."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some improved features","review":"I love how easy the one click red-eye fix works. The one step photo fix is nicer with the added feature \\"smart photo fix\\". The other brush features are easy to use. It does a nice job removing digital camera noise.One thing I'm not really pleased with is the browser. I liked how it worked in ver. 9. I find it easier to drag and drop my photos instead of using the browser. But I felt that way when I moved from Win 98 to XP.Overall, I am satisfied with this version. Anytime there is change, you will make some good and bad choices; but I feel this is a good choice for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downhill since PSP8","review":"I've used PSP since it hit the market. PSP9 took forever to load and, aside from networking facilities, offered no advantage over PSP8 - I deleted it. PSP X loads faster than PSP9 but the user interfaces are drastically changed with no significant improvement - and the Browse Folder facility, which I use extensively with large volumes, is completely BROKEN. There's a \\"Hide Browser\\" feature that's so slow it's useless, and even with it turned off, images come up BEHIND the browser(!) Ooftah!!

Having used Version 9 in the past, I thought I was unlikely to bother with V.10. To my delight, V.10 is a quantum leap forward.

You'll be having fun in pretty short order."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENED!!!?","review":"I first started using PSP with version 2. I've happily used versions 3, 5, and 7 as they came out. I tried the demo of version 8, which was okay, but since version 9 was due to be released, I waited. Currently, I have version 7 and 9 on my WinXP machine. Version 9 has a few nice things to offer for photo editting that are not available in 7, but since 7 loads so much faster and is (for me) so much easier to use, I hardly ever boot up version 9. As for 10...well, I must echo the lament of several other reviewers. JASC had a great product..and Corel seems bent on turnng it into a POS that isn't much more useful than the photo software that comes with most good digital cameras. Most of what I do is graphic design related, with some photo editting..but not much. If you are really into doing creative things with digital photgraphs I think that Photoshop is the way to go, based on the amount of reference materials that are available (mainly because you need them!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Paint shop prox very cheap","review":"Was completely unusable as could not copy program to hard drive.

Family and friends love getting picture collages of events (great way to document the party or outing onto a single sheet, especially when some of the shots just aren't clear enough or special enough to stand alone on a larger print). The red eye removal feature is eerily accurate (how do they do that?!?) and the plethora of paint shop tools are similar to those found with Adobe Photo Shop. The main difference is that I was up and running without reading the Paint Shop Pro X manual; with Photo Shop, I had to read chapters and jot down notes to remember how to do something a month or two down the road.

I want to warn against mistaken identity in purchasing PaintShop Photo Pro X3 (or other X versions) as Paint Shop Pro X - it is not by any stretch the same product. PaintShop Photo Pro X3 is bloatware that does virtually nothing but use system resources while Paint Shop Pro X is a great photo-editing tool that rivals Adobe Photoshop in its capabilities.Caveat emptor on PaintShop Photo Pro X3.

I was able to buy the Fusion Dome and all of the fusion crew pieces at Dollar stores. I paid $7.99 for the dome at Conways and $1.50 for a pair of figures at the Dollar store. I paid a total of less than $30.00 for what would have cost $100.00. For those of you that want extra fusion crew figures, check out your Dollar stores and Conways. Your kids will thank you for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for a 3 year old","review":"I just received this toy for my 3 year old son's birthday and it is not as I expected. The dome says it is for 3 and older however you need be able to read to understand how this \\"game\\" works. Children of 3 do not understand using cards. I see it having little play value and should be sold for older children. I hope the toy store will take it back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible toy and misleading advertising","review":"This toy not only is a rip off but a huge disappointment to the child waiting for the two figure to fuse in the dome. What a waste of money BUT more important how sad to see my 5 year old so disappointed in a Santa. Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"My sone received this as a gift and was very excited about it at first, but as another reviewer mentioned, it quickly becomes frustrating if you don't follow the directions EXACTLY. After a few minutes he gave up and moved on.I finally donated it to charity with my son's blessing - and this is a kid who saves everything!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great game for siblings of different abilities.","review":"My newly-turned 3 year old son, and his 5 year old brother have a great time with this game! The announcer clearly states the directions, and the boys are learning to follow them correctly. If they fail to do so, the announcer gives them another chance to try it again. Although the concept of the environmental strengths is too difficult for my younger son, my five year old has no trouble consistently choosing the correct figures for the environment. It's a fun game, which they can play together with a minimum of adult assistance. Good going, Fisher Price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"My 4 yr old begged and begged for this toy and I finally gave in when I found it on clearance. After playing with it for maybe an hour, even he said \\"Mommy, this was a waste of money!\\" If he doesn't follow the directions exactly in the order said, or tries to skip ahead, the game is unable to keep up and then he gets frustrated. I'm really glad we didn't pay anything close to full price for this useless piece of plastic"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating but sometimes fun","review":"Sadly, it took me a while to figure how to play this game. lol. It's definently too complex for a 3 year old to play it properly (finding the strongest competitor for each environement, etc.), . The very frustrating part is 9 out of 10 times when we go to \\"fuse\\" characters together, it machine says \\"not recognized\\", which this basically then makes it impossible to play. Not sure what the solution is, but i'm pretty annoyed at this point. If it were working properly it would be 5 stars, but right now it's 1 star for me since it never works properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loads of Fun!","review":"My [kid] wanted this for Christmas. Since we couldn't talk him out of it we bought it. He loves it. We bought 3 extra sets of people so he has a lot of choices. He's eagerly waiting for them to come out with the new people.He is able to follow the directions and has figured out how to read the cards so he can find the best guys for the different regions.This is not a toy a [small kid] could do on their own. However my [kid] loves to play with his brother, who helps him figure out what to do. They will play happily together in one of their rooms for about 30-45 minutes. That about the maximum limit on the 3 year olds attention span for any toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"best among ten Je T'Aime Traum CD.","review":"I have brought 11 of Anthony Ventura's CDs (Je T'Aime Traum 1-10 and \\"music for making love\\").
