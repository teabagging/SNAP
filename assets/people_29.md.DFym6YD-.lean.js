The songs on horror show are huge sounding and pull off very well live. Horror show is a concept album that pays tribute to many of the classic monsters. My personal favorite is Damien. Iced earth play poweful epic metal, simular to old Metallica mixed with Blind Guardian. Iced Earth have the potential to be the biggest metal band on the planet. This is true heavy metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"It deserves the rating it gets.","review":"What can I say... such a FANTASTIC album! This is the CD that got me really into Iced Earth. Well... I listened to almost all its mp3 first. But I still decided to buy this CD as my support towards the band and for better quality of this great CD. Others have already rated each track and stuff so I'll just save some time here... Basically, I like the theme of this concept album. Lyrics are deep and emotional, not just some random phrases describing creatures. My all time favorite has to be DAMIEN and PHANTOM OPERA GHOST. Man... these 2 tracks are enough of a reason to purchase this album! As others, I LOVE how Iced Earth is able to put in melodic element into their HEAVEY metal music to make a coherent whole. Progressions are also well-placed. In short, this is ONE OF THE BEST METAL ALBUMS OUT THERE."},{"rating":"2","title":"It only took one song....","review":"I never really heard too much about Iced Earth until a fellow soldier played \\"Ghost of Freedom\\".

But I don't want a refund, damn it, I want the product that is being advertised!!!Having been a VERY loyal Amazon.com customer for several years, and having encouraged others to buy from Amazon.com, I HIGHLY resent having my time wasted by this false advertising (not to mention the run around that I am getting in trying to correct the problem).I'm going to be alot less likely to order from Amazon.com in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense heavy metal","review":"Absolute going under your skin, especially 'Dracula'.

Taken from unreleased demos made shortly before his death and released posthumously a year after it, this album is surely one of the worst albums ever made by a truly legendary artist. His ballads are the weakest of any album in his career, others like \\"Sanctified Lady\\" are too robotic to be good for somebody like him, and \\"Masochistic Beauty\\" is such an unforgivable atrocity that sometimes I can't help but wonder if it was what Marvin and his father were arguing about when he was killed."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Its all good.'","review":"IF M GAY HAD TO0 HAVE A LAST CD, THIS ONE, DREAM OF A LIFE TIME, IS THE BEST THAT HE, OR ANY ONE COULD HOPE FOR.

Most songs are done very well, thanks to the artist and the top-notch backup band. Too many highlights to mention, but some of my favorites are Stevie Wonder doing 'Blowing in the Wind' in a soulful ballad, Eric Clapton doing some incredible guitar work on \\"Love Minus zero-no limit' and \\"Don't think twice it's allright', and the song with Dylan, 'My back pages' where Clapton, Neil Young, Tom Petty and others do guitar solos.

Most tribute type concerts don't live up to the hype. This one does. Great performances throughout. A shame its not on DVD. Overall, the audio and video quality of the VHS is first rate (for VHS). Pretty much all the artists come through with outstanding performances of their songs though the Johnny Cash/June Carter rendition of It Ain't Me Babe comes off like a throw away. Also, includes the historic appearance of Sinead O'Connor to a chorus of boos shortly after her SNL \\"incident\\". If this is the low point, its quickly overcome by a couple of great Neil Young performances to end Tape #1.

Sinead O' Connor's defiant tribute to the \\"other\\" Bob by speaking \\"War\\" a capella was courageous and to be respected. All she did was dare to criticise the Pope, the leader of a church who have perpetuated centuries of oppression of women. The boneheads who booed her were ignorant cowards.

For example, when George Harrison first came out, he sang \\"If Not For You\\"-where is that song on the Video and CD? Was it a mistake? I am also disappointed in the Mixing--they (Columbia) made it way too \\"commercial\\" in that the rawness of the music is missing. For example, towards the end of the song \\"My Back Pages\\" (a highlight of the Concert) Neil Young sang the final \\"Ah, but I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now\\" as a solo. They kept the camera on him but when you hear the rest of the people singing-it looks and sounds strange. If they ever put this out on DVD, I hope they won't mess with it too much.

The chapters are acollection of essays and do vary considerably.The other chapters were almost all were flawed because Hanson's polemic is based on much better understanding of the Classics and, to some degree, the West than the contemporary world or Islam. Sometimes this is clear because either the reasoning or overly broad conclusions are visible to a careful reader. Other times the neo Con bias informs the selection and presentation more subtly.Overall more pompous than profound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fly Fishing Through the Midlife Crisis","review":"This book puts it all together, lifes high and low spots, our successes and failures, and the drive to overcome the challenges presented by these situations. It makes one realize that there is a degree of \\"The Redneck Way\\" in all of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Fishing Book--And Not A Fisherman","review":"Do not waste your time on this book if fishing is your interest. Raines is using an interesting topic as another opportunity to slip a little more of his political liberalism out to the world by casually working in slams of Reagan and others who don't fit the liberal mold. If you want to learn how a self-proclaimed Alabama red-neck saw the light and became a liberal editor for the New York Times, it's your nickel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Net This and Keep It","review":"Ignore what the right-wingers say and judge this one for yourself, if you love the outdoors and streams where the fish rise. It's not quite what Penick's \\"Red Book\\" is to golf, but it comes closer than any other book of its type."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fly fishing through a self-induced sense of knowledge.","review":"The book's central goal is admirable, but is marred by the author's inability to recognize that he does not have all the answers. As a result, one is left with the clear view that Raines is a self-righteous windbag. For example, he proclaims the northern outpost of the redneck way of fishing ends in Maryland. Guess this not-it-all has not been to northern PA. or parts of the Midwest. In spite of this, the fishing stories are entertaining. Their impact is muted, however, for all but the rich, liberal fly fisher because of the author's politics being injected in the book. This makes the book more useful for the feel-good liberal, rather than the sincere fly-fisherman. Judge you tolerance for this, and get it if you are one of these types."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my style...sorry","review":"A coworker of mine let me borrow this book to read...because he knew I liked fly fishing books. I think I could have very easily put this book down and not finished reading it. I really do not care to spend my free time reading about politics but it's 4 degrees outside and my flyline keeps freezing to the ground so I decided to continue on. What I found was an author who learns how to come to terms with his mortality through the death of a close friend. I think if he had listened to his preacher as a child instead of shunning him he might not have wasted so much of his life fearing death. If you're looking for a book to help solve your mid-life crisis I wouldnt read this book. Try reading the Bible. I'm giving this book 1 star because it's a flyfishing book and another star for the recipes which I may try some day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better spend your time fishing than reading this","review":"This book seems to split people into 2 camps - either you love it or hate it. I was told it was one of those 'must read' books, a seminal tome. In fact I found it grossly self indulgent, over sentimental and boring - I struggled to get through it in the hope that something of interest would appear. It didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book on fishing and life","review":"I've read Raines book and enjoyed it thoroughly. Taken on it's own merit, it is an insightful book about the journey from one kind of fishing to another, a journey that is also an analogy for life. Along the way, Raines offers his political views, but to argue as the other reviewers on this page have done that the book is of poor quality because Raines is a liberal is silliness. Sure, his views may be disagreeable to some, but they are his way of inserting his voice and experience into his writing. The writing itelf is rich and the insights are perceptive. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fishing or Politics?","review":"A friend of mine lent me this book to read. I made it about 2/3 of the way through and had to put it down for good. Although the books is well written, engaging, and interesting, Raines can't stay away from launching political barbs. (I think many of us will all agree that Hoover was a poor president, but Raines can't keep from repeatedly driving that point home. It gives one the impression as though Hoover had it out for Raines' own family.) I'm not sure what all that has to do with fly fishing. His inability to keep his politics seperate from any other aspect of his life is quite obvious in the content of the NY Times, which he is now the Editor in Chief. If you're looking for a light read about the adventures of fly fishing, I recommend Harry Middleton or John Gierach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the part about Midlife Crisis?","review":"Maybe my crisis is so intense I missed this topic on the book. I purchased this book in the attempt of finding some more information about men midlife crisis. But if you intend on buying this book for the same reason, don't.There's absolutely nothing valuable about the subject, and frankly, the fly-fishing part (almost everything else) is not even interesting. I'm not a fisher, but a well-written book will get your attention about any subject. This one is just a compilation of small autobiographical chronicles with doubtful choice of sequence.Perhaps good if you are a fly-fisher or want to know some meaningless political stories.

I bought mine at Lowe's and it was the only kind they carried. When I noticed the thread underneath the nose, I asked the salesman about it. He told me that it was just another accessory and that all I had to do was disconnect it and throw it away. When I installed the spout, I took it off like he said and all the water began to come out from the hole when I pull the knob to redirect it to the shower. The shower head had water dripping instead of spraying out. I turned it off and reattached the thread. Now water came out of the shower head, slightly weaker than it did when we had our old spout attached, and water shot out of that bottom nozzle, rather than just pouring out. This is a waste of money and now, not only am I going to have to make another trip to Lowe's to return it, but then I'll have to go to another hardware store entirely to purchase a new one."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great book for parenting through all ages and stages!","review":"I read this book before I had my son, and I loved it.

I cannot just \\"let it happen.\\" This book has also made me take a hard look at myself and realize areas where I have faulty thinking and need to work on personal growth.

I have a two year old and an infant and feel much better prepared to raise them to serve God in their lives.I can't stop talking to my friends about how practical, simple, and easy-to-apply the principles of this book are - I'm reading the book again because it is so full of great information that I have to absorb it for a second time.I do believe that this book has to be put into practice BEFORE a child reaches their teen years, simply because that is a time when children become adults and it could be more difficult to apply boundaries only if you have not started the boundaries when they were young. If your child is a teen already, this book might just frustrate you because it will make you wish you had started earlier...just to be honest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing, over complicates things","review":"This book has good points but the questions tend to ask a lot of abstract questions.

Many great points throughout the book, such as how parents can and should avoid extreme anger and manipulating behavior when disciplining their children, but I feel a much better overall approach to dealing with challenging behavior in children can be found in a book called \\"The Explosive Child\\", but Dr. Ross Greene. \\"The Explosive Child\\" is great for parents of all children, but can be especially helpful for those dealing with severely challenging children. This book has changed my entire paradigm of how to relate to children. Though Dr. Greene's book is not written from a Christian viewpoint, it might as well be!

I definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recipe For A Successful Life","review":"This book Brea And Butter by Tom McMakin is an excellent way of looking at life. The most amazing thing about this book was how successful each person who joined the Great Harvest Company was. With each person working only 40 hours per week even the CEO and Managers. It's a wounderful recipe for life and a key to being happy and succesful with whatever profession you choose. Regardless if it's not the Business World."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Review","review":"This book was enlightening and enjoyable. Not only did it shed light on a utopia of sorts in business, but persuaded me so much i feel compelled to start my own business. Although business is not something i find appealing this book created an ideal of what a business should be and how it can affect those who work there. McMakin takes the reader on a journey of self discovery and \\"work discovery\\". Through this book one is able to understand the importance of a job well done and a job that appreciates you as a equal and as an idividual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bread and Butter...not bad","review":"I didn't think that a book I was reading for an economics class would be very interesting, however, this book proved me wrong. I actually read every page and enjoyed it very much. At times I felt like there was too much repetition, but overall it was very interesting and boy did it make me crave bread. I was intrigued by all the different aspects there are in one bread company. Tom's perspective on Great Harvest added lot to this books charm. He not only showed the happy, perfect world of the owners of the different stores, but he also gave his insight on the company. I would definitly recommend this book to anyone interested in starting a business. It was pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bread and Butter","review":"I enjoyed this book. Although McMakin could have been a bit more concise, his excitement and passion for the Great Harvest Bread Co. kept me reading. The values he preaches are refreshing, and I would recommend it to anyone going into business for themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book","review":"This is the first VB.Net book I've found that really explains the language. I own about 8 other VB.Net books and I'm constantly asking questions like, \\"why am I typing ByVal and what does it mean?,\\" or \\"what's really happening when I call a function?\\" So many of the books I currently own have left me with too many unanswered questions. I'd be willing to bet that as he wrote this book, Purdum was constantly asking himself what kinds of questions the reader would ask. Every new concept is given a thorough explanation. The book gets very detailed about how things work in VB.Net, but it is written so well it is easly understood by a beginner. Purdum definitely doesn't gloss over anything.If I had to purchase just one VB.Net book as a beginner, this book would be it.

I'm not an expert so I can't compare the quality of the image, it looks good to me.Problems are the constant buzz and the height adjustment, which were both mentioned here.The monitor is way too bright, and when you reduce the brightness a constant, very annoying buzz starts. With all the noise in an office environment, it may not be a problem, but at home, where it's silent, this bugs me a lot.The height is not adjustable and very low.

To me, that doesn't mean squat when it's not pleasing to the eye. The colors on the screen are not consistent; it's brighter on the bottom then on the top. If you look at it while moving your head up and down, you'll see it change. That's why you get a difference when you're looking at it straight on. The new, cheaper TN panels they're using have a different viewing angle than previous ones. A lot of the monitors the electronics stores sell are of this type. The display models are deceiving, because they run a video loop that makes the picture look beautiful. But, when you get it home and start running your apps on it, that's when you start seeing the flaws. Also, this model has an annoying blinking, blue light when it's in sleep mode."},{"rating":"2","title":"All I can say is WOW!","review":"Received this monitor last week and the wife is jealous, lol.

What makes this book special is the attention to detail the author brings to the topic. Many books have been written about this traumatic time in US history but this one examines the political involvement of other countries. Using a brother vs brother tale as his vehicle, Hart records the impact one foreign concern had on even the smallest confrontations. Be prepared to be amazed at all you will learn while enjoying the exploits of the Norton brothers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well investigated","review":"As a foriegner, I'm especially interested in US History and definitely look at it from a different perspective.

The rest are, well, more suited for the dance floor, although diehard Ricky Martin fans will beg to differ.Don't concentrate too much on the lyrics, it's really quite trivial, but hey, it's pop music, not the Star Spangled Banner.So enjoy it, I know you will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"What a nice product!

Filmed in the late years of the WW2, and after making the penetrating and Faustian \\"Devil and Mr. Webster\\", Dieterle decided to bet for this tongue in the cheek movie; inspiring in Budu saved from waters, the central character is a sympathetic and talented beggar who practices magic and decides to break the walls with just an intention in mind: to bring the expected happiness of his daughter who is love with a Caliph; but on the road there will be more laughable and funny situations.Marlene Dietrich stole the show with her erotic appearance in an Arabian dance painted of gold (a pioneer device for Goldfinger, perhaps?).Go for this version that to my mind remains several echelons respect the 1955 version.

I have a multitude of French learning materials but this approach is something very different.

It would be nice if someone would write one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this & read Riddlemaster again","review":"When McKillip's good, she's very very good, and when she's bad it comes out like this. As in many of her other books, McKillip deals with mysterious characters who live on the edge between reality and dream. However, here she errs by making the character who should be mysterious her narrator. This makes all Roisin's eccentric behavior (slipping off into the forest to commune with the brook, that sort of thing) seem like a pose. A real child of nature, living by instinct, wouldn't be writing this book; a narrator, by definition, has to be self-conscious, and Roisin shouldn't be. It's too bad, because this could have been a good one if told from a different point of view."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating fantasy","review":"This book would be a wonderful read even without a plot due to Ms McKillip's remarkable prose. It does, however, have an interesting plot, and will definitely not be the last book of hers that I read. Do not miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible prose that works its story right into your bones","review":"McKillip's always beautiful prosereaches a new level of hauntinglyricism here. The language is rareand rewarding and it communicatesthe story straight into your heart andbones. While most writers render astory into language, McKillip wrestsher stories from the language itself.This one is luminous, wrenching,gorgeous, and powerful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely beautiful!","review":"A gorgeous, rich, complex story framed in McKillip's trademark lyrical prose. Rois was an amazing character and makes a wonderful and magical narrator. You see the world from her not-completely-human perspective and it really comes to life. The ending is a bit confusing, though--does Corbet forget everything from the other world? Is he now fully human? Did he ever love Rois at all (or Laurel, for that matter) or was he just using them to become human and to escape the other world? Still, it is a beautiful, magical tale that I was sad to see end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written, but that's about it","review":"I adore Patricia McKillip's work, so when I saw this, I bought it immediately. Unfortunately, it just didn't deliver. Her prose is lyrical, as usual, but the story just didn't interest me. Halfway through the book, I was still waiting for it to get started. I've shared it with my friends, hoping that they would spot something I didn't and the verdict was unanimous. Dud. A real disappointment from an artist that usually can't be faulted."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dreamy tale","review":"I just recently finished this book for the second time. The first, I didn't really grasp it. This time around, however, I did. It's a dreamy tale about the wild, wood-loving Rois, the cursed Corbet Lynn, and Rois's sensible sister, Laurel. Ms. McKillip weaves a tale of unspoken love and a disasterous curse the villagers think will come true. When Corbet Lynn returns to his family home to rebuild, he brings with him mystery. Rois is the only one who can see him for who he truly is. I think what bothered me most about the book was that the author did not tie up the loose end about Rois's mother. I really wanted to know who/what she was/is. However, I loved the end when Corbet asks Rois to look at the rose vines intertwined with ivy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Use of Imagery","review":"I thought that this book used a wonderful use of description and imagery. There was no plot, but the description certainly made up for it. The only problem that I had with the book was it's ending. It seemed to abruptly stop. However, this leaves you to use your imagination. Overall, a truly amazing story."},{"rating":"1","title":"confusing and lacking info","review":"I thought that Winter Rose was just a piece of confusing mumbo jumbo. It's hard to recognize whether Rois is dreaming or in reality because sometimes the author doesn't state the fact that Rois is conscious or not. There are other reasons that made the plot hard to follow. The characters didn't give enough information on this \\"other world\\" that Corbet came from. How did it form? Is Nial, Corbet, and the \\"witch\\" the only inhabitants? Also, the ending leaves too much questions. Does Corbet still love Laurel? What does Rois feel? How did Corbet escape from the other world? Finally, the narrator, Rois, was too mysterious. The point of view should have been in third person, not the wild wood-child. Some of the discriptions by Rois was skimpy and perplexing.Though I love fantasy (and this book is definitely fantasy), Winter Rose was just too weird and puzzling for me to really like and understand the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring storyline.

Okay so here's the scoop- this book was terrible. First off, the main character was OBSESSED with the man and it was absolutley confusing to the point of annoying that you didn't know what the heck he was. I was EXTREMELY disapointed because i had just finished reading a VERY good book by this author, In The Forest Of Serre (this i recommend). Also, the plot was so repetitive, i couldn't even finish the darn book! And i'm glad i didn't because i read the ending and it was horrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This was the first book by Patricia McKillip that I read. I was hooked after that.

In fact her characterisation in general was wonderful. And the basis for a plot was undeniably there. But it just didn't develop. It was vague and gossamer like, and at the end I was so sorry, because I could have loved it if it was a little more substantial, but it was so airy it fell flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"the standard?\\"","review":"supposedly, this book is the standard for logic design in undergrad courses, but i found a couple of things really difficult about this text.1) lack of examples2) poor printing qualityfor the price, i'd expected a bit better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I got this book for a Circuits course.

Outside of the realm of paper writing, where sourcing isn't an issue, this is a practical guide for crisis intervention for anyone who might need such information.The inclusion of vicarious trauma, the actual definition of what crisis is (the reaction to an activating event and not the event itself) and warnings about interfering with the natural coping mechanisms by acting too fast make this invaluable.

I bought this record a few years ago and have only listened to it once because it is awful. First, there is a constant buzz that will make you want to kill yourself throughout the entire record and the sound quality is quite subpar. Second, most of the track names are heinously erroneous. The first track is really \\"Night In Tunisia\\" and track six is really \\"Quasimodo\\" for instance. As a result of buying this album, I am boycotting all CDs published by Delta and LazerLight Digital. If you need an inexpensive introduction to Bird, buy the \\"Best of\\" from the Ken Burns series. Better yet, trust me and buy the immortal \\"Bird and Diz\\" with Thelonious Monk, Curly Russel and Buddy Rich making up the rhythm section. In any case, don't waste your money on this embarassing album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much buzz and static !!","review":"How can the great combination of Bird and Miles be worth only one star ?

Having served in the military I do not approve of Adkisson's MO (modus operandi) during his earlier years, particularly while in a liberty status outside the boundaries of a military installation, and I question the basis upon which some of his more seasoned considerations and decisions came into play later in his military career. I found the book entertaining in that Adkisson invariably came out smelling like a rose regardless of the appropriateness or inappropriateness of his activities. The youth of today's military would achieve very little success were they to attempt following Adkisson's lead as their role model however I do believe they would thoroughly enjoy reading of his experiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"An impressive accomplishment","review":"With my not being in the US Navy, I was very impressed with the descriptive manner used to explain the naval lifestyle aboard ship and the relationship between pay grades.

In this case the mid-eightees were the beginning of college. It was the pinnacle of brief period of pop music that took place between disco and grunge.Everyone who has heard any music from the eightees is probably familiar with the first two tracks...they were both big radio and MTV hits that still hold up quite well almost 25 years later. The great thing about this album though is its depth. There is not a clunker on this album and one might argue that songs like \\"Nervous Night,\\" \\"Where Do The Children Go,\\" and \\"All You Zombies\\" might be the best songs the band ever recorded.Latter work from the band found them crafting the occassional good song with a great hook, but nothing compares with this front to back.

Now I have it on CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Debut","review":"The Hooters were given a national spotlight after Rob Hyman co-wrote the classic \\"Time After Time\\" with Cyndi Lauper. They responded well with this successful and strong album. The first single, \\"All You Zombies\\", was a swipe at organized religion, a frank call to believers. The follow-up, \\"And We Danced\\" is one of the more underrated singles of the 80's; and \\"Day By Day\\" is a catchy, high energy song that showed the entertainment value of this tight band. The rest of the album is equally solid, including the excellent \\"Where Do The Children Go\\", a direct look at the lost generation of 80's teenagers. The strengths of this band were always their direct lyrics and high enthusiasm; and both are well evidenced on this album. Most consider this band a one-album wonder, which would be an unfortunate mistake, because their next album \\"One Way Home\\" is in my view one of the great albums of the 80's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Party Music","review":"Nervous Night by The Hooters is one of my all time favorite albums.And We Danced...Nice Opener. An essential party anthem.Day By Day...Another uptempo fun pop party music.All You Zombies...Remnicent a bit of Cyndi Lauper's Time After Time. No wonder. They made some of Cyndi Lauper hits.Don't Take My Car Out Tonight...The Cars should have covered this. Nice rocker.Nervous Night...Another great pop rock sure to go well with party mood.Hanging By A Heartbreak...My #1 favorite. Great after-party music.Where Do The Children Go?...Excellent Songwriting.

His message is direct and, at times, biting. Spurgeon is not afraid to challenge his readers to a high level of dedication and servanthood. Using themes like \\"The Obedience That Faith Produces,\\" Spurgeon touches on issues that many ministers neglect. Although at times the reading is slightly tedious, modern day analogies and a skillful use of language and literary techniques give the reader an enjoyable reading experience, overall. Spurgeon relies heavily upon scripture, both from the Old and New Testaments. Several of Christ's most neglected (and crucial) teachings are highlighted. For instance, \\"If you love me, you will obey my commandments,\\" is a teaching which is discussed broadly. For those who are seeking and intimate relationship with the Lord, \\"Being God's Friend\\" would be an excellent supplement to the Bible ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regulator leaks- danger","review":"I have owned the grill for a few years...true enough...But now the regulator is leaking- explosive and dangerous.Getting parts has proved to be impossible.

As a masters student in clarinet performance who takes professional auditions, I feel that this book does draw much needed attention to self awareness in music.

While the book may have value to some, the grandiose and verbose treatment of the material was a little to much for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little.","review":"I don't usually write bad things about anything, but this book is very little of anything. It is mostly blank space and almost no real information at all. I finished it, and felt that I got almost nothing at all.

Sorry for being negative, but I could not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Filling the Void","review":"This book easily fits into both categories of music and spirituality. In fact, it should be required reading for any creative and artistic person. Music, like all creative endeavors, is a manifestation of the person's interior life. The more conscious the musician is of the self, the greater his/her ability to bring music into the world. The author has definitely made a significant contribution to an area of musical life that deserves to be explored, discussed, and taught. Young musicians will find much wisdom in the author's insights and his words will resonate among those of us more seasoned in the art. Every serious student of music should add this to his/her library. Conscientious teachers of music should recommend, if not review, this book with their students."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I just wanted to say that I had to read this book and write three, two page essays on it. My only problem was, there was nothing to write about. He says the same thing different ways. I really don't see what people are getting out of this book. If you're a human being with emotion and you understand music's emotional neediness, then you don't need this book. I don't usually write negatively about things, but this book just upset me because there are people actually buying into everything and paying for a book that common sense would tell them already. If you have half a brain, you don't need this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Scholarly Study of the Passion Narrative","review":"The depth of Brown's scholarship is marvelous. Brown parses and analyzes each verse of every gospel story with insight and precision. It is a testament to his even-handedness that he draws criticism from the religious right as well as the avant garde iconoclasts who inhabit the left wing of modern Biblical scholarship.

The student must invest a good deal of effort in reading and understanding this book, but the diligent student will find the reward well worth the extra effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death of the Messiah","review":"This is a very scholarly, theologically oriented text.

Now.","review":"It does what it's supposed to do and that is to tune your drum heads. The biggest difference in sound that I noticed were in my toms. I always kept the tom heads somewhat loose to give it a lower tone, but once I tuned them to the suggested drum dial number, my set sounded so much better.This is the next best thing I've invested in when it comes to playing drums (the drum set being #1, of course)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute crap","review":"I can never get my drums anywhere NEAR sounding like a drum should, I have tried, and tried, and tried, and tried and failed every time. It is a HUGE source of frustration and anger for me. So I bought a drum dial, the reviews sounded great. It looked easy to operate and I was sure this is what I needed. I was wrong. It has been absolutely zero help. The reading varies greatly, even if I don't change the tension. I can put it down and it will read 74. Lift it directly up and put down and now it's on 76. These are brand new fresh heads. I will try and set every lug to let's say 76, then I go round again and it's all over the place. What a joke. Massive waste of money.

I've been playing and recording for years and years and I have gotten really good at doing this by ear. However this takes my ability to get really close and lets me get dead on.

If you like a big pocket knife this is the one to get. It has however been discontinued so you might want to grab one soon. I also have a Junkyard Dog II with the G-10 handle and it seem to be a little bit better. It's only a flipper but it's an up grade to the this one. I will say this.

It shows the battle as both the great victory it was, and as a series of mistakes and missed opportunities. The campaign as a predecessor for D-Day is presented also. I would have liked to have seen more names of officers and more information about specific units. The author is capable of being very technical, but for the most part stays away from military technical jargon. This is not a teaching treatise for West Point; nor is it fluff for an ABC mini-series.

And what a solo debut it is! Nine fabulous tracks that haven't lost their strength over the years. Alison's emotive and ruminative voice has a depth many other female singers lack. Though the production by Jolley/Swain tends to be a bit slick, Alison 'Alf' Moyet saves the album from mediocrity with her soulfulness. Alf's songwriting-skills are impressive and her songs emit power. 'Love Resurrection' makes you spin around the room, while 'All Cried Out' makes you want to belt the song in full volume. The latter being the best song on the album. 'Where Hides Sleep' brings out the restlessness in you, as does 'Money Mile'. A praising review, but why only 4 stars you may ask. Simply because Moyet's albums 'Hoodoo', 'Essex' and 'Singles' are a bit better."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a debut","review":"Alison sings like no one else. What a recording.

The transfer is pretty good considering a 1964 movie but there are a few spots in the movie where the transfer suffers, but only briefly.

So, why would I complain about it? Probably because it feels quite out of tone with the material before it. It's more like a sequence I would expect from one of Clint Eastwood's more bleak Westerns, like his Spaghetti trilogy. Still, this sequence isn't anywhere as much a betrayal to the film as the \\"twist.\\"As for the performances, both Eastwood and Shirly MacLaine are good. Eastwood is as enjoyable to watch as ever and gets some good laughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"lame western","review":"tough to knock anything the late/capable don siegel helmed... can't say it's his fault, either. film doesn't hold up.male lead is dull to the point it's painful to watch. the always credible shirley maclaine (particularly in this type of role) does what she can to keep the tale interesting... alas, it is not enough.even the competant score by gifted Ennio Morricone does not really help matters much."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"They did a great job putting this on dvd. glad to add it to my collection. keep the oldies coming."},{"rating":"2","title":"memory lane","review":"It was a long time ago that I saw this movie and I had almost forgotten it.

Well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN ENCHANTING WESTERN","review":"TWO MULES FOR SISTER SARA stars Shirley MacLaine as a call girl masquerading as a nun in order to evade French soldiers and accomplish her work as a spy for Mexican rebels. Her performance is spellbinding! Her straight man in the movie is the great Clint Eastwood in the image and role that he made famous: the strong, silent drifter turned mercenary. The two meet up and the result is screen magic. Their on-screen chemistry rivals some of the great duos of film history. Together they manage to dupe the French, save the day and fall in love.Directed by Don Siegel, TWO MULES FOR SISTER SARA is an enchanting western that allows Eastwood to show a lighter, softer side and Shirley MacLaine is the perfect star for the role of Sara. To top it all off Ennio Morricone provides a wonderful soundtrack with a signature title track and a score that is comparable with those that he composed for ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY and A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS.THE HORSEMAN"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what you might expect from Eastwood.","review":"This movie is very entertaining because it has fun and almost parodies the typical westerns. MacLaine shines in this film and holds her own against Eastwood's more traditional persona.

Eastwood & MacLaine work well together to make this a memorable movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid from beginning to end. Shirley obviously NOT a nun.","review":"How stupid do they think we are?

Each pony gets a picture and a poem. The poems are kind of bad (they sound like they were hastily made up and never revised), but toddlers really don't seem to care about that sort of thing. They are simple and catchy enough for kids to remember and give a basic education on each pony's personality.

Now there is a 12\\" hole from where the seams are supposed to be joined. We only started grilling in May so it is not from overuse. Would not recommend this to anyone.

We have decided a couple gromets on both sides and a bungi cord from front to back will work for us. My concern is that with Idaho winds it would get blown off if not secured.

But so far it seems much better than previous covers. Lots of other covers have cracked in the winter, and this one has held up well so far this winter. It doesn't go all the way to the ground, so on really windy it days, it does start to blow up, and could potentially blow off. It has handled rain and snow well so far, and doesn't feel as stiff (brittle) in the cold as previous covers. The material is thick and hopefully will last long. The colors are nice, but that part wasn't critical to me. We'll see if they fade with time. Overall, it is my favorite cover to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"Fit nicely over my grill. I had to give it 4 stars because it has nothing on the ends to make it fit more snuggly when the wind is blowing or the weather is generally bad.

Lighting is virtually non existent, sound appears to have been recorded live with no thought about audibility, dialogue is a long litany of cliches and the actors only light up when they are smoking cigarettes (there's a lot of smoking acting in the film, presumably because someone told the director this adds depth to the characters)."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesnt follow the title","review":"this movie was bad I mean I thought when I saw the title it meant that these army or navy or armed forces would take on a whole hord of Nazi zombies like the title says and it didn't the story line sucked it was to predictable and the ending was horrible I was generous when I rated this movie 2 stars out of 5"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Nazis and very little zombies","review":"This movie was a stinker.

It has bad production, horribly bad instrumentation, visciously bad arrangements, excruciatingly bad vocals, and an indescribably bad cover. If you like Elton John, you'll like this CD! And that says more than I ever could! The songs themselves are not horrible, it is just the way they were crafted that makes it so utterly sickening to listen to. If I were you, I'd buy Planet Waves, Blood on the Tracks, Oh Mercy or Time Out of Mind and hear the works of genius, not the works of a demented tired musical wanderer, who was apparently out of ideas, hope, and musical direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great effort","review":"I just ask you one thing - why he shouldn't be a pop musician from time to time, rest from all those poetic images, expectations...?

But even at his worst, Bob is still the best. People like to jump on the bandwagon and say that between \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" and \\"Oh Mercy\\", Dylan had lost his muse. But if anyone else had released \\"Empire Burlesque\\", this admittedly mediocre album, they would be hailed as the \\"new Dylan\\" and a genius.If you have the money, I suggest you invest in the Bootleg Series 1-3, and listen to what Bob was recording at the time but not releasing.

I own almost every other Dylan album and consider Bob to be the best with 15 of his albums in my top 100. I have put off buying this one because I knew it was going to be bad or at least bad for Dylan. Even the cover picture is a little weak. My preconceptions were all correct and I wish that I hadn't spent the three dollars from the vinyl bin at a local bookstore.If you really want all the Dylan albums much like me, don't expect much. It isn't as bad as any Winger album but it is probably, in my humble opinion, the worst Dylan album and should be the last one that any fan should buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pain.","review":"I'm a new fan to Bob Dylan's music. Oh Mercy, Another Side of Bob Dylan and Desire is where I started. After listening to Empire Burlesque I have to think that Bob somehow was blindsided by the 80's. Every cheesey production trick to come out of the 80's is on this album (reverb, background singers, glossed up production). So it's kind of a hard listen. You get through all that crap to get to the songs which aren't Bob's best (in my humble opinion). My suggestion is to stop wasting you time and move on to Bob's 90's music which is far superior to his 80's music. His 90's music is good but not as good as his 70's music. However, his 60's music is probably close to scripture at this point in a lot of peoples minds. Enter this record at your own risk. At the end of it you might be searching for spandex pants.Maybe Bob could re-record this album and free the songs of the bad production? That's a thought..."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a classic!","review":"I don't care what people say about this album, it's a belter. It's one of the most played Dylan albums in my collection and I have just about all of them. This is a whole lot more user friendly than any of his stuff from the 60s. Put me on a desert island with Empire Burlesque and Street Legal and I'll be happy. It's not often I find myself singing along to Dylan songs but with this album I do. I love the melodies, I love the lyrics and I love the production. Whoever says this is a bad Dylan album is wrong, dead wrong. It's in my Top 10 of favourite albums of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Bob Dylan; what more needs to be said?","review":"This is Bob Dylan; what more needs to be said?

I found the first CD uplifting, but when I went on to listen to the second one, I quickly became lost in a never-ending series of lists of 7 reasons for this, 6 ways to look at that, 3 factors of something else, etc. It became so confusing and demotivating that I just quit right there and haven't gone back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for insomnia....","review":"I truly believe the author made a game out of taking about 45 minutes' worth of content and stretching it out to several CD's in length. There is some good material here, but it gets covered up by endless anecdotal and honestly, dumb stories.

I seriously doubt that I'll bother to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different perspective on motivation.","review":"I have listened to this book twice and I am starting on it a third time. Particularly valuable is Beeler's presentation of the idea of \\"Rowing vs. Sailing\\" toward your goals.I'm currently looking for a print version, because the book is crowded with citations and a few silly exercises, some noted in other reviews. The entire first disc I skip through upon subsequent readings. These minor irritations should not take away from the value provided in the rest of the book.My top takeaway is the material regarding how to write down your intentions and goals using appropriate wording/syntax to create a valid, believable intention or goal for yourself. In the end, you cannot fool yourself into thinking something you do not internally believe. Beeler provides good points to follow as you set quality intentions and achievable goals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive and disapointing","review":"As with many such books this one starts with the regurgitation of other motivational authors' ideas with a few original and thought provoking passages of its own. Then part way through, the author chooses to inflict upon us his right wing, Christian fundamentalist views.Now, most motivational authors mention spirituality in some context, but Beeler evangelicises for chapter after chapter.If I want a book about Christianity I will seek one out. I do not appreciate having the hard sell for Jesus sprung upon me in this way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I listened to the audio version. The author seems to have done his homework when putting the book together. References one study after another. However it is painfully boring. It comes across like a dry college lecture.

Interesting to listen to and easy to see the amazing results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, second edition can be better","review":"What a great idea for a book. Very entertaining look at a handful of classic, mostly-American, pop songs. The origin of each song is described (that's the most interesting part) and then there's a pretty detailed run through of many of the recorded versions (that can get a bit tedious, especially if you're unfamiliar with the versions discussed).What it lacks is an index, and a formal discography. It would have also been nice if the lyrics of each song had been printed, and maybe the actual written music as well. Friedwald often describes the structure of the song by using the lyrics as guide posts, and that left me high and dry sometimes since I was, I'm ashamed to say, unfamiliar with some of these songs--I couldn't even hum St. Louis Blues, let alone recall any lyrics. A companion CD--or CDs--would have been nice as well, but that idea may be a little impractical.Those flaws aside, I'd recommend this to anyone with any interest in the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Interesting Musical Journey","review":"Friedwald addresses twelve great musical standards, and at his best, brings them and their creators to life in light and personal writing.Friedwald is not a grumpy old stick-in-the-mud, the kind who believes that all Good Music ended when Those Damn Kids plugged in their guitars. One of the things that is so engaging about the book is the breadth of his discussion (even Eminem and napster make appearances in this book).There a points when the book becomes a discography in paragraph form and the straight-ahead listing of who recorded this next and when become a bit numbing. But at its best, the book gives you tidbits that surprise, pictures that enlighten, and a desire to run out and look for a particular recording of the songs you thought you knew so well.Bottom line; if you think the idea behind the book sounds interesting, you'll like the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"early zipper failure makes for a useless tent","review":"We used the tent about eight times--five nights on a Boyscout trip and three in the back yard. The stuff sack it comes in is not very durable, and rips easily. The front zipper jammed and then completely separated, making for a useless tent while on a campout. Luckily we brought a spare tent. What's the use if you can't protect your tent in the stuffsack or zip the flap closed? You get what you pay for, unfortunately. Maybe the earlier models were better. By comparison, we have other tents (REI campdome) thirteen+ years old--zippers are in perfect condition. I only bought this tent after what seemed like hours of reviews and comparisons.

The Peaceable Kingdom, is an excellent starting point for those wanting to dive into Hauerwas. This is one of his earlier works and written at an accessible level. Much of what he says is restated in his immensely popular work co-authored with William Willimon in Resident Aliens, which is a must read as well. Hauerwas's engagement with such a variety of disciplines provides a profound work on what it means to be a Christian. His most noticeable influences being Karl Barth, John Howard Yoder, Alasdair MacIntyre, and Ludwig Wittgenstein among others (see xix). Whether or not you agree with Hauerwas you have to engage him. His writing is exceptionally readable and spiritually challenging. If you're not a Christian his work won't make sense, that's part of the point.

I personally felt very dissapointed with the whole collection for several facts:- mom and pop basic edition. Basically a documentary produced with a handycam. On many occasion you get direct filming of a postcard.-constant and exasperating repetition of published text. The word \\"presand egyt\\" is probably said 20 times. But to say something 20 times does not give it any validation.- vague and not really valid affirmations. As an illustration, the water erosion theory, a not widely accepted system to calculate the age of the Great Sphinx is presented as the most widelly accepted. The aging is absurd. The author establish relationships between concepts but rarely demonstrate anything. The dvds do not offer any novel information.

I was deeply disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christianity Before Christ","review":"Gurdjieff in EgyptI don't know why Gurdjieff didn't say more about the origins of the teaching, but given all the inconsistent stories about its origin, I was fascinated to watch this documentary video, Gurdjieff in Egypt. William Patrick Patterson put together the pieces Gurdjieff did leave behind to reach a startling conclusion: What Gurdjieff brought to the West in the early part of the twentieth century was ancient, esoteric Christianity reformulated for the times, \\"Christianity before Christ.\\" Egypt has always interested me and this video opened a completely new window on its art and architecture. What I also appreciate about this film, as well as the others in this trilogy, is that they are also teaching documents, introducing and explaining some of the practices of the Fourth Way.

Mr. Patterson has done an excellent job of showing us what Gurdjieff meant when he said that the Fourth Way is \\"completely self-supporting and independent of other lines and it has been completely unknown up to the present time.\\" It is fascinating to see the connections made between the hieroglyphics on the walls of the Temple of Edfu - the Seven Sages who came form the Homeland of the Primeval Ones - and what we read in Meetings With Remarkable Men, All and Everything and In Search of the Miraculous. It is amazing that no student of the Fourth Way has explored the story of Gurdjieff's search in Egypt and Abyssinia until this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I bought this on sale and I'm so glad that I didn't pay full price for it.

It may very well last for 30 minutes on a single charge but it starts to lose suction within 3-4 minutes. (It wouldn't be so bad if it were capable of running while plugged in. It isn't.) The attachments just make it worse, and the carpet attachment (the wide one) causes it to lose suction pretty much altogether.

This is a good example of why porn stars should not make softporn B movies. The acting is atrocious, the script is idiotic and even the sex is tedious. And the worst part is, there is nothing that is either fun or funny. I know, some flicks are so bad they are hilarious--but not this one. Meant to be a parody of \\"The Ghost in the Invisible Bikini\\" and a few other classic films, it only manages to amuse when it insults itself. There are basically two ways you can go with this material. Make it like an erotic thriller, which at least gives you sensuality in the sex scenes, or make it campy, which would at least inject some energy. \\"Ghost\\" lacks both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Don't waste your time watching this movie I watched about 6 or 7 minutes of it and skippedthrough some other parts and saw that it was a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item","review":"The reason why I gave this item five stars is because it is a excellent movie with excellent actor and actresses in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy, Not Funny.","review":"I was looking for a cheesy, funny movie, like that of Shark Piranha or the like.

Because present-day authors do not suffer from these disadvantages, recent English-language books tend to be clearer and better organized for beginners. _Go and Go Moku_ also betrays its age by its occasionally nonstandard terminology, which alone is sufficient reason for beginners to avoid this book.Of the many excellent English-language introductions to go, my favorite is Kaoru Iwamoto's _Go For Beginners_."},{"rating":"1","title":"Examples difficult to follow, dry reading","review":"As a beginner just learning the game, this is not the way to go (sorry). Lasker was world chess champion for 27 years, losing it in 1921. This book is written from that rarified perspective.He will jump into a complex series of moves for a couple of pages, totally losing the reader on the logic and reasons for the progression, and then after another page say the explanation is probably not appropriate for beginners and/or there are many exceptions to what he just wrote. The diagrams are generally hard to follow, and aren't particularly clarified by the accompanying text. There is one complete game recorded move by move between masters Karigane and Honinbo played in 1926 which is instructive. But if this is the first book on go one is exposed to, it might do more to discourage than to help one experience the enjoyment the game can provide."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are beginner, look elsewhere...try anything BUT this book!","review":"The last two reviews are right on the mark about this book. If you are a beginner, try anything but this book.The examples are both confusing and hard to follow -- the diagrams do nothing to help.

I imagine anyone else who is buying this book is in the same boat as me, if so, then good luck. If you don't absolutely have to buy this book for a course, then don't. It is boring, confusing to read, and never really clarifies anything. The author explains what folklore isn't, not what it is.

This was a fun way to do so.

The author looks at record collecting from every possible angle -- from the Freudian aspects of the drive to the possible reasons why collectors have trouble finding girls. It's full of wonderful interviews with the famous -- Peter Wolff, Peter Buck, and Robert Crumb -- and not so-famous -- a guy with 150,000 records, a woman who collects all Olivia Newton John albums and memorabilia. A collector himself, Milano thoroughly understands the search and satisfaction of finding a record very few other people have. I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in music, collecting, or simply good storytelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ride the grooves.","review":"This book made me break into a grin-and-nod combo more than once in recognition (frequently scaring other subway passengers). No matter. Reading about others chasing the elusive high of the vinyl dragon was comforting - and totally entertaining.I also liked the fact that this book that this book bemoaned the rarity of female collectors (Crumb's quote, \\"it never gets them hot,\\" is hilarious). I'm one of those rarities myself (26 and trolling flea markets for records since I was 9 or 10), so it was interesting -if not really particularly surprising - to find out there's not a lot of us out there. \\"There's not many women who want to sit around and debate the best Elvis Costello album\\" line made me laugh, too - \`cause I do!I'd recommend this for anyone who's ever collected anything - you're likely to find kindred spirits within these covers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice collection","review":"It took me awhile to get used to the traditional lute tab notation as I am coming from a regular guitar background (read standard notation & \\"modern\\" tablature).

The Editorial Review above from Publishers Weekly tells exactly how it is. And that's it!What this tall tale reminds me of is S.King's Misery. Only in this one the protagonist is fully capable of leaving but doesn't.Doesn't even think about it! till the very end. He lets them get away with killing his dog, and abusing him endlessly everyday.It's just ridiculous not to mention improbable in the extreme. I mean there is nothing in this book that is plausible enough to get your mind around except a guy doing a bit of winters house sitting.As for Mr. Kings positive review.....Mr. Kings stories have deteriorated so badly over the past few years that his reviewsare meaningless.

It still ran out of control and wide open only ten feet from me. It was picking up waves from somewhere so we could not use this toy.

It twists and warps selected quotations of our Lord. It strangely leaves out troublesome quotes that don't fit Mr. McLaren's filtration system of maximum tolerability for his brand of compromised pan-inclusive non-conclusive Christianity.Little more than conventional liberal religious belief in angry frustrated denial of clear Bible truth statements couched in false humility. With so much re-thinking of who Jesus really is and how he really means to be interpreted, an uncautious sophisticate intellectual can rethink himself right out of Christ and into antichrist. So openminded and freethinking as to slide out of the Goodspell (Gospel) of Jesus and into the Badspell of Dan Brown."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great introduction","review":"I have a hard time understanding how anyone who has read this book can find Mclaren to be \\"an emergent heretic not affirming the physical resurrection of Christ.\\" This book is a friendly and concise introduction to the study of the historical Jesus. It is illuminating and not at all heretical. Have the people who speak this way read the book or are they just going off of what their local homogenized Christian subculture says? N.T.

The instructor at this Maryland university was a modernist progressivist mainline revisionary who made us all question our beliefs about what 'Jesus really meant' for the modern mind.

This alone, and a person's faith in Jesus' God-man perfection and righteousness before Holy God, empowers living like Christ lived.If only the little letter of First John was quoted as much as Willard-Wink-Wright, we would have a more honest authentic grasp of the Whole Jesus and His Original message direct from heaven.\\"This is love, not that we started off loving God, but instead God took all initiative by loving us first and sending His Son from Heaven as the atoning substituting lamb-sacrifice regarding our sins...Whoever has the Son has eternal life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have the life.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking and motivational","review":"This book is thought-provoking and motivational.

And, to follow those teachings."},{"rating":"1","title":"gneo-gnostic gnonsense","review":"The title says it all, although the book itself is cause for alarm.Yes, the Lord did teach in parables, but he explained everything to his disciples. These disciples in turn gave us the rest of the New Testament to elaborate what Jesus meant by \\"Kingdom of God\\".This is where Mcclaren is way off base. He limits his ideas to the Sermon on the Mount, parables of yeast and seed, etc. When an author is spot off, it shows everywhere in all he says and believes and passes off on others.Secret Message? We need Mcclaren to decode it for us.Uncovering the real Truth? We need also Dan Brown's Davinci Code to get at the hidden facts behind conservative evangelical creeds & confessions.That could Change Everything?

He even goes through the whole history of the church and explains why and how each age of the the church has missed this message. But the message he is promoting is something that all Christians of all times and places have embraced. That God is good and his kingdom advances when we are changed by God and act accordingly in our personal lives. The tone of the book is humble, but the message is very arrogant. If it was a ploy to get the message out in this age of supposed new discoveries about the ancient church, (Which is really just the ancient gnostic cult), the that would be cool, but he actually believes he as uncovered the TRUE Gospel hidden in the words of the bible and missed by all until he came along to explain it. Very dangerous and worrisome to me..."},{"rating":"1","title":"1/2 Star Is Being Very Generous","review":"I've done some research and it's true. Looks like there is a movement to up the ratings for this book. About a dozen or so fans were sent advance copies to offer positive reviews to keep interest going.It took some doing, but I as a non-fan finished reading what the latest theologic fashion trend claimed to be. Not that impressive. Lots of sentiment and suggestion, but little on the level of revolutionary.What I found was neocolonialiberalistrendoctrinairethicality trying to substitute for biblical discipleship in the Fellowship of the CROSS.What does it profit someone who tries to gain the whole world and yet forfeits one's soul?

Looks like trying to find a metaphor under every bible verse that has hidden secret meaning only divulged to the inner circle of expert linguists.The real secret message of the real Jesus is: Unless you repent of your sins, you will perish. See Luke 13.I couldn't find in this metaphoria any mention of the absolute necessity to worship Jesus as Lord. A genuine Christian is a Christ-worshiper. It seems like there is a subtle substitute of revering and regarding Jesus, but not bowing down to the Lamb in the center of God the Father's Throne as co-worthy of adoration, praise and worship. See Revelation 5:8-14.I liked the cover art and some of the sections on Christians getting out of their comfort zones to be more missional and engaging of a lost world in need of God's love.

The other is \\"The Untold Story of the New Testament\\" Church by Frank Viola which focuses on the story in Acts and the letters of Paul, Peter, and the others. Both books gave me a brand new look at the New Testament which caused me to see things totally different. They both draw on the history of the times and reframe everything in the gospels and the letters by a historical framework. I recommend both books for I feel they both go together.

A younger person who loves Cool Water, Acqua di Gio, on the other hand, will probably hate it. Try a sample if you're unfamiliar before you make a blind buy.I personally love it...just remember this one is a powerhouse from a generation ago.

It has served its purpose well. I have hardly used the \\"utility / exacto knife\\" as it feels VERY light-weight, as though it would break with the first use.I used the putty knife to hammer out the caulking from around 20+ windows, and many other things. The finish on the metal end has worn off from the repeated hammer hits, but still functions great! The bits have held up very well but were a little slick at first due to the chrome-like finish. I have worn out the PH#2, but then again, it's most commonly used.Overall, I am quite pleased with it. Use it for most of my home renovations and remodels.

It is PINK, a saving grace, the guys tend not to want to be caught dead carrying OR using PINK girly tools *YIPPEE*.Gettng my drift about disappearing tools that fail to find their way back to my tool box? NOTHING is worse than having to fix something and your tools are nowhere to be found. Dumb looks and IDA, IDA KNOW, the only response you get from the assumed guilty parties. I'd like beefier tools in PINK.

This one is okay but think about what you will be needing it for. The drill is useless. If you need it because you are going to be assembling furniture and stuff by yourself, then don't get this for the drill. I wouldn't have minded if it had screwdrivers but it comes with no screw drivers. It has the miniature ones that work for toys and stuff but nothing useful. I charged the drill overnight even, it worked for maybe a minute but didn't do the job. I couldn't get not one screw off my chair. The drill is just too weak for the job. I borrowed a neighbors drill and the screws came off in seconds. There is no wrench or anything really useful in this toolbox. Waste of money, but it is cute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy w/purchase","review":"The item appears to be of good quality and I'm sure my daughter will enjoy it. Especially since it's pink!!The item was as shown and arrived quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Screwdriver & missing regular screw drivers","review":"This set is quite cute and good for light home repair, such as hanging pictures. The electric screwdriver is far to weak to be used for much else than screwing in pre-threaded holes (such as computer repair). I tried this weekend to use it to repair a closet door system and the screwdriver wasn't strong enough to screw into the wall (even though there was a smaller hole pre-drilled.)The hammer is little, but sometimes that's all you need. I would also have liked to see a regular sized phillips and flat-head screwdriver in the set. Otherwise, the case fits together nicely, everything stays in place even after owning it for over a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little tool box","review":"This tool box has been great.

I recently needed to use it this month and it wouldn't charge and didn't work. Sadly it was out of the time frame for Amazon to provide a replacement so will be contacting the manufacturer on their faulty item. The reason why this tool set is considered to have so many tools is because of the electric screwdriver...if this doesn't work then it ends up being 20 tools short.

I do a lot of decorating and home repair. Most of the time I have trouble finding my husband's tools. When I do find them some are too heavy and awkward for me to use (drill, battery charged screw driver, etc..).I was extremely disappointed with the Appollo 135pc tool set. It reminds me of a toy set I bought for my son when he was 10 and wanted to help Dad with repairs. The pliers and wrench are too small for my grip and the hammer is smaller than I thought it would be. If you're looking to hang up some pictures this would be fine. But if you're looking to do more than that I would not recommend this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT worth the money!","review":"I've got to agree with the other negative reviews. These tools are like toys, made out of flimsy materials. I do not understand how others are getting any use out of them. The screwdrivers were the first to break, the metal they are made out of is so soft that after putting together a few children's toys they were completely ruined. The cordless screwdriver (\\"drill\\") has NO power, and after a handful of uses it will not hold a charge. The plastic piece on the tape measure broke off so it can not be held in place. Even the pink plastic hinges on the case broke off. The only thing I've found really useful in this set is the hammer, and well, that's not worth the price. For this amount of money you could buy yourself some real tools, forget about these even though they look so cute. I'm sorry I got them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my girl tools!","review":"I bought the Apollo Precision Tool for myself because I can never find any of my husbands tools when I need them.

Some things, like the tape measure and the teeny-tiny level, are useful, but that's about it - I can easily buy those items separately for a much cheaper price. The drill is worthless - in fact, mine has never gathered enough power to perform any function. The hammer is far too short in the handle, resulting in it being off-balance and quite difficult to use. Please pay attention to the detailed reviews that others have posted on this - I agree wholeheartedly with them!!

You can tell the author has this whole world detailed out in her head and we just get a glimps of it in this book. I liked Wren she is funny, plucky and knows when to keep her mouth shut.

It's a brilliant idea, and the artwork is pretty. However, the significance of the images is less than clear.

Not quite the significance on which one can hook meanings that I would prefer.You might want to discount what I say, as I admit that I tend to resist learning yet-another set of attributions.

After the nail is bent, the head pulls off in attempts to remove the nail, even in Smartside and OSB, with very little stud hanging on to it. Somebody in China cut some corners on the metallurgy. I end up cutting the nail off short and pounding it the rest of the way in."},{"rating":"1","title":"These Are NOT The Pliers You're Looking For!","review":"I purchased this tool with the intent of using it as purposed--to gently tighten a threaded part without scratching it. While the pliers' design is a great idea, the engineering is pathetic. The rubber jaw-covers do not fit properly over the jaws, which leaves the tips unsupported. This caused the rubber to desintegrate with the very first squeeze. Attempts to get the rubber better positioned only caused it to tear. After their very first use, I was on to the replacement covers that were included. Even though I tried to be more careful the second time around, they immediately self-destructed on use. Wrapping them up in electrical tape is helping to hold them together, but I don't anticipate getting even 1% of the work-life I originally expected from this tool. Fortunately, I was only burned for around $20.00. If you're thinking of buying this tool, don't. Keep searching. And, please let us know if you find something that works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks cheap","review":"I bought this for the soft jaws which I installed on my professional Solder Seal pliers.

In addition, when I had a question about the unit, the tech support folks were right there with speedy, courteous information. For their size, these heaters do not have the raw output of something like a \\"Buddy Heater.\\" However, there are some big differences. Buddy Heaters do not work above 7,000 feet. Therefore, of little use in Colorado. Second, these heaters burn exceptionally clean requiring very little ventillation. Previously, I was using a radiant kerosene heater to keep my enclosed trailer warm during hunting season. It took huge amounts of ventillation to keep the carbon monoxide detector from going off (read \\"to stay alive\\".) A clean efficient burning process is critical for me when I use the heater for my hunting trailer.

The attachment holes on the heater body do not align up to those on the legs, furthermore, when the bolts were tightened, the nuts fell off from the retaining clips to prevent them from spinning, making the legs useless. The fit and finish of metal work is so poor the heater looks like a bad lemon car made in the 1980s. I would not recommend this product to anyone.

I place my tea leaves or coffee into the press first. Then I boil water in a pyrex measuring cup in the microwave and then pour it into the press while it's still boiling. It hasn't cracked yet as the other reviewer suggested it might. The press itself works pretty well in that it prevents even superfine ground coffee from getting into my cup.

Not a great deal of suspense, I mean we all know the story by now.But the lack of vibrant color, the eerie motion of claymation, and the sound effects that are crystal clear will leave a less-than-warm-feeling with you when you are dont with the movie.If you enjoy the fantasy with a darker twist, and don't mind watching your tv with a very confused look for several parts, this is a highly interesting and different version of the story we're all familiar with.not a comedy, suspense or horror. Just the regular story in a darker and more twisted perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"This American doesn't mind subtitles!","review":"I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who loves the many variances on the wonderland theme. Or anyone wanting to watch an artistic and visually appealing film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visuals over story","review":"It's definitely an interesting, albeit rather creepy take on the old story. It's not as funny as one would expect, being quite a bit darker in themes and design overall. It hit me pretty close to home, considering my own dreams and nightmares often look similar to this film.The stop-motion animation is truly a sight to behold, very bold and interesting.The story itself is backseat, as there's very little talking or explanation of what's going on. This film will no doubt enchant younger viewers with its creepy imagery, amuse older audiences and artsy-fartsy types, but it's definitely not for everyone and some kids could very well be scared by the creatures in this movie. Most of them are made of animal skeletons, taxidermied creatures and other such dead things and some may find it upsetting.However, if you're like me, it'll be right up your alley and a welcome addition to any movie library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surrealistic and dark. That's all..","review":"Yes. i admit that this one is a surrealistic, experimental, dark film far from the other Alice-related movies. But all those things does not prove that it deserves to be praised. What i could find in this movie is that a vague plot, bizarre characters and a weird sound. That's all. Even puppet-animation failed to catch my mind (I am a big fan of that method). Instead of it, i'd like to recommend BBC's TV version directed by Jonathan Miller and/or 'Dreamchild' to people who are interested in more creative, dark version than normal Alice movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"creepy","review":"how do you ruin \\"alice in wonderland?\\" elminate the dialogue.

I have never been so bored with \\"alice in wonderland\\" nor have i ever been so turned off to something that looked so much like a horror film. Don't waste your time if you're a fan of the wit and fun and knowing humor of the original story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A decent experimental film","review":"Being a sucker for stop-motion animation, I purchased this DVD on a whim. While it does have it's moments of greatness, a majority of the movie just left a bad taste in my mouth.The animation is brillliant, but the constant cut to the girls mouth is really jarring, and quite a bit annoying when you see it for the 10th time.The short film that is included on this DVD is the better part of this DVD, IMHO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad...film...taking up...valuable...brain space...must purge","review":"The treatment of Alice in Wonderland is overshadowed by the grotesque nightmare of the White Rabbit. A stuffed rabbit gets bug eyes, and rips itself free of its display case, and takes off. It is one of the most ghastly things I have ever seen.The dialog and narration is minimal, almost making this a silent film, which adds nothing to the story, indeed making it very hard to follow. Especially since this film is full of symbolism. In fact, if you take out the \\"said the White Rabbit,\\" et. al, there would hardly be any dialog throughout the first 3/4 of the film.The sound is harsh and low quality, with sound effects overly dominating each scene.The best part of the film is when Alice is turned into a doll, and the doll is animated. The treatment and cinematography is very consistent, making our ability to relate to the doll as the character very easy.Overall, a waste of time, but is probably a lot of fun on an altered brain chemistry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably Svankmajer's best movie","review":"If you are unfamiliar with Svankmajer, it may be best to start with Alice.

This adaptation is incredibly unique and completely fascinating to watch! Obvious that much time and care was put into the making of this film. I would not, however, recommend this film for children since when I watched it with a 22-year-old friend, she found it disturbing and asked me to turn it off. One of the films main characters is the product of taxadermy, and there is very little speaking and virtual silence for much of the movie except for the sound of scurrying and footsteps and such. Personally, I found it brilliant and completely engrossing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This film reminded me why I was afraid of Grandma's Victorian attic.","review":"To get the most out of this movie one should be over 50, growing up with grandmas dolls that looked as if they were just exhumed from the grave....huge Victorian attics/ basements with dark interior rooms filled with trunks, junk, and the ever present dress makers dummy guarding the twisting attic stairs. The basement pantry filled with old dusty bottles of pickled, preserved...Svankmajer knows how to remind me that once upon a time....I never went to bed without locking the attic door."},{"rating":"2","title":"Down a darker rabbit hole","review":"Here's a surreal version of Alice in Wonderland that's both unsettling & compelling, a marvel of Eastern European stop-motion animation & sensibiity. The juxtapostion of Alice's innocence (or apparent innocence, at any rate) & the nightmarish rendition of Wonderland as something more like the underworld, the land of the dead & the disturbed, is one long frisson of darkened delight. It indeed has the quality of a sustained dream, and I've no doubt that the original Surrealists would have found themselves very much at home in it. Not for everyone, of course, but likely to appeal to a much larger audience that one might initially imagine.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I remembered","review":"I saw this twenty years ago while I was in college, remembering that I liked it. Maybe because my girlfriend was artsy and I was \\"in love\\". Picked this up again and I don't know what I was thinking. This movie is unwatchable now. I could only take the closeup of Alice's mouth saying \\"Said the white rabbit\\" so much. That is pretty much the whole dialogue of the movie. Stop animation I remembered does not hold up today.

Regarding the great mysteries of the Revelation, Patterson does not pretend to have the answers, he does not give us what he thinks, he just gives us what he thinks we need.

Cotton Mather was one of the witch hunters who prosecuted and executed hundreds of innocent women. Many were hanged and few went through the ordeal unscathed. This book was originally written and published in the 1600s. It was to be a guide for witch hunters and how to deal with them. This book symbolizes many of the mistakes that we, as a country, would like to forget. Check this book out of a library, its not worth the money to spend. Its only valuable to collectors or psychopaths."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This book is just a collection of what Author has read in various other book, or have heard from so called expert folks.

I wasted my money on this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Infertility Book Ever","review":"So far the worst infertility book I have read. This book is surprisingly unhelpful. The authors talk about how a person can choose to stop being infertile and start living childfree. They claim that these are different in that childfree is a choice and infertility is a diagnosis. I felt like they repeated the same information over and over throughout the book. This book explains what they feel childfree living is, and how it has helped them. They do point out that you are only diagnosed infertile after actively trying to have children, and that if you never tried to have children, you would not know that you are infertile. While this is true it did not help me feel any different. This book was meant to be comforting; however I felt it was condescending.THE VERDICTI do not recommend this book to anyone. I would never read this book again, and regret reading it in the first place.See more of my reviews on my blog kaitlinmichelle.wordpress.com"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing that anyone believes this book","review":"How sad that people believe this collection of creationist fallacies to be true.

I was on hold for 96 minutes after calling their 1-800 number.

I kept it anyway because the item description at Amazon does not actually promise that it's green (the box does, and the product photo does) and I just need to keep the bird poop and rain off my new grill.Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good grill cover","review":"Definitely a great deal for a very good grill cover.

The adapter A. E. Hochner also throws in an informative essay on the art of adapting. While this will certainly interest would-be playwrights and Hemingway afficionados, there is little else of substance here.The short story is little more than a premise--a poor Bahamian fisherman finds a sunken luxury yacht and tries unsuccessfully to scavenge it-with no supporting characters and an unsatisfactory resolution. Hochner adds villians, conspiracies, and two love triangles to spice things up. The result is a better-than-average TV movie, due to solid performances by Benjamin Bratt and Armand Assante, but it is still too slow and formulaic to meet the standards of a feature film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous little book","review":"I just love Cecil Poole's writings.

I was shocked to find that it was basically straight-ahead techno-type dance music spiced up with samples of Shipibo shamans and Don Agustin Rivas. Nothing very original there (if you want to hear good uses of similar samples, try \\"Mother Ayahuasca\\" on the \\"Kiva\\" CD by Steve Roach, Michael Stearns and Ron Sunsinger). However, the CD is well-designed, and has a wonderful little booklet about ayahuasca in English and Dutch (?). If you're curious about traditional, contemporary or \\"post-modern\\" uses of ayahuasca, whether in South America or Europe, the booklet serves as a good introduction. If you want to hear insipid techno with pilfered sound samples, this is also good.

Most address the mechanics and processes concerned with day trading and neglect to provide what is most essential and that is techniques for identifying trading candidates and how to implement these into viable trading systems. Mssrs. DeMarks' book present s aplethora of worthwhile approaches. It's certainly not turnkey but what do you expect for the price of the book--the holy grail? One thing is certain the methods are original and can be dissected and applied piecememal to methods I have previously applied in the past.

I have also conducted commodity and stock trading schools. The ideas I have acquired from both the DeMarks are the curriculum of my classes. Originally, before being introduced to the DeMark methodolgy I relied upon the same trading techniques as all other traders. What convinced me to try the Demark techniques was the fact that someone told me that DeMark was the originator of a few of the all time trading favorite oscillators such as RSI. I wanted to know why he abandoned this indicator. It now makes sense to me--he has developed more accurate and sensitive trading tools that are more responsive to the rhythm of the market.

You'll sit up and take note from the first five tracks, with the splendid voice of the sadly neglected Archie Lewis, accompanied by the mid-forties Geraldo Orchestra. That sets the pattern, with each vocalist being allocated five tracks with a variety of accompaniments. So the compilation progresses through Marjorie Kingsley with Harry Roy, Sam Browne, Paula Green with Joe Loss, Alan Dean, Anne Shelton with Ambrose, Chick Henderson, Evelyn Dall with Ambrose, Cyril Grantham with Geraldo, Anne Lenner with Carroll Gibbons, Rita Williams, Jimmy Mesene, Eve Becke, Al Bowlly, Vera Lynn with Ambrose, Dorothy Carless, Paul Rich with Lou Preager, Carole Carr with Geraldo, George Melachrino, and Dolly Elsie. Some of these tracks will be familiar, others less so.

The astronomy and geometry are written for a layman's level, without being too dry or technical, but not childish either. Heath details how the earth moves about the sun, with seasons and the calendar, as well as two types of lunar cycles, equinoxes, solstices, eclipses, etc. The book details how our calendar works and offers some interesting alternatives. There's even a short chapter about Stonehenge, which can be further explored in another volume by the same publisher.I found it fascinating how much megalithic astronomers knew about the sun and moon cycles, especially the geometry, but then again, they didn't have much else to do and light pollution was almost non-existent then. Imagine what the sky looked like in 3000 BC! The book is full of cool illustrations and tables and overall is well put together."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Delightful\\" !","review":"I love it for it's simplicity. I 10-year-old child can read this book, yet most adults know very little about the Sun, Moon & Earth. If you have an interest in astronomy this book is an excellent starting point.

Only one writes that it is a wonderful remaster but I don't agree at all! This is a remaster in the worst case.

I played it on several CD-players with several and high-end equipments too but I can't deny Joseph M. Palmaccio (who-ever that may be) has some problems with his ears during the mastering or there weren't better tapes in store!

I can't believe the song \\"Send It\\" doesn't get more nods here! One of my fave songs, talk about your hooks! My God Jeff (hehe, literally)! The send off song Heaven Only Knows is great, Calling America likewise, however there are exactly 4 songs here that I consider fluff and for a 10 song cd that doesn't bode well.It was clear to all that ELO was losing steam and Jeff was losing interest, however having said that, if you program your cd player just right and play all the great tunes hear, you'd never notice.

ELO were no longer the big band they were in the 70's the band had fallen off thier pedestal so Jeff decided after one more album he would bring ELO to an end for good. anyways BOP is a great way for a a great band to say goodbye.

The ballad \\"Getting To The Point\\" marked the end of a group. Otherwise this is just average songs. \\"Heaven Only Knows\\" starts fine but get's tiresome. \\"Secret Lives\\" has the typical Lynne riff in the refrain, but is really a bad song. \\"Sorrow About To Fall\\" adds a saxophone that makes it more forgettable. \\"Endless Lies\\" is Lynne trying to be Roy Orbison, which he's not!

The Adicts are a more fun, less angry and political, English punk band from Ipswich, UK. By the time I got to the concert, I was really excited to see them. They ended up playing several of the songs on this album, which is really a greatest hits collection, like \\"Chinese Take Away\\" and \\"Joker in the Pack.\\" If you get the opportunity, definitely see them live.

Yes, it's not very long and doesn't technically qualify as a book but it's contents are all that matter. For $10 this is a great investment for your short and long term success. Not many original ideas in here but the way the author has cooked it down to the most important details, I value it's simplicity. How many times have you read books that are 300+ pages and you wonder...\\"how come it couldn't be more respectful of your time\\"?

Please don't purchase this unless you can get it at the dollar store, on sale for $ .50. There is one good metaphor about a fly banging endlessly against a window after having flown into a house. The fly continues to bang until it eventually gets swatted by a home owner or dies, when just feet away is an open door that it can fly through. The goal, I think, is to show that we all get caught up banging into brick walls when there is a door of success that we are somehow missing. Maybe Mr. Pritchett thinks our brains are the size of a fly. Other than that minimal story, the rest of the book was a huge disappointment....and I paid $13.00 for a paperback with about 30 pages....more like a booklet than a book. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was very impressed with Pritchett's book \\"The Employee Handbook of New Work Habits for a Radically Changing World\\" so I purchased this one.

While it is true that all we know about his teaching comes from his enemies, his enemies were people like Saint Augustine so.... At any rate, history seems to teach that Patrick was not Pelagian. Nevertheless I greatly enjoyed the book. Patrick emerges as a real person and not a stick-figure \\"saint\\", but I wish his Christianity was a little more evident in the story. There is no real conversion experience. Lawhead made us believe he was building up to one. But the very end is typical Lawhead and very satisfying. I recommend the book highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"departure from the expected","review":"I've read most of Lawhead's books, and while I was totally bowled over by Byzantium, this book left me wondering if a geographic change of domicile for him has influenced his writing.I finished this book only because I appreciate the way he plies his craft. The first 150 pages of the book are the hardest to get through: while being very realistic and probably appealing to the general public; I feel that the believer who begins to read this book will stop before the point of the story has been made due to being offended with the \\"in your face\\" details of the baseness of humanity.I do agree with other reviewers that this book has all the marks of being the first of a series, simply because the book ends with a beginning and does not complete the story of Patrick's life. It was not his best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"I must admit this was the first book I read by Lawhead, and well it's going to be my last. The book started off very well, there seemed to be good characterization and I felt compelled for what was happening to the hero. However about halfway through it seemed to be that the author just got tired of the book and condensed it to get the agony over with. The book didn't really talk about how Patrick came to get his powers, or define his deep belief in God. The plot was a little un-realistic too. Why would any sane Roman Citizen not want to advance up to become a senator? Why would he get so much help? I don't get it. I had high hopes for the book and well it and the author let me down great deal. I guess its back to Steven Pressfield for a good and somewhat accurate novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Fiction, Terrible Biography","review":"Simply as a fictional novel, this work by Lawhead is an excellent read.

Lawhead hugely diverges from many of the known facts of Patrick's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Promiscuous","review":"My husband started me reading Lawhead and up until Patrick, I enjoyed his writing. We are very careful on the content of what we read and Lawhead had, thus far, been very morally clean. However, within the first 50 pages he includes lewd details of sexual relationships. I do not know anything about the historical Patrick, but this information was not necessary at all. If it had stopped I might not be writing this review, but the sexual promiscuity continues throughout the book in detail. While I very much enjoyed Hood and Scarlet as well as the Pendragon Cycle, I have nothing good to say about Patrick. Even the theology is loose and liberal. It made me wonder if Lawhead has changed what he believes. In the end, Patrick was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really a Saint","review":"I have read the reviews about how troubling this book can be, and I concur. As long as you forget about St. Patrick, and just consider it a story about some guy, it is well-written and interesting after a fashion. If you want Christian inspiration, look elsewhere.

What so funny is that until the end of the book, this character had several names but never Patrick!!

Results have been very good with toast, waffles & bagels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last 6 months","review":"This toaster has great features and looks good. We enjoyed it while it lasted, which unfortunately was less than 6 months. We will replace it with a Black and Decker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Well Made","review":"This is an inexpensive toaster. And as it has been said \\"You get what you pay for\\". It is not made well at all, and does not toast the bread well either. The toast is not evenly toasted and in general does not perform well. I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half Baked","review":"The only reason this didn't get only one star is that it barely works as opposed to being a complete dud. Half the toasting elements work properly which means it's necessary to turn whatever your toasting to get an even result. Half a turn on the timing knob-which lacks any calibration-produces a half baked effort to time things. When you look at the slots, and then try and insert something, you find it only accepts things half as big as one would expect. The cord is half as long as needs be. But it looks great on the counter but it's a half baked idea to buy it for the design only."},{"rating":"2","title":"No More undertoasted toast","review":"We are very happy with our Sunbeam 6277 4-slice toasster with cancel button and bagel button. It is our first order on Amazon.com and we were thrilled with the time it took to get to us. It is a good looking toaster and the price was right. We are especially delighted withe the bagel button. We like our toast and bagels nice and brown and this machine does it right. We will certainly be using Amazon.com regularly. Thanks for a great produce!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Germ-X Hand Sanitizing Wipes","review":"There is something wrong with these wipes they leave a very bad smell on your hands when using. we have been using these wipes for years at the sheriffs police and never had this problem before. We are not using these wipes at all, sorry we order them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Try These If You Miss The Old 6 x 8 Purell Wipes","review":"As many others noted, these were a replacement for the old 6 x 8 Purell individually packaged hand wipes. This is a very good size (I don't like the smaller ones at all). These work very well and are not too harsh on my hands. We keep them in our truck glove box and it is very convenient to put one in your pocket for later use. The only complaint I have is that sometimes the package doesn't want to tear open and you have to use a small scissors to open it. It doesn't happen every time and it is a very small complaint. I also like that you can buy them in good quantity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"My grandson has a great time playing with Big Jake,along with Jay Jay and Tracy.

The song selection is terrible. If there was a slow boring song on any of their albums, then they surely played it on here. I own the R.E.M. Road Movie DVD and I think the song selection on that DVD was way better (even though the quality of the DVD is worse) Other than the boring songs, once again I think the mix is off on this DVD. The music is over the singer, and you might as well forget the back up singer, you cant even hear him. Just listen to \\"orange crush\\". The singer is also off key in the beginning of the DVD. The DVD lacks energy, as well as the band. What your left with is a more older, burnout, tired R.E.M. The DVD footage is amazing, the scenery and quality is the best aspect of the DVD. Final verdict: Great picture, muffle sound, drowned out vocals, unenthusiastic band, great scenery"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was fooled...","review":"I was expecting this DVD to be in DTS, but unfortunately it was only in Dolby Digital 5.1 format.I'm so disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Among the best I've seen...","review":"I really enjoy these concerts on DVD and have seen a good number of them. I usually find that I need to watch the concert twice to really get into them, but when I bought Perfect Square on a whim and saw it for the first time, I was hooked by the second song. The scenery of the concert location is beautiful, as is the stage itself. The crowd is humongous and energized. The picture and sound are both good, and the performance is fabulous. I was very impressed. It's now an easy favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Hard to believe how much this band has grown since seeing them in a small bar in Madison 23 years ago. Michael Stipe's theatrics are the most interesting and the band blends well. There is noone like REM. They are truly one of a kind :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"R.E.M. Live","review":"I bought this DVD. I saw REM live in Minneapolis. They are every bit as goodon their live DVD's as they are live. The condition of the DVD was flawless andthere were no problems ordering, shipping or watching. I will always trust Amazon.com, and thank them for all their products. A true Amazon.com believer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Price of Admission","review":"Other reviewers have commented on the many, many highlights of this incredible concert. Although trite, I can honestly say that any one of the following cuts is well worth the price of admission: What's the Frequency,Kenneth?, Daysleeper, Bad Day, Losing My Religion, Imitation of Life, It's the End of the World, and the real show-stopper -- M. Stripe's personal favourite -- an absolutely amazing version of Country Feedback. With the band currently on tour, I am sure there will be a renewed interest in their videos. This is a 'keeper' that will not disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"problems with ipod touch data transfers","review":"The charger worked for my ipod touch, but have had lots of errors and problems with data transfers.

She asked me to buy it again because it was the only one she liked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informative","review":"I took a class this summer and one of the Text we used was the Guide to Wildflowers of South Carolina. This book is very informative and gives many different topics for each plant listed.

It has been a very useful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"White Horse Inn","review":"This is not a good compilation selection CD, although the one Alfred Drake piece is very good. There used to be a very fine Angel recording of this show; too bad that it is no longer available. Come on Amazon, search it out and re-issue it. You've got at least one buyer here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got rid of my spider mite problem","review":"Started up nearly a hundred seedlings and I could see red spider mites popping up everywhere. I sprayed this 3-in-1 all over and have not seen any bugs near my plants for nearly two weeks now after the one application. Seemed to be okay for using on tomatoes, eggplant, peppers, green onions. No noticeable bad side effect. Wouldn't hesitate to use again if needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Spray For Bad Bugs","review":"As an organic gardener for many years, Safer products have been my mainstay. For a large garden it makes sense to purchase the concentrate and mix up your own spray. For houseplants or a small raised bed, this large spray bottle is perfect. If it's just an aphid infestation, blast them off with a hose. For tougher bugs, mites, scale and fungal diseases, grab the Safer spray. You need to be sure to coat the undersides of leaves as well as the tops. This is a multi purpose spray, but for roses I use Green Light Rose Defense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really really hoped this would work","review":"Last summer I spent more time than I care to think about wondering what was causing my zucchini plants to die from the bottom up, and picking caterpillars off my kale and collards. I wasn't really interested in repeating either experience, so I was thrilled to find this.I've been applying regularly, re-applying after rain (not that we've had any) and watering, and....watching my kale getting eaten by caterpillars. Those little green ones that are supposed to be easily killed with BT. But I guess not with this. Even spraying it directly on them doesn't seem to have an effect.As for the zucchini, I'm not really sure what's going on. It doesn't appear to have that stem worm thing, or at least I can't find an entry slit, but it's definitely not doing well. This may not be the spray's fault, but having seen no evidence that this is improving anything, I'm afraid I won't be spending any money on it. :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"No improvement on my hibiscus moscheutos","review":"I rarely use chemicals or pesticides in the garden but had the opportunity to give this product a try. I have a perennial Rose Mallow (hibiscus moscheutos) whose leaves get devoured yearly by the caterpillar of the sawfly. I've tried handpicking, but they just keep coming. I used this product specifically for the leaf eating caterpillars it says it controls. It did not. After one weeks use, there were still caterpillars eating the sprayed leaves, the few I chose to spray daily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Safer but does it work?","review":"I try to avoid introducing chemicals into my immediate environment. This means that I use organic fertilizer, that I compost and that I usually do not use commercial insecticides. Thus, I am disposed to like this organic product. I have tried it on several occasions: to control a caterpillar infestation on an ornamental tree; to control pests on a rose bush and to combat a fungicide on two shrubs. I cannot say that the results have been particularly commendable. I will continue using it over the next weeks and update this review, but for now I cannot recommend the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work!","review":"I bought two bottles of Safer 3 in 1 to put in my garden to get rid of cucumber beetles, mostly, and a few other assorted pests. Last night, I used over one bottle with only one application. I soaked the whole plant, just like it told me to do. I followed every instruction. First of all, the bottle stopped working when it was 2/3 empty, making it impossible to spray. That was annoying, but not a reason I wouldn't buy it again. However, today I went out to my garden, and the cucumber beetles are everywhere! Clearly, it had no effect whatsoever. I still see lots of crickets, as well, which it was supposed to kill.So not only is this product pricey (I paid $8 for a bottle, not including shipping, and you're supposed to apply it once a week), but it doesn't work at all! I hope I can find something organic that actually does work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work and Didn't Spray","review":"I got the product to help with the white milky fungus which had spread to my cantaloupe and zucchini. I wanted something I could treat the slightly infected leaves with after I pruned all the infected ones.I cannot describe how frustrating the spraying mechanism was. It clogged every other spray. After 10 minutes of attempts 9and colorful language), I poured it into a different bottle and used a different sprayer. I used it for four days, then there was no more. AND It did not work. Don't waste your money on the product. Try another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems to have adverse effect on roses","review":"UPDATE:Several weeks after spraying my rose leaves with this product, I noticed that they are in much worse shape than they'd normally be now, in this first blooming cycle after winter dormancy. I can't say for sure it is this spray, but I can't think of any other factors. The leaves have been eaten by something, in a \\"lacy\\" pattern. Don't think I'll be using this product on my roses again; maybe on other hardier plants.--------------I've used Safer brand products for at least 20 years. Sometimes I'll just mix up some homemade soap solution, and that will work just fine.But some garden phenomenon require a few relatively benign chemicals. Trouble is, most products have way too many, and this spells trouble for beneficial insects and up the food chain.This product contains everything I'd normally use in the garden but no more, and I don't have to mix myself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems to Work","review":"I have been using this product quite extensively in my garden. I have quite a mixture of plants and succulents and was hoping for an all purpose spray - which it appears to be. I don't have a severe pest problem, but do find the occasional need to be pro-active. So far, so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.... not up to the standards of the brand","review":"I have used many Safer products before with success, and I was surprised to be disappointed with this one. I used it throughout the summer growing season on different plants to see what it would do. To be honest, it did not appear to do a thing. The little critters would just keep on moving right through it, and that is not my experience with safer's insecticidal soap and other products. I tried this, but then had to turn to my standards of Neem, Pyola, or Spinosad to do the job. I had a large aphid problem on some bok choy that this didn't touch but that the neem knocked right out. I have had such good experience with Safer's products in the past that it honestly makes me wonder if there is something wrong with the batch that filled my bottle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad for Mint Plants","review":"I used this product on my mint plant to get rid of aphids. When I sprayed it on the plant it didn't get rid of the aphids and turned the leaves of my plant black. A much better approach to getting rid of aphids would be to dump what ever is in this bottle and replace it with a few drops of dish detergent in water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Work","review":"Because it was billed as a safe and organic product, I first used Safer Brand 3-in-1 Garden Spray on some pesky flies on my indoor plants. While I realize that the product isn't really designed to kill the larva that are in the soil, it didn't even kill the flying adults - even when I sprayed them directly onto the bugs. I also used the product on the aphids that were eating my roses and again there was no affect. After going 0-2, and it wasn't for underuse - I repeatedly sprayed mass quantities on the bugs - I decided to throw the product away and invest in something that would actually kill garden pests.Safer, organic, or not, I see no reason to spend $13 on a product that doesn't work - and the Safer Brand 3-in-1 Garden Spray doesn't cut the mustard!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kills Effectively","review":"Even though this is touted as environmentally safe and ok for organic gardening, it still works. It is basically soap salts with sulfur added. These fatty acid salts have been used in insecticides since 1947. They have very low toxicity to humans, as long as not ingested in large quantities and dissappears from the environment in less than a day.My wife and I use it on our rose bushes. Following the label, it put an end to the aphids, thrips, and japanese beetles feasting on the leaves. The old dish washing liquid mixed with water in a spray bottle can do the same thing but, it seems, not as effectively.The added sulfur is the fungicide. I routinely dust my plants with powdered sulfur. I actually prefer the spray, though, because the plants don't look, well, dusty. The safer brand is easy and convenient to use and effectively kills pests and inhibits plant damage caused by fungi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product at a great price","review":"My backyard has a lot of snails and they constantly attack the flowers. I notice since I use the pray, no more snail hanging on the flowers. Quite satisfied with the results so far. Don't really know how long the effect lasts, but it would be perfect if it can last for a few weeks at least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works very well -- lasts about 3 weeks","review":"Worked very well against cabbage worms on broccoli, brussel sprouts and cabbage in southern NY in June 2011. Effect was visible within about 3-4 days, and overall lasted about 2-3 weeks without rain.

Very robust design, easy to use, versatile - it is in many ways better than my more expensive handlebar mounted light.

It hasn't received much publicity, which is a shame, as I feel it has the potential to become a \\"commercial\\" success. This isn't a \\"Chick Lit\\" book, there is something in it for everyone - love, lust, betrayal, war, set in 20th Century China.Maybe this will win an award and get the recognition it deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"An untold story that rivals tales of European & American polar thrillers","review":"If you enjoy books on polar survival and exploration, this book will be a welcomed addition to your library. If you've read other books of this type, you know that it quickly becomes difficult to find an original non-fiction story about polar adventure & survival. This book is a hidden jem! Of note is the fact that this is a translated text, but it still reads so well you don't even realize that it is a translation. I've read other translated books that result in awkward reading. The length of time that the party members survived is unparalleled when compared to other tales of artic survival. The resourcefulness of the survivors is truly amazing as they continue to face daunting task after daunting task even to the very end. This book is hard to put down and will not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Land of White Death","review":"Excellent book.

I loved this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Polar survival memoir","review":"This book makes a worthwhile addition to any polar exploration or survival library if only for the fact that it was written by a Russian. Valerian Albanov survived an incredible journey that began as an arctic hunting expedition. The book is relatively short and was written by Albanov himself mostly from his journal entries. If nothing else, after reading this tale you will appreciate dry clothes and a warm bed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Received Damaged","review":"I was so excited about this product; but when I got it I was deeply dissatisfied. The box was damaged. It was bent inward at the lid on one side and around the drawers opening it was ripped on both sides. I will be returning this product for a replacement. I do think that the box is really cute. However if I receive another damaged box then I will never buy another thing from this website."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This is the best house plan book I've found. We've looked at several and found that most books must share the same plan database. This book actually has plans that we didn't find in other books, and the fact that there is a color photo or illustration for each one makes it that much better. We haven't ordered a plan yet, so I'm not sure of the quality of the blueprints or materials list, but if they're as good as the book, I'd be happy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good collection of plans","review":"We are going to hire an architect and contractor to build a home and bought 3 megabooks of plans from Amazon to get some ideas. This was the worst of the lot though by no means as awful as \\"the house you build\\" book. My wife and I just didn't like many of the plans. The organization isn't really too useful as the plans are grouped by style, not size (nobody who is building a 3000sf home wants to parse through 1500sf cottages). The color photos are nice and I gave the book 2 stars because there are helpful hints for construction and design interspersed throughout. Check my other reviews for the home books we recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimate?","review":"Who can claim this is the ultimate book? Who is the editors of homeowner?

For a writer to have not known these two individuals nor,from my understanding, not having a personal interview with either of Michelle or James has really done some homework. Though I do think that revealing Rachels name in the book was quite inappropriate and a violation, as far as Im concerned. I think the book uncovered enough damage, then to have to exceed further by doing so. As far as the true character that exhists in Michelle, that is something the writer came close to, but yet so far. The true Michelle under the facade. Thats the Michelle I knew and will never forget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunting Evil or is it the evil within?","review":"As carlton describes in the book, disfunction in a family can cause embedded scares to ones soul.

As one of the We Both Read series the left pages contain more difficult words and background information while the right pages have both smaller and fewer words.

Two reasons this got only 4 stars... 1... it is incrediblly hot to sleep on. Almost impossible in the summer because it holds your body heat. 2... after 7 months of sleeping on it, I can already see where it is layed on a lot and where it isn't.

The interactive elements and the audio CD were fascinating - I wasn't sure they would seem fitting in a book on the Holocaust but in fact they add another level of understanding and meaning to the book.

Even though the chapters are very short in length, they do a good job of introducing the reader to very important aspects about each part of the Holocaust it covers. It includes a lot of pictures as well as inserts of official documents, personal letters and art work that help the reader get involved much more deeply. It also includes an audio CD of survivors sharing their stories.

The reading was pretty typical of any of the many skydiving books which are available. I get the sense that this book was never intended to be published. If publication was intended, it was certainly rushed. Almost all of the photos were printed so dark that you could not make out what the photos were. The hand drawn diagrams were pretty odd, and not all that understandable. The photos that were not printed too dark were too choppy with huge pixels (obviously taken from a home PC and blown up).The positive aspects of this book are that it touches on just about every aspect of skydiving. The book was also relatively inexpensive, although Amazon did not offer a discount. I wish I could be more positive about this book. There are better books available. I recommend the Skydivers Handbook. It is everything this book is times 2. Happy Skydiving!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice touch","review":"It looks nice hanging on the side of the changing table.

I don't think she should confuse people with her physics, since I don't know what universe she's talking about here. The rest of the book seems accurate - I wish she'd stuck to math a little more and mysticism a little less, but the book does have \\"sacred\\" in the title, so I can't really complain.

Its cheap and I guess you get what you pay for , reminds me a bit of a black and white catalouge or something.

I was given it as a present and I find myself turning to it for all sorts of ideas and also give it as a present quite regularly.

I am a graphic and fabrics designer and I had not come across some of these things before so I am very grateful for them.I also really like the way the book is put together, lush textured paper (recycled I note) and quality illustrations. The way the subject is built up stage by stage until we reach the more complex set pieces at the back is very good. It helps you understand the basics of good design, and the use of geometry in this process.I think the new-age overtones work very well too.

This book has concentrated many useful and fascinating observations about what has become known as sacred geometry into an exquisite little package, with meticulous illustrations. Highly recommended!

After listening to it all the way through twice I think the sound quality is what you'd expect for a BBC Sessions album, not perfect, but far from unlistenable. The album includes an excellent version of Robert Johnson's Four Until Late. Other standouts include Born Under a Bad Sign and Cat's Squirrel. The worst sounding songs quality-wise are Sunshine Of Your Love and Rollin' and Tumblin', but I can live with those. Chalk up another one for the BBC by presenting some more material from the Sixties, sounds as fresh as it did all those years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"Most of the songs are almost identical to subsequent Cream releases, although a few are different enough to merit some condsideration, e.g., Crossroads (though at less than 2 minutes we're cheated out of a full version).Also, the sound quality is mediocre and the announcer is annoying. I couldn't do much about the sound quality but I was able to get rid of the announcer's intros. I ripped the CD to my PC and used Creative WaveStudio to delete the announcer's intros (other software can be used).

If you don't have the Albert Hall CD/DVD, get that first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New or Even Better","review":"Understand first that these recordings were a gimmick to get around a contract between the record companies and the BBC. Artists re-recorded songs in the BBC studio, that could then be played on air without limits. At best these recordings reproduce what was recorded in studio. Most of the time they are worse. There is none of the energy of a live performance and none of the polish of a real studio recording.

Other reviewers have said that the sound on this release isn't of great quality and they are right. Most of the other BBC Sessions CDs have much better sound than this but that wasn't too much of a deterrent. To tell the truth, I was just excited to hear alternate versions of songs like 'Crossroads' and 'I'm so Glad'. The band seems to be in good form and the interviews with Eric Clapton were also interesting.'BBC Sessions' doesn't have the best sound out there but as a fan of the band I was prepared to overlook this minor technicality.

Armade Assante is also in this film and gives a very good performance as the ordinary guy who has dreams of a better life.

There are the obvious parallels to ROCKY and one scene of animal cruelty which I found disturbing (in NZ this movie is R16 despite being PG everywhere else.

I used it once and it was just as other reviewers have said. It did not mix well at all and I was afraid to turn it up past low since I thought the plastic mixer would go flying off the counter at a high speed.

Also, I recieved it for Christmas last year and at Christmas time this year the base broke off and won't go back on and then this weekend we baked cookies and while I was eating one I bit into a piece of metal.

It sloshes all of the baking materials up on the sides so you have to scrape the sides constantly with a spatula. All it does is mix and spin so only the bottom stuff is getting blended. I ended up with inconsistent dough - the stuff that was being mixed at the bottom was too runny and the stuff that was clinging to the sides was too thick.

When you turn the dial you may get nothing until you have turned past the slower speeds, then suddenly you have too high a speed. If you try to turn it down, it stalls. If you leave it on any speed that is in the lower range (if you get it to run slower at all), it surges and often quits.

It is a sorry example of the quality Sunbeam used to offer and I should have had my first clue when the box stated the country of origin!The beaters do not cover the bottom surface well and it was as much work using a spatula to stir as it was to just work by hand.

The story here is at once satirical and sad - but really the style of the film is what makes it all work. Is the film slow paced? Sure, I guess. It's also only 85 minutes long. The editing is not lightening fast and there is not a lot of plot. But that is sort of the point. It is about a particular ritual that a son develops while faced with the challenge of burying his recently deceased father. If you want good cinema that slows down time and envelopes you in it's haunting, spare [cold] atmosphere then this is a fine film. It ultimately has a lot to say about the madness of bureaucracy [communist or not] and the irony, pity and hope of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonmovie","review":"Alternates between boring and exasperating.

The setting doesn't give a feel of Paris at all, a giant vortex of Bohemean life and huge center of culture, for the way it's described - it all might've happened somewhere in a small town in Ohio.Characters remain somewhat flat and quite faceless, except Pankratov (but, as we know, oddish old cranks is quite easy material to describe in literature).Generally the book is a way too straightforward and, as it lacks true intrique, twists and any tension, it leaves an impression of uninspired work that the authour managed to deliver through a lengthy spell of his own boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Forger","review":"The book has a fascinating premise woven in the historical context of art plundering by the Nazis.

Richey does an excellent job of weaving in a captivating, romantic subplot around extraordinary events which put America, and our freedoms, on the brink of destruction. Although President Hastings is a fictitious character, there is no mistaking the similarities found within our present Administration. You will find yourself cheering for Kate Malloy, and wishing that there were more Reed Adams' in this world.

My son enjoys riding in it, but the straps are a nightmare to adjust. You have to push down the lever and tug for all you can to get them to move. Plus, the straps get twisted inside the buckles. I have spent hours untwisting them, and the next time we put him in there, they immediately twist back up. We even had someone certified at installing car seats look at it and it took him 45 minutes and he still couldn't get them untwisted.My recommendation is to spend the extra $ and buy the Britax. My wife's car has it and we have never had any issues adjusting the straps or having them twist up."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Love the Car Seat BUT....","review":"My husband and I both own a Triumph 5 and our 22 month old daughter loves it. After using the seat for 15 month the tension knob that is used to release the harness failed. I called Evenflow and they told me to discontinue using the seat because the part was not replaceable. They told me to purchase another seat as this one was out of warrenty. Shouldn't these car seats last more than 15 months? I am truly disappointed with the company and refuse to purchase any more products from Evenflow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent purchase for tall infants","review":"Our son was too tall for his infant seat before he was 4 months old. I did alot of research to find a seat that would \\"fit\\" his tall frame, but yet recline so his head wouldn't fall to the side. This seat is perfect! We have a Honda CR-V and it fits better than the infant seat. We did have to put a towel under it because the backseat is on an incline. The firestation inspected it just to be sure and it was fine. I don't find the straps to be difficult to use. I just hit the lever and loosen them when I get him out and tighten him back up when I put him in. I can do it with one hand. It is very easy to adjust the strap height. Overall, this is an excellent seat for those babies that are very tall at a young age."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Best Car Seat!!!!!!!!!!","review":"My son is 15 months and still in this car seat. He is 35 lbs. We bought this for him when he was 9 months old, we had the alpha omega one and he hated getting into the car. That one was so not confortable for him and it was so hard to tighten, it was a pain. He has loved the car since he got his new seat. My husband always wants to go climb in his car seat with him becuase it looks like a big lazy boy chair and its so comfy. We love it and it is so easy to tighten on our child. The only down fall is my son only has 5 more lbs to go till he out grows it. But it is the best. He loves to try and help buckle himself in by pulling up the 5 point part. Buy it, you'll love it and its number 3 in consumer reports."},{"rating":"2","title":"Triumph 5 Comfort Touch","review":"We have two of these car seats. I bought them because Consumer Reports rated it in the top 3 safest car seats last May. It took us a little while to learn how to strap our son in properly since the straps can be made longer by sliding the clip to remove or put in the baby without actually making them longer. Sounds weird but it works. I like the fact that I can also lengthen and shorten the straps with knob on the base. It fits in my car and my husband's truck perfectly. It's like a nice big recliner for my baby. We graduated from the infant car seat at 4 months because he was too long for it. He is 8 months old now and I believe this seat will allow him to remain rear facing until he turns 1 year old this summer. I highly recommend this car seat. I feel that my baby is very safe in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a Big Clamshell that moves!","review":"We recieved this as a shower gift but will be returning it because the CPS tech could not secure it tight in our Acura MDX. We just bought the Britax with the latch and it fit perfectly with no movement once the rear facing tether was installed. Comparing the two seats we found some information that you might find useful: The Evenflo is very heavy and wide 19.5 inches vs. 18 inches for the Britax. The back height is only 21 inches vs. 22.5 inches for Britax. On the Evenflo, our little (10 mo / 95% percentile height & weight- ha, ha) fella's head would flop side to side and his little legs were pushing against the seat. He looked like he was being gobbled up by a Clamshell! It's a cute looking carseat but doesn't look the like the construction will hold up over time. If you have a small infant/toddler and you can get a solid fit, this might be an OK seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST HAVE!

I am SO glad I decided on this one after months of research. One piece of advice -- buy a leveler for it for your bay's first few months; it makes it easier to get your baby in and out as well as keeps him/her more comfortable when in the younger months and the head, etc., is not so strong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work well for me","review":"While this seat seems well made and safe there were more negatives than I could handle. First, as mentioned in lots of reviews, the latch mechanism is large and fussy. Standing in the rain fiddling with the mechanism, not fun. Our large 6 mo. old had his entire chest and midsection covered with plastic buckle mechanisms. He still seemed comfortable though. Second, the back seats of our Town & Country minivan have side bolsters that block access to the side mounted buckle release mechanism when rear facing. I'm sure it would work better forward facing, but I want one that works both ways.We were trying to save a little money by not getting another Britax, but we've returned it and will be getting another Britax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Straps to difficult","review":"I bought this seat because it was rated high and seemed well liked by on-line reviews. After my husband tried for about 5 minutes to get the straps properly adjusted and tight, we both agreed to take it back. I would not want a caregiver to have to try to figure these straps out. Keep it simple for safety."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATED IT!!!","review":"After much research, I decided to purchase this seat. I actually bought two, one for each car. My 7 month old cried each time I put her in it. The memory straps were much more of a problem than convenience. I had a hard time each time I put her in or out of the seat. Her arms would get caught between the loops. I took both of them back and bought a cheaper seat that has the adjustable strap at the bottom of the seat. She no longer cries each time I take her for a ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"straps ...","review":"i can't stand this carseat. i had to fight to adjust the straps properly every time i used it. this seat is NOT for the mechanically challenged!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Tricky To Get Baby In...","review":"But then, I haven't tried a bunch of different seats. It was rated highly by Consumer Reports, so we bought it based on that. What is troublesome is that when I am putting my son in it, the shoulder straps almost seem too short when I buckle him in, and it pulls him a bit down. I try to loosen the shoulder straps, but they seem not to lengthen. But once you turn the knob a few times, it all seems to fit right. I think that the shoulder straps stay the same length as when the baby is in transit, versus loosening when you use the release knob. The release knob seems to loosen only the waist straps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Safety problems","review":"I had several safety problems with this car seat and have finally gotten another one. My son always slid out of shoulder straps when in the rear facing position. I constantly had to adjust the straps even though they claim that you would not have to. I finally gave up on the seat when the crotch strap stopped locking into position and my child could slide down in the seat any time. I called Evenflo and they replaced the seat with another one. I am going to return it and get a refund, Evenflo did not want to give me refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Wash Harness","review":"I have had the car seat for 1 year and loved it until my daughter got sick in it and I needed to completely remove the car seat cover and straps to wash it. I didn't know at the time of purchase, the straps CAN NOT be removed!I emailed Evenflo and got the following response: \\"I do apologize, the harness straps are not made to come off the seat. There is no way to get them back on and working properly. Thank you for contacting Evenflo ParentLink. We appreciate the time you took to email us. \\"I then called and talked to a customer service rep and she was not very sympathetic, telling me that I should have read the instruction manual before using the car seat. She could not tell me what page the reference is on and I could not find it anywhere. She did offer me a new car seat if I paid $50 dollars. I thought they could do better than that.I give this product an unfavorable rating based solely on the unremovable straps."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Much Trouble!!","review":"This carseat was to much trouble. Although it seems to be a comfy seat, if it is buckled in properly and tight you cant get it to recline right. If your car is not set up for the LATCH then its a pain to get your hand in the back to buckle the belt.I took this seat back the next day!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could return mine.","review":"If you are looking for a car seat that needs to constantly be moved from car to car (ie...you drop baby off at daycare and husband picks baby up at daycare, so you leave the car seat), this car seat is NOT for you. It is a pain to get it buckled into the car. The holes that the seat belt slide through are small, my hands barely fit. I have to peel back the material and guide the seat belt that way. It's a pain. Not to mention it is a some what heavy seat. So constantly moving it is quite a work out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Britax","review":"I purchased this car seat for my now 18 month old daughter when she was 6 months old. I recently had surgery on my hand, and love the fact that I can hook her and tighten the straps with one hand. I have used the Britax and was not happy with that car seat. Triumph car seat is cheaper than the Britax and much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just hope your kid never barfs,pees or spills in it....","review":"The cover APPEARED to be removable for washing what with all the clips around the edges. However, we found that it is actually sewn to the seat and the straps are sewn together and that the cover does NOT come off!You would have to cut the straps or the cover to get it off.I will be contacting Evenflo and asking them for a new one that I can sew snaps on myself since the current cover now smells like sour milk permanantly. Some things just don't make sense! What parent has ever had a kid who NEVER made a stinky mess of some sort in the car seat!AAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRHGGGGGGGGHHHHH!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Triumph 5 a winner","review":"This seat is great, it was so easy to install. My back seat slopes quite a bit, so we put a towel underneath to fix that. The fabric is soft and cozy and I love that the seat reclines. We had our baby in a carrier for the first 5 months and with headrests and all, her head still fell forward when she was sleeping or riding so now she is laid back and cozy. Can't get better than this. I highly recommend it especially for the price is great. One hand tightening and release of harness straps is a plus!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Car Seat","review":"Deciding what car seat to buy for our son was a little overwhelming. There are so many choices out there! After careful consideration and research, we chose this carseat. It has wonderful safety reviews and is a nice looking seat. The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is because it was a little difficult to install in our Chevy Blazer in the rear facing position. My son really seems to like it and the padding on the seat is much more plush than other brands in its price range. We are very pleased with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Evenflow doesn't play fair","review":"This seat is pretty good. While rated very safe, the straps are cumbersome and more of a pain than anticipated. However, the worst part about the straps is that they are wrapped on an axel-like rod within the seat. If the straps were wrapped wrong or get pulled wrong, they become off-centered. This means that one side will tighten much tighter than the other. The only thing that can be done is to send the defective seat back to the company and wait at least 2 weeks for a new replacement seat. You also have the option of getting a booster seat instead (most are not rated safe and are much less in cost). Evenflow would not work with us to meet our traveling needs despite admitting the seat could not be used. They would not allow us a refund so we could buy a new seat immediately. Alltogether, its worth the extra money just so you don't have to deal with the company's poor service and the chance the straps may become defective!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!!","review":"We purchased this car seat not too long ago for our 7 month old son. We love it, it fits perfectly in our little ford escort hatchback. I was worried at first going shopping for these bigger car seats that it wouldn't fit, but of the 3 we tried at Babierus this one was the ONLY one that fit! Our son loves it, and I feel VERY secure with him being in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An overall good buy","review":"We purchased this seat a month ago and so far we are pleased. Our son is very comfortable in this seat. It reclines enough for him to lay back comfortably. (something that many other seats wouldn't do) At 4 months he is 26 inches and 17 pounds. We are a little concerned that he will outgrow this seat before he is ready for the next seat. His shoulders fit comfortably now - but if they broaden it will be a tight fit. The buckle seems to land right under his chin and I have trouble snapping it without catching his skin. Despite these little aggravations We are very pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"yes, cleaning","review":"My son just threw up in the this carseat. I removed the cover and washed it as instructed. All the cushioning waded up into balls. Then when I went to put the cover back on..after hosing down the seat itself, the styrofoam pieces broke off. Both sides broke off and the car seat was a mess. This doesn't seem very safe! I took it back to babysrus- which they were amazingly great with their help and return policy (no receipt or box). I had to show them the model on the floor because the car seat was so unrecognizable. When I showed them.. I lifted the cover to show the areas that fell apart and the floor model was also broken in the same place.Don't buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great for rear facing","review":"This seat fits perfectly in my SUV and reclined to it's full correct position. After trying the alpha omega and taking it back after one day I purchased this and love it and baby loves it too! It is so easy to install (literally took about five minutes) because it comes fully assembled. The straps do tend to get a little twisted but its small problem to deal with because they seem to hold my five month old son nice and secure. The easy release latch is great for getting baby in and out of the car too. I would highly recommend this seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Question","review":"I recently purchased this based on the reviews I read here. So far so good. My son looks much more comfortable here than he did in his infant car seat. I do agree with the previous reviewer that the double straps on the shoulders seem a bit too much and hard to adjust but I guess that makes it even more safe and secure for our kids. Just a general question though - my son is very sensitive to light. It was nice when he was in his infant car seat that it had a sun shade. Wouldn't it be nice if the convertible car seats also had sun shades? I wonder why they don't install those on convertible car seats? Wonder if it's a safety hazard..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only thing that stopped me from buying is the seat cover","review":"I have a nine month old son. I am considering buying the Evenflow Triumph 5 Comfort Touch Car Seat. I liked all the features. Last week I went to BRU to buy one. But, the only thing that stopped me from buying was the seat cover. On the display item, the plastic hooks(2 on bottom and 2 on the top) that keep the seat cover attached to the car seat were dangling from the cover, basically making 2 holes in the cloth. Looking at that, I backed off from buying the carseat. Did any of you had any problems with the cloth? Is it durable? I would greatly appreciate your response. Thanks in Advance."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful for the money","review":"This seat is great. We purchased the AlphaOmega first, TERRIBLE. The Triumph 5 fits great in my Jeep Grand Cherokee with plenty of room for adults on either side. The side and front strap adjustments make it much easier to accomodate a QUICKLY GROWING little one. Even though we had to put a wedge in front, due to my car seats, this one is easy to install. My daughter seems much more comfortable and doesn't fight me QUITE as much when strapping her in. We do a lot of traveling since her grandparents live 350 miles away, she seemed quite contented during the last trip. This seat is even low enough in the back that I can actually see her in the Fisher Price jungle theme mirror strapped to the back headrest, something I deem a must. The AlphaOmega was sooo high, I couldn't even see her in the mirror, scary. AND it created a blind spot. Try the Evenflo Triumph 5, I feel it is a VERY worthwhile investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"what they don't tell you!","review":"I purchased this carseat based upon its excellent reviews and moderate price. I took the carseat to a carseat installation service in my area, and as soon as the installer saw my backseat (Acura MDX) and the carseat I had purchased, she said, \\"take it back.\\" Apparently this carseat cannot be placed in the middle of the backseat if your car has an armrest that folds down; it would have to be placed on either the left or right side. Since I only have 1 child, I wanted him to be placed in the middle. Apparently, this is the case with all Evenflo carseats if you have an armrest in the middle of your backseat. So, I returned this seat for the Britax Marathon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comfortable and safe!","review":"My 10 month old baby girl just loves this seat. She is very comfortable in it. The things that I love about this seat is that the straps do not twist at all. The strap adjuster is on the side of the seat and is so easy to use. When rear-facing you can actually reach the knob that adjusts the straps on most other car seats that I have looked at, the strap adjuster is right up against the seat and is impossible to reach. This seat has styrofoam construction, which is a very good feature. The only other carseats that have styrofoam construction are the Britax brand carseats and they are alot more expensive. This seat is just awesome. It's cushy and easy too install. I love this carseat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended by car seat inspector","review":"We bought this car seat after a lot of research and decided that it was (on paper) just as good as the Britax. However, it isn't. The straps were difficult to adjust and once we had our son strapped in, the buckle rested right on his belly and the chest clip almost overlapped the buckle. Even the Babies R Us person working with us said he wouldn't buy it (we ignored him). So we took it back and bought the Britax Marathon. When I took it in to our local police to have it installed, I mentioned I had bought the Evenflo Triumph 5 before and the police officer said he would have told me to take it back -- he said that while all car seats meet safety regulations, they are not all equally safe or desirable. I'm glad I spent the money and bought the Britax."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Car seat","review":"This car seat is awsome!! One of the best features is you never have to re-thread the straps thru those tiny wholes. It is also great for small babies. My daughter is 11 months old and weighs 16lbs 3 ozs we didn't need the infant seat anymore and put her in this seat and she is really happy in it. I like the fact that it lined with the bike helmet material. The only draw back is it's weight, it is really heavy, not a good seat it carry on an airplane but that is a small draw back compaired to the saftey of the seat.."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the lady with the question about fabric durability","review":"I really like the Evenflo Triumph car seat. However, there is a problem with the fabric. We bought ours in late March 2003, and while moving the car seat from my Jeep to my husband's truck, my husband managed to pull the fabric from one of the plastic clasps that secures the cover to the car seat. Yesterday, while trying to pull the cover down and secure it, my finger went right through the fabric, creating a hole. I called Evenflo and explained the problem. Since this happened in the 90 warranty period Evenflo is sending me a new cover at no charge. I hope this info helps you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great seat","review":"We found 2 of these carseats on sale, so we bought them both. The double strap is not as difficult as some people say, you just have to know how to use them. They're easy once you know how to use them. When you put the child in, you should click the strap into the base before clipping the chest clip, it's easier that way.We've only used it for a couple months, my daughter is 7 months now. Not sure how she'll like it when she gets a little bigger, it seems to be more form fitting for narrow bodies. We'll see. Otherwise, it's a great seat so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby (and Hubby) loves it!","review":"We bought this seat when our daughter was 3 months old. She is a very tall baby and was growing out of her infant carrier quickly. I had done research online and was considering a much more expensive seat. At the store, my husband spotted the Triumph5 and fell in love. The baby is totally comfortable, and we are confident that she is also safe. It fits rear facing in both our Town and Country and Taurus. We liked it so much that we've just ordered a second one"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good investment","review":"I bought this when my son was eight months and 18.5 lbs. The straps are horrible, and the \\"memory harness\\" feature is a joke. I had to fight with the straps to get my son into the seat, much to his displeasure. Also, the stitching on the seat cover came undone within the first day of use! Not acceptable for such an expensive purchase!It was easy to install in the car, though so I'll give it credit for that. Maybe this car seat is fine for older children, but I had to return it after only a couple of days."},{"rating":"2","title":"comfy for infant and fairly easy to use","review":"We have used this seat for our 5-month old since day one. When he was a newborn we used one of those padded head supports shaped like a horseshoe. He is quite comfortable in it. We have put him in other carseats when we have visited friends and he seems much less comfortable than in the Triumph. We like the harness system and once we got used to it we have not found it difficult to use. In fact I like that I can loosen it and readjust it as often as I wish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Safety Ratings","review":"I have not purchased this seat yet, but I found the Consumer Reports ratings to be very helpful. My husband and I were trying to decide between this car seat and the Britax one which received the highest overall ratings. If you read the report carefully, the Evenflo actually got better ratings for safety in the crash test. The Britax did not score as well in this area. It scored the highest in the four areas that indicate how easy it is to use. This gave it the highest rating overall. If you look at the price and the safety ratings, this Evenflo seat seems like a great purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As I expected","review":"Looking for a car seat was no easy task. Reading all the reviews I finally came to the decision of the Triumph 5. My 1 year old daughter finally grew out of her infant car seat and this one has been great. Easy to install. Fits great in my Corolla! A little on the heavy side, for changing to other cars, but not a huge issue. (just use to the infant carrier) I'm glad I decided on this one. My daughter likes it, very comfortable. I like the knobs allowing you to release and tighten the belts. I also like the way you only need to unlatch the fabric to put the seatbelt through. My hands are so small that I actually can just slip my hands through the slots without even having to unlatch the fabric.Great buythanksDopey3492"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it! I love it! I love it!","review":"I did a lot of research when looking for a car seat. I did not want to spend A LOT of money. I am so happy with this purchase. It was easy to install and so easy to use. We need to get another one for our second car and I wouldn't buy anything else. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great seat!","review":"We purchased the Triumph V seat after reading several consumer magazine reviews. My son loves it. It is so comfortable and easy to adjust. When he falls asleep in the car his head never falls forward as it does in the other car seat we have in the other car. We call it his \\"Lazyboy\\" carseat because of the comfort of it all. It is also FAA approved so we can take it on our long plane trips with the assurance that our son will be comfortable sleeping on the plane."},{"rating":"1","title":"STRAP UNHAPPY","review":"This was my first of two so far for my 10 month old, 29-1/2\\" long baby boy. The seat seemed to be comfy, but he cried whenever I tried to put him into it. The straps are the reason I took it back. I read the instructions and even emailed Evenflo to inquire on usage, but the time and effort to get them right just wasn't worth it anymore. His arms were hard to get out once he was in there. I felt the whole setup was too \\"strappy\\" with buckles and latches being everywhere. You must play with them before you buy to be sure you want to (can) adjust these while sitting in the back seat of car with a young one. It took a long time and was quite frustrating. I did purchase the Vanguard 5/Comfort Touch tonight and will be testing it this week. If all else fails, I'll be getting the Britax. Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OUTGROWING IT AT 6 MONTHS!!","review":"I just bought this seat for my 6 month old and I am taking it back. I had taken him to the BRU store and this one was by far the one he fit best in and with most comfort. The problem is his shoulders are about as high as they can go for the 2nd of 3 shoulder heights available. I didn't think that was a problem at the store since he had plenty of room till the third one -- However, when I read the instructions, I found out I can't put it in the 3rd height until he is forward facing - another 6 months! I don't think he is going to stop growing for the next six months, so I have to take it back. I really hate this because I loved the comfort and user-friendly design, which none of the others seem to come close to. I think I am going to get the Century 1500 STE for $$, since it ranked well safety-wise and I saw no really big differences in the rest of the seats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it...until it broke...","review":"I've had the evenflo triumph 5 for 2 years...it is easily installed and the straps adjust easily from the front (big plus). I was thrilled until the crotch buckle started to stick...I thought I wouldn't be able to get it buckled at all and then upon arriving home I could not get my daughter out of the seat...I had to make the straps as loose as possible and slide her out. Worst of all Evenflo says that it is past the 60 day warranty and will not replace the carseat and they say the buckle is not replaceable. I am angered by evenflo's refusal to back their product."},{"rating":"1","title":"No padding and hated the straps!!!!","review":"This was the first convertible carseat that I have bought being a first time mom. I really liked the fact that the carseat was wide (I have a big boy!). Also, I liked the turn knobs to tighten the straps or so I thought. The turn knobs only tighten the lap part of the belt not the shoulder straps. Once I got the seat home I discovered the double loop shoulder straps were really a pain in the butt. I did not even bother to put it in my car. The other thing I hated was that there was no padding in the seat area. This is not a good thing especially since we will be taking long trips out of state to visit relatives. Cheaper carseats had more padding than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the seat, but....","review":"This seat was easy to install and my son was very comfortable in it, but I did encounter a problem. The support that goes around the childs head has a different type of material on the backing. It is very thin and my 10 month old son was able to poke a hole through to the stuffing. I turned around to check on him b/c he was being very \\"quiet\\" and to my surprise he had a mouth full of stuffing. Great seat, but be careful if you have a \\"picker\\" like I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to install","review":"This seat was highly recommended by the Baby Bargains Book, but we found it impossible to tighten the LATCH straps.

OVER AN HOUR SPENT CLEANING IT AFTER MY DAUGHTER GOT SICK IN IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy Install, But Hard to Remove Child","review":"This seat was the second one I purchased for my five month old son. I was thrilled when I installed it because it was quite easy to do. However, when my son was in the seat, I found the crank to tighten the belts to be very loud, sometimes waking him from sleep. Also, loosening the belt was difficult as the button that had to be pushed would not always disengage the seatbelts. One time, my husband and I couldn't get the belts loosened for almost 5 minutes. What if there had been an emergency and we needed to get our son out quickly? We marched right back to the store, returned it, and spent the extra money on a Britax, which installed easily, is comfortable for my son, and is easy to operate."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"Well I received this car seat as a gift. Boy what a mistake. After only using it one time the hook that keeps the fabric on the car seat ripped off. When I called Evenflo they informed me my car seat, which was only 3 months old, was no longer and warranty and they would replace the cover this one time. They were not very friendly and just keep reminding me they were doing me a favor by giving me a new cover for free when my car seat was no longer under warranty. Secondly the shoulder straps never seemed to fit my baby right no matter what I did. She cried all the time when strapped in. So now I am stuck with a $... car seat that my baby doesn't like. Really look and investigate before buying. Just because it is rated within the top 3 doesn't mean it is always the best. well almost 1 1/2 months after contacting the company I have yet to see a new seat cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor design","review":"This seat did not work in either of our cars in the rear facing position. Our seats have a flared edge for lateral support and the way the harness fastening knob is designed, it is embedded in the seat cushion so you cannot get your fingers in to adjust it. When we tried to put in the center of the seat, we couldn't get it tight enough to keep from moving sideways. It might work with a latch system but we don't have one. It is also very heavy also. The harness system has overlapping straps so it can be confusing at first \\"which hole\\" to put the babies arms through. I will say that it is a comfortable seat for the baby. If you only need it for forward facing it might be a good seat because it did get rated well for safety. We bought the Britax Roundabout and like it a lot better- its much easier to install, more secure and much light."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess this seat is","review":"Not only is it difficult to adjust in the rear-facing configuration, but it is near impossible to keep the straps from dangerously twisting in the retention mechanism. We have two different seats for two different vehicles, and I have never had the kind of trouble with the other seat. If I had a do-over, I would not have purchased this seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend the Extra Money and get a good one","review":"I bought this car seat a year and 1/2 ago, when my daughter was 6 months old. Its works ok, when it's rear facing. However forward facing, it's very difficult to get it strapped in. She is bigger now, and she looks very uncomfortable. Also the fabric is completely worn down to the cushion. I think it's worth spending the extra money and getting the Britax. I'm getting one. Not worth the trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT seat!","review":"My daughter LOVES this carseat, it is so comfortable!it reclines a lot and the straps are so easy to move.The only thing i didnt like was that she is between the first adjustment and second, the second being a little too high over her shoulders and the first way too low. With winter we have to go with the second.but other than that it was fairly easy to install and the second I put her in it she stops crying.I think its a great buy for the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Try it out in the store first","review":"I purchased this car seat online after reading good reviews. I thought it was comparable to the Britax Roundabout with the extra $$$. I returned this seat the day after I got it. It was impossible to put into my car and to get it tightened. My son looked uncomfortable and wailed everytime I tried to put him in the seat. I couldn't tighten the knob effectively. Horrible seat! I purchased the Britax Roundabout and haven't regretted it since. Now that is a wonderful car seat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If the belt release was only 1 inch back","review":"I really liked this seat But I put it in my 2002 town and country (rear facing and the belt release was hitting the back of my seat I could not tighten the belt because there was not enough room.It was a very soft seat and it didi have a lot of room.I did have to take it back but I would try it in your car!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love this seat","review":"We have used this since our daughter outgrew the infant carrier, so about age 4mo to 13 mo. The adjustable knobs on the sides to tighten the straps are fantastic. Maybe once a month they do twist, but it takes all of 8 seconds to fix, just like when my seat belt gets twisted. We loved it rear facing, had no problems. The only minor problem I have found forward facing is that I can't make it recline. I just might not be pushing in the right spot and our girl seems to be happy and comfy so I am not too concerned. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is the reclining issue, which as I said may be me and not the carseat. When I first ordered the seat, I thought that I didn't have instructions so I had to call evenflo, they were very helpful and nice. It turns out that the instructions are under a flap in the carseat(that even says, look under here for instructions) so if you do purchase this, which I recommend, please look under the flap for the owners manual."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy, easy, easy","review":"This car seat has been wonderful. I was very hesitant to move away from our infant seat/carrier because it was just so convenient. I love this seat however, and have been delightfully surprised. I read all of the reviews and my husband and I tried our little guy in every seat, and even put a few out in the car. This was the smallest one height wise, and it fits great in our Honda Civic. The other ones are all so high if you don't have a van or SUV. The best feature in my opoinion though is the belt adjuster on the side of the seat. I do not know how you could do most of them with the seat in a rear facing position. This is just so easy, especially with winter coats. I love it. I have just been so pleased with this seat. My son in comfy and safe, and I am thrilled!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT Carseat!!","review":"We are very pleased with this carseat. The fabric is durable and the straps are easy to use. The knob to tighten/loosen the straps can be a little difficult to turn at times, but this is a minor factor in the overal function of the carseat. The carseat secures fairly easily and the LATCH system works well. The only thing I would recommend to the manufacturer is to change the way the cover can be pulled over the side. The padding is styrofoam and my son has started picking at it. We will be using adhesive-backed velcro to remedy this problem. Overall, we feel very secure in our choice of this carseat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome seat","review":"I purchased this seat after witnessing a friend's daughter in the same seat. I was apprehensive about the strap adjustment, but as one reviewer said, if you read how to adjust the straps, it is simple. It is easy to get my daughter in and out of this seat and she falls asleep easily as other people mentioned. Overall, I think this seat is a bargain compared to the other Britax seats. I would recommend this seat to anyone. Only one problem that I've encountered was with the latch system. The strap is not quite long enough and is difficult to get the seat in and out quickly, but at least it is extremely tight in the car. Oh yeah, and I have a Honda Civic also--no problem fitting it in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have gotten the Britax","review":"I purchased this car seat for my 18 month old son. I researched and liked what information I could find on this product. Once I got it home I was very unhappy. First of all it weighs a TON! Not recommended if you need to use it for 2 cars. It is wide which is comfy for the rider but if you have a small car it is going to be a tight squeeze if there are other passengers. Especially if there are other carseats/boosters that need to be used. I have an Expedition and 2 other sons in boosters and it is quite a feat getting them all in the second row. The straps take a bit getting used to and to try to recline it is a nightmare. Lastly to wash the cover requires a screwdriver to remove the back to be able to take it off. Our fourth son has just arrived and when he is ready for a forward-facing seat he will be getting a Britax model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Seat","review":"We purchased this seat at Target for 15% less, in a fabric called Aztec, which is a very attractive option. It's a great seat.Our 20 lb 7 month old loves it--we know because he falls asleep the minute we hit the road, something he never did in his old seat. He also loves the cushioned buckle--we know because he has stopped trying to unbuckle himself since we got this seat.We love the memory harness, the easy to use release levers and tightening knobs, and the one-hand recline lever. The best part is being able to change the height positioning straps from the front--so easy you can do it in less than 3 minutes, by yourself.This seat is safe--just ask Consumer Reports, whose experts rated it among the top 3 seats in their most recent review."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome car seat","review":"After purchasing the britax car seat and it being to large to fit into our nissan sentra. We decided to purchase the truimph 5 car seat. It fits into our car, and leaves room for passengers in the front seat! We love how the car seat fits our 6 month old, 20 lbs baby! Our daughter is soo comfortable in the bucket seat and we have had no problem with the straps or installing the car seat. Just to let you know, the instructions for the car seat are underneath the padding of the seat. Also, for all those people who can't get past the syrofoam...the britax also using it in their car seats. Styrofoam helps absorb the impact from a crash. I wouldn't buy a car seat the didn't incorporate this life saving material. Overall, the truimph 5 car seat in a much better value than the britax that also doesn't recline enough in the rear facing position. There is nothing like seeing for daughter look like a rag-doll when sleeping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird Straps","review":"We got this car seat as our second with the Britax Roundabout being the other one. Although the Triumph 5 is wide and rather comfy, the straps are ridiculously difficult. As far as I can tell, it is the only carseat to have double straps from the crotch latch up to the shoulders. What a pain. When we tried to tighten, only the lower or upper strap would tighten leaving the other one loose and sometimes falling down off the babies shoulders. Also putting him in was difficult. His arms would get split between the double layer of straps. Realizing I would need to deal with this seat for several years, I have decided to return it to get another Roundabout. Only $169 on babyage.com and it can be used up to 40 lbs. Much, much easier to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best deal under $150","review":"This seat is awesome! After purchasing the Graco ComfortRide for our oldest daughter and hating the twisted straps and the teetering of the seat, we bought the Evenflo for our second child. What a difference $40 makes! The seat is cushy, the base is sturdy, and there's recline options!This seat installed easily, both rear- and front-facing. Adjusting the straps is simple once you get the hang of the adjustment knob (Note: Graco users will have a harder time getting this than other users). Even changing strap positions is easy - you don't have to take out the seat! You just lift the front panel (located behind your child's back, and reloop the straps.We don't have the LATCH system, and the seat couldn't be more secure.Overall, we found this seat to be so comfortable for our daughter that we went and bought another one for our youngest child. And the Graco seat? Well, it's going in the trash as soon as our oldest moves into a booster next month."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Happy Mama","review":"I researched and debated for weeks between this seat and the Britax. I decided on this seat and am very happy with my decision! I feel that I still get lots of \\"extras\\" (easy to adjust straps, non-twisting straps, lots of padding, good looking, etc) as well as safety, without the ...pricetag. It fits perfectly in my Honda Accord and my 7-month-old son loves it! I use it with the seatbelt because my car is not LATCH equipped and it is very secure. I didn't give it 5 stars because it only has the helmet foam on the sides, unlike the Britax which has it along the whole torso. Overall, I highly recommend this seat if you are unwilling/unable to pay for the Britax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seat is too heavy and big","review":"I liked the side strap adjustments on this seat, however this seat is extremely heavy. Do not buy if you plan to move from car to car. I could not tighten the latch enough to keep the car seat from sliding, using the seat belt was worse(maybe because I have leather car seats?). It also did not fit well in my Ford Focus Sedan. I returned it for the new britax marathon with latch. The britax fits my car perfectly and does not move at all. The latch on the britax is much easier to use, but of course you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs Longer Straps","review":"I like everthing about this seat except for the straps. My son is 20 months old, 28 lbs, and 33\\". The straps are fully released and I can barely get him in the seat. I have to buy something bigger just because he outgrew the straps before the seat! Attention Manufacturer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So easy to use","review":"We originally puchased this car seat with the OshKosh padding. When we needed a second car seat, we purchased a Graco and found it difficult to tighten the harness when it was being used rear facing, so we went out and purchased a second Evenflo Triumph 5. Since our daughter is small for her age, she will be rear facing for a while longer and this harness is so easy to use since the tightening cranks are on the sides. The padding is very thick, our daughter is so comfortable in it, she falls asleep almost instantly. My only concern is to see how well she will fit in it when she is 18 months old, if she is so comfortable in it now"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to Adjust","review":"We got this car seat as a second seat for my husbands car. This is a great seat when not installed - once installed in the car it is horrible. You can not get to the tighten/loosen adjuster knob once the seat is installed.We had the seat installed by the local fireman- and he put the seat in very tight(the correct way) and every time we put our 6 month old in the seat it is a struggle to tighten him in or get him out.I plan on bringing this seat back to Babies R Us for an exchage-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for newborns!!!","review":"I bought this seat when a coworker highly recommended it after using it with her toddler, and after I read the great safety reviews in several respected consumer journals. I thought I was saving money by having one seat that we could use until my son was over 40 pounds. I was very disappointed on the day my husband and I brought our son home from the hospital and found that it forced his head downward toward his chest in the rear-facing position because newborns haven't developed enough head control to hold their head up on their own yet. We had the seat inspected, so we are certain it was installed properly; it just doesn't work for a newborn. We kept it to use later after he outgrows the carrier system we had to buy to replace this one. My advice: buy a carrier system from the beginning and it will save you money and frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great looking product but...","review":"My wife and I did an extreme amount of research on this carseat and were quite impressed with it's ratings and reviews, so we purchased it. After installing the seat we noticed right away while driving around the noise from the seat was going to drive us insane. The carseat while having good safety ratings and a great appearance shakes and rattles so annoyingly while going down the road we couldn't stand it. We had to unfortunately return the seat. It seems due to it's ability to adjust so much it has more moving parts creating the noise factor."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Triumph broke after 11 days","review":"...After deciding on the Triumph 5 Comfort Touch, I went to Toys R Us and was very pleased initially with the seat. I did have the salesperson help me carry it out and install it due to the heavier weight. I'm not that small, but I couldn't imagine trying to travel with this seat on the airplane. I did however rationalize that this extra weight would add to the seats overall safety.After driving me crazy for the last week, the adjustment knob finally broke and now I can no longer tighten the straps. I called Evenflo's Customer Service Department (if you want to call it that) and was put on hold for over 20 minutes before the rep came on the line and concluded that the gearing was most likely stripped and was not caused by user error - Me! I had called Evenflo earlier in the week to verify I was indeed using the adjustments correctly. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"My daughter WOULD NOT sit in this seat!","review":"I know people that are very happy with this seat, but try your own kid in it before purchasing. The seat is very rounded. My daughter hated sitting in and looked so uncomfortable. Her whole body was hunched in it, and her head was pushed forward so she was looking a little down. Since we tried it in BRU first, we knew not to buy it.I have two friends who received it without trying it first. Both registered for it. One's child hated it, the other's loved it. I would rather wait than worry about trying to return it 6+ months after receiving it from a registry.I gave it 2 stars because I do know that it gets good reviews from consumers and the government. Even my local police dept recommends checking it out. But they also warned to try it out first because it is such an odd shape."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY ONLINE","review":"I would definately not buy this seat online. I had decided to purchase it after researching it online, and went into the store to check it out. (It has the second highest safety ratings as well as being recommended by other parents and Consumer Reports) As soon as I put my hand into the seat and realized that there was NO padding under the fabric, I put it back and walked away. There is NO WAY an infant will sleep or even ride comfortably with no padding under his or her bottom. I bought the Britax Marathon, and after the initial \\"sticker shock\\" am completely in love with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous Material","review":"We where all set to go on purchasing this car seat. I loved everything about it, and thought it was a very well made seat. Boy was I wrong! While I was talking to the salesperson at Toys r us my husband started taking the padding off to check out the material. Underneath the cushion of the arm rest is styrofoam. He pulled it off even more to reveal its mostly made of this stuff. I just know that my child would eventually peel back the cover and have a great time of breaking apart a very expensive, and large packing peanut. Not only would it be messy, but also extremely dangerous. I wouldn't be surprised if the Triumph Five gets recalled because of this.Mother of two \\"Alison\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Some things are not as good as they seem!","review":"If I could give no stars I would!

I was thrilled when it was in stock, loved the features, and was excited to install it once I got home... However, during installation, I soon discovered the most alarming part of this seat...styrofoam! Yes, styrofom. Styrofoam makes up at least 1/3 of the seat, hidden underneath the pad...I don't know about you but I don't want to protect my child with styrofoam borders of her car seat...I feel cheated ... and it is certainly going back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not for a toddler","review":"i gave this seat one star because it is comfortable. but putting it together was not easy. also i dont know why evenflow uses so much velcro on all their products. my 16 month old just takes everything apart since its so easy for her with the velcro. also the foam on this carseat just doesnt make sense to me. my daughter picks at it for the whole car ride and now each side of the car seat has deep holes where she has been picking.. and my car is full of little white styrofoam!! i wouldnt recommend this seat for a toddler who gets into everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Choice!","review":"I have just recently purchased the TRIUMPH 5 COMFORT TOUCH CAR SEAT WITH LATCH for my vehicle for my 7 month old granddaughter. I did much research on-line, with Britax being out of the question, price wise. There are so many features that thrill me with this seat! The adjustable knobs make tightening or loosening the straps a breeze! It is nicely padded, and VERY stable when using the latch. The reclining feature is phenominal!!! Our granddaughter really seems to enjoy it, so much so that my son and his wife purchased the same one for their vehicle! I STRONGLY suggest also purchasing the foam wedge. The seat, when initally put in was not at the proper 45 degree angle. Her poor little head bobbed to and fro while she slept. The $9.99 wedge took care of that and the seat is just as stable with it as without! EXCELLENT CHOICE!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this seat","review":"We purchased this seat when our daughter was 8 months old and have used it for 2 months now. I love how easy it is to adjust the straps on this seat. The seat we have in our second vehicle you have to adjust from behind the seat. Fine now, but when we turn it forward facing it'll be nearly impossible to adjust. These straps adjust with a knob on either side of the seat. The memory straps are a little confusing to figure out and the double strap is a pain sometimes, but the seat makes up for that in other ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"This car seat is worth every penny and more!!","review":"I was all set to buy the Britax roundabout carseat. I went to BRU and the salesman suggested the Triumph to me. He told me that it was just as good as the Britax but at a better price. I tried my daughter in both car seats. She seemed to be comfortable in the Triumph so I decided to give it a try. It was easy to install in my car and fit well rear facing. I love how easy it is to fix the straps. It is just a quick push on the lever to loosen and a twist of the knob to tighten. It reclines far back enough so my daughter can sleep without hurting her neck. I also love the styrofom. Moms, that helps to absorb shock during an accident. The only flaws are that the directions are a little hard to find and I also think that the straps do take time to get used to. Once you understand how to work the straps, though, it is a breeze. Moms, if you were going to go for the Britax like me, save your money here and buy this safe, comfortable carseat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Seat","review":"I have been very happy with this car seat. We originally purchased the Evenflo Titan based on a Consumer Reports article. I found that the seat looked uncomfortable and could pinch my toddler's legs when fastening the harness. We purchased the Triumph when my daughter was 7 months old. The seat is very comfortable and I love all of the recline positions. I have found it very easy to adjust the straps and get my child in and out of the seat. My daughter rides comfortably in the car and on most trips she falls asleep. She will be 2 in November and we have purchased a second seat for my husband's car. Both grandmothers have also purchased seats for their cars."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHOKING HAZARD!","review":"I loved this car seat until a month ago. My six month old loves to play with things in her hands. When she is in her car seat, she grabs and plays with a corner of her car seat cover. Three or four weeks ago, I discovered that she split opened her car seat cover and was grabbing chunks of the filling. I immediately returned the car seat and replaced it with another Triumph 5. I thought my first Triumph 5 was simply a defect and a new seat would solve the problem. Well, I was wrong. This weekend I discovered the same problem appearing again in the car seat cover. Obviously, the material used to construct the backside of this car seat cover is cheap enough to where a six month old is able to slowly tear it apart. This car seat needs to be recalled before a baby chokes to death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This seat is very easy to install, especially if you use the LATCH system. It feels quite sturdy, and stays in place. The seat is VERY plush and comfortable for my baby. It's easy to recline, and to adjust the harness. The seat is quite large and heavy to lug around, but I feel my baby is safe and secure. It received an excellent rating in Consumer Reports, and is priced well."},{"rating":"2","title":"About the styrofoam....","review":"I've been reading the reviews and am shocked to hear about so many returning the seat or disappointed because it's made with styrofoam.

What better way to protect your baby?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Returning the Triumph","review":"After reading so many wonderful reviews and having people come up to us in the store to tell us how wonderful this car seat is, I'm returning it to try the Britax Roundabout.

It's impossible when in a rear facing direction. So back to the store I go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent seat, but with some flaws","review":"My son is 3 months old and almost 20 pounds. I have been searching for a new carseat for several weeks now. I bought and returned 4 in all, including the Evenflo Triumph V. Overall, I liked the looks of this seat. It is very well cushioned and has EPS foam. However, it is very heavy and the harness adjustor can be quite frustrating. I took this seat to the local fire department to have assistance with installation. After working with it for an hour we decided that we just didn't like the way it fit in my van. Also, the buckle is very large and the strap is really long. When my son was fastened in securely, the buckle and lower straps came up very far on his abdomen. The carseat technician and I did not think that looked very safe if we were in an accident. I took this seat back and ended up getting the new Britax Marathon (the only one left in the store!). Britax seats are very expensive, but in my opinion are worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"We've been using this seat for almost 2-1/2 years, since my daughter was 6 months old.

The side arm covers are easily lifted and our son discovered the styrofoam under them and has eaten a large quantity of it. When I contacted Evenflo they offered to send me new styrofoam to replace what he had eaten, and told me to give him a toy to remove his attention.Like I havent tried that The elastic is easy to lift and a toddlers persistance will not stop the issue.

I bought it when my daughter outgrew her infant carseat. I liked the fact that this could be installed in both rear facing and then forward facing when she was older.That said, the problems with it make it not worth the money! First of all, the cover is not removable so you can't wash it. Trust me, this will matter! In desperation I took it outside and scrubbed it down with soap and the water hose. That was a mess and it never really got clean.Second, the strap system broke almost at once. I can neither tighten nor loosen the straps. They're frozen in place.

I love how the straps adjust. It is very convenient for the wacky weather we have had lately. The only problem we have is that the base is very wide (and we are using the LATCH to install it) and we cannot get to the seat belt latches for the sides of the back seat in our Durango.

I decided on the Triumph 5. I read the instructions and was ready to place my daughter in the seat to adjust the straps and recline to best fit her before installing the seat in the car. I placed her in the seat and buckled her in and then began turning the knobs to adjust the belts and much to my HORROR when it was just right I stopped turning the knobs and pulled the straps to make sure they were snug and the straps just pulled right out of the seat HAVING NEVER LOCKED into place. The seat was manufactured Sept 04, 2003. Evenflo stated that every car seat is tested before being shipped which scares me even more that this has happened. They also stated it will be 2-3 weeks before I can get a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Foam Breaks!","review":"I purchased the Evenflo comfort carseat last October and returned it in January when it broke. At first I loved the seat, it was roomy and fit nicely in my small car. The biggest downfall at that time was that you couldn't turn the knobs in the rear facing position. At Christmas we flew with the car seat and checked the seat with our luggage. When we got home I noticed that the foam under the padding was all cracked and broken. I called Evenflo to ask if it could be replaced and they said no and that the seat was now no good. Luckily Babies R Us allowed me to return the seat and purchase another one. I have to wonder if a carseat can break going through baggage what would happen in an accident? As a matter of fact, I was in an acident last week and was glad my child was not in the Comfort Touch seat. I should add that my seat was one of the first ones made and did not have the latch.

First problem was the straps always got tangled. Second it was not comfortable for my daughter. The third problem was when I tried to put the seat belt through rear facing the plastic inserts would always move out of place. The worst problem I had was the seat would move and tilt when I made a turn since it was top heavy, in my (97 Pontiac GrandAm). That to me did not look right safety wise. So when I had enough money I purchased the Britax Marathon after two other carseats I tried. Trust me it is worth every penny. My new seat does not tilt due to having side locking clips on each side."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Bigger Babies","review":"I'm the mother or a large baby (12lb at birth). When my daughter grew out of her infant carrier at 7 months I had to find a seat that was big enough for her to grow in. There are few seats available with high safety ratings that will accommodate a larger child. This one is great. We actually tried a smaller seat and found that she was very fussy and fidgety when we were in the car. When we switched to the Triumph 5, car rides got a lot easier. I only have one seat so we are always transfering it from vehicle to vehicle and it's a breeze with the Triumph 5. It's also very easy to get her in and out of. We just turned it front-facing and it's even easier!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for tall babies","review":"My 6 month old quickly grew out of his infant carrier, so I decided to do some research on a car seat. He is in the 95th percentile for height so getting something that would be suitable for his height was very important. I found that not only was the triumph the safest car seat in crash test studies, but it also is very good for tall babies. I bought it and adjusted it to him, it is wonderful. It is so comfortable to him. It fits GREAT in my Camry. I am very pleased with this buy. I may find some downfalls to this purchase later, but for now I think this is the best decision I coulda made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't purchase again","review":"We purchased this seat when our daughter was 4 months old.

My daughter also seems uncomfortable when she is in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"This is a pretty plus car seat & my daughter seemed to really enjoy the extra space (coming from the Graco infant seat). It secures in the car fairly easily & most of the adjustments can be made without taking it out of the car. Currently we are using the seat rear-facing since my daughter is only 9 months old & she's been using the seat for about 2 months now. We used another inexpensive Evenflo model while we were out of town once & that seat pales in comparison the Triumph. I'm hoping we'll have the seat for a couple more years without any problems. The only problem I've had is adjusting the straps/harness once she's snapped in. The straps can become a bit tangled and uneven & it's like solving a riddle to get it straightened so that my child is securely in place."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT purchase this seat!","review":"I am furious with Evenflo right now beacause of their customer sevice. This car seat was great at first, until my daughter got sick and I had to clean the seat. The cover fell apart when I washed it according to the instructions and the straps are not removable and I CANNOT get the vomit smell out. Customer service says there is nothing they can do about it. UGHHH!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great car seat for the price","review":"I've been using this car seat for 1 month after my now 7.5 mo. old daughter outgrew her infant seat. I was impressed that the ratings in Consumer Reports were comparable to the expensive Britax seats. The seat seems to be well padded and comfortable for my ~19 lb. 26\\" daughter to sit in (rear facing). It was very easy to install and to adjust the strap tension. I also like how easy it is to move the shoulder straps to each of the three settings- you don't even have to take the seat out of the car!The only reason I give this seat 4 stars (not 5) is because of the difficulty we had removing the seat cover for washing. My daughter leaked through her diaper on to the seat cover at the end of a very long trip. I had to uninstall the car seat and bring it in the house in the pouring rain, only to find out that I needed a screwdriver in order to take off the cover!!! Seems odd, considering how easily everything else is about this seat.Overall, a great seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"SAVED MY BABIES LIFE!!!!!!","review":"I love this carseat!!!! It is so easy to get your child in and out of. I was recently in a severe car wreck when a car ran out in front of me. I hit the car head on going 65 miles per hour.

This carseat saved her life and I would recommend everyone use this for your precious little one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Great After All","review":"I bought this carseat after a lot of research, as it got a lot of good reviews.After installing it in my car,I realized the knobs to tighen the straps were pushed up to my seat so far I could not use the knob.Also, the lap part of the strap would get tight but the shoulder strap would stay increadably loose.I am calling tomorrow to see about exchanging this for a different carseat.I would recommend trying it out first before buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ex Peace Corps Volunteer reviews excellent teaching tool","review":"As a Peace Corps Volunteer in Paragauy, one of my main objectives was to promote the use of home gardens.

Don't buy it for friends (or their kids). Don't let friends buy it for you (or your kids). The translation is AWFUL. There are so many other Dr. Seuss books that have been brilliantly translated: Mulberry St / Green Eggs and Ham / One Fish Two Fish / Horton Hears a Who / The Grinch Stole Christmas. Buy those.

It is literally translated- word-for-word, and obviously that does not work with any kind of translation. The translator has to use his/her discretion to transmit the message through whatever type of medium they are working with. In this case, Dr. Seuss's writing is playful and rhyming- this translation does not do this book any justice. They should really never have published this.

This translation DOES NOT succeed in achieving the lyrical style in Spanish. Any Dr. Seuss books translated by Aida Marcuse or Yanitzia Cannetti are fabulous because they ARE able to maintain the lyrical rhyme in Spanish. I hope one day that one of those two translators does their magic with The Cat in the Hat. In the mean time, I just read this one to my son in English.

That translation was done right!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Losing the rhyme is a crime...","review":"A literal translation of Cat in the Hat does great damage to Dr. Seuss' original idea to teach children how to read.

Anything but this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cat in the hat in Spanish is not a good book","review":"I read The Cat in the Hat in Spanish and did not like it at all. The beauty of the English version is how Dr. Seuss combines the words to make them go well together, but in Spanish, this just does not happen. In my opinion, this is a book that should NOT be translated.....at least not into Spanish. I was raised in Mexico City and attended up to my second year of College in Mexico, then graduated from a US university, so I am fluent in both languages.

The body count is pretty large by film's end. The flaws count, too -- with too many implausible heroics in flame-drenched buildings -- too many intense expressions -- overwrought poses -- and... pregnant... pauses.... The story's incoherence suggests that it took a backseat to the special effects. Not surprisingly, I suppose, the movie's supposed to be inspiring, too -- idolizing -- while not idealizing -- fireighters in general. But the movie should have made them smarter than shown here if they wanted to impress me.

This is no sugary, \\"Can't we just all get along\\" picture of the ideal \\"brotherhood of man.\\" This is a chronicle of misunderstanding, miscommunication, determination, reconciliation and forgiveness. But finally, the story of Antioch Community and the friendship of Spencer Perkins and Christ Rice is about grace--God's grace working through flawed and struggling Christians who are radical enough to take the Sermon on the Mount as a call to lifestyle and mission.Everybody who is interested in miinistry with the poor, racial reconciliation, Christian community and social justice should read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not terrible for the eighties","review":"It's hard to get past the terrible haircuts and clothes, but once you do, this movie is not bad.

I found that this book was better written than Page's first, but unfortunately I got really bored about halfway through the story. I don't want to spoil the plot for any reader, but let me just say that Gina and Reese are not consistent characters, are each as insecure as the other, and each time you think you got a pretty good idea of who they are, Page throws something in the story that confuses you.

The Cooler is a lot different, it has a smaller star cast, lesser number of characters, lesser aspirations but it still manages to earn respect. The concept of a Cooler is very interesting, you see. I love films based on Casino. The Cooler is unpredictable, uplifting and brief in it's own self congratulating way. William Macy gives a performance you tend to expect of him.

It feels like a low-budget, R-rated episode of CSI; everything is dark and dingy, including the characters. Nobody, including the main character, Bernie, is very likable, and most of them are downright creepy. There's a lot of sadistic violence, and the \\"saved by the bell\\" ending is just dumb.

Worse, a wonderfully ironic ending was right before the writers' eyes and they missed it. When Alec Baldwin's character comes over and begins watching Macy at the craps table, Macy should continue losing, then walk over to Baldwin and say, \\"You don't need me anymore. You have a new cooler. More of a loser than I ever was.\\" And walk off. Baldwin's life is now worse than Macy's and he has taken over the role as the contagious loser."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vegas the Heart of Fabulous Fiction","review":"Their is a type of fiction that has been out of fashion for a while it is called Faboulous. Not in the sense of \\" Good \\" but in the sense of being right on the boarder of being believable. This movie falls into the category. You must go along with the premise of \\"luck\\". But then again is not Vegas based on that one concept? Once you grant that the movie makes worlds of sense. Loser and Winner are just reverse sides of the same coin. Things such as being in the right place at the right time and feeling \\"lucky\\" determine which side the coin will fall facing up. The main character has been living his life with the Loser side up for quite a long time. When the coin is flipped he goes with the change the long shot. I don't think many people will \\"get\\" this movie unless they have spent some time in Vegas and absorb some of the real unreality. The musical score is excellent especially \\"The Bounce\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dirty Vegas","review":"Great movie about main character Bernie (Wiiliam H Macy) who plays the title role as a gambling \\"Jonah\\" employed by Alec Baldwin to circulate his casino, and snuff out any chances of his clientele getting on a winning streak. The plot here is extremely convoluted with a host of well known cameos, and the representation of the seedy Vegas casino life as the backdrop to a romantic yet tense storyline is excellently handled. Without going into too much detail, Bernie inadvertently finds mutual attraction with one of his \\"marks\\" which leads to untold complications, and the coming together of several different sub plots. The end result is eclectic, but thoroughly absorbing for the viewer, and the parallels to other great Casino movies are tactfully handled, without overtaking the script. Some strong sexual content, violence and language ensure an R rated audience, and despite the borders of credibility being stretched a little at the end, this is a very polished piece of filmmaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Equal Parts Scorsese & Capra","review":"... THE COOLER was one pleasant surprise, a script that cleverly juxtaposes the grim, harsh, gritty reality of the fading gambling glory days of darker Las Vegas with the whimsical 'what if' element of a character (Bernie Lutz, played winningly by William H. Macy) hired by the slimy casino manager (Alec Baldwin, playing Alec Baldwin) to pass along his seemingly endless streak of bad luck to hot table players. Throw in the only stereotypical element of the script -- a down-on-her-luck cocktail waitress who originally came to Vegas to make it big as a showgirl now trying to go legit b/c she may've found her one shot @ true love -- and you've got a capitivating character study that's as much about the people who inhabit these roles as it is the times they live in. Wonderful performances, outstanding camera work, and a complementing music score make THE COOLER one hot flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cooler DVD","review":"I received the package on time, professionally wrapped for protection.

But Overall Dissappointing.","review":"I bought this DVD based on reccomendations from friends and some of the strong reviews I read here at Amazon. I thought the premise of the movie was quite clever, and I thought it was well cast. However, I feel the movie was hurt by poor developement of the characters and the story. It seemed like the movie had a hard time getting going. I found myself waiting for something to happen and before I knew it the film was over. There were a number of questionable plot points that I won't get into here. If you're one of those people that always pick up on things in movies, like \\"how did that guy get there?\\", then you will find that there a number of those type of moments in The Cooler.Overall, the movie was based on an interesting idea but that's where it ends. I would reccomend reading the back cover and leaving it at that.

But any early promise is soon whacked into left field by the B-movie scenario, in which the obvious holds firm sway.. We are supposed to believe that an ageing Las Vegas hack (The Cooler) with a very bad and greasy toupe falls into a meaningful relationship with a sexy (heart of gold, natch)hooker at his casino.Of course, true love comes with his first real sexual experience in years; and hack and hooker become someone we pin our hopes on, depite the bad dialogue, and the sub-plot of a lost son belonging to the hack, who gives us a chance to dive more deeply into the swampy mire that is this movie. Worst of all, it has a happy ending! Take my word--this mess is predictable and soupy. Give it a pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vegas, Lady Luck, and some fine acting...","review":"Beautifully photographed in an unvarnished Vegas, William H. Macy plays \\"the cooler\\" in an old-school casino. Employed by the Casino manager (Alec Baldwin), the cooler brings bad luck to a hot table or a gambler on a roll. The bad karma emanating from Macy is visceral. Everything in his life is dead or dying. His contract in Vegas is days from coming to a close and he intends to get out - fast.Then, a seemingly chance encounter with a cocktail waitress (Maria Bello) changes everything. They fall for each other - hard. And the cooler's dance with lady luck begins anew.Plagued by a bunch of serious plot holes, the script is probably the weakest link in the film. Macy, Baldwin and Bello are each outstanding in their respective roles, salvaging - with sheer determination and skill - what could have been a disaster. Because they are so believable... we believe: in the possibilities that love brings... and lady luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a simple good movie","review":"You have read the storyline here written by others. I knew nothing of this movie when I started watching it. It was the stars that even made me watch the unfolding story. What a loser, yes the heart of gold hooker (but it happens) and I like Alex Baldwin as an actor. He was a bit \\"hefty\\" in this roll but maybe the script called for over weight.This isn't the kind of movie I can watch over and over because it is so strong. It is well work watching,tho but not for light even entertainment.(DVD)"},{"rating":"1","title":"not so hot","review":"Ever wondered what might have happened if Martin Scorsese had teamed up with Franka Capra? Wonder no more--the result would have been this simplistic fantasy (a pitiful shlub possesses the magical power to make Vegas casino players lose the minute he shows up at the table) jazzed up with stomach-churning violence and unnecessary nudity (do we really need to see William Macy naked?)Besides an unbelievable set-up (as the old-school casino manager/owner/whatever--it's never made clear exactly why he's calling all the shots--Alec Baldwin portrays a character that's been extinct in Vegas for 30 years), Macy is saddled with yet another variation on his tiresome sad-sack role. Take a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointing movie","review":"OK, I get it. When William H. Macy's character falls in love, he is no longer cursed with bad luck and he loses his ability to \\"cool\\" down hot gamblers. He can even get cream in his coffee.This move is way too obivous and mechanical, and because of it, it's hard to see the characters as real people. I actually had some sympathy for old-school Alec Baldwin until he turned violent. It might have been interesting if he were portrayed sympathetically, trying to stay alive in a bland, profit-oriented world. Alas, no use for nuance in ths flick.And the ending - where he reaches in the car and grabs the beer can - was the most remarkably stupid thing I have seen since Joaquin Phoenix swung his baseball bat in Signs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Not That Good!!!","review":"movie overpowered by sex scenes, that's right, un-necessarily so! if the acting can support itself, then it's just not needed. period. alec baldwins part is well done, and so is macy's, only to a point though, and quickly fizzles...the blond's part can be played by any blonde (anywhere) no real talent required or delivered here...really, don't bother with this one, it's just not that good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not a bad value for the money","review":"I just went to Big Lots and bought the FME4, as advertised for $30.00.

I love the function of the thermal caraf, it keeps the coffee fresh and hot for hours, however, the swinging door above the coffee pot which holds the coffee filter and coffee is an extremely poor design.

She is an avid coffee drinker who always has a pot brewed. This was definitely the wrong choice! The overall quality of the coffemaker is poor at best but the most aggrevating problem is that it is impossible to pour a cup from the glass decanter without half of it dribbling down the side of the pot onto the counter. Pour it fast, pour it slow, the same results. Only had it a month and already shopping for a new coffemaker and it definitely will not be Krups!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Attractive coffee maker; poor coffee","review":"As a lover of hot, full bodied coffee, I was eager to try this machine after an old coffee maker died. The first one purchased had two problems; the spring-loaded door holding the coffee basket would open during the brewing cycle. The first time it happened, I thought that this was a neat feature that occurred at the end of the brewing cycle. Wrong! The second problem was that the little glass tube that indicates the water level leaked. A replacement pot worked fine, but the coffee on the 1-3 cup cycle (brewing 3 cups) was little better than brown water and the coffee and pot, instead of having a typical coffee aroma, smelled and tasted of plastic. Next coffee maker....not Krups!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than the the Black & Decker we had","review":"I bought this coffeemaker on clearance at a local store and am somewhat happy with it considering the price that I paid (dirt cheap). It pours a cup of coffee nicely and doesn't spill all over the place like the last (God awful) coffeemaker we had. I thought that this one was attractive too, but I've had it for less than 6 months and the silver color has flaked off of the buttons and water reservior cover broke off.

When I lifted the carafe to pour a cup, the paint on the heat plate peeled off with the carafe and revealed a disgustingly rusted area. I'm very disappointed. I had a Mr. Coffee before this, and it worked for 10 years! And, it cost a lot less! I switched because I wanted a larger coffee maker, and in my research I found that Krups was supposed to be one of the best brands you could buy. It actually still works...

This is a brand new unit and twice the basket has popped open during brewing.4. The rubber feet pop out. I drag my unit forward to fill it since it sits on the counter with cabinets above it.

I'm getting ready to toss it! First issue: the handle on the carafe fell off when I'd had this for 3 months. Just popped right off (only held together with some cheapie adhesive stickers). Luckily, it was replaced at no charge. Now the water reservoir viewer on the front keeps popping off the connector at the bottom. Whenever I fill the coffee maker with water, water will pour out of the bottom of the reservoir viewer. What a mess!

Yesterday it stopped working. The indicator on the LCD panel is for the water sensor, saying that it is out of water (it is not). Despite all the plugging, unplugging, dumping water out, etc., it's dead. In addition to not lasting long, the controls are difficult to figure out and the beeping noise that it makes is really obnoxious (although you can turn off the beep, the noise indicator resets itself to \\"on\\" everytime you unplug the machine, which I do every day). This coffee machine also does not come with a reusable filter and requires a \\"duo\\" water filter, which is an additional ongoing expense.

Beyond that point, the coffee maker worked fine and the coffee tasted good. Today it suddenly stopped working. I went to get a cup of coffee and it was cold. The unit said it was on, but the burner was cold. I emptied it and tried to run wather through it - lights go on, but it doesn't do anything. The good news - it's still under warranty. The bad news - I have to send it to a service center for repair or replacement. The closest service center to me is about 300 miles away. So obviously, the easy answer is ...

One, it reeks of plastic while it's brewing, and that smell filters into the taste of the coffee as well - and two, for being 1100 watts, the just-brewed coffee is definitely not hot enough. Some other problems: the latch for the swing-out filter housing is oddly placed, the removable filter holder doesn't seem to fit correctly, and the some of the digital \\"features\\" are more of a hindrance. Oh, no gold-tone filter is included, and not even a coffee scoop (standard items they used to include).I don't know who took over the Krups company, but I want the real one back - they used to make great machines.

The pad did nothing for my pain, in fact, my Thermarest pad does a better job. I ended up making my own pad from a yoga matt which works better than anything I've tried. Just cut the yoga matt in strips so that the resulting pads cover all but the sits bones. I made a pile of 4 strips (front, back, and sides) and fit them into a mesh bag (one with a zipper intended for laundering delicate items such as stockings).

The \\"bad\\" is that, in my opinion, it rambles in some places, especially in the last half of the book. Another \\"bad\\" is that the author uses a lot of uncommon words that only someone with an incredible vocabulary would understant. Example: page 127 (picked at random)uses the words: Flummoxed, estivation, tropeiro, mealy, prehensile, transect, naunce, anthocyanins, cotyledoms, transect, bromeliads. Trying to get through that for over 200 pages was a workout for me. The author also uses meters and hectars, not feet and acres, so distances and area are hard to understand. In addition he uses a lot of Portuguese words. There is a Portuguese glossary in the back if you don't mind flipping back and forth while you read, which I don't take the time to do.

Having read Patterson's Struggle of The Magicians, I was moved by the visual representation of the ideas in the book, and it led me to not only re-read the book, but watch the film several times again for what I missed the first time.

From that point on he taught very little and came to the conclusion that he would push the teaching into the future through writing. He spent several years writing his Legomonism All and Everything.After the completion of his writing he began an all women's group known as The Rope. The war and the Nazi occupation of Paris ended that group but soon weekly meetings were held at great personal risk.With the war having ended and the death of Ouspensky many students returned to Paris. The last two years of Gurdjieff's life laid foundation for dissemination of The Fourth Way teaching in the west.This video is recommended to those interested in the significance of what Gurdjieff brought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with the product!","review":"I did not know anything about chutney until I went on a known recipe cite and found out that they mix the fruit with peppers and vinegar!

It is sad. I tried to get the game to run and all it did was make my system crash. Unless you plan on using Windows XP, don't buy this game for any modern computer.

During re-install attempts Win7 denies installtion of digitally-UNsigned StarForce \\"virtual drivers\\" for both games. StarForce is for digital rights management (DRM) game copy protection. The result is neither gane will run under Windows 7 - a BIG disappointment for me.Another older racing game, World Racing 2 (WR2), also used StarForce DRM- but Synetics, the German game developer, released a WR2 patch that eliminates use of StarForce.

And, I'm terribly disappointed. The graphics have been improved over TOCA PRD 2---You can finally use anti-aliasing without any problems. The physics seem to be decent---they feel less arcarde-like than PRD 2. But, the driver AI is absolutely dire. It is impossible race a clean line...the AI will knock you off the road without a second thought. In fact, if the AI was better, I'd give this game a much higher rating.Also, this game has limited support for the Logitech G25 racing wheel. It does support the clutch, but there is no support for the 6-speed shifter. I haven't seen a patch that adds support, either. If Codemasters patched in G25 support and fixed the driver AI, this could be a fun little game. Instead, it's just sitting on the shelf collecting dust.If you like racing games, pass on this one. If you're a hardcore TOCA fan, you are not missing anything by not purchasing this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't work with Logitech Wheel","review":"I'm wondering what people are using and what settings, because nothing seems to get this game to simulate any normal car movements or steering. Both games by codemaster has no value on my computer with my wheel even though my system is much higher then the stated requirements. I don't have the force feedback on, because I know that can make steering and handling wacky, yet no matter what setting it will not work properly.You'd be taking a risk buying this game not knowing if it will work or not and many write ups stated they also couldn't get a normal steering or handling out of this game making it worthless to them as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul Reaver 2 has gone gold","review":"Eidos just announced in my e-mail that Soul Reaver 2 has GONE GOLD..

You have to go into this game knowing that its short, for this reason DO NOT BUY IT RENT IT!! It took me 2 days, maybe a total of about 8 - 10 hours to finish this game. The final reason i say rent this and dont buy it is because the ending is absolutely the biggest let down I have yet experienced in a game i was really into. Remember soul reaver 1, the ending was good, it wrapped up mysteries and left a bigger mystery open but at least soul reaver 1's story was pretty much wrapped up. Soul Reaver 2, Everything is left wide open, NONE of the story is wrapped up and the ending, well, lets just say, theres some text at the end, and thats it. HUGE DISAPOINTMENT. Be warned.

What a dissapointment. The graphics are good, and the voice acting remains the best in the business, but the actual game play is repetitive and linear. You basically engage in the same fight over, and over, and over again, to go from cutscene to cutscene (not that the cutscenes aren't great). There are no true boss fights, nothing to discover, and the puzzles, while more varied than SR1, are still pretty basic. I would make this a weekend rental, b/c you won't need more than that to finish it. The DVD extras are fun, but unless you are a complete Legacy of Kain fanatic, this game will dissappoint you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story but way to short","review":"It picks up right where the first game leaves off.

This was obviously just a vehicle to get to Soul Reaver 3. I spent the entire game waiting for a challenge that never came.

IMO, \\"Change of Heart\\", \\"Iko Iko\\", and \\"The Faraway Nearby\\" are the greates tracks on this album (although all of them are distinctly different). \\"True Colors\\" is a real classic; it's one of the greatest albums I've ever heard. It's not a mess of different styles, though. \\"True Colors\\" is a very solid album. All songs are logicall integrated into one unforgettable performance.

The only other song that's worth owning here is her cover of \\"What's Going On?\\" Even Iko Iko is pretty weak. Cyndi does have a pretty impressive array of guest musicians helping out here...The Bangles, Nile Rodgers, Billy Joel, Ellie Greenwich, Rick Derringer, Aimee Mann and guitar god Adrian Belew plays the lead guitar on \\"What's Going On?\\" She even has the immortal Pee Wee Herman playing the Operator on the song \\"911\\"!

Daniel has so very thinly paraphrased Cunningham's own words (example: \\"always stir clockwise\\" becomes rewritten as \\"stir clockwise always\\") that I am amazed this was published by such a reputable firm as Weiser. The worst part of this collection of \\"secrets\\" is that Daniel has listed identitcal recipes from other authors but CHANGED THE INGREDIENT AMOUNTS as well as left out important information about safe handling of the ingredients.

As previous reviewers have stated this book is pretty much nothing but plagiarism. 400 recipes, several of which Iam looking at right now in Cunningham's Incense, Oils & Brews, the only difference between many of the recipes is the proportions and the difference is 1 drop for each component oil.

This isn't a book to teach programming, so you'll have to go elsewhere for that, but if you already have a basic understanding of your favorite programming language, and know how to draw graphics to the screen, this book will provide many, many ideas, for that critical point when you stop and wonder, \\"what can I do next?\\" Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat sensationalist and laden with innuendo.

Inside he finds an old dinosaur egg. He was disappointed until it hatches, and then he has to keep his new pet Pteronodon / Pterodactyl away from his parent and the noisy neighbor.

In any case, if there were ever power in words, then surely they reside within these pages.One passage that compelled me to buy the book for reference was...\\"One should never fall down in the belief that you will find someone to pick you up. only those defenses are good, are certain, are enduring, that depend on you yourself and your ability.\\" Certainly something to be said for self-reliance.

There are so many glaring mistakes in the first two chapters I dont even have the patience to hammer through it. While New Riders books have been satsifying in the past, this one is a failure and I wish to express my extreme dissatisfaction to the authors and New Riders for not even bothering to issue an errata list to help people out who are having problems following the examples.This is not a cheap book, and the extreme technicality of the subject requires accuracy in writing and proofing. I am sure that nobody in the proofing team ever tried these exercises since as written they are impossible to execute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so professional","review":"This book is detailed. It will talk you through a lot of the different techniques you can use to animate, but it's examples are terrible. I am not a professional animator, but even I could do better example material than this. The animation of a slug/worm type thing is terrible, both in terms of it's main movement and its secondary motion. The walk cycles are abysmal with no obvious signs of reference material being used. The Lion animation is laughable. The environment animations look extremely amateur. This book is NOT for professional animators. At best it is a fair resource for finding different techniques to animate. Why they'd release this book for any reason other than to make money is beyond me. It certainly doesn't show MAX up as being a good animation tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Errors here, errors there, error EVERYWHERE!","review":"After reading positive reviews of this book from Amazon.com, I bought it with high hopes...

If you remember your guy friends in the 80s who wore too much fragrance and liked it, then this is the fragrance for you. As for me, I gave it away after smelling it for only a day.

I was THAT SURE that that's what he had done, though, because this stuff smells that much like bug killer. When he came home a little later, though, I smelled it on him and wanted to vomit. He said he had to use it 'cause it's all he has around right now and can't afford anything else; that's another tip that this stuff is cheap and crappy.

If it were a 75%-25% Bush (or Kerry) Victory, I might see the reason for this book to exist. There isn't need to apologize for a lost election, but there is a need to do something if you feel compelled to apologize for it. Every one of those people in that book possess an ability to be able to change the country if they don't see it to be fit and for all intensive purposes, I hope they find that ability to do so.Nothing else can be really said about the book.

That's what I thought I was buying.Instead, I bought a collection of photos which seems to be a self-righteous and elitist circle-jerk.

However, with 574 pages of text, it has the disadvantage of being too much oversized. Also, for those who are interested in specific applications of semigroups, like partial differential equations (parabolic PDEs, stability, properties of solutions etc) this book might appear too vague. So, if you are going to create something new in those areas, your tool will be certainly Pazy's Semigroups, which is shorter, more comprehensive and more applications oriented, without compromising the theory part of the subject.

Not much steam and not so easy to stand over and breathe because of the small amount of steam.

The product itself seems well enough constructed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pot of boiling water and a towel: cheaper and more effective","review":"I get frequent sinus infections and steam treatments are the only thing that truly keep them at bay. I was hoping for a cleaner/tidier alternative to the pot and towel over the head method, but the steam this machine produces is not nearly hot enough to be effective. Furthermore the face shield didn't really fit my face at all. If you're just looking for a nice steam facial I'm certain this would be fine, but for a true sinus cleanse this just won't work for me.

Inhaling steam is so good for you, if you have allergies or are battling phlegm or a cold...this will help you so much.

I am not sure if this particular piece was defective, or whether this is how the item is actually designed. If this is how its actually designed, I guess its time for a design revamp.When I buy a STEAM INHALER, i expect to have a good steady stream of steam to inhale - not just the occasional dainty puff. Totally uneffective for me. I use steam inhalers to clear my breathing, and if you are like me, and prefer a strong level of steam, this item is not for you. I can see that there might be people who prefer a very small amount of steam, and perhaps, its designed for such people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vicks Steam Inhaler - do not buy it","review":"It barely produces any steam.

O aparelho é só para produzir vapor."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I purchased the inhaler based on the good reviews. The first time I tried it I got badly burned, when my 5 year old walked into the power cord. This means I cannot use it when my kids are around.The second time I made sure they were in bed before I tried it. After 5 minutes I put a pan of water on the stove, boiled it, and used that with a towel to inhale the steam. The experience with the pan was 200% better than with the Vicks. With the Vicks only my nose and mouth get warm versus my whole face and forehead with the pan (sinuses are located in your forehead!).Breathing in through your mouth with the Vicks (when your nose is congested) will get you much cold air from the side openings.My lips, being closer to the steam opening, felt hotter than my nose, whereas with the pan I got a much more evenly spread of the heat.I returned the Vicks and will be returning to using an old fashioned pan again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great ornament","review":"We ordered two Vicks Steam Inhalers and they arrived quickly and in good condition. Unfortunately we live in Australia (240 volt) and they came with an American plug (not a big problem) and American voltage - 120 volt (major problem).

It performs as advertised, however the unit's base began to crack and fall apart after about a week and a half. I salvaged the cord, heater pot and switch and fabricated a new case. Also, I have been putting three drops of cinnamon, thyme, and clove essential oils each in the water with excellent results. This wiped out my chronic sinusitis in just three days. This result came after three months involving four rounds of antibiotics and four steroid tapers. I know that Vick's cautions against this, but I think that they just want to sell their expensive vapor pads. It is interesting to note that the substance on the vapor pads is thyme extract. I got my essential oils from Ananda Apothecary online. Please note that you should close your eyes when inhaling oil infused steam, and rinse your face with cold water when you are done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for sinus infections, congestion, colds","review":"Using this inhaler when suffering from sinus infections, colds and simple congestion can hasten recovery and will make you feel better right away.

It was on last night for at least an hour continuously (I just kept refilling the water because I really need a room humidifier) and no leaks, nothing burning through, no issues.

I am so happy I purchased it because it iseasy to use, It works because it goes directly to the face and clears the congestion, no medicine neededand I used it for several days. I also followed another reviewers advise and used distilled water.Product does not tip over and it is easy to wipe off steam that accumulates. I put it on the side for anotheruse the same day.

This is yet one more mini vapor device that is not worth the money. Summary of issues:- Does not put out that much steam- The rubber facial unit does not stay put- Not easy to move around- Easily leaks out water- Potentially dangerous due to leaks and poor quality of plastic parts.This is the second vicks vaporizer product I have bought and I will no longer buy their products. You would be far better off buying a good quality facial steamer where the water is completely contained, much easier to move around and where you can safely direct the steam where you need it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great!","review":"I found that there wasn't enough steam produced to be effective! I have bad sinus allergies and my doctor recommended I inhale steam either in a steam room or through a device to help cleanse my sinus cavities.When I saw this on Amazon I thought it would be perfect; small, light weight and I could really isolate the steam to my nasal area.Well it doesn't produce enough steam for anything!! I don't know how any of the people who have reviewed the product were able to loosen congestion.

Inhaling the steam really helps break up congestion and provide relief. It's not going to completely clear your head, but it certainly helps. I keep one at home and one at work.

All it does is heats up water. For 30 bucks I was expecting something like an aroma therapy machine with loads of included materials. Nope, it comes with 1 scented ring and you can't load it with any kind of oil. My advice is just go heat a pot of water and stick your head over it.

From the plastic casing to the super light weight of the camera was the first thing. Just the controls and the feel of the camera make you think of a toy! Not having an optical zoom is another setback. When you use the digital zoom through the LCD the image gets almost unrecognizable. It pales in comparison to the Olympus D-460 as far as features, construction (the 460 is rock solid!) and LCD quality.

I have transferred pictures connecting the camera directly to the computer, however, the transfer software only seems to work 50% of the time. Based on my experience with the DX3500, I would recommend that shoppers pass on the DX3500 and continue to shop around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible print image quality","review":"If you just want a camera to email pics, this is a fine camera. I purchased it, however, to take pictures of my newborn son and email them to family so that they could print them out and frame. I have been unable to get ANY acceptable printed images from this camera. I've tried all sorts of lighting, indoors, outdoors, and even running the pictures through Photoshop filters. I could not even print out a 3\\" x 5\\" picture that was not grainy. DO NOT purchase this camera if you want to be able to print your images. a TOTAL waste of money.

The only difference for me is that DX3500 does NOT accept regular alkaline-AA batteries while HP318 does. therefore, DX3500 will cost you extra money...All up to your habit. If you take lots of pics weekly you may prefer DX3500 w/ dock. Or if you use it only twice per year(vacation) like myself, HP318 w/ regular AA's may be smart. I'd like to give 4 stars to DX3500, 4.1 stars to HP318."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excited with my first digital camera","review":"I love my new digital camera. I used it at a friend's wedding and got very beautiful and clear pictures. The only reason I am not giving it five (5) stars is because the digital zoom is not good at all. The pictures that I tried doing a 'zoom' on were very fuzzy; so, if you want to eliminate this, then I would suggest the DX3600. It comes with stronger digital, plus it also has optical zoom. Other than this, I am truly enjoying my camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"very average camera","review":"I bought this camera 3 years back and its a plain simple point and shoot camera with a fixed lens and you cant adjust anything. It has no optical zoom, no video recording, etc. but thats what you pay for. Picture wise the camera shoots beautifully and the colours come out really nice and natural. Its flash is pretty bad with flash shots coming out dark. I have taken decent 6x4 prints even with the lower resolution. The power on/off switch is really horrible and flimsy. It broke after few months of use and I had to get it repaired. After that my computer never recognises the camera and I have to use a card reader to transfer photos.I wouldnt recommend this camera even to a first timer even though its very very simple to use. Its just too flimsy and featureless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Satisfied","review":"At the moment i am very tired, having spent 6 hours trying to update the software to the new Easy share. I have had nothing but trouble since updating to Easy share. I owned a Dx3500 and then a DX3600, which I was satisfied with until I upgraded the PC to Windows XP. Now I have the latest Kodak LS753, and the software CD included will not install and even when i down load from the net I get a message saying that there is an error. I have checked for virus, turned off all programs etc. and still no luck. I have never had such problems and I will be certainly returning to the shop with the camera and exchanging it, and I will be letting everyone know the problems. I feel so angry that I have wasted so much time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera/Poor software","review":"This camera is the greatest!! Very fast transfer of photos from camera to computer. Longer battery life than other digital cameras. Very simple to operate. Very good quality of photos. User friendly. The software to download from camera to computer is fast and simple. The Kodak Photo software that comes with it is terrible. No option to delete photos you don't want without going to hard drive, finding file and deleting. Don't understand why there is not a delete option in the software. I use a different program for editing photos. Also, no option to easily reduce pixels or size in their software."},{"rating":"1","title":"I outgrew this camera very quickly","review":"Don't be fooled by this camers 2.2 Megapixels. It may be able to shoot at high resolution, but it applies to much compression to the images it shoots to make them fit onto the card. The result is that the images apear grainy when fully zoomed in. Also, the digital zoom only enhances this graininess. It looks like someones merely cropped the image and then enlarged it to full size (blurry and low quality). This camera also is terrible for film exposure (I know it doesn't have film, but still). My pictures are always come out to dark or too light and I have to use photoshop (Making copies of layers and setting them to screen or multiply) to set the values right. The only plus about this camera is that it has a good OS, and has the novelty of being able to hook up to a TV. I would reccomend stepping up to Nikon Coolpics 775 (about 80 bucks more) because there is a huge chance you will outgrow this camera like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy Kodak","review":"I no longer buy Kodak products. The buttons on the camera are poorly made and will frustrate you when you least expect it. I have my camera for a while and it is out of the 1 year warranty.

So I am telling you guys not to buy Kodak cameras or their products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad quality/prize ratio","review":"The first impression i've got with this camera is weakness. Seems that if camera falls to the floor (more usual than you 're thinking),it'll be destroyed in million pieces. Plastics are bad and termination isn't good.Another big drawback is that it hans't any kind of optical zoom or in defect intechangeable lenses. The digital zoom is the least chance because you'll loose resolution and quality. A wide angle lens could be a good optional item.The photos aren't awesome, too dark and automatic modes are terrible ... Zoom is underpowered.I've got an SLR and the results and i dind't find any digital with their performance ( my SLR is a Yashica FX-3 , full manual). The best digital camera i've seen is the new nikon 5000 but for that prize i could manage a Contax Aria with Zeiss lenses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good package.","review":"I usually like Kodak's digitals, but this one has a strange mix of features that should render it unacceptable to both amateurs and to advanced users. To wit, the image quality is very good, boasting 2.1 megapixels of resolution, enough to handle not only web-based photography, but enlargements of up to 8\\" x 10\\" as well. However, this is completely offset by a fixed-focus lens and no optical zoom (it has a digital zoom, but these are not nearly as useful). The rest of the features are acceptable, including memory & expandability, flash, battery useage & USB connectivity. Kodak is selling an optional 'docking station' for this camera that allows for 'easier' downloading of images to your PC, but any memory card reader (Viking, or SanDisk) is simpler, cheaper and more versatile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whak","review":"This cd sucks.

It annoys you with all of its sentences. If only the authors didn't use the word \\"respectively\\"... The book repeats itself, goes in deep details with the simplest tasks any computer science student should know, and passes the more advanced ones without proper explanations. It leaves you with the impression that the authors do not fully understand what they are speaking about. In some parts, it is as unscientific as a scientific textbook can be. For example, in explaining white balance procedure of a ccd camera the book tells you to turn the camera towards a white object and press the white balance button.Despite these failures the authors are fairly successful in giving a comprehensive picture of what 3D shape recovery requires and how it can be implemented, hence the second star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Photometric Stereo Coverage","review":"If you are trying to find a good book on Photometric Stereo, look elsewhere. This book is out-of-date on the subject and over-priced. Techniques for finding light source directions from multiple photographs are not covered such are shiney spheres or Singular Value Decomposition. Also, surface reconstruction coverage is lacking. The only technique presented in enough detail to use is the Frankot-Chellappa algorithm when there are others that produce better results. The Frankot-Chellappa algorithm presented on page 113 is either missing something or stated in error. It simply does not work, the resulting image is highly distorted with low-frequency artifacts. Papers written on this subject can be found on the internet at no cost that contain current techniques where the book does not. Summary, if you want to implement photometric stereo algorithms this book will not help you."},{"rating":"2","title":"My jury is out on this complex opus","review":"Reading \\"The Ambassadors,\\" I was awed by the subtletly of emotion and social gesture James was able to describe. Clearly here was a crafted that had been years in the honing, and I appreciate the book's liberation from the plot-heavy mechanics of earlier books like \\"The Portrait of a Lady\\" and \\"The American.\\" Everything is only subtly insinuated; whole lives can hinge upon half-meant gestures or long-buried social prejudices. In this way, the book has some of the wistful tone of \\"The Age of Innocence,\\" but more depth if less elegant prose.The prose is the thing -- James was dictating by this time (how on Earth does one dictate a novel?), and it shows. His chewy ruminations and meandering, endlessly parenthetical sentences are hard to digest. I think James went too far in his late style, and \\"The Ambassadors\\" might have benefited from a sterner editor. Still, this is an important book, absolutely worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE!","review":"Do not, under any circumstances, buy this edition of The Ambassadors. It's impossible to read and impossible to judge what the real book is like because the formatting - paragraphs, in particular - is completely messed up, making dialogue, in particular, virtually incomprehensible (I discovered this because I was having such a difficult time following the writing - and I adore Henry James - that I compared the Kindle edition to a \\"legitimate\\" edition). No wonder all the other reviews refer to the \\"complexity\\" of the prose, etc. This edition is an absolute rip-off and an insult to the author, one of the great masters of the English language. Amazon should be ashamed of itself, and this edition should be taken off the market immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"a magnificent achievement","review":"This it the novel where James discovered a new authorial voice, a new way to write and present his characters. It must have been a wonderful moment when he realized he had taken matters to a new level. The insights pour from the page, the wonderful \\"tone\\" of the sentences flows like a golden river. A restorative read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect Sleeping Elixer","review":"Whenever I cannot get to sleep I simply reach for this book and, voila, within a few sentences I am drifting off. James wrote dialog that no one in the world has ever uttered. When the topic is obvious and simple, his characters question one another intensely trying to determine what it is they are talking about. When the topic is strange and hidden, amazingly they all understand each other perfectly and silently. If you are into extremely cerebral, S L O W M O V I N G, non-plot, non-action novels, this is for you. Unfortunately I prefer characters who speak as normal folks do, who motivate in their lives, who don't think themselves to death and who are real. I am truly sorry that HJ considered this his finest work. I much prefer his earlier, more accessible and likeable works such as Daisy Miller."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAH, HUMBUG","review":"I KNOW CRAP WHEN I SEE IT OR IN THIS CASE READ IT!

They never get tired of it.But to me, much of his music is same old same old. It's like I have been listening to the same rumbling phrases all night and they just go on and on, never changing or getting anywhere. For me Steve Reich does a much better job of this repetitive stuff.I recently saw him in concert in San Francisco, the audience loved him.

My unit is quiet enough to sleep with it on. However, as other people have said, there's a hole in the bottom of the unit. That might not be so bad except that the unit has to be carried to the bathroom every day for cleaning, if one follows the instructions. It leaks as one carries it if one doesn't hold it absolutely level. I had planned to use it in my office during the day, but the leaking problem means I need to get a separate humidifier for my office.Also, if one were to follow the cleaning instructions provided, taking care of this unit would take a couple of hours a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chews through filters quickly","review":"I quickly discovered that this thing chews through its filters. We keep this running 24 hours a day in my son's nursery, so that it's ready to go when he goes down for naps and for bedtime. It has a large tank, so I only refill it once a day, but keeping it running that long means the filters only last about 2-3 weeks. We used the Kaz WF2 Extended Life Replacement Humidifier Filter, which are a little on the expensive side, so we decided to find a different humidifer that didn't have such high maintenance costs.Other than the speed at which it went through filters, it was a good humidifier. Maybe if you only run it at night the filters would last longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filter needs to be changed too often","review":"I have had this unit for about a week and I already need to change the filter. Also, the low setting is just like not having it turned on at all...I wake up with a headache and dry throat like usual. But it's too noisy to sleep with it on the high setting.

It only works in fairly small rooms, but it does well in my fairly average-sized bedrooms. I have had other, better humidifiers, but they have been much more costly. My two biggest concerns are that the replacement filters are a bit pricey and that the water tank can be difficult to open. The sound of the fan is a pleasant white noise, and there is no problem with dripping or spitting like I have seen in other models. Overall, I would recommend this humidifier, especially for the budget-conscious buyer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not last","review":"I bought this unit for my Mom's bedroom.

They don't last long and are around $10 each and I go through maybe 2 or 3 each winter. If all the water isn't used at night and sits in the tray during the day, it starts to disintegrate the filter. Also, the new filters have a chemical odor the first few days you use it. The humidifier sounds like a fan, which is fine for me, but if you want a noiseless machine, this isn't it. It worked OK as a humidifier.Finally it broke one night and started violently shooting out water through the vent. I would never buy one of these again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three of these leaked in a row","review":"I've never written a review before, and I've been buying almost exclusively from Amazon.com for years, but I had to warn others that this product may be the worst I've ever seen.

Followed the instructions to set it up (which I'll be honest, is rare for me, but I wanted to be sure I was doing it right) and get it running. The air coming out seemed to be just that, air, with no extra moister. I left it on high all night, which was noisy as all get out, and the water level barely moved while the room was still desert dry. There is no mist. There is no humidity. There is no longer a Vick's humidifier in my room. I'll be looking at a Crane humidifier with better reviews and I recommend against this one, even though it's cheap, pay the $10 more and get something that 1,200 people all say worked well for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"The humidifier runs so quietly, I don't even know it's on.

It needs to be cleaned regularly because of the risk that standing water can be a source of bacteria/ mold/ problems.

So if you are looking for one, I would recommend getting one that is designed to be very easy to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"works fine, but mold build-up in warm homes","review":"I liked the idea of invisible mist, and the humidifier worked just fine. However, since I live in an apartment building where I have no control over the heating of my apartment, and my apartment is quite warm, I found that with 7-10 days of use I would get mold build-up on the wicking filter. I could see the mold on the filter, and smelled mold when I operated the humidifier. After going through about three filters in the course of a month, and since those filters are quite expensive (about $8 each), I decided to just get a regular ultrasonic humidifier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was it supposed to be a humidifier?","review":"I am greatly disappointed. I purchased this humidifier a few months ago, and back I am shopping for another one as this one is going into the yard sale pile.

Also, I have probably purchased three or four filters for it already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaked Everywhere","review":"I bought this from a store in May for my young daughter who had an awful cold. I mistakenly left it on her bedroom floor with water for a week, and even though it was turned off it managed to leak all over her carpet and left a big mildew spot. When I moved it tonight to use it again I discovered the mildew stain. I turned the unit on and it began to leak again. When I tried to turn it off to find the leak, the switch broke off in my hand and the unit would not shut off. Since it was sitting in a pool of water I had to unplug the unit and throw it out. Having only used it a grand total of 3 weeks I am disgusted by the poor quality of this item. I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Functions well but loud!","review":"The motor runs too loud to put in living room or bedroom.

I am so angry that we as consumers are expected to put up with shoddy quality I am now boycotting any Vicks product and of course am telling all my friends. The filter you have to buy for this humidifier disintegrates very quickly and at over 10.00 a shot, in one season of 3+ months you can easily spend what you paid for the humidifier itself.The company has to know better unless they have no quality control at all and ignorant designers.

I never moved the unit, followed the directions and it all seemed to be functioning normally... I refilled it once a day for a couple days and noticed that wet spots were popping up nearby the unit and later realised that it was constanty leaking water through the drain plug. So I put it in a plastic tub to catch the water and saw that about 2/3 of the water I had put in the tank was just running back out of the unit and down into the carpet padding. My guess is the plunger on the drain cap was defective, but regardless it is a huge and messy disappointment! After throwing it away, (I lost the receipt), and cleaning the carpet extensively I would reccomend getting a different humidifier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works fine, but went bad after 3 years","review":"We used this humidifier for about three years during Winter months on a nightly basis. It worked well, although the high setting was too loud, so we were never able to get full use out of it. This year when we took it out, it no longer works.

Product Development please note: If you can figure out a way to enclose the lower tray you can avoid this.We have it by the bedside table and with two toddlers I need to get this this thing out of their way every morning. I am getting great practice for a circus balancing act. Trick is to move the upper (water container) unit first. Next, the lower tray ( which fills almost to the brim) - again, fine balancing skills required. And then the base.Overall, I will keep it. I did some research and it looks like all humidifiers have some or other glitch. I guess its the nature of the product itself. This one does the job, its inexpensive so I'm okay with it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud and Leaky","review":"Wow, I hope the engineer(s) who designed this pile of crap got fired.It is actually designed to leak. There is a shallow tray inside that holds the water, and any overflow comes out the two holes on the bottom. The tray is filled to the rim by the tank, so literally any movement will spill water.I've seen plenty of humidifiers, hot and cold, that can hold water and only leak when knocked over or bumped hard, but this thing leaks when you slide it a inch.On top of that, the sound is like sitting on the wing seat of a 737 (something I did very recently). We didn't bother seeing how functional it was at raising the humidity because there isn't any way we'd be willing to use it with all the noise and water leaking everywhere. There is no way we'd be able to sleep with the noise and I worry about the furniture it sits on getting damaged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy","review":"I read all the reviews before I bought this from Target and took them all into consideration hoping that I could prevent the problems listed. I cleaned weekly to prevent mold, I put a towel underneath to prevent water leakage, etc...It worked well for one month then I refilled it one morning and when I went to check it an hour later all the water was on the floor and it smelled strongly like something was burning. I cleaned it up and refilled it, then it was making a horribly loud noise. I emailed the company per it's instructions and after emailing them three times they have not replied.It's trash. Spend more money and get a quality humidifier. I recommend Air Swiss which is considerably more expensive but I have owned for over 7 years and still works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"humidifier","review":"This product is very loud so if you want to sleep with it on forget it.

My husband loves that is cools off the room making it more comfortable for him as well. I was able to breathe better in a few nights. Cleaning it out every morning is annoying, but it's necessary, otherwise you'll wear out your filters faster; they can be expensive. I must say that the highest setting is a little loud. Some nights I was able to sleep through it, but I've had to turn it down most times. However, I do feel you get your money's worth using the highest setting. If it gets too cold or too loud, just turn it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great.","review":"This machine is very quiet even on high setting.

It seemed fine until the tank got low of water, then it again dumped the rest of the water on the floor. Not a good thing for my wood floors.I would stay away from this humidifier."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"This humidifier is very poorly designed. Not only does it leak badly if you move it at all, sometimes if you don't insert the refill tank correctly, the water will leak out of the tray and through a hole in the bottom of the device. Yes, the manufacturers have put a hole in the bottom of their humidifier!Also, as has been noted elsewhere, you have to change the filter quiet often or it gets mildewed which produces a rotten smell every time you use the humidifier. Your carpet also smells rotten from the leaking.This product is not worth the hassle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DIdn't get very humid","review":"Used this for 2 days and it didn't seem to \\"humidify\\" my kids room at all. I returned it and got a vaporizer that we used for a few years. That worked OK, but just recently started to piddle out on us. I recently burned myself on it trying lift out the heating element when it was still on thinking it was unplugged b/c it was not putting out any steam. It was in my 13 month old's room so that could have been dangerous. We just got the Warm Mist with Auto Shut off. That one is AMAZING! Best thing I've used so far. I definitely recommend the Warm Mist over this model or the Vaporizer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works, but our floor is ruined","review":"This works well if you keep it in one place and don't move it.

Well this things has leaked ever since we bought it. The design is shockingly flawed. I think a 8 your old could see this thing point out its flaws. It you touch it, fill it, move it, do anything with this humidifier water will come out the sides and everywhere it can. Today I needed to move it and it leaked from the screw holes in the bottom. This thing was treated with care, I read the instruction a few times (due to disbelief that anyone would put such a thing on the market) and still it just leaks everywhere. Do not buy this humidifier, you will regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst purchase ever","review":"This thing leaks all over the place. It's the worst product I've ever purchased. The water tank is on top, and doesn't seal well when you place it on the base, so water inevitably leaks out the sides. Whoever designed this is a moron.

On the higher level, it is a bit loud, but not as loud as some others have made it out to be. When it's on high, I can't hear it through the wall of my apartment if I'm in the next room with the door closed.

If I put the gauge right by the blower of the unit, it will read cooler and about 50% humidity, so I know it's putting out something and my guage seems to work, but my room, which is 10ft x 12 ft x 8 ft(ceiling) is not getting very humid at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Newer model is unsafe--leaked horribly","review":"Do not buy another one of these if you have an old one that works!

I ran this all night in the high position, and the water level barely moved (meaning not much moisture was emitted into the air). Also, it is exceedingly loud in the high position, and even more ineffective in the low position. The wick filter is a hassle to install (they should have a disposable cartridge type of filter...

If you've got plenty of free time, it might be worth your while.After our last round of cleaning (not daily; more like weekly) we reassembled the machine and turned it on. It ran until we turned it off to check that the reservoir cap was on tightly. After reassembling it , the unit stopped working.

Then I read further and thought it may be an evaporative humidifier (although it didn't say so on the box or anywhere else but the pamphlet). But apprently that means there is no mist that you can see visibly but the water goes through the filter and emits moist air and the only way you know it is working is when the water level goes down and the room feels moister. Well I had it on all day and the water level went down like an 18th of an inch if that and the noise on the lowest setting was so loud we had to shut it off at night when we needed it most. Didn't notice any difference in the moisture level in my kids room even after running all day.

I have it on right now and it sounds like someone is using a blow dryer! I'll keep it because it was cheap and so what if we throw it away at the end of the season. Easier than returning it.

There must be some sort of a design flaw that if it's not seated properly, which I was very aware of this time, but I still woke up to this model leaking everywhere.

In other words, if your attic is totally flat and the light is be able to reach everywhere, you are all set.

The first song \\"Is It A Crime\\" burns like a hot knife through the heart. And the song's climax is the real clincher. And every composition is strong; not one throw-away like other groups' CDs. Musicianship may be more defined in her later albums, but for the total package of lyrics and melody, my money is on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweetest Taboo............","review":"This was the second album release by the group Sade, and it followed along with the first, as a great recording.

For me and my wife, it gives me a great close shave. I've never had a problem with skin irritation. Just how hard are these other guys pressing the razor on their face?! I can't imagine. I only need the lightest pressure to get a good shave. The shave is fast, about 2 mins. The dual blade design (each of the three heads has two rows of blades!) is awesome, makes the shave clean and fast. I'll probably stick with Remington rotories from now on, but will upgrade to a corded/cordless.My problems with it are:Can't use with cord if the battery dies (didn't know this when I bought it)The gears in the head strip/slip easily if a long beard/mustache hair gets in, which requires turning it off and back on again.Otherwise, it's a great solid razor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very short life","review":"Well the shaver itself was great. It gave me a clean shave and left my skin virtually uniritated.The main problem was that it died a year and half after I bought it! the battery would charge and work but the motor was working so slow that it was impossible to shave with.So since the 1 year warranty is over, and I had no box or reciept I had to throw the damn thing out :(So overall its a great shaver for your money but it may die..."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a Norelco","review":"Well, I must agree with those who said that this shaver is mediocre. I bought the refurbished one at $20 and it is worth that, but not a penny more. It does not give a close shave without going over your face several times. My Norelco worked this well when the blades were 8 years old!I admit, I usually had to shave twice with the Norelco, but the Remington is not nearly that good. To get a decent shave, I have to press pretty hard and go over each area several times. I end up with a bit of redness from the pressing that I have to do to get the shaver to work reasonably well.If you're buying a shaver for $40, save your money and find a Norelco that's on sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay if you only need it for about a year!","review":"After about owning it for about a year the battery needed to be charged practically every night.

I am well satisfied with the new Model 845 tho' I have not use it much; it does use the same shaving rotors and head as the 890. The only drawback I can find is it cannot operate directly off the power/recharging cord; it can only be recharged and will run only off the battery. The 890 can be used in either mode. But then, the 845 comes at a more economical price than the 890. Overall I find the Remington a good shaver and have no inclination to try or switch to any other make."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this shaver!!","review":"I bought this shaver over 10 years ago and the only thing I have done to it is replace the blades once. I retired it a couple years ago and put it in my travel bag. Since then I have purchased two other shavers, both expensive and both have been junk. I am currently trying to find another 845, but they are obviously out of production. I have never had an issue with razor burns, nor have I had the battery issues that others have had. I have had the battery go dead, but that is after months of sitting. I just charge it up and it is good to go again. I originally purchased this for something like $10 at a discount hardware store.

No Christmas is complete without this song!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Last Christmas!","review":"Every year around Christmastime, the Wham song, \\"Last Christmas,\\" has survived and thrived. Okay, Wham! was a mediocre duo with George Michael who used it as a launching pad for his own musical career. Duos like Wham! were quite common back in the day. I liked the tape at first and was thrilled later to get the compact disc version.Remember, most tapes and albums or records back in the 1980s had about 10 songs or 12 at the most. Unlike today where compact discs can have up to twenty songs, this album is memorable for the soft ballads and love songs. You don't have to be a Wham! or George Michael fan to enjoy it. The compact disc takes me back to another time where the music was softer and the worries were lighter in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wham!'s swan song","review":"\\"Music from the Edge of Heaven\\" was Wham!'s farewell disc, a fine blend of sunny pop and blue-eyed soul. Although the songs on this disc have aged well over time, only 3 of the 8 songs here are new. The others are previously released singles (\\"I'm Your Man,\\" \\"A Different Corner,\\" and \\"Last Christmas\\") or note-for-note remakes (\\"Wham Rap 86\\"). Other than that, this disc is a welcome 1980's flashback from one of the finest duos of its era."},{"rating":"2","title":"congradulations to the author!","review":"I admit, I'm not particularly religious, nor do I think I have many significant elephants in my life (certainly nothing that rises to the level of what the author went through), but despite all this, Ms. Renner's book was a fast and fascinating read. The book is searingly honest, which makes it not only a hopeful guide for others who seek healing through faith, self-awareness and sheer will, but for people like me, it is an open, honest and insightful portrait of someone who has survived an trauma most of us will could never imagine. I have to congradulate the author on such a brave and unflinching achievement. This kind of self-examination and self-critique takes a lot of guts to put onto paper and that it's put down so incisively and with such clarity and detail is truly applaudable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Elephant in My Living Room","review":"There are books one reads that make you feel you will become a better person for having read it. Marlane's book is such a book. She has laid open her life, and brings the reader along with her in her physical and emotional trauma showing how her entire life was affected for years. She then shows how forgiving the one who wronged her so badly brought healing to her person. She shows how forgiveness gives a changing movement from negative emotions to positve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much There","review":"This book purports to help adult women dealing with unresolved sexual abuse. Instead, it is a trecley text which recommends turning everything over to the Christian god and not worrying about it. Worse, it suggests that if you can't get over sexual abuse this way, it's because there is something wrong with you. It hits you in the head, hard, with the author's religion. I would never recommend this book to anyone dealing with abuse issues. It's great that this strategy worked for the author, but people looking for real information and advice should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tale for boys","review":"This team of Thompson and Warhola has illustrated a few fairy tales that are great introductions to fairy tales for small boys -- and for girls as well, of course!

Worth bringing back into print!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Depressingly Wonderful","review":"This was a great story and very engaging, but also very bleak and sad, which only added to the story. It has to be hard to write a story like this, to show the unhappiness in someone's life and how to turn it around. I read the book over a month ago, so it's harder now to put into words what I felt when I read it, but I've been there, in that place emotionally. The main character seems weak, at first, but as she investigates and works to clear her name, she becomes more...more sure, more aware, more herself. Stronger and able to handle what happens, and she shows her intelligence, getting the murderer/abuser in a most unexpected way that I never would have thought of and made for a great story. I've ordered the second in the series and can't wait to find out what happens next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This was a wonderful book. It was, at turns, suspenseful, hilarious, gritty, thrilling, sad, witty, insightful and spooky. I stayed up late two evenings in a row to finish it and annoyed my traveling companion by continually reading funny or perceptive lines. It's hard to believe that this is the author's first book. I hope the author has a long and successful career ... and is prolific. I also hope the book (& author) become popular in the U.S. so future books are quickly and readily available."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare Find","review":"It seems to me that Denise Mina has that wondderful knack of delivering characters in a sentence.

I kept rooting for Maureen, who drinks too much and sometimes handles difficult problems ineptly, but who is courageous and persevering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad crime","review":"I finished this book just to see who committed the crime, but I felt the book was too long, quite trashy and not well-crafted. It is written in the third person which comes across as a bit impersonal. The story is ridiculous and unbelievable in parts. There are a lot of typos in the kindle version - just because it's cheaper than the hard copy novel, doesn't mean it shouldn't be edited. I would recommend Tana French as a preferred crime author- her writing is more believable, her stories more gripping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat Flatulence","review":"The ninth sentence, on the first page of the book, last line of the second paragraph is:\\"Eight long months of emotional turmoil had passed as suddenly as a fart.\\"Um, had I noticed that line in the store I probably would have \\"passed\\" on this one (pun intended)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great atmospheric novel","review":"I found Garnethill a well-written, engrossing novel. I cared about the main characters, about what happened to them; they were well-developed and likable. Use of dialect in novels is often annoying, but in this instance, it added to the flavor of the story, as did the atmosphere of the Scots setting. It was refreshing, for a change, reading a crime novel written from the perspective of a character who was not a detective or police person. While the novel wasn't flawless, it was a relief for me to enjoy what I feel was good quality writing, after the last disappointing novel I suffered through! I look forward to reading the other two in the trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Best of Mina's Books!","review":"This book is a good read. It focuses on the poverty-stricken Scottish city of Glasgow. In the narrative are domestic violence, alcoholism, the impact of poverty on lives, mental illness and a woman with a history of sexual abuse and past trauma. The protagonist has a deep soul and is a real survivor. Add to all this a riveting mystery, and it combines to make a highly recommended book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The way things work: computers","review":"I bought this book for my 12 year old to prepare for a computer literacy test he took to 'test out' of a required middle school course.

I read this series in reverse order, and I have to say Master of Temptation was my favorite of them all. The story certainly got off with a *Bang* as our main characters sealed the deal in the prologue! It was a nice change from cookie cutter romances in that the attraction was immediate without any of the drawn out chasing and wooing into bed. With that out of the way, the falling in love aspect was more real (for me anyway). There were many wonderful and colorful characters in this tale of secret agents, adventure, and intrigue. Both our leads were strong, smart and fearless. The \\"money\\" scenes were quite well done and very steamy. All in all this was a very well rounded book. Nicely done and highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lovemaking? I Think Not!","review":"Writing numerous sex scenes does not generate stirring romance reading. Nicole Jordan's newest novel MASTER OF TEMPTATION is saturated with stimulated descriptions, but what it does not have is the desire, the lust, the titillation that creates a good story. In other words, sex does not equal romance.I have found Nicole Jordan is a hot and cold writer; you never know what her books will provide. This talented author either electrifies you with her inspiration or leaves you cold with her neglect.MASTER OF TEMPTATION is the first novel in Jordan's newest series, \\"Guardians of the Sword.\\" A group of men and women who champion against evil and keep the world safe (Kinley MacGregor fans take notice). For part two in this ensemble, I plan to visit the library.MaryGrace Meloche."},{"rating":"1","title":"All I can say is..eh","review":"I'm about half way through this book and lemme tell ya, it's been a struggle. Master of Temptation? I don't think so..Max is neither tempting nor particularly masterful so far. I don't feel like I'm being drawn in to the story at all. It reads more like a laundry list than an actual narrative meant to draw me into the lives of these people. Frankly, I don't care about the main characters. She's mildly interesting because she is so different from other heroines..he's so one dimensional and familiar that he's boring. The dialogue is awful and the sex scenes are worse. At one point, the crucial..ahem..point, he actually says, \\"Heal me, my angel.\\" I mean, blech.

Foolishly I lent it to a student and never saw it again. When the Broadway play came out titled Shinebone Alley, it used all the songs from this 25 minute (or so) LP side and added more songs of less distinction. I never heard the original cast LP of that show at all. Since then I have hunted high and low for the original LP or the Shinbone Alley LP with Eartha Kitt. If anyone out there has either for sale, please let me know right quick. This video, then, was a blessing to me in that I at least have all the songs back again. I still cannot understand some lines sung by the chorus and Channing does tend to bury enunciation under her singing style. So I could use a copy of the script also.

Now I'm sure I could have fixed it myself - probably in short order. I've had little exposure to working on anything mechanical, but this book is very clear and simple.Max takes you step by step through exactly what he would do if he bought an older used outboard to evaluate it and set it up to run forever. That was exactly what I always wished I could have in print.One reviewer has complained that it doesn't cover pre-1955 motors well and that is correct. Max basically recommends against buying an earlier motor, so spends no time on them. The motors covered here are mid-50's through early/mid 70's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave Daniel Mixes the '60s with Suspense","review":"In a wonderfully written book, David Daniel has taken the reader back to 1967 Haight-Ashbury and the Summer of Love.

Partner a down on his luck San Francisco inspector with a young, attractive writer for an underground newspaper and you have an odd couple hoping to catch an elusive prey before The Summer of Love becomes The Summer of Blood.I recommend this book for all of you who were there in the 60s' and all of you who wish that you were."},{"rating":"2","title":"Appalling!","review":"I read this book when I was a teenager and I was just appalled that a Mother could do this to her own children.

Messrs. Matz and Ellis are two of my favorite arrangers for singers, period.A huge bonus was the singles - need I say more?The only low spot for me was NOT including the fabulous double pow-wow concert album with Mama Judy at the London Palladium - that would have made this package really complete.

Bears are bears, some are smart, some not so, some are hungry, some not so, and so on. They're beautiful and to be taken with respect and simply not to be feared, like this author seems to contrive.

I purchased it while a Boy Scout about 6 years ago, after using a similar Eureka tent during a patrol outing.I've never had an issue with water entering the tent. It's simple and quick to set up, and it's lightweight enough to lug around for simple outings, but not for lugging up a mountain for an outing.It even survived being crushed by a tree. Sure, the poles are a little bent (getting new ones soon), but the only mark left on the tent was a tiny hole (less than a dime-sized tear) in the mesh, which I'll be patching shortly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product fot thin, straight hair","review":"The best of it's kind - not easy to find it shops - great volumizer!!

Like other reviewers stated, it does not do a good job overall. It is particularly bad on the neck and jaw line, even with several passes and multiple directions. It is also loud.

There are four levels with 10 puzzles each, and then 5 hard puzzles in each level. You do not need to complete the hard puzzles to continue.

Toki Tori must rescue all his egg buddies that have been kidnapped and scattered throughout the game. Once you have grabbed a certain ammount of eggs back you advance to the next stage.

I understand why a pinch of salt is needed to operate this device, but I have never used any other humidifiers which required me to add salt. When it was full it never lasted more than about 10 hours, even though the description says 18-24 hour operation.

I get extremely dry sinuses in the winter and finally broke down and bought a humidifier to run while I'm sleeping. It helped a lot with the dry sinuses. So mission accomplished. This humidifier is not what it seems though. I purchased because the product description said a full tank of water would get me 18-24 hours of run time. It burns through the water so quickly it doesn't make it through the night. I sleep about 6 hours and this thing runs out of water around that mark. I read the instruction manual and followed the instructions for fixing this problem. It recommended doctoring the water because it was either too hard or too soft. I started mixing the tap water with distilled. It didn't really help much. I know this is just a cheap model but I'd like it to at least do what the box is advertising. I don't think that is asking too much.

You may want a couple if you have a large large rooms or in living areas, it works well in my office which about 14ftX12ft and bedrooms ~ 20ftx20ftIts funny to read the negative reviews.

First of all if you have soft water you must put salt in it every night dispite the claim in the instructions that you shouldn't have to do so more then once or twice to get it to work. First night I had to use two servings of the recommended salt content and it worked great after that. All night long! Second night I used only one serving due to the instructions warning that if you use too much salt it can burn out the motor and then you are screwed. It started to work and worked for a couple hours, but when I checked on my baby around 2am it had quit. Third night I again used one serving of salt and it did nothing the whole nite.

I added salt, I made sure not to fill it above the fill line, I followed the directions perfectly but it still stunk! I was worried and did not want my son to be inhaling burned plastic! I thought to myself that maybe it just smells that way because this is the first time it was used.

I've tried washing it out and unclogging it to get the steam going again. No such luck, and the way the water tub is shapped makes it impossible to dump all the water completely out.

Yes that does make the steam start to roll out of it good, only problem is that is will steam itself out very quickly. When I get the steam the way I want it won't even last 7 hours.If you have a small area and aren't looking for that much steam then this might be okay, I will be bringing this to my office to use.

The area around the machine becomes saturated with water and it makes me uneasy going near the electrical socket in the morning to unplug the machine.It is inexpensive, but I would go for a higher-end humidifier next time.

Why misrepresent the product's function so blatantly I wonder? It seems the steam comes out pretty well at first, but then as time goes by, it gets weaker & weaker, and only works about one-fourth to one-third the claimed length of time.

If you keep it clean and do the maintenance they recommend (cleaning with vinegar) it should last quite a while, as I said I've had mine for several years with no issues.I recently found the perfect thing for filling this too, if this is the same model I have-- an Ice Mountain large water jug fits perfect in the hole of the vaporizer when you take the \\"lid\\" off, and works really well for refilling.

I figure after all the pinches I've added, trying to get a moderate boil going, there has to be at least a cup of salt in the tank.Anyways, I definetly don't recommend this one, yeah the price is cheap, but you'd do better buying yourself some big pots, filling them with water and letting them steam on your stovetop.I'll be looking for another model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the steam?","review":"This vaporizer worked great for the first 2 days.

I added a teaspoon last night and it was maybe a little vigorous. Try adding just a few pinches if needed. That is mentioned in the instructions anyway. I like the vent where the steam comes out, it doesn't get too hot. The light is just right, not too bright.

It has worked fine on the first-level of my house.A lot of grey crud fills up the tank as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pleased...","review":"I bought this unit while pregnant to use and then thought it would be great to use when I had my children... Ruined the night table I had it on while pregnant (literally spitting water), and had to scrub my bedroom walls due to the water running down the walls (was only sitting at bed level). Have tried using for children when sick and the same issues. Last night was my last night trying it... Worked fine at first, then when I had to refill the tank, it began to \\"spit\\" very hot water at me (could have been on children had they been close enough), have had to scrub the bedroom walls today where the water ran down the walls, and it is loud, especially when it decides to \\"spit\\". Due to the extremely hot water spitting, I say this unit is just not safe, especially for a child's room. I am fine with the hot steam, but hot water should not be spitting across the room. I am always sure not to overfill so this is not the issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't work sometimes","review":"It works good at the beginning. But it works really bad recently, after I got it one month. There's nearly no vapor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating to clean & dry","review":"The one problem I have with this unit is that the molded plastic base (the white part) is virtually impossible to empty so it is fully dried. It is like trying to shake the last few drops out of a soda can. You need to dry it to avoid creating the environment for mold growth between uses. It could have been made to pour out the water... I don't know if this is a planned obsolescence thing, so you'll go out and get another cheap unit next season, but is irritating. Otherwise, I've had no problem using with a bit of salt and soaking in vinegar solution before drying to store."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO NOISY","review":"I had an older version of this that worked great for 10 years then finally quit emitting steam so bought this new one and it was horrible. It makes a gurgling noise about every 2 minutes, just enough to keep you awake and bug the heck out of you. I tried everything to fix it, more water, less water, etc. nothing fixed it. I have to get rid of it because my kids can't sleep when it's in their room because right when they are nodding off, that stupid gurgle sound happens again. A bit annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it's supposed to","review":"Nothing special, just keeps my room from getting super dry.

Unfortunately, mine can \\"spit\\" water a good 1' on occasion. I dealt with this by placing the unit in a foil turkey cooking pan. It does use a lot of power because it's continuously boiling water. On the other hand, it can definitely help heat a room along with raising the humidity so you can lower the heat in the bedroom and it balances out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vaporizer","review":"Awesome!

Upon examination, I found that if you have a water softener that uses salt, this Vicks vaporizer is no good unless you buy a few jugs of distilled water to use, and then follow directions. Reason: Water softeners that use salt, load up the water with sodium ions. The sodium ions in the water cause the vaporizer to drawn a lot of current and blow your circuit breakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"Apparently, any brand of warm mist vaporizer that you buy that costs around $20.00 is made by Kaz.

Waste of time!","review":"I bought this last year, and even though I followed directions, added salt, experimented with different amounts of salt- this never worked for me!

It creates only a small amount of steam. Adding salt increased the amount of steam somewhat, but then the thing started to sputter water. When I was a kid my grandparents had a vaporizer that put out a LOT of steam. I have no idea what brand that old vaporizer was. This Vicks vaporizer probably has more safety features than that old vaporizer, but it doesn't create nearly as much steam.

Saudek's literary narrative is firmly established in each image-story which is made more believable - as all good stories are - by his use of real, imperfect models. Saudek continues his story-plays by adding color to his prints in a very loose manner as if to wink at us as he embellishes the sometimes acrid image with a thin, sweet confection. This collection of Saudek's images gives a complete range of his work and is of excellent print quality; a rarity today at this price. As this edition demonstrates, Saudek is a major player in keeping the 'fine art' in the photographic medium while others play with computers."},{"rating":"1","title":"These photos are freely available!","review":"I honestly don't know what to make of this product.

The control and graphics are both quite good - which are the two most important game metrics for me.Finally, there is really nothing else out there like this game. Sure you could have DOA: Hardcore or Rayman:Revolution - both of which are excellent games - but realistically purchasing this game lets publishers know that there is a market for highly original concepts.

The annoying bits are that there is no damage to your taxi when you hit \\"solid\\" objects, you cannot mow people down on the street, the missions are all timed, the street surface glitch is EXTREMELY annoying (sometimes the street will completely disappear, looking like glass), and the wannabee Wolfman Jack should look for another means of employment. The side missions, exp. the long jump, [are] REALLY [bad]."},{"rating":"1","title":"what?","review":"this game might be fun at the arcade but it sucks at home. this is one of the most boring games i've ever played.it is still better than nothin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of bugs","review":"Be very careful when buying this game. If this is what we have to look forward to from Dreamcast ports, then we're in for a lot of trouble. What's wrong with this game? Where to start?- There is a major pop in problem. Sometime, it's so bad, you can't see the street just in front of you.- The street is frequently not there at all. Just the car in blue \\"air\\". Sometimes, turning a 360 will fix it.- The music usually plays for between two and ten seconds, then stops. When it gets bad, two or three notes will loop for 30 seconds.Yipes! These problems make the game totally unplayable. I don't recommend buying this game, yet. I hope they recall the garbage they've shipped, fix it and rerelease it. Then, it'll be one of the funnest games yet for the PS2.If you've read great reviews of this game, they're from people who haven't played this PS2 port."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Non Realistic","review":"This game is so not realistic. Seriously if you hit a car or crash your car is still dosen't have one dent. I first played this at my friends house and I loved it but when I bought it I got bored with it one the 2nd day. This game is not for kids it has swearing and voilence that's why it is rated T for teen. I don't know what peole are saying when they say it's great for children. Please rent before you buy and I do not recommend you waste your $20 on a game with nothing realistic not for children and boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"DONT buy this NOW","review":"this is a great game but you should wait till the seaquel comes out.

This game just doesn't work. It's boring, the graphics aren't good, and the storyline does not have much in it. Despite these bad features, this game can get very fun during free ride. Have fun driving around like a maniac while smashing into stuff. Back to the bad stuff. This game isn't half as good as a game that is very similar to it-Smuggler's Run. Smuggler's Run has better graphics, better gameplay, better story line, and is just more fun. I'm sorry SEGA and Aklaim, but I had to give Crazy Taxi 2/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four and a half really","review":"Crazy Taxi is a must have for everyone,kids,adults,teens.I borrowed this game from a friend and I love it.I plan to buy it in the future.It has lots of modes.(Arcade,Original,Crazy Box).Arcade is like an exhibition mode,Original is like an adventure mode,Crazy Box is a great minigame.It is easy to pick up and play.It is great to play with friends,even though there is no multiplayer,take turns at arcade to see who can earn the most cash.Here is what is good about Crazy Taxi:Great graphics,fun for more than one person,great modes,great fun for a while.Now what is bad:no official multiplayer,not enough modes,becomes repetitive after a while.Still overall a good game,hopefully Sega will improve the cons and make Crazy Taxi2 an absolute must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst games ever","review":"There is absolutly no point to this game. I wasted three bucks from renting down at my local video store when i was bored one after noon. This game is the same thing over and over and over again.

So save your money and go buy a good game for the same price like Final Fantasy X."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many bugs... this shouldn't have been released","review":"We waited a long time for this game to come to PS2. Who cares if it's just like Dreamcast... we don't have that console. But like several others have reported, this game is WAY too buggy to have been released, and I'm ashamed of Acclaim for taking money from consumers for an unfinished game. The road disappears constantly, which screws up your ability to play properly, and the game froze and had to be restarted twice within the first half hour of playing. It pretty much kills the potential of any fun this game could deliver. We'll be returning ours..., and I'd advise anyone to wait until these problems are fixed before making a purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Acclaim should be ashamed...","review":"Poor, poor, poor!!! How many glitches can you fit in one game? Disappearing roads, freezes, poor sound...either it's a defective copy or they just couldn't get it right.

I'm sure Acclaim had people fired for such a pitiful showing. I'll be exchanging my copy today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy Taxi (PS2)","review":"Well what can I say? It's Crazy Taxi, one of the best and most fun arcade games ever made by Sega in my honest opinion. With it's addicting gameplay and awesome soundtrack it's fun to play any time.

So she enjoys it so I am glad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool game!!!!!!!! =-)","review":"I personally think this game is very cool.

The game is full of action and I WILL BUY IT!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just didn't do it","review":"Again, another failed attempt at a racing game. Crazy Taxi gets boring really quickly and then you really have no where else to go and you end up bringing this one to your local Funcoland or Game Stop and trade it in for something else.The graphics are excellent and for the 5 minutes that it lasts, the game is fun but as soon as that 5 minutes is up, I wouldn't count on anything else to expect in this game.When will they come out with a racing game similar to Road Rash? Atleast in Road Rash, there's a lot more competition and you actually have to deal with the elements and environment around you. I can recall several times where I just drove across a park to get where I needed to go. Again, not very fun and an unfortunate thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's with the BUGS??","review":"10-15 minutes in the game and it FREEZES(crashes the PS2). Half of the polygons go invisible while driving. Obviously, whoever did this port was out to make PS2 look bad or was it just BAD coders.

The graphics are okay, but when you hit a building or something you go UP the building and it glitches? Since when does that happen in a modern game? The controls are atrocious. It's not a rewarding game and after 30 minutes of this game, you're thinking, this was $20??? Lots of hype, but in the end (30 minutes later) it's boring. I even picked up the SAME characters for the SAME destination in the SAME run...see...boring! There's only one course and 4 cab drivers....and the same old boring everything. Save your $! This was a big let-down...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Game has some BUGS!","review":"I got the game yesterday and I can already tell it has some serious problems. Something is wrong with the graphics: Your driving around and all the sudden the ground dissapers, you cant see the street only the other cars and people.

I think this one is a RETURN to AMAZON!"},{"rating":"2","title":"what an enjoyable book!","review":"As a 23 year old who wishes she was still in the 4th grade, this was a really fun and enjoyable read. The first-person narration was consistent and made the story that much more relatable. While there was, of course, fantasy and magic involved in the plot, it was contained enough so the story was still fun, but realistic enough to prove a greater lesson in the end that most kids & adults could relate to at some point in their lives. Can't wait for the next book!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"must read\\" to any class!","review":"Mr. Wartik has crafted a great book! The Vonnesta Project is fantastic!

Well Done! ~Beth Kern"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"Screen protectors may seem a good idea to use, but I think it's not worth it. Unless put on perfectly, one may find air bubbles on the screen, even with the help of a \\"Soft Card\\". If one manages to put on correctly, however, more force is needed to activate the touch screen. These slips may reflect light a little too much, making it harder to see, and when used, the little marks from the stylus will contribute to an even harder to see screen. It's a very sticky mess, so if you do buy it, put it on with care, because it is very hard to get off again. Not reccomended. If you don't want your screen to scratch, take good care of it, because these won't help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Option","review":"I haven't bought this for my DS because of all the reviews saying how it gunks up the screens. Until Nintendo comes up with an official product you can try getting a package of screen protectors for a Palm or other handheld device and cutting it to size. It's a bit of a bother, but worth it to protect your investment.Fellowes makes a very good product that won't mess up your screens. I don't know if it will detract from the gaming experience - it hasn't bothered me while playing Urbz - but may be difficult for games that rely solely on the touchscreen feature of the DS. Happy gaming!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Piece of Bull****!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is quite possibly the worst accsesory ever.

YOU CAN BUY THIS AT CLINIQUE MAKEUP COUNTERS IN MACYS,OR ANY WHERE THEY SELL CLINIQUE.IT SOUNDS SILLY BUT THE MAKEUP REMOVER IS OIL BASED AND CUTS RIGHT THROUGH THE GOO!!!

They are utterly worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst accessory","review":"This is by far the worst accessory you could put on your DS.

Please do yourself a favor and buy the Hori ones. It's a much better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!","review":"Sure this item may sound like a good investment, but it's not!

The problem is, the protector themselves are full of dust and aren't clear. You can hardly see the screens when you put them on. Even worse, when you try to peel them off, this sticky goo gets stuck all over the screen.

I'm a little confused as to how Pelican manages to stay in business at this point. The extra styluses are nice to have and the top screen protector was not a problem at all for me. Unfortunately, this defeates the original reason why I bought the thing. Like most of us who own a DS, the touch screen becoming damaged is a a major concern. Once I had placed the screen protector on the touch screen, it began to not respond to any form of touch that it normally would, rendering this technological advancement useless. Lucky for me though, it came right off with no problem and left no residue at all. Do not purchase this product as I can only forsee it causing more harm then good. There is probably a reason why Nintendo reccomends using only officially liscenced Nintendo products."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS OR ANY THIRD PARTY STLUS PENS","review":"I actually bought the 2 pack pelican metallic ones for 4.99, but it's the same thing. The thing looks really cool and stylish, fits in the ds nicely but that's about it. But what I didn't know when I bought it is that the tip is finer than the ds one, making it VERY prone to scratches in a matter of months or even weeks depending how often you play and how much the game requires a stylus. Stick to the OFFICIAL Nintendo one no matter how cool looking 3rd party stylus pens are!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for.","review":"I'll be short and simple. There's no need to protect the top screen, unless you carry your DS around open and in a bag full of knives and keys. The bottom screen protector was rather inconvenient to put on. It's no the company's fault if their product gets air bubbles, but the soft card didn't help. It got rid of some bubbles around the edges, but if you happen to get one in the middle of the screen, you're wasting your time. I also had a bit of trouble removing the bottom protector, as the screen is inset in the system, but once again, not really their fault. Overall, this is a cheap screen protector. Take that as a good or bad thing if you want. It's better than saran wrap, but worse than the Hori protectors. So if you have the money to spend, it's best to stay away from this.And for the fun factor: Are screen protectors supposed to be fun?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, not perfect...","review":"I really liked this book because it does NOT waste time...

The SP gives you 20 hours of play on one charge if you don't use the backlight, and 10 if you do. A battery that advertises being good for only 10 hours is bound to get less then that.

The goods as I see them...The playfield is great. The layout has plenty to hit yet not crowded. Sound effects are fine but not outstanding. You can play your KISS CDs while playing the game (way cool). Two playfields instead of one. The music is not bad enough to gripe about. Very inexspensive (always a plus). The bads...You get what you've paid for. The flippers have a lag, as if the jets are worn. The ball plays like a pachinco machine with flippers, or the shop owner set the machine level at a 75 degree angle. Hard to catch the ball. The painting on the first playfield makes it hard to visually track the ball. I miss the Turbo-Grafx pinball game Devils Crush.... The next time KISS authorizes a static pinball simulator, they should go to Empire Interactive.

SO if you love KISS and Pinball machines, then this game is for you.KISS PINBALL"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it's worth [less money].","review":"This game isn't very good. You get two boards of Kiss themed pinball. The worst part of this game is the ball control. The balls drop much too fast, making it hard to get any control. You basicly spend the whole game just flipping the flippers in hopes you'll hit the ball before it quickly drops to the bottom screen and past your flippers. The sound isn't very good either. Not much in the way of Kiss songs or sound effects. The manual even tells you to put your favorite Kiss CD in the playstation after the games loads. Don't confuse this game with an old favorite of mine for the Sega Genesis, Crue Ball, based on Motley Crue. That pinball game was great.

There are some delightfully nasty scenes in the movie, but this spoof is geared more toward a comic slant than an X-rated one. This movie is VERY low budget, but that doesn't take much away from it.

I love \\"Free\\" which is a song about wanting to break out of bondage. It's so easy to relate to- whatever is holding you down- a relationship, a job, sin, sorrow, doubt- this song will speak to your heart. Another great song is \\"Perfectly Done,\\" with encouraging lines like, \\"Hey little brother, Oh I know life has been rough, But I believe in you, cause in God you are tough.\\"Unlike a lot of \\"joyful\\" Christian music, Shawn is more serious, and doesn't even crack a smile in the CD art. When you aren't in the mood for the bombastic style of Praise&Worship; music, sit down on the couch with a cup of coffee and soak in \\"Ripen.\\" More about man's struggle than God's glory, this CD tends to feel like a series of personal yearning prayers being sung. Very much like the Psalms. Not quite as poetic, but just as honest."},{"rating":"1","title":"How do the Braves do it? Only vague answers here.","review":"This was a really good idea for a book, but it just doesn't deliver. Aside from the general annoyance of the cheap publishing and frequent typos, this book has no real structure or overarching argument ... if you read the last couple chapters you get more out of it than if you waste your time reading the whole thing. It's basically a mixture of biographies of everyone in the Braves organization and the author paraphrasing the words of others indiscriminately.I am a huge admirer of the Braves organization and their genius, so I was disappointed to not glean very much info about their magic in this book. Every once in a while there is a real gem about the Braves' philosophies, but just reading the life story of Steve Avery teaches me nothing. The book gets pretty repetitive with this and much of it is skippable.The Braves are an excellent foil to \\"Moneyball.\\" This book certainly isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book","review":"This book was a waste of money.

But the best description I saw was in an earlier review. If you read the first 4-7 chapters to get a history and an overview of the scouting program, as well as 1 or 2 of the scouting stories on prospects, you get the idea. Then skip to the end and read the last 2 chapters. If that was all the book was, then it would been a fascinating read. But as a competitor to moneyball, it doesnt hold a candle to the book in general.First, moneyball was well written. This book could've been a compilation of a home schooled sophmore in high school research and writing course. Moneyball actucally has flow, and tells stories differently. Scout's honor tells the same story over and over.Here's my suggestion. Buy the book, read the first 10 chapters and the last 2, and then return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"good, but see if you can find it cheap and with added warranty","review":"I bought this product at Sam's Club.

This incident will originate a curious blend between these two men: carving in relief the abysmal differences between both ways of living and thinking about many issues.Humor, surrealistic vignettes, towering images, fascinating script and inspiring direction made of this film one of the greatest ones during the early nineties.

Three strangers meet up and set out on a quest to retrieve a stolen magical object. What made this book enjoyable was the three main characters. Aaron is a runaway prince turned thief. Darvish is a drunken prince who turns out to be a pretty decent guy after he drys up a bit. Chandra is a princess who's not happy about her betrothal to Darvish because all she wants to do is wizard about. The characters are all pretty likeable and well developed for such a small book. If you are looking for a decent but light fantasy story with a bit of slash thrown in then this is a good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love","review":"I absolutely adore this book! This was my first time trying out any work by Tanya Huff and I was in no way disappointed. The plot is well thought out the characters are excellently developed with many facets to them and the well written details help keep you immersed in the story like you are actually there with the characters til the end of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous world building","review":"This tale presents as a situation similar to that of the British Empire the eve before Napolean's invasion at Waterloo....in a VERY alternate Universe. Everything you anticipate should immediately be thrown out the window, other than the attitudes and manners of the noncombatants. That said, the hierarchy and structure of the competing civilizations is mere background to the fascinating personalities who populate this story. It is a coming of age, it is an accommodation of the world other than we know it, it is a striving against odds too great to be fought, it is triumph out of tragedy. Immerse yourself, and spend some time in a very different world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sadly, out of print; but a favorite!","review":"This still remains my favorite Tanya Huff novel, and one of my favorite novels overall. The writing could be polished better, and the transitions are rough. But there is no doubt that you will identify with each of the three main characters in some way. This book has some of my favorite lines. As with her other series, she wraps you into her world and you begin to think using their slang. Nine Above!I, like many of her other fans, would love a sequel. I understand that Ms. Huff doesn't want to write a sequel, because she wants the happy ending to stick. While I relate, I want more! One small novel is not enough time with these characters, or this world.I truly wish this book was not out of print, or at least available for the Kindle. If you can find a copy, get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"3 misfits, 2 powerful wizards, 1 fantastic adventure!!!!","review":"Ms. Huff's characters are some of the most ragtag and troubled that I've ever encoutered. Still, they come across as people you can empathize with, rather than pity. You cheer them on as they try to tackle the problems of an entire nation while managing their own shortcomings and hang-ups...and there are plenty! A prince, a thief, and a young wizard seek the magic talisman that holds back the everpresent peril threatening the city. At the same time, each grows and matures, forming bonds of friendship and love to last forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"A welcome delight for the reader...","review":"I read this book years ago, I was stunned and exhilerated. This is why I read fantasy and science fiction. So that the story can grab me and the characters can touch me. Tanya Huff has written one of my favorite novels of all time with Fire's Stone. I've re-read it, it was ruined, I re-bought it. If she ever decides to write about this world again, I will be the first in line for it. I am a true Tanya Huff devoté!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WILL NEVER GO OUT OF STYLE","review":"I love this book. Since the first time I read this story I enjoyed it, how the stone becomes missing in the first place and what they do to get it back. How Darvish comes into Aaron's life and Chandra's, how they are forced together to return it and the bonding that follows. All the characters mingle nicely. I have read it so many times that I now have to purchase another because I wore this one out. The characters could be put into any century. They intertwine so nicely. Aaron's true feelings finally come out towards Darvish and the reaction is wonderful. The story line keeps you going. The adventure keeps you on the edge of your seat. I don't want to go into too much detail to spoil the plot but Tanya can always write a wonderful story. I wish there was a sequel made on this on how they get along later and what happens to Chandra later with Aaron and Darvish. Maybe get them into another adventure. This book was too good to stop at one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful character work, slightly rushed ending.","review":"I have read this book several times over. I am in love with these characters! The relationship between Aaron and Darvish is *intensely* romantic. Chandra's evolution from spoiled brat to brave woman is well spun, and as I've always found with Tanya Huff, the surrounding world and people are vividly alive. I've always appreciated seeing that women soldiers, wizards, and assassins are commonplace in these other worlds. She always pulls it off with style. To return to \\"The Fire's Stone\\": maybe it was just the disappointment of coming to the end of a book whose characters I was in love with, but the ending seemed just a tiny bit rushed. Still, I recommend this book without hesitation, and will continue wishing for a sequel, or perhaps just another book set in this fascinating world!...and in the meantime, I'll surely read this book again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Good One","review":"This is probably the fifth or sixth book I have read by Tanya Huff and she is definitely an author I would highly recommend. I really liked the characters in this, especially Darvish (despite his drunkenness in the beginning). Though the growing relationship and feelings between Aaron and Darvish made me a little uncomfortable (I would rather have had Darvish lusting after Chandra instead of Aaron) I didn't let it put me off and had a hard time putting the book down in order to do the necessary everyday chores that need to be done. Tanya Huff does a wonderful job of showing what friendship and true caring is all about. I hope she does come up with a sequel to this, but if not anything else she does come up with will be very good without a doubt. You can't really go wrong with one of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice while it lasted, but sprung a leak","review":"Had this very nice-looking (albeit occasionally mistaken for a liquor flask ;-) ) water bottle for a bit over a year. The aluminum gets dented fairly easily, but supposedly the plastic lining inside should maintain a seal. Not for me! One of the dented \\"corners\\" now leaks. Drip drip drip. I don't know if this is more likely given the oval design--those \\"corner\\" regions are very dent prone. Also, the colored enamel chips off of the dented regions, which is merely an aesthetic problem, but worth noting in case that matters to you. I'm getting a Klean Kanteen to replace it--my daughter has one, and while it is heavier, the stainless steel doesn't dent (or leak)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of Date as of 2011","review":"I tried to run this on my mac book pro, and all I have to say is that it is time to give up on windows xp when considering OEM unless you can get a the most recent version.

I would only use this version over vista and others because your mac will run quicker. Eventually you may want to have at least 2gb of ram, but I am using 1gb which is recommended and it is fine.A note if you get VMware.

At $90 a set I would like to see more than 2-3 years or at least a replacement sensor cover. It is a PIA to replace these things! Buy a regular carriage light with no motion or light sensor (those break too) and put in an inexpensive timer on the switch to control when you want to light! Total cost $40 for a set including the timer vs $90 every couple years on this junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice looking light","review":"Light is very nice looking and seems well made.

I just replaced 2 lamps I bought in 2003 because I could not find a control unit to service them and, after further research, have found that the manufacturer will not sell just a lighting control; You have to buy the whole unit. Over time the sensors start to wear out and the function will become erratic. Expect this after about 5 years. When these 2 finally go, I'm going to install 2 \\"plain\\" lamps and a separate photocell/infrared sensor in a suitable location to control both lights; At least I will be able to replace just that piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would never recommend unless you are required to get it","review":"For a book that is supposed to be read as part of a Master's curriculum, this book was lacking.Typographical errors, sloppy layout and not reader friendly.

Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down.I grew up in the same Boston suburb as the author, in a family spiraling in similar downward economic mobility, and I'm about the same age as the author, so many of her experiences mirrored my own. Her mirror brought me surprising clarity and compassion with regard to my parents' struggles and the impact their struggles had on my own growing up.I'm a psychologist now. When I look at this book from my professional viewpoint, as someone who treats and writes about depression, I also feel that it's a terrific resource. I will be recommending it to adults I treat for recurrent depressive episodes.The author's depressions started when she was an adolescent, and continued intermittently through much of her adult life. Watching her gain understanding and mastery over this depressive tendency gave me a deeper understanding of how I can help the depressed individuals with whom I work.BRAVO to the author, and thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gallagher hits a homer!","review":"This book made my sides hurt!

You'll especially love where Charles Schumer, D-NY ends up in this one. But \\"The Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World of Politics\\" is truly a case of saving the best for last. James Carville is my personal favorite character in this one.Rated R for language, innuendo, and other violence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever happened to true scholarship?","review":"If Tokovich had spent more time analyzing the literature of the American renaissance rather than writing a politically correct pseudo-feminist rant against a supposed white patriarchal conspiracy, this might have been an interesting book. Tonkovich has a flair for language, but is so concerned with toeing the line of academic-speak that this book often reads as an unintentional satire of academic writing.

I perfer to remember it's History as told by my father and his and remember my experiences during it's worst era (mid 20th century) through it's struggle to become reborn today.If you are considering this book, I recommend you take the drive through Patapsco State Park along the \\"Old River\\" on Sunday instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, doesn't work","review":"The Lexmark Z55 was advertised as being very fast and easy to use. NOT TRUE! It took several tries to get the software installed, and the printer ran extremely slow, when it did print at all. It would not print at all from DOS, or from other computers on the network. Printing from a DOS program in Windows caused a Windows program to pop up and it seemed to take 'nearly forever' to print a simple directory listing. Even such a simple command as DIR>LPT1: caused the computer to crash.A tech. support call to Lexmark (NOT a toll-free number!) revealed that this is a 'brain-dead' printer that does not include the printhead driver in its on-board electronics, but instead relies on the host computer to control the printhead. So whenever you print anything, you're tying up your CPU doing what the printer is supposed to do itself!I do NOT recommend this printer unless you want to 'throw away' half your CPU speed every time you want to print!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great when it works...but that's not all that often","review":"For the first few months, this worked like a dream.

It's actually an amusing, sarcastic kiss-off.\\"Brownsville Girl\\" is one of Dylan's best epics, but if you're a bootleg collector, seek out \\"New Danville Girl\\": \\"Brownsville Girl\\" basically took that same recording, replaced the vocal track and dumped extra echo, horns and back-up singers on top of it.

Buy any other Dylan album but this. If y2k hits, Bob's discs will be better than gold. They would be the new currency, something that has a value that will never wane, even in a time of economic crisis. Sure if the power is out the disc players won't work, but someone will be savy enought to have a generater just to play Bob's music, and this man will be out King, and we will follow him.

And afterall, it is Bob Dylan. That's worth three stars right there!The biggest problem with this CD is that it lacks consistency. It's as though Dylan recorded these tracks over a very long period of time and was never able to develop a unifying theme. And if some of these songs (\\"Precious Memories\\" & \\"Under Your Spell\\") were to drift away and never be heard from again, it would be no great loss to the Dylan catalogue.On the other hand, some of the moments on this album are wonderful. \\"Brownsville Girl\\" is obvious, but I also really like the powerful \\"You Wanna Ramble\\" (a great song to play on the road), \\"They Killed Him\\" and \\"Got My Mind Made Up.\\"Not great Dylan, but not bad Dylan.

When Dylan's lyrics are weak, that robs all purpose of listening to the music. Guess what? They're mostly weak here (Drifting too Far from the Shore; Maybe Someday; Precious Memories; Under Your Spell). Guess what else? The tunes themselves are mostly weak: no memorable melodies, no virtuoso or even good (or even crappy, for that matter) performances, nothin'. And don't even get me started on that children's choir found on They Killed Him... baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad idea. Most of these songs are cut-cut-cut-rate love songs. The exception is Brownsville Girl. His lyrics are at their best. But those booming drums, backing vocals and horns are distracting.

My concern if a a new listener listens and forms a negative opinion on Bob before hearing the other more \\"accessible\\" entries. This review can be applied to the other two albums mentioned.

Believe me.It's your decision: if you can handle this, buy it, because otherwise it takes excellent pictures in normal lightning conditions.

Last year we went on a vacation with 11 hours of driving. We saw plates from around 30 states. However, we did not have this informative guide like we did this year.The paper stock is heavy and coated, making it resistant to any \\"accidents\\" that may happen in the car. The pages are oriented horizontally and have a tie so that they are easy to flip. Each page has the plate on one side and a ton of information on the other side (great for keeping inquisitive kids busy). At the back is a good map of the states (a two-page foldout) which can be scanned and printed so that you can check off the states as you see them.The box is sturdy and not too much larger than the book itself, but large enough to allow a pen and pencil in it, as well as a folded map printout (see above).The plates are large, colorful, detailed and current.

It does not cover any one area very well. Your time would be better spent on concentrating on books that cover these areas in proper detail. The author gets too far off on politics in the second half and it was a struggle to not just put the book away and forget it. There are a few good tales of travel on the Mexican trains, but you have to put up with the rest in between.

I feel that it doesn't shave as close as the Norelco but perhaps this is because I didn't give myself time to adjust to it.In all fairness it is solidly built and has a feels plenty powerful.

I personally loved it and almost immediately went out and searched to see if she has any other works. I was not disappointed, she has one other CD which is also very good, but this is my personal favorite. Even if you are not a connossieur of Arabic music, and I have played it to a number of my friends who are not, you will love this CD, in fact many have thanked me afterwards for introducing them to her. It is certainly not pop music so if that is what you are looking for, this is not the CD for you, this is real musicianship and excellent singing.

The stroller adapts to fit several different car seats and is easy to configure/put together. I was particularly impressed with how sturdy the stroller is, yet it is still surprisingly easy to fold up and put into the back of the car. The large storage basket underneath is also a big plus. If you have twins you absolutely MUST have this stroller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful stroller, but could use improvements","review":"I couldn't imagine getting out and about without this stroller. However, things that could be improved upon include: the directions - they were horrible; the undercarriage is not easily accessible when both carseats are in the frame; and it does not fold up very well - the straps and wheels often get in the way.Unfortunately, there really aren't any other options out there, so this one (even with it's problems) becomes the top choice.We've only had it for 2.5 months, but have used it often and it is in great shape still.

It became so bad that the metal started to snap. I called and complained to the company and they refunded my money and told me I needed to lift the end up any slight kerb(don't know how they think you can do that when you're by yourself).

I called Baby Trend customer service, and the response was that only the Baby Trend car seats are designed to lock in. That makes no sense to me - why would they say that Graco car seats fit in if they don't??I've read many reviews from people, and some people talked about the same problem, some people say they fixed the problem, and some people say their Gracos fit great!

However, I used this until my boys were 6 months/20 lbs and feel I definitely got my money's worth. It's so simple! You remove your carseat from the car, sleeping baby and all, and set it in the frame. It's quick, easy and best of all...under 10 lbs. I was even able to use it right after my C-section. The stroller handles well and turns on a dime. The only disadvantage IS that the storage bag is hard to access...small price to pay! The cup holders are great, it pops up with one release button and folds just as easily. I could not have done without it! Makes mobilizing twins possible and simple. LOVE IT! LOVE IT!

It is so long that it is difficult to steer, and barely fits in the back of my minivan ('04 Nissan Quest). I have yet to get it to close completely. It is also very heavy.

This happened to me. A 16.5-volt power supply was hooked up instead of the supplied 12 volt one. It didn't blow the fuse but it did blow the CCD pick-up.HP does not sell this part, so it cannot be fixed. It becomes Landfill instead.

The 3570c is a great leap backwards from my previous HP scanner. If you require a transparency scanner, I would suggest getting a 3500 and add the transparency adapter as an option. With the 3570c you have to use a piece of white paper over your scanned item to prevent the transparency holder from bleeding through to your scanned image. Also, I've found that the scanner has a tendency to \\"auto-crop\\" certain items even when the \\"auto-crop\\" function is disabled. I'm getting tired of having to drag the cropping handles around just to get the entire scanned image on the screen.

It's a decent knife block, but should not be sold on Amazon with a $20.00 price tag or more if it is a blatent free gift with purchase.Just a word to the wise for those who may be thinking of sending this as a gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"good knife block","review":"I only have a few knives, but needed a place to store them.

Please David, go on with your solo career!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Milk Toast from David Pack","review":"I was truly looking forward to this CD, but i was shocked when ireceived it in how BAD the songs are!This CD doesn't even come close to the quality of the Ambrosia albums or evenDavid's Anywhere you go album. David you need to go back and listen to Ice Age, The Brunt,Time Waits For No One, Mama Frog, Drink Of Water, Make Us All Aware, and Danse WithMe George! These are all incredible songs. In the future please do not leave a drum machine inthe final mix. It's extremely annoying. If you must get this CD wait for the domestic release,unless you like MILK TOAST!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sappy Songs From Mr Pack","review":"This CD is a big disappointment! I love David's work with Ambrosia, but the songs on this CD are very poor and the recordingis not very good. At this import price it is really NOT WORTH IT!Let's have some PROG ROCK SONGS! and NOT this SAPPY STUFF."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightfully Refreshing!!!","review":"Finally, another solo project from the distinctive voice of Ambrosia--and it only took 18 years. While other aging rockers' talents have diminished with age, David Pack's voice and songwriting skills are as fresh and vibrant as ever. Each track on Unborn is a gem. There is a great variety of song styles yet the album flows naturally and fits together, unlike some of Ambrosia's later efforts which seemed somewhat uneven and awkward. It's a crime this has to be ordered as a Japanese import. Would no US company distribute this album? These songs should be dominating the FM airwaves. Buy this album!! If you love Ambrosia, this is worth every penny! David Pack fans also need to check out \\"The Best of David Benoit\\" (Pack sings \\"The Key To You\\") and Alan Parsons' \\"Try Anything Once\\" (Pack sings various tracks and the sublime masterpiece \\"Oh Life-There Must Be More\\" alone make it worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unborn","review":"Well, based on the other reviews I read here, I was prepared for disappointment. However after listening to the songs, I have to disagree with the negative reviewers. No, this isn't prog music by any stretch of the imagination. But it is David Pack. David Pack isn't prog. Ambrosia was prog. David's music is his own. Much like his solo CD from the 80s, it's got smooth ballads, upbeat tempos, and original lyrics that only David can write. Nothing wrong with that! He shows his sensitivity, and his faith, along with his musical abilities, which are second to none. For David Pack fans, this will be a treat. For those looking for progressive rock, best to look elsewhere. This is a good, solid CD, and anyone who loves the elegant sound of this man's voice will be jumping for joy to have this one in their collection....it's been way too long!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"David Pack ~ Unborn","review":"With all due respect to those who gave this CD a negative review, the reason it doesn't sound like Ambrosia is because it's not Ambrosia, it's David Pack! If you are a fan, for the love of God, you need to own this CD. Pay no attention to the high price. It's new David Pack! What more do you need to know? His voice still has the power to kill, and the songs sweetly bring you back to the mid-80s, mid-90s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much talking and not enough music!","review":"First, let me say that when Little Richard is playing, the music is exceptional even though he does erroneously call himself \\"I Am\\" which is a Biblical term for God. Little Richard is great but not that great. As I said, the music is great.The biggest and most annoying problem with this CD is the excessive talking between songs. While this is a normal thing to expect in any live concert, the producers of this CD should have curbed most of the talk and let the music play. However, since the CD is only about 30 minutes long, the deletion of the talking would have made this a 15 minute long CD. Not worth the purchase.Unless you are a die-hard Little Richard fan (like me I guess), purchase any of his other CDs. They are longer in length and have more of his music. I wish that more of his live performances would be available except with more music and less talking."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works, but not perfect.","review":"We bought this clip for two A630 phones in our house. It works fine, the belt clip is satisfactory, and product looks simple and sturdy.Problems: (1) ridges on the clip don't sit snugly in the slots (grooves) of the phone. There is a high potential for the phone to drop off. (2) All the buttons on the phone are exposed and seat belts and other things start pressing the buttons. You have to cultivate the habit of locking the phone. (3) Charger plug doesn't sit well if the phone stays in the clip. You have to jiggle and make sure that the charging is happening.We are not unhappy with the product, but I think there is certainly room for improvement.12/24/2008My phone fell from by belt a few days ago and the clip shattered.

It leaked some, but not as much as some others experienced. Our biggest problem was cleaning. We tried additives, but nothing helped against mineral buildup.

Not a bad little humidifier, but there are much better on the market now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd that this has been so well reviewed...","review":"But I used this Vicks Humidifier model only once and returned it. First, there something rattling around in the base that clearly should not have been there. More importantly, after only one night, there was crusty brown gunk on the inner unit (even if my water is chock full of minerals, should this happen after only one use?), and aside from the water tank, it was not easy to clean. Some humidifer companies suggest cleaning weekly, but this one would require cleaning after each use.I continue to search for a good, table top humidifier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke for me quickly","review":"I have had two of these now.

I started looking at the rest of the device and noticed the tank cap has a spring loaded valve, on this valve is a small knob at the end presumably to not allow the rubber bushing to fall off.I actually believe that is where the rubber bushing is supposed to rest, I grabbed the edge of the bushing and pulled it down until it snapped into place on the end of the valve stem and miraculously my humidifier is working like a charm now.I hope this helps other owners of this humidifier because it works well, is quiet and is quite simple to operate. The only negative is the reliability of the spring loaded valve in the tank cap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Thought","review":"I first think that these additional volumes of monsters are really a great help. Often times in the old compendium I find myself not being able to find a \\"new\\" encounter for the players to deal with. Witht the annual compendiums I find more and more encounters that can add great fun. For example I find that the new types of dragons, golems, and lycanthropes add surprise to the game. My players often know how to deal with anything I throw at them so the new monsters in this book challenge them more and create more fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've seen better/","review":"Okay even this had been the worst of the lot I still would've bought it but thats because im obssesed with collecting every singel compendium. For those of you who arent this book is not neccessairly a must have. Id say the two good parts which stick out are the Wereshark and the Brine dragon. The art <stinks> compared to annual 1 and some of the monsters are pretty stupid too, two words: Centaur Kin.

Production sound is technically excellent but plain and unvarnished. The absence of gimmicks and artifice breeds an absorbing intensity.Duets between bright, sprangy sitar (Narenda Bataju) and the oud (Hussein el Masry), a string instrument with a wonderfully hollow woody resonance. The former is lyrical and exploratory, the latter foreboding and mordant.Endless variation on the same phrase treats us to bursts of grinding staccato riffing and tremulous, quivering accents. The final twenty minutes, joined by stacks of throbbing percussion, are very loud and swing like crazy.Serious afterglow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Card..Main Event is decent.","review":"I cant lie due to the stacked card of UFC 126, I knew it would be hard to do a follow up and the main event of Penn v Fitch for a chance at the winner of GSP v Shields, but this was a good UFC but not a great one and I am still buying it but I just wish they would change the judging system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Withcraft or Coincidence?","review":"This book is a fast read with a story line that takes several twists and turns.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anything is Possible","review":"This was an awesome read. The author captivated me from first page to last. It also scared me out of my wits, making me glad that my agent is a wonderful woman I can trust. Yikes!

Leider ist Männer mit 2:02 etwas kurz geraten, aber ist trotzdem toll. Dit Tonqualität ist recht gut, zwar nicht so wie ein Studioalbum aber es ist eben ein Livekonzert. Dafür hat man die Stimmung, besonders bei solchen Songs wie \\"Bochum\\" und \\"Was soll das\\", wo das Publikum begeistert mitsingt, aber auch beim gefühlvollem \\"Halt mich\\" und \\"Land unter\\" bin ich immer wieder erfreut wie die Leute mitgehen und mitsingen; es gibt einem wirklich das Gefühl mit dabei zu sein.Das eizige was ich zu bemängeln hätte ist, das es kein Doppelalbum ist.

It is huge. MUCH larger than your typical soap dispenser. That may be a plus or a minus, depending on what you're looking for.2. The pump mechanism just slides over a tube of sorts (it is not actually attached to the screw-on top). This can lead to poor suction when pumping since air seems to leak in if the angle you're pushing isn't perfect. I get bubbles and sputtering from it as often as I get soap.3. The base at the bottom, screw-on top and pusher-thing are all made out of that grippy, porous kind of rubber that absorbs dirt and grime. Not too bright for something that is going to be used by folks with dirty hands.I bought it mainly because I've been happy in the past with KitchenAid products, but they really dropped the ball on this one. It is not up to their usual standards in either design or build quality.

I wish I'd have looked a little more closely at the picture before ordering, though... I didn't realize it came with three wise men but only one shepherd and no Joseph! I'm telling my girls that the shepherd IS Joseph, but if he is, then there are no shepherds... So we have a duel role shepherd / Joseph, but all three wise men? Seems a little silly since those three didn't actually show up in the story until Jesus was a toddler... but anyway... This toy would have undoubtedly made 5 stars in my book if it would have come with a Joseph character and one or two more shepherds (even if it meant a slightly higher price)."},{"rating":"2","title":"We like it but...","review":"There was no clear description that this one wasn't the one that had the music, which is the one I wanted.

This is definately a worthwhile purchase.Our only complaint is that there doesn't seem to be a Joseph (in the picture the little man in the stable is actually the shepherd).

Having left Pearl Harbor just before the Japanese attack, the Pan Am seaplane (a Boing 314 Clipper) is ordered to continue flying west on total radio silence. Their ultimate goal - to reach New York's La Guardia airport. Flying often with the wrong fuel, i.e. 90 octane auto gas instead of 100 octane aviation fuel, taking off vastly overloaded with spare engines, engine parts and barrels of oil, flying over the continent of Australia where there is no place for a seaplane to land and taking off, again overloaded, from there Congo River just before it becomes a major waterfall, these are just a few of the challenges that face the heroic Captain and crew if this remarkable airplane on a remarkable trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forgotten History in the Making","review":"Ed Dover brings to light a historical event of which few have ever known.

After going through the book, the reader would have enough knowledge in the field of spectral analysis to make her prepared for advanced reading / research in the subject.

The \\"piston\\" compression technology provides just the right amount of compression on your muscles and truely enhances your running comfort and performance.

I am reminded more of Sufjan Stevens, who is far more appreciated in Europe than in the U.S. Why, because Sufjan (like Andy Liotta) writes intelligent lyrics and melodies that need to be listened to over and over again to really appreciate how good this guy is.

The maps are the best I've ever seen and allow the reader to follow the various actions easily. I did find it difficult at times to follow the battle at the grand tactical(corps/division)level because of the detail at brigade/regiment level being told.

I called up the HP Hotline and they told me \\"to pull as hard as possible\\" to get the thing back to the middle. I tried pulling and basically nothing happened except that I pulled off the white strip. They then informed me that the cradle sticking tends to \\"happen a lot\\" and that I should just go out and buy a new printer since my 90 day warranty was up.

It was a little easier setting up with the laptop, but not a major problem with the desktop. It is much quieter than the old one and also faster. I am very pleased.

I took the advice of a BestBuy sales person that an inkjet print in the same quality as a laserjet. But they definitely do not match, even if they have the same dpi.

The online support representative at least did acknowledge that the reports of free replacements were true. But he said that this policy had been discontinued as of December 2005.

This printer was the biggest disappointment with my HP Pavilion Computer package I bought August of 2002. It came free with the computer, so it seemed like a bargain- and if it's still goin for $140 it must have been (though i think that price is a bit obnoxious). However, I would have rather paid the extra $50 for a better model than suffered through all the \\"mechanical errors\\" and various paper jams i've received the past year or so.

I have already been without a printer 3 weeks, so this is a great inconvenience and dissappointment in that I thought this a very well rated product. I realize that any warrenty on parts has run out, but a company that finds a major defective part in one of its products, I think, has a responsibility to the consumer to reach some kind of an agreement that is agreeable to both.

I couldn't even call their phone support for free since it was past its warranty, so I spent about 4 hours online with a technician who couldn't help me. Customer service overall was terrible.

That wouldn't deter me from buying it, though. We just sewed a velcro tab onto it where the magnet is, and that took care of that!It really is cute, and my daughter just loves wearing it around the house, and even out to church, the grocery store, wherever!

But the SECOND DAY the magnet on the pack came loose and was lost in the lining of the pack. The one on the flap is still secure.I located the magnet and sewed it back in place (it looks a little rough but it won't get lost again!) I can't say that I know for sure that my daughter didn't cause this, but since she only had it for 2 days and is pretty easy on her toys, I suspect it is a defect or poor workmanship.However, it is totally fixable and worth it since this is the only backpack out there that is just like Dora's and not hard plastic. It really is cute and she loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy!","review":"My 3 year old loves this little backpack. She pretends she's Dora and takes it every where she goes.

It's about this loser named Daisuke who turns into Dark due to his feelings for some silly girl named Risa Harada who doesn't return his feelings. This girly is giggly silly over that heartbreaker Dark. Riku who in my opinion is the better of the Harada sisters. She is a grating character too but tolerable compared to her uber annoying sister Risa. In fact I wish Daisuke and Dark ended up dead and Risa with them.

D.N.Angel was in fact one of my favorites. It starts off with a boy named Daisuke Niwa and how he is introduced into the story. The beginning may throw people off because no one knows exactly whats happening, but as you watch later on you will understand. Niwa happens to fall in love with the younger of the two Harada's. Since Risa doesn't return his love Niwa now becomes Dark because thats part of his D.N.A. Her sister Riku isn't a bad character as well because she just happens to like Niwa and I won't say anymore otherwise I'll end up spoiling the whole dvd.

The main issue is in Europe. I got caught out. I bought a 3 catridges overseas - I could not use them on my HP printer. I asked for a refund, HP Email Support (US) was nice but ineffective.

After giving them the serial number and model number they told me the product was not under warranty and I could either use e-mail support which I had already tried or pay $25 dollars for 7 days of hardware support. I will try to take the product back to the store I bought it at and get my money back. Needless to say I will no longer be purchasing HP products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy with this printer!","review":"I had recently purchased this printer. It does a great job printing photos on HP photo paper (even with the ink cartridges it came with, you can also purchase separately another cartridge specifically for photo printing). I was very impressed that it looked like store developed pictures. I have yet to try it out with the photo ink. Text printing is great in b/w & color. For the price, it's worth the money. No complaints about it. We were thinking about a multifunction printer by HP, but we were told that the print quality & $ of this printer can't be beat, especially for photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"HP DeskJet 5550 Color Printer","review":"After just a few days using this printer, I am convinced it's a real winner at a very resonable price (especially for HP). The color, speed, and price are what led me to buy this printer. I am not disappointed; and I rate it at 5 stars based on this.However, the ink jets are typically pricey, therefore a 3-star rating for this. And I realize that HP is really in the supply business and not the printer business. So, all-in-all, a 4.5-star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paper Jams and Feed Problems Galore!!!","review":"This printer was a real disappointment. I loved the print quality of photos. However, this printer is LOUD compared to my old 722c, which lasted nearly 5 years. Not only that, it was cheaply made in comparison. After about a year and a half the thing just went crazy and the paper would not longer feed through. It makes a loud crazy sound then doesn't pick up the paper. Customer support is non-existent. I tried to send an e-mail rather than PAY for support and I received a file not found message. This sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after warranty expired","review":"Printed great for a little over a year (the duration of the warranty) and then it quit and just flashed all it's lights at us.

I'm happy to have it back in my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound is a bit too slick","review":"It was great to have Gregg Allman back on the radio in 1987 with the nice title track. The success of this album lead to another solo album the following year, but neither of these albums are of the caliber of his material with the Allman Brothers Band in the 1990s nor his recent solo album (Searchin for Simplicity).This album has a 1980s slickness to it that takes the \\"soul\\" out of the music. Gregg's voice is in fine form, but there is nothing too memorable from the music. I would go with Evening With the Allman Brothers Band (1992) or Searchin for Simplicity (1997) to really hear Gregg making rich, soulful blues-rock music."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few good songs, but not one of his best","review":"This album was a comeback album for Gregg in 1987, after 5 years of playing clubs & bars. It features former Allman Brothers guitarist Dan Toler, who never had the gritty, bluesy chops of Dickey Betts, Warren Haynes, Duane Allman or current ABB slide prodigy Derek Trucks. The title track was a top40 hit & still gets plenty of airplay on album rock stations 12 years later. The album is just overproduced.I would recommend passing on this one & picking up something from the Allman Brothers Band in the 1990s (An Evening With.. or Seven Turns) to hear what real blues-rock sounds like. For a taste of Gregg's solo career, Searchin for Simplicity (1997) may be his best solo effort of this career. It is a much more honest, roots oriented rhythm and blues album without the extra studio production that hinders I'm No Angel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vacuum Bags","review":"I decided to purchase 2 packages just to save time & have extra.

I hate to admit it, but i cried, it was so beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"someone like Jerry Falwell or Dr. Laura","review":"Someone Like You is an easy read, but the book promotes so many negative ideas about women that I found it hard to enjoy it. The book attempts to portray female friendship, and does a fairly good job of capturing the importance of friendship between young women. But Dessen severely punishes any character who has sex (fatal motorcycle accident, pregnancy) or even wants to have sex (car accident). Her blatantly regressive views on sex make this book more of a blanket treatise on why sex is bad and should not happen outside of traditional marriage. Dessen also incorporates extremely negative messages about body image into this novel, which are particularly damaging for young women. She is a talented storyteller, but her ultra-conservative, reactionary views render this novel more than repulsive; it is simply bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone Like You","review":"This book weighs about a half pound.

This was my best friends favorite book so when she gave it to me for christmas, i wanted to read it. I was sadly dissapointed! Im sorry, but cigarette smoking bad boys who get drunk and go to parties arent the type of guys i'd be swooning over. I guess if i havent read so many beter romance/teen books, i'd say this was pretty good, but it didnt even really end well either. Her and the guy never even really talked at the end. I guess my big mistake was reading Twilight before reading this book. If you want a real romance book thats PG, and so amazing you feel it in your heart, i would highly recomend Twilight! That is the book i got my best friend hooked on! When i asked her which she prefered~ there was no competition. Twilight won."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Sarah Dessen","review":"This was my first Sarah Dessen. It isn't as well known as the others but it's still a great book.

I've lost count of how many times I've read it. I can relate to the problems and choices Halley has to face. I remember the first time I picked it up, I literally could not put it back down. And each time I reread it, it never gets boring.

I think I've read it about four times in about a day each time. This story line just never gets old. The friendship Halley and Scarlett have is amazing! The book shows the struggle they go through with Scarlett getting pregnant and Halley's struggle to have a relationship with a boy her parents less than approve of.

Apparently, this was made into a movie called \\"How to Deal\\" with Mandy Moore, a movie I turned off about fifteen minutes into it. I hoped the book would be better. I was wrong.The plot was cookie cutter. The writing was tepid with nothing distinctive about it. The characters were annoying and unsympathetic. Even worse, I started wishing for even more bad things to happen to them. I put it down about fifty pages into it.Yes, I'm an adult, but that doesn't stop me from enjoying well written YA novels.

Scarlett was known popular and halley was just the quiet little friend, but she doesnt mind. When the Junior year came up, there was trouble going on. When Halley was at sisterhood camp in the summer, Scarlett called telling her something. THis something was really important. Scarlett's boyfriend had past away from a motorcycle accident.

I enjoyed some of Dessen's books in the past, so I thought I'd give this one a try. It sucked me in big time. It was a refreshingly real look at the struggle that teen girls face dealing with pressure from guys, pressure to drink, and pressure to be who their parents want them to be. I was tempted to knock some sense into Halley partially through the book, luckily Scarlett did it for me. Encouraging book, complete with happy ending, but I'm not going to lie and say the whole story was happy. Life's struggles aren't happy. Definitely worth reading though."},{"rating":"2","title":"current and realistic","review":"What a well written novel! The story highlights the trial and tribulations of being teenagers.

Even though the movie How To Deal kind of stunk, the books are great. Halley and Scarlett are two very thought out characters and seem very realistic.

It comes in a plastic bubble package unlike some of the nicer ones that come in gift/display boxes. I opened it so I could put it in a nicer box since it was a gift and played with it a while. It is nicely balanced, sharp, and feels very solid.The only thing I didn't like about it was that it was difficult to open one-handed. There is a ball bearing on the inside of the blade that acts as a locking mechanism that keeps the blade secure while it is folded closed, which is a nice feature. That, however, coupled with the pointed thumb stud make it difficult, and at times painful, to open without using your other hand.Other than that, it is beautifully designed, the black finish is nice, the serrated edge is very useful, and the side of the blade is marked \\"Design by Ken Onion.\\" Very cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unless you require digital input, this is the BEST 15\\" panel","review":"Unless you require digital input interface,which I would recommend Eizo Nanao's L365, NEC's 1550M is by far the best in terms of image quality for the price.

Recently I noticed when I bought a replacement set, that they were made in Mexico. When I used a TDS meter to test the water, it went from 220 ppm (tap water) to about 187 ppm (filtered). I remembered getting much better results when testing the filtered water before. I believe that there is inadequate carbon inside the carbon filter to reduce total dissolved solids (chlorine, lead, mercury, etc.) One thing that is very evident is the redesign of the carbon filter -- it was a solid grey tube before -- now it looks just like the companion filter.

Conversational on one page, professorially pedantic on the next, straining throughout in its effort to contextualize all of Coltrane's work in the writings of Fela Sowande; this is not an especially fun or insightful read. The book's lack of focus extends to even the placement of photographs, which appear throughout the book with no relationship to the choronology of the text. The best passages are Cole's personal recollections of Coltrane, in particular his recount of Coltrane practicing with a friend in a hotel room. For those sections alone, the book is worthwhile for dedicated Coltrane fans. But newcomers to Coltrane about would do far better to pick up Eric Nisenson's \\"Ascension: John Coltrane and His Quest.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Hero-worshipper or Academic?","review":"I agree with other reviewers, that the author tries to be both a hero-worshipping spectator and a musical academician. The two do not always meet, and rarely reinforce each other. Given that his main subject was Miles Davis, it seems that his interest in Coltrane developed more as an ancillary \\"pop\\" infatuation, from just being in the jazz environment, than an academic interest.While I enjoyed the author's recounting of his many encounters with the jazz musicians of the 1950s and 60s, not a lot of light was shed on Trane's music beyond the attempt to make a rather superficial connection with its Nigerian roots. This is rather curious in itself since the author admitted not really understanding Trane's later more spiritual music.Given these concerns and the fact that the manuscript was rather sloppy written -- especially for a Phd student -- there is not much to recommend about this book.

What a great shaver! I provides me with the close shave I demand without skin irritation.Since it's rechargeable I can take it with me and the charge lasts about 1 week. One thing I found surprising is that the shaver just stopped while I was shaving with no warning. It doesn't slow down as the battery drains like you'd expect...it just stops. Keep that in mind and put it on the charger after a few days to keep this from happening.One improvement suggestion: It needs to have a low battery warning indicator.I highly recommend this shaver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phillips Norelco 7240XL Shaver","review":"I bought this for my son as his first shaver. He is happy with the closeness of the shave, rechargeabilty of the battery, he reported no problems or disappointments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very very nice indeed","review":"So this is my second shaver I bought first one was not a Phillips shaver it was actually CONAIR and it was bad it would hurt me when I shaved so for a while I would just use razors to shave but that was bad too, I didn't really cut myself all that much but my skin would just really hurt so I didn't like that so I tried this one and WOW AMAZING. Really nice shave doesn't hurt shaves very closely and skin doesn't irritate or anything just really really good. Everyone's skin is different however I highly recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs Low Charge Indicator","review":"My husband reports:I would buy this again because it gives me a comfortable, close shave. What I don't like is that there is no warning when the battery runs out of power. One moment you are shaving and the next you have to find the cord to complete your shave.It takes a good 8 hours to recharge the unit.My previous Norelcos charged in about 2 to 3 hours...but the copy did report this so I knew what I was getting into. It would be a good idea to just charge the razor every 8 - 10 days for the way I shave, you might need to charge it sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"close shave, easy to use","review":"This shaver can do a job almost same as the razor blade. At the area around mouth, it does a great job, if you let it go through a few times, also stretch the skin little bit, it does a clean cut as good as razor blade.At the area near the ears, it does not work as well as razor blade. So do not toss out the razor blade yet.It does a very close shave like razor in most part of the face, compared to other electrical shaving systems I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first electric shaver","review":"The shaver came with an instruction booklet--which I needed after 60+ years of soap and blade shaving--and the booklet suggested trying the razor for a week or two before deciding whether or not to keep the \\"shaving system\\". After ten days of using it, I decided to keep it, and now, after a month, I'm glad I did. The quality of shave is getting better and better, and apparently both my beard and I needed some training. It is easy to clean, and I'm getting three or more shaves out of each recharge of the batteries. The booklet suggests a removal and cleaning of the whirling cutters every month, and while the print in the booklet is big enough, the drawing showing the removal and replacement of the cutters is too small for me to interpret--a call to Norelco assured me they'd send a larger illustration--not yet received. Other than that--I like it a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUT OF THIS WORLD","review":"At first glance, this little gizmo resembles something from the plant Zrylon-5. I have only used it once so far, but it provides an incredibly gentle shave to the point where you barely know it's there. The tap-rinse feature is great, and I did not expect to find a trimmer too (not advertised). The only possible minor quirk is that it took me an extra minute or so to shave my neck, but the machine again was gentle. Overall, my first shave was as close as any I've ever had...really."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Battery life","review":"I bought this on Amazon for about 30 bucks. I was hoping to upgrade since replacment blades were almost as much as the razor itself. I also found it for $28 at Target. I am compelled to write to hopefully help some of you avoid this razor. The battery life is horrible....after removing it from the charger you can hear it lose RPMs by 3 days it sounds sickly. Maybe I just got a bad one, but bad is bad....and this razor is bad...when it cuts it does a great job, but the blades aren't compatable with my series 7 Noelco.....so I am stuck.....caveat emptor!7240"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works good. Aesthetically eh.","review":"I've been using it for eight months, now. It's quiet and comfortable. Produces a close shave without too much work.Not that I care, but aesthetically, this razor looks cheap compared to previous Norelcos that I've owned. The translucent plastic across the front doesn't really seem to match nor fit with the rest of the unit. It looks tacked-on.I'm bad about leaving my razor behind when I travel, so I keep one in my travel kit and swap them every time I charge the one at home. As an experiment, I purchased a similarly-priced Braun at the same time I got this one. The Norelco does a *far* better job than the other one.Enough difference that I'm here today to purchase a second one of these.Recommended. (One star off for being ugly)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice but needs a low battery indicator","review":"I have used several of these Norelco shavers over the past 30 years. My last one held up for nearly eight years. Compared to all my previous models, I was immediately impressed by how quiet this one is, yet it still gets the job done. I find other styles of shaver don't cut as close, at least not on my face. The only thing I do not care for is that I have no idea when the battery is low becuase there is no low battery indicator, like there was on my old one. Also, I like that this one can be rinsed out and cleaned under running water. So, on the plus side: it's quiet, it works well and is easy to clean. But minus one star for the possiblity that I might be caught one day on a weekend trip without the charger and the battery quits on me."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice shaver","review":"I really like the look of this shaver. Everyone that sees it inevitable picks it up to look at it. Does a great job shaving. Battery last for a really long time too. Only problem is that it is not as quiet as i expected. otherwise a great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"wait a sec. definitely not a 4.5 star.","review":"Out of the box, this was a disappointment. The motor was weak and it barely shaved any of my moustache. When I turned this on, it honestly felt and sounded like another shaver that's at 5% battery level. I was beginning to think that mine was just a defect but then decided against doing anything because the rotary type did not seem to be a good fit for me. I don't have a thick beard, and the shape of the shaver doesn't work well for cutting above the mouth hair.this looks ok, but it feels light and cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointing charge","review":"Philips Norelco 7240XL Cord/Cordless Rechargeable ShaverI purchased this shaver about 8 months ago from amazon to replace a Norelco that I had for about 5 years and finally would not hold a charge. This shaver cuts exceptionally good and I was extremely happy with it. I made sure to use it untill it was fully discharged and a charge would last approx. 1 week but after only 4 months, it would not hold a charge lasting only for 1 shave. Now I use it as a corded shaver only. It still gives probably the best shave I have had. but as a cordless shaver, I cannot reccomend it to anyone. Maby I just got a bad one, battery wise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weakest battery I have ever seen","review":"Not a bad razor as far as the shaving goes, but the battery is just awful. It takes 12 hours to charge and the charge dies very quickly (with no warning or charge indicator). If the shaver is left in a cold place, the battery essentially dies. This is a surprisingly bad battery for a reputable company like Philips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consult Your Physician Before Following This Book","review":"This book is dizzying and very disappointing. It is mostly a compilation of run on sentences. The summation on the back cover claims that Chasing the Gender Dream \\"has all the answers\\".

The author was SO OBSESSED with having a girl that after 2 sons she became fixated on conceiving her \\"Gender Dream\\".

After this, he shifted towards pop, huge commercial success and a scarily diminishing hairline. While the schmaltz factor is cranked up high, there are two songs here which any self-respecting AOR fan will lose their mind over. These songs are Wait On Love and Gina. It is still these two songs - far more than the ballads elsewhere - that cause my stomach to flip over at the memory of the girl I loved and lost. These songs soundtracked the heartwrenching collapse of a very volatile and emotionally charged relationship that I \\"enjoyed\\" in the mid-80s. Wait On Love is a real killer: a note of crazy optimism in Michael's lyrics as he explains how the right girl might always be just around the corner. Meanwhile, Gina is all busted heart and mad, lonely longing. I often cry when hearing both songs. And it's been a long time since \\"she\\" walked out of my life.
