He avoids the legends and uncorroborated stories about Bin Laden and sticks with only the facts he is able to confirm or which have a solid factual basis. This is the largest small book I have ever read. Dennis doesn't waste time puffing his adventures in pursuit of his quarry like some journalists do. Instead, he gets out of the camera's way and takes us on a narrated tour of Bin Laden's world and his political place in it. Told with flashes of hard-won insight into the Muslim world, this book is valuable for the student as well as the generalist. I particularly liked the way he related Muslim Brother Sayyid Qutb's ideas (d. 1966) to Bin Laden's own revolutionary program and his thoughtful discussion of Bin Laden vs. Iranian President Khatami's political thought. Excellent, original and well done!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"full of typos","review":"I'm surprised this has positive reviews at all. It is full of typos, especially in the exercises.

I do agree with the author though, that to be successful in weight loss, you must do your own thing. You cannot lose weight and keep it off unless you personalize it to your own needs.

The main focus of the book is to use your moments and minutes wisely; execute tasks with purpose and productivity; and never allow a situation to overtake you; just say \\"When.\\" You'll have to read the book to get that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maximize Your Moment","review":"I knew that this book would be a great read from the time that I was recommended to read it. The book arrived in a timely fashion and the condition was great as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most amazing, life-saving self help books I've read","review":"In this book, TD Jakes takes a very real approach, hitting on key life issues, in order to get the reader to live a more positive, goal-oriented life. I have read several self-help books and browsed many. TD Jakes real approach based upon his life experience, people he's dealt with in his ministry etc will make you want to re-read this book and keep it in your collection to refer to. He touches on major topics in our lives from the friends we keep to wasteful ways we may spend our time. I definitely recommend this book for readers of all ages and even for non-christians!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding collector's identification and value guide.","review":"Kathy and Don Lewis' Talking Toys Of The 20th Century provide an outstanding collector's identification and value guide, using small color photos to provide clear pictures of not only the toys, but the boxes which house them. An organization by toy publisher makes them quick to locate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good source","review":"When one looks for a collectors guide they are looking for an informed source. A truly good \\"guide\\" will show an item in it's mint, original state. This way one can tell if the item they own is in Mint, Good, or Poor condition. It is unfortunate that Ms. Eisenstein and others make excuses for the untidy and ragged condition of some of the dolls and toys in this book, and for the sorry state of the photography. It tells me that the authors did not feel that it was their job to find really great examples of things that are not that hard to find... It takes hard work and imagination for this, and I'm afraid these things are lacking."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Riveting Roller Coaster Ride","review":"If you like heart stopping, what-can-possibly-happen-next thrillers, you'll love this one. Move over Ludlum, Clancy and the other guys...Jim Turner's book is one of the best international thrillers I've read in a long time. Clever plot twists you haven't read elsewhere, a cast of intriguing and colorful characters, including those you'll love to love and those you'll love to hate, and an ending that will leave you hungry for more of James Houston Turner's writing, makes this book a great read! My suggestion: Don't start reading this book at 9:00 pm...you'll not be able to get up for work the next morning."},{"rating":"2","title":"extraordinary","review":"Antsy is an extraordinary song writer and performer. There is a wit and honesty in the music that is unique in the music business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes!","review":"I heard an interview with Antsy on NPR. He interviews very well, and the interviewer played some snippets of this CD, but they were apparently very carefully selected to disguise the overall stink of bad taste this CD emanates when you have the whole package in the house.The musicianship is fine, if uninspired. But the songs, the lyrics, while they were able to give the radio interviewer a few good seconds to air, those teasers only serve to cast the awfulness of this thing into bold relief. If you are thinking of buying this thing, ask yourself, \\"What would Jeff Foxworthy say?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of great tunes to gyrate to!","review":"A great collection of hits which are great to listen to or dance to"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing cd of a wonderful movie","review":"Loved the movie and the music. The CD however, does not have all the songs the movies does. It is very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full Monty CD","review":"It was a gift for my wife's birthday. She loved it. Great price and easy shipping options."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun, up-beat album","review":"A great mix of classic songs like \\"You Sexy Thing\\" by Hot Chocolate, and a great remake of \\"You can leave your hat on\\" by Tom Jones. There are also 2 tracks that are from the original score, composed by Anne Dudley. This is an album that will make you wanna get up and dance, with it's semi-camp 70's disco songs, and the final song may even get you to doing your own version of The Full Monty. Just make sure that the curtains are closed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie deserves a great soundtrack","review":"With a mix of rock and roll types from the 70's to the 80's, one can't help but like The Full Monty soundtrack. The original songs written for the movie are also wonderfully unique in their sound. And, with titles like \\"The Lunch Box Has Landed\\" how can one go wrong?! =) (The song is actually quite good). Though the redo of \\"Leave Your Hat On\\" isn't quite as good as the original, it does have a nice flair to it. A feel-good compilation! =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this before it disappears!","review":"If you are an erasure fan, you know that this is by far one of the most cherished and best CD singles the band has ever put out. \\"Drama!\\" is also one of their best B-sides even in remixed form. With mixes by Bob Kraushaar and Mark Saunders, the song with it's very impressive hook and bass line, is almost instantly addictive. \\"Sweet, Sweet Baby\\" had an underground following fora while, sampling off campy films such as Barbarella and Dark Star. This is a must have for any erasure fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Try, But I'm Looking For Quality","review":"While the poems aren't particularly well-written, my students did enjoy the few I read to them. I teach 2nd and 3rd graders and my team is working on finding songs, chants, and poems that correspond with state standards and our goals for the year. This book didn't have a lot to offer for that purpose. The poems are long and wordy. I am returning the book because I just don't think I'll use it enough. It's not something I would just add to my classroom library either because I'm not sure it would last long. There are small pictures worked into the text of the poem, but they aren't particularly exciting or interesting. The book is spiral bound, and not particularly well-constructed. I got a large chunk of the book twice, which made me wonder if I was also missing anything. I'm glad that someone is doing this -trying to engage students in math with poetry, but I hope that as more people do it the overall quality available will also improve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stops working","review":"I bought this adapter thinking it would answer my problems. It did, but only for a couple of months. Just stopped working like the nintendo one did."},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGEROUS!!!!!","review":"This power adapter is DANGEROUS!!! It worked really well for a few months... then it BLEW UP!!!! I was lucky that my four year old son and I were not close to the outlet when it blew and that it was not plugged into our gamecube.

The cord burned right off of the AC adapter.DO NOT BUY THE INTEC POWER ADAPTER!!!!I have added pictures so that you can see that I am not exaggerating."},{"rating":"2","title":"game cube adapter","review":"I bought this for my great grandson and he said the adapter worked quite well with his game cube."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid Intec...","review":"When I first bought this, it worked just fine. Then, a month or two (maybe three) I took my Gamecube to my aunts house and it wouldn't start up. I had to mess with it a little (I didn't do that before it started acting weird). When I got home, it was completely shot. I highly recommend NOT buying this! If you don't want to get another dud or a new system (a 360, Wii, or PS3), go straight to Nintendo and buy that."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!!!!","review":"I got a gamecube a year ago and I bought one of these. About 2 months after I bought it it broke. So I got online and got another one. After a few months this one broke. DO NOT BUY... GET ORIGANAL NINTENDO ADAPTER NOT INTEC!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly written, hard to read aloud","review":"I picked this book up because my son loves Bert, Elmo and Ernie. The story is fine, the pictures cute, but the text... I guess it proves the point that it is difficult to write children's books. The text is rhymed, but seems to lack any sort of meter or rhythm. It makes it very difficult to read out loud. My son seemed uninterested despite several readings, perhaps because the wording is so clunky and uninspired. I expected more from Children's Workshop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made in USA!","review":"I'm glad to see Domke is still making their stuff in the USA. This pouch is one of the only ones with fasteners arranged to attach to a bag strap in a vertical position, and also horizontally as on a belt. It has plenty of room for a larger flash unit and some batteries, or a whole mess of batteries, flash cards and accessories. Domke stuff is indestructible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chronicle of a King","review":"This show (on Broadway in 1976) is chock full of great moments, a \\"swan song\\" as it were for Richard Rodgers who has written some beautiful (but alas) seldom heard melodies. Some of the highlights include \\"No Song More Pleasing,\\" \\"As Once I Loved You,\\" \\"Away From You\\" and \\"So Much You Loved Me.\\" The show dramatizes events in the life of Henry the Eighth,including his divorce from Catherine of Aragon, who could not give him a son and Ann Boleyn who is beheaded after giving birth to a daughter and sustaining several miscarriages. The king's desperate need to continue the family line is the thrust of the show. Penny Fuller plays Ann Boleyn in the first act and her daughter, Elizabeth, in the second. As she has shown in previous recordings (such as Applause), she is vibrant, moving and powerful. Glenn Close plays Mary, Catherine's daughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even Richard Rodgers can write a turkey!","review":"After over 50 years of superb composing a man is allowed to write a stinker and Rodgers did. We can't blame his lyricist (the great Sheldon Harnick of Fiddler on the Roof fame) or any of the creative team. Maybe we can blame the idea of writing a musical about Henry VIII beheading his wives. In any case buy this only if you're a collector (like I) or just as a curiousity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hounds Guitarist still rips!","review":"Don Griffin is a rock and roll institution among Chicago Bar Bands of the 70/80's. His step into the National arena is long over-due. I was blown away by this incredible guitarist in the 70's, seeing him explode with The Hounds on the south side bar scene. Former Hounds Bassist-Joe Cuttone makes an appearance here as well. No comparisons needed, Don has been playing long enough to be an influence to the artist mentioned in other reviews. I consider myself lucky, I still have the Hounds two vinyl efforts and they still smoke to this day. Horses anyone? Buy all three of his cd's. They are a guitarists listening dream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I needed","review":"I looked at alot of undersink storage and decided to buy this one. It was not expensive (compared to most), it holds 13 cleaning bottles (which is alot), and the bottles fit under the disposal when sliding in and out. I actually haven't installed the braces to hold the slider rails in place - you almost don't need to, that's how well it works. I will ultimately install the braces because when you pull the drawer all the way out, it does tip forward slightly.I would definitely recommend this basket and will be purchasing more for the bathroom and the kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stacking rack","review":"This stacks longwise on top of Rubbermaid Slide 'N Stack Basket with Track. This was nice for me as I have a drain pipe that only allows me to utilize so much space under my kitchen sink. It is a bit narrower than necessary for my application, but works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed","review":"I needed something for under the kitchen sink. Ours is an old house and sometimes it's hard to make things work the way you'd like. After much measuring and web searching I decided on these sliding baskets rather than some of the more expensive items I found. I can't speak as to their sliding ability as yet--we need to replace the floor of the cabinet so we haven't bothered with \\"permanently\\" installing them. However, they make things so much simpler, even just sitting there. I'd had cardboard boxes in the cabinet. These make things so much easier to find. On top of that, the white plastic brightens the cabinet immensely. I need to get into another cabinet and do some more measuring. Hopefully, they'll work in there, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rubbermaid slide n stack basket","review":"Nothing exciting but exactly what I wanted and as described. Was packaged well and arrived on date it was supposed to.thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the money","review":"I got these to organize the storage containers in my kitchen. They work well, and the high sides keep things nicely in place. Only downside is that they only pull out about half the length, not as much access as I had hoped. Very easy to install."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle and emotional japanese novel","review":"I don't know whether it was the mood I was at when I read this book or the book itself, but this very simple, highly emotional japanese novel left a very good impression.I think Matsubara collects very well the subtlesness of Japanese culture and aesthetics and translates it into a story that is not only easy to read but also easy to fall for.I am a fan of Japanese literature, although I still find the work of some authors difficult to fully engage with. This is clearly not the case of Matusbara's \\"Cranes at Dusk\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"touching","review":"I first read this book as a teenager and have repeatedly reread it over the years, a sad but joyful book, melancholic nd touching. Loved it, would recommend it for anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frame's Autobiography?","review":"Okay, I have to confess that I haven't read past chapter three of this book. It may be a fine analysis of Van Til's thought, but to get to that you have to put up with Frame talking about himself. He is (if you believe what he writes) just about the only person who can really figure Van Til in the right way, he wrote a 125 page paper for Van Til, he wrote a negative review of Van Til's authorized biography that Van Til appreciated (he even told Frame so, so there!), Gary North talks about him in the introduction to one of his books, he was the kind of thinker that Van Til liked to challenge in class (because he was so smart, see?) etc. etc. etc. BLAH BLAH BLAH. Frame talks about himself to a ridiculous extent in this book. Helpful is the appendix where Frame briefly discusses each of Van Til's books. This is the only reason this book gets two stars. John, if I wanted to know your life story I'd ask."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird","review":"This is very weird, twisted stuff, but in a good sort of way. Can't think of another way to describe it, just stay far away from mindbending drugs while listening... the combination could be fatal."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pet Shop Boys B-Side","review":"Although catchy enough in its own right, this song reeks of missed opportunities. People rave about Johnny Marr being part of Electronic, but when Johnny Marr is known for being a jingle-jangle guitarist, his contributions to a bog-standard 126bpm dance track such as this could have been made by Fred the Milkman and you'd never know the difference. Similarly Bernard Sumner (of New Order) brings nothing to the track... and last, but not least, Pet Shop Boy Neil Tennant phones his vocal in, making the whole affair sound like a very shoddy Pet Shop Boys b-side. A waste of three talented individuals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout","review":"Great Workout, Ver nice Extras. I particularly liked the explanation of the Tai Chi Posture alignment"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! Essential Points Covered Here, Neglected Elsewhere","review":"For those of you who are not familiar with him, Dr. Jerry Alan Johnson is authentic and the genuine thing! Jerry has covered many points that are seldom mentioned or even not known by other instructors in the TAO YIN rules. Traditional Chinese Medicine makes a whole lot more sense when you review that section. He also covers cleansing, or releasing stagnant energy BEFORE starting the Chi Kung exercises."},{"rating":"2","title":"finally, the DVD","review":"I had this tape and played it so long, the tape wore out.. it's a great workout for beginners of chi kung and for teaching students.. unlike the postures of yoga or tai chi, chi kung is easy to learn and can be practiced anywhere for as long or short as you like.. the workout doesn't look strenuous but it will increase your energy, flexibility and internal organ strength.."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective","review":"I like the CD but it stops in the middle of the tape but I really like the movement of the exercise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not enough","review":"If you need a simple handbook for flute music, take it but must be aware that is not complete with all the modern music from XXth Cent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Artist, hard to find this CD","review":"I was lucky to attend a concert of the Harry Chapin Memorial Band which happens to include his daughter and the son-in-law he never met. I was so grateful to be able to purchase this cd on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"An essential book in my kitchen","review":"I buy the Cooking Light Annual Recipe collections religiously and each volume since 1997 occupies an easily accessible shelf in my kitchen. I still enjoy the magazine but these books are great for those nights when you want to do something different with the chicken (or whatever).After four months, I doubt this will be my most used volume. CL has gotten a bit fancier each year and I still turn to earlier volumes when I want a light version of everyday fare. What's really missing from this book (or their internet site) is a five star index. The book includes indexes for name, main ingredients and order of appearance. My wish -- an index by cuisine since I love Asian food.Bottom line: Not necessarily a book for dieters but a good resource for people seeking to eat and live in a healthy manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some real gems in here!","review":"I too subscribe to this wonderful magazine, and decided to try a year-end compendium of all of the recipes...I was a bit put off by the thin paper of the book and the lack of pictures, but the recipes are outstanding and the pages are packed with great ideas.

It just gives us a black screen on our machine. THQ was not helpful at all in trying to solve the problem, other than to send us an email to update our drivers (which didn't help). On a friend's XP machine it works just fine and the kids love to play it. The cars are hard to maneuver but the kids like the different arenas and secret places that unlock other arenas.I wouldn't recommend the game, based on the technical problems - we've also had problems with Velocity X, but not the older Hot Wheels games like Stunt track Drive 1 and 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"ReDye","review":"Re dyed a expensive dog collar that was fading. Applied the new red dye and everyone loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oral commentary of Guhyasamaja","review":"first, Geshe Tsephel is my teacher.The retreat which I received this empowerment for this practice was 7 days long. The commentary of this book provides supports for the short and middle lengths sadhanas by explaining the middle length. The commentary fills the gap between the sadhana and the actual practice. The commitments for this practice is 6 Guru Yoga Sessions a day. Different teachers have different requirements. It is highly recommended to have and do Vajrasattva purification (or Nungdro) practice for a couple years before receiving this empowerment. Allot of difficulties are removed by receiving the empowerment. Without it, the book will be very confusing and difficult to read n understand. Lastly, please get the empowerment before reading this excellent book. This book points the way to enlightment but the Guru is the start and finish of enlightment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Before you order this book . . . .","review":"This book is nice reading if you already know what the gun trade is about, but it gives only minimal information on the actual construction of firearms. Too much talk and crude drawings do not really promote this publication. If you're after a nuts-and-bolts handbook for firearms construction, don't buy this one, but start off with something simple. P.T.Luty's book would be a useful alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated by 20 Years","review":"The author of this book prides himself of not having a formal education and it shows. You will find no useful technical information necessary to safely design, build, and test firearms.What I didn't like about this book: Outdated information about firearms laws, hand drawn technical drawings (get a DELL dude), no information on new manufacturing technologies such as composite materials or CNC, total lack of technical information, single page on marketing of firearms. (There is more but I stop here)What I did like about this book: It has a shiny cover.If you are looking for real information on the engineering of firearms look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Bill Holmes","review":"To my mind, this is probably the best of Bill Holmes's books. Maybe because its stated goal is not to tell you exactly how to build one specific gun... a goal Holmes always seemed to fall short of. This book gives a good view of Holmes's character, a broad sample of the fruits of his impressive creativity, and yes there are lots of suggestions for trigger mechanisms and so forth that could actually prove useful. Most of the advice given about machinery selection is basically good. In my opinion Bill Holmes had a lot of failings as an author, but this book was definitely worthwhile to me. Though again, you cannot learn everything the title promises by reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Home Workshop Prototype Firearms","review":"In my opinion I should have bought this book first.This book has so much more to offer to first time Bill Holmes buyers. I beleave it will give the beginner a better view of Bills works. It still leaves things missing as in his other works but also leads you into an better understanding of what to expect. It offers a look at all his other guns and a deeper understanding of gun parts. I am a former marine and machine gunner. I have experianced alot of the guns Bill tries to create in some fashion and that experiance gives me a view of those parts Bill leaves out. So for all you guys that have trouble with Bills work its all about putting the missing puzzle pieces together. Look in other places and you will be enlightened to a world that is Bill Holmes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"Bought this for my rabbit when the seal on his old bottle stopped working and leaked continuously. Gave him a couple days to figure out the valve, and he simply couldn't. Testing it with my finger, I can see that it takes quite a bit of pressure and a few seconds to get any water out of it at all, and if it's pushed the wrong way, nothing happens at all. In addition, the end of the valve is shaped like the head of a nail, only a lot smaller, and that has to be painful to push on with a soft little tongue. Although I do like being able to fill it through the nice wide opening at the top, it's useless if my poor bunny can't drink from it. I'll be going back to a ball at the end instead of this awful thing. Not sure what they were thinking when they came up with it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"This is a huge waste of money! We bought this because we have never had any luck with water bottles for our guinea pigs, so when we saw this we thought for sure this was the answer to our problems, boy were we wrong!

I now have to change the bedding more frequently and am therefore spending even more money after buying this expensive piece of junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent historical footage","review":"This DVD is excellent. It gives clear information on the history and life of the Judo legend Mifune Sensei. If you are interested in history, kata, technique this dvd has it all.

It's real easy to get one to bite but not so easy to set the hook and reel it in, the fish always seem to get away.If you are good at working the controls and have a lot of patience, this game is for you. On the other hand if your patience level is low (like mine) it's very likely you'll set the game aside and play something else.As for the quiz section-you have 10 seconds to read the questions and answer. If you know alot about fishing you'll do fine.I recommend you RENT it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fisherman's Bad Club","review":"The game was on sale for [money] at a local store so I took a chance on it--most PS2 games are 20 or more. I would have had more fun folding my money into a paper airplane and throwing it out my car window.This was THE WORST GAME I have ever played. I have played other fising games that had more to give than this game. You can only select your casting location by going left and right (you can't move your cast in closer). To reel the fish in, just press the x button--not very realistic especially when the analog sticks could be used as a reel. You also have to keep turning the analog left or right, depending on which way the fish goes and the tension is too tricky.The game is not intuitive, the lures are not very easy to select, and most of the buttons on the controller are NOT used! The voice was bad, the music cheesy and the tourney took FOREVER. I had to quit after 15 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Really BAD","review":"Why do they keep coming out with more garbage fishing games?

I have to say that Mr. Alvarez can write, and he knows how to put words together. But he doesn't know how to write a story. I kept waiting for things to move together in a way that made for enjoyable reading, but all the time I kept thinking that Mr. Alvarez was writing for himself and not giving any thought to the reader. He lost me in his forced symbolism and his strained surrealism. I guess he's read too many Latin American novelists and he thinks that he's supposed to be mystical. I am sure he'll write a really wonderful short story collection someday, when he's thinking of his readers first. There are rules to writing stories. Mr. Alvarez should learn them. But, it was a good effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"An okay book","review":"I honestly did not see anything to rave about this book like some of the other reviews.

Not a bad book, but I really would not recommend the author to my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste...","review":"This book isn't worth the paper it's printed on. And all because it says: \\"for Experienced Programmers\\"... To clear it up: It's really a beginners guide! The first chapters explain what Delphi is. Then it tells what every menu-item in the IDE does. It explains some things about the Delphi types.If you're a beginner with Delphi and you've lost the original manual, then consider purchasing this book. Otherwise, it's just a waste of your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for programmer with light experience.","review":"I read this book as a transition from VB to Delphiabout a year ago while still in school.

For example the authors spend a paragraph explaining what an integer is!Furthermore, it doesn't get into the \\"nuts and bolts\\" at all. It is written on a very elementary level.Another annoying feature is the very frequent suggestion that the reader refer to the online reference for information on a topic. I would think that someone buys a book because he can't get the answers from the online reference. The authors also often refer you to another chapter in their book. It is as though they didn't care enough to organize their book properly.Spend your time and money elsewhere"},{"rating":"2","title":"Feral kitteh went badonkadonk","review":"My little 2 year old feral kitteh Spook got this for her birthday, which is TODAY.

This was only my third musical ever, having just played in school productions of \\"Carnival\\" and \\"Gypsy\\" as a green sophomore in high school. Somehow, our director contacted Jerome Moross to tell him of our production and he traveled to speak with us during one of our final dress rehearsals. What a thrill for a bunch of kids (albeit an unusually talented one - we had to be to pull this challenging show off!) to get to meet the actual composer of the show we were presenting! It made a tremendous impression on me and further fanned the theatrical flame that has carried me through 30 years of fun, friendships, and fulfillment in the theatre. The quality and editing of this recording is not what is should be -- but it exists, and that's reason enough to add this to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like \\"Road Apple\\"...","review":"I saw this show performed in Cambodia and I must say I liked it. So you could imagine my disappointment in this, the original cast recording. Frankly I expected more... a lot more. Usually the original cast is supposed to be the best. But the Cambodians put on a far better show I must say, with much more vocal range. I'd also like to know why \\"Spock's Brain\\" isn't on this CD? That was one piece I loved in the show I saw but for some reason it didn't seem make it onto this CD. Overall, I'd say it's a better idea to catch a plane to Cambodia and see their production than to throw your money away on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great News for Golden Apple/Jerome Moross fans","review":"The Golden Apple is probably my favorite show and I fell in love with it while hearing side 1 of the original LP. It's great to have it on CD. The \\"Great News\\" is that today (May 1, 2001) a CD has been released containing many Jerome Moross songs that have never before been recorded. It's the cast album from a Jerome Moross revue that played at Joe's Pub at The Public Theatre in Manhattan in Feb-Mar 2000. It features Alice Ripley, Richard Muenz, Jessica Molaskey, Philip Chaffin and Jennifer Giering and can be found by searching for \\"Windflowers\\" here at amazon.com. It includes many songs from Ballet Ballads (Moross's other collaboration with John Latouche, from 1948), and the unproduced Gentlemen, Be Seated.

He provides his non-textbook/detailed account from a heavily biased Roman Catholic perspective and dabbles in just as many geo-political historical facts as anything else. The book contains every possible Christianity-related character and -ism imaginable and dwells overly-long on early Catholic and medieval history and glances impassively over more recent developments. This reader can imagine only one kind of reader benefiting from the book, and that being a person who wants to collect facts to justify his/her spite of the Church and formal religion.

We are not Monophysites, and we believe in Christ's perfect and complete humanity. We rejected Chalcedon because of real concerns that it was allowing Nestorianism in through the back door, despite its condemnation of Nestorius. This is not a very scholarly work. Fr. V.C.

Not nearly as good as the $25 earphones that come with the IPod","review":"I listen to lots of classical music and wanted some quality earphones for my new IPod. In the $200 range the Shure E4 gets top reviews. Mine were a big disappointment. I thought my first pair was defective, and Shure generously exchanged them. The replacement pair was just a bad. The E4 series has very poor base and very harsh higher frequencies. Overall, these $200 earphones are much worse than the original $25 earphones that come with the IPod. Much worse. The sound produced by the E4 is marginally better than a cell phone. If you're not serious about music, and want something fancy to plug your ears with, the Shure earphones will do the job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent Sound but real quality problems","review":"I have owned a pair of these for the last 2 years and have had to send them back on 3 separate occasions.

It's outrageous that a pair of $170 headphones would short in 4 months, despite my careful care. I mostly just leave them at work, they hardly even travel. I thought the sound was good, though I'm no audiophile... and the ear attachments are plentiful with enough foam buds to fit any ear if you have the sense to get them in right. But to short completely like this is just absurd. Now I'll have to pay shipping to get it fixed... so angry! I'll never buy shure again, or any expensive ear buds for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound Quality....Lacks the POUND though","review":"When you're looking for quality and sound....Shure is it! Hands down, the most quality and dynamic sound I've ever heard in a headphone. Maybe its me and maybe I got an different model. I knew these were discontinued and I like the price but it seems they just lack that FUNK I was hoping to get via the bass!! For Hip-Hop/R&B; and some Contemporary Gospel, you need a strong bass line. What I had to do was adjust the levels in iTunes on my computer and PSP and so now I'm good!Worth the money? You bet!

The only problem i found is it an be a little frustrating finding the right earbud earpieces fit your ears properly. I bought these partially for working out.

Anyway, got my first, and the left earbud had a short. It was broken out of the box, but I still had to pay for FEDEX shipping back for repair. Last night, I got a brand new, factory sealed box with the buds. Opened, plugged in, and there is no sound in the left ear. I am furious, but given that I paid $200 or so for these, my only choice is to pay FEDEX to ship it right back. What horrible quality (although I admit the sound is good).

The SCL4 earphones sell for [...] cheaper and can be easily picked up new in the box on Ebay for [...] whereas I paid Ace Photo and Digital [...] for a pair of SCL4's.

Her personality and unpretentious love of wine shine through on every page. Additionally, she has created a framework for understanding wine that is easily comprehensible. The information she provides is not arcane and so detailed that, like after reading many wine books, I put it away and promptly forgot everything. Instead, she gives smart charts of information, comparisons of vital topics, and suggestions for wine tastings that really work to clarify the world of wine. This is a highly usable book, very readable, and one will come away with a high regard for its author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master Sommelier","review":"Andrea Immer Robinson is an excellent teacher on the art of wine. Her skill as a writer matches her skill as a master sommelier. This is an excellent book for anyone interested in exploring the world of wine. I'd also recommend Andrea's DVD, \\"Andrea's Complete Wine Course for Everyone.\\" It's a complete two-hour course that touches all the bases, from the basics, to ordering in restaurant, to great food pairings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for Beginners","review":"I knew very little about the wonderful world of wine before buying this book. I ma glad that I did! It is well written, easy to read and gives fantastic selection suggestions. Ms. Immer teaches you how to truly taste wine and proper wine vocab. to name a few. I have taken this book to the liquor/wine store many times and have never been disappointed. Great for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"This is such a great guide to wine and winetasting. It's perfect if you have a bunch of friends that also enjoy wine. I started out trying to do the tastings (part of every chapter) on my own, which started to get very expensive. I quickly learned that this is a perfect evening activity to do with a bunch of friends. Have each friend bring a bottle from her provided lists so that it's more affordable. Each chapter turns into another get together with friends and we go through them together. The tastings perfectly illustrate what she explains in the text and you'll be a connoisseur in no time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and fun","review":"Andrea Immer does a fantastic job of teaching the reader about wine in simple terms without snobbery and confusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too superficial","review":"I read the Italian wine section and I couldn't help but being disappointed by what I was reading. The author was very generic, superficial, and her approach to wines reminds me very much of that of a tourist who doesn't speak the language, takes only a ton of pictures, finds that life there is simply great, thinks that everything is a fairy tale, and doesn't even bother reading a guide (according to her \\"The Italians, with extremely rare exceptions, just do not care about the white wine\\" - my Lord! -, which is made \\"for export and for cheap, refreshing drinking during seaside holidays in Italy's stunninggly beautiful coastal towns\\". A vacationer to Capri couldn't have done better). On top of that, she doesn't really say anything new or insightful. A waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book - Written Simply","review":"At the start of her book, Andrea Immer promises it will be like no other wine book - and she delivers. This is a down-to-earth writing which brings the common man to a comfort level where he order from a wine list without sweating.The book's construction as part-course and part-antidotal is very smartly done. Immer offers some great tips about how to navigate your way through wine in store and restaurants and how to know one bottle from another. She encourages trying new things and offers a whole bunch of recommendations.The greatest thing, though is that she offers timeless lesson plans here. There is no list of essential wines to buy or drink, and she doesn't force here personal preferences on the reader.The one downside is that, to truly maximize enjoyment of this book, you need to invest in the wine tastings and comparisons spelled out inside - I suggest making this book a group activity."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best wine book I've read!","review":"Since catching the wine bug a few years ago, I've read five or six books that survey the world of wine. This one is my clear favorite. No one else does a better job of teaching you what to expect when you open up a bottle from a region or varietal you've never tried before. While most books provide lists of grapes and regions and expect you to memorize the style of wines made from each, Ms. Immer presents a system for predicting how a wine will taste based solely on information on the label and basic geographical knowledge. Her \\"Flavor Map\\" approach is innovative, intuitive, and highly accurate. I also thoroughly enjoy the tasting exercises, which offer a hands-on way to compare and contrast different styles. This is homework I can deal with!My only critique is that I would have liked to see more space devoted to grapes beyond the so-called Big Six. But this book is so good, I can't bring myself to take off a star for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charts & Maps Not Legible on Kindle","review":"My gripe with the book is not so much with the author, as it is with Amazon and publishers who sell a book as Kindle friendly when it is not. Charts and maps are so tiny that not even a magnifying glass makes them legible. Zooming in does no good. Any references in the text to the chart or map become meaningless. This leaves the reader in frustration and with a bad taste. If great wine can be made simple, why not the 'e' edition of a book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Cuts Hair","review":"Works fine.

I had received it as par of a PC game package, and I thoroughly loved it.Patricia Cornwell's novels are sometimes a bit tough to read. She starts getting all caught up in other things and eventually I get bored and wander off. The CSI novels, however, are fast paced, give you just enough to be interested, are easy to read, and give you good twists. It's not weighed down with a lot of complicated character development. There's just enough there to make you satisfied.This particular novel gives a great story with some interesting plot twists.

The authors traversed the french speaking half of Belgium and have uncovered a vast wealth of liquid gold....and reds, blonds and wheat coloured beers. Their enthusiasm for their task knew no bounds as they tracked down small family run brasseries in out of the way places that would do justice to the beerhunter himself, Michael Jackson. They have rated the beers using scales of their own tastes, as well as expectation for the tastes of others.Their descriptions of small unique breweries such as l'vapeur were captivating.One developed a severe thirst as one read.

I then got this bag, but really did not like the waxwear and color used for the strap and body strips. I couldn't care less about how it looks, but the strap and strips (in this light color) are far too prone to dirt and dust and the like. And making it worse is the waxwear finish, which you need to care for regularly and are not supposed to machine wash! So this bad has a strap and strips that are far more prone to dirt than my olive canvas F-5xb, but you're supposed to hand wash it. I don't have the time for that, so I sold this bag without using it much.That said, I do like the overall structure and layout of the bag--just not the finish and strap and strips."},{"rating":"2","title":"My EDC bag","review":"This Domke bag is my every day carry bag. The profile is slim and fairly compact but it carries a lot. The 803 carries all of the odds and ends that I use every day. When traveling I toss in my Kindle and a few extras and off I go. Love the look and feel of the waxwear finish. Would buy this bag again and again but I don't have to!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst purchase","review":"You can fit a couple lenses and a camera body and a few accessories in it. That is fine. But the material is stiff and unyielding. Putting things in and taking things out of this bag is a nightmare. The pockets are small, as they should be for a bag that is low profile and compact. But when I reach my fingers in the pockets to retrieve items the zippers scratch up my hands. I have small hands and simply taking out something as small as a rear lens cap is a big headache. I cannot stress how much I hate this bag. I never use it. It is good for transporting your stuff if you don't want a bulky bag to carry around. But I don't recommend it for using on a shoot because you will be fighting with it for your stuff the whole time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I am very picky with my camera bags, finally found one I love.

Very good service, products arrive as they should.Good company, online and by phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Waxwear finish is not for everyone","review":"While this bag looks great in terms of color, I hated the Waxwear finish. It rubs off on your hands when you touch it and also when you put something in the back slot such as a book or folder, the wax rubs on that. And if you put something that is rubber there, it will ruin that. I put my Apple iPad there with the Apple iPad case, which is black rubber and the wax rubbed against that and ruined it for good.The inside of the bag does not have the Waxwear finish so you don't have to worry about your equipment there however all of the pockets do have the wax and it can indeed rub off on whatever you place there.I returned this bag and got a standard canvas one of the same model and am much happier with that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bag for micro four thirds system","review":"Great bag, small size but big enough without being too noticeable. It's water resistant and looks great. Had to get the Domke shoulder pad but this really should be included with the bag at this price. It's somewhat durable...i say somewhat because a corner of the velcro on one of the pockets came loose (just a little thread) but superglue remedied that right quick. Come on Domke, this is made in USA and i'm trying to support US products but more quality control needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh????","review":"I have absolutely no idea what the point of this book is...yes, it is very atmospheric, but an explanation of some sort as to what is actually going on would be nice.

Please spare the \\"these are the same people who don't appreciate abstract art\\" comments. This is a bad book. A really, really bad book. Do not buy this. I didn't even pay for my copy and I want a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"TROUBLING","review":"What's troubling about this novel isn't the story (which begins with sinister potential). It's how the writer, inexplicably, changes course and takes the reader down a path impossible to negotiate. While I don't appreciate the spiteful tone of some of the other reviewers here (we are supposed to be book \\"lovers,\\" people), I have to say this book is not deserving of a favorable mention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was really disappointed with this author. I love horror above all other genres and I really expected something better based on the first paragraph of \\"Ordinary Horror\\". I'm only rating this book 2 stars because at least Searcy knows how to use the English language. But he was overly descriptive at some points, and quite often for no reason. Searcy did at least keep up the feeling of dread throughout much of the book, but that just made it all the more disappointing when nothing happened. I keep thinking that maybe I missed something - all I can think is that the plants somehow drove everyone crazy and that's supposed to be the horrorific bit of it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deliberately Obtuse; Should just be called \\"Ordinary\\"","review":"I was very much looking forward to this book--it sounded so good. But as I read--and waited for something to happen--it became apparent I had made a poor choice. Nothing ever did happen. If I am wrong and something did, it was on pages my book was missing. Though it opens up the door for questions on my intelligence (go ahead, I am secure in my mental capabilities) I must say that I am not sure *what happened* in this book. I actually went online to see what others' takes were on it, to make my reading seem less like a waste of time. Instead of a plot the writer seemed to attempt to write of things quotidian--and try to make them sinister. I would read parts over to see what word I had missed that would explain the sequence--but there was nothing. Utterly incomprehensible. Someone earlier wrote--in the course of praising the book!--that he did not remember the book well. That would be because there was nothing to remember."},{"rating":"1","title":"SMELLS LIKE BAD WRITING","review":"I can't remember the last time I was so repelled by a novel.

This is one seriously tiring tome."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXCRUTIATING","review":"Everyone's a critic, but...this book was mind-numbing in its absurb detail and lack of coherent plotting.It started off so promising...I was so ready to like this book. The more convoluted it got...the more bored I got. By the end, the writing was just annoying, indulgent and stupid.Sorry...but this one's not at all worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Ordinary, It's Horrible...","review":"At about page 150 of this 230-page \\"horror\\" novel, I began to wonder if I was the victim of some terrible joke played by the author and publishing company, namely, that nothing horrible was going to happen. Oh, wait. At one point, the protagonist locks his keys inside his car.That's about as close to horror as this book comes. Clearly, a number of people who have already reviewed the it enjoy the writing style. I didn't. Paragraph after paragraph of descriptive prose, each between half a page to two pages in length, pushed the limits of my patience. And the almost total lack of dialogue or action didn't help, either.I wish the book had contained an actual horror story to support all the verbiage. As it stands, this feels like a 50-page short story, padded out to the length of a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"LIKE WATCHING BLOOD DRY","review":"I rarely write reviews of anything, but it's only right someone warn the uninitiated about this god awful thing.\\"Ordinary Horror\\" is bad on many levels. \\"Professor\\" Searcy reminds me of a failed writing professor trying too hard to impress. I'll spare you the details (something I wish he would have done) and tell you this is the most confounding, unexciting, poorly written novel I've read in years. Beware, alright.(Note: The title evokes the remarkably good \\"Ordinary People\\" from back in the 70's. This book isn't even in the same league.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORROR?

The first few pages were well-written and promised an eerie story that would creep up on the reader. However, by the time I got a third of the way through the book I became increasingly aggravated with the obliqueness, lack of affect of the protagonist, and minimal plot. Halfway through I just wanted to skip to the end and find out if ANYTHING happened. Basically, Ordinary Horror would have made a pretty good short story but is an extraordinarily dull novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"where did the plot go?","review":"i agree with the prior reviewers that the story starts with promise. an elderly widower orders a strange plant to help rid his garden of gophers, and what starts as a promising story of the strange effect of these plants on the neighborhood (or is it all in his mind?)soon turns into a story full of the beginnings of menace and horror which NEVER pay off. i kept waiting for something happen and nothing ever did. save your money....my copy of this book ended up in a trashcan @ the airport."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point!!!","review":"I am a stubborn reader...if I buy the book I am going to finish it.

But maybe that's the point.....This is a small book - just over 200 pages - but it took me nearly 10 days to read it - and I kept re-reading sections to make sure I hadn't missed something really devastating. I do not recommend this book - although the writing is probably very good. I don't read books for the writing, but for entertainment value - and believe me - there is nothing entertaining about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.","review":"Having read rave reviews of this debut novel, I was eager to dig in. What a disappointment. I'm embarrassed to say I read the entire thing simply hoping to see if something interesting would happen or if the vague imagery would actually take me somewhere. I am a huge fan of Shirley Jackson and Raymond Carver - two authors to whom Searcy is compared - and the comparison is an insult. Searcy's blurry mess of suburban snapshots is horrifying only in the sense of how unsatisfying and pointless it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAJOR letdown","review":"Bought this as soon as I heard it was out.

The best way to describe it is cloudy and blotchy. Images that are sharp and smooth on my home TV are rough and blocky. There are a few games that I can't even play at all becuause you can't see enough detail or read text. I made sure everything is hooked up right and adjusted the color and brightness, so it's not user error. And the S Video cable doesn't make it any better.

What fabulous entertainment! Great writing, wonderful situations, excellent acting by all the cast, and the genius of Phil Silvers are jam-packed into every show. All the right ingredients came together at just the right time in the right place. There was a lot of integrity, sincerity and love put into those shows--a big difference from the assembly-line stuff of today's shows.Sgt.

Unfortunately, this work is almost a line by line back and forth between the actual work and the commentary. It was almost unreadable due to the proximity of the commentary to the text and definitely lacking, in terms of the actual translation. There was also way too much of a focus on apologetics to the western (Christian) world. The work would have been better if it had not gone out of its way to make sure it did not offend Christian sensibilites, and make itself into nothing more than a treatise on eastern philosophy.

The 150 easy recipes include a tantalizing tomato bisque soup, a unique Ozark pudding, and a to-die-for Boppin' John (traditional New Year's Day dinner down South). Using the free and clean energy of the sun will appeal to anyone hoping to be more environmentally responsible. Not only do Anderson and Palkovic teach neonates like me how to construct a solar oven (out of tin foil, cardboard, newspapers, and glass!), but the book also lists places where I can order such ovens. As for me, I'll be taking the solar cooker and a copy of Cooking with Sunshine to the Mississippi River beaches this summer. Bon appetit."},{"rating":"2","title":"How and Why?","review":"Just picked up the book yesterday and read it from cover to cover last night. Great opening section about how solar cooking works.

Perfect reading level for young adults, or younger children with adult guidance. Ideal for discussion with those of an age where going to church, at times, may feel more like a burden than a privilege. Learning how others willing gave their lives for their faith, should stengthen an appreciation for privileges often taken for granted today. Could be used for book club reading for a church youth group - read a chapter and discuss. Adults can also learn from these tales. Could we, with God's grace, face similar challenges with such bravery? What challenges to our faith do we face today, not nearly as threatening as the gallows, and how do we respond . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Going past known limits","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. It gives you the ground-level stories of Ranger School from ten men who survived the experience and pushed past their mental and physical limits to graduate. Those ten stories are not only enjoyable, they are often surprising. For example, one mentioned an experience where he dug some food out of a trash can when he was ordered to sick call because of the horrible condition of his feet. I was shocked that Ranger students often operate on one or two hours of sleep (and 1 1/2 meals per day)for weeks at a time.

Brace Barber examines the complexities of Leadership and shows everyone how it is teamwork, team building and faith that makes a great leader. By Far the best book on leadership for the Corporate and Military world I have ever read. You do not need to be in or have served in the military to learn something from this book. For those who equate military leadership with not having anything to do with the corporate world, you are sadly mistaken. I have paralelled my personal corporate and military experiences with those that Brace has written into his book and I was amazed by the similarities and the lessons I learned through them. In some cases the lesson I have learned was to make better choices in my leadership style. A real Leader is also the Servant to those being led.

Tony Levin plays bass on all but one track, & is well suited to Andy's unique style of guitar playing. Greg Bissonette plays drums on most tracks. Only the first song is reserved for Andy's touring band- it is an earlier song of Andy's called \\"Big Thing\\"- and the band rips through it live. I even hear a little \\"Sunshine of Your Love\\" thrown in for good measure. The cd is half new compositions from Andy, and half Jazz covers.

As I got better I replaced the amp but the guitar is still works great. Although, The wammy bar is terrible to say the least. It is much harder to push down and i dont even use the thing anymore.

Sadly, you might just have to hear this album for yourself if your morbid curiousity peaks high enough. This live cd is a manifestation of everything that is wrong with reggae: overzealous, cheesy and too eager to please. No originality makes you feel sad for the state of reggae and makes you cringe that some people have gone out to enjoy this band. We can only hope that the crowd noises are overlaid or just that they are random drunk interjections. If neither of these are the case then abandon all hope if you enter the jazzhaus, for it is the land where musical integrity is thrown out the window."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absolute Classic","review":"This book is truly an inspiration.

Even a quick listen to some early Kitaro would have helped. But alas we have a CD that \\"Music from the Hearts of Space\\" wouldn't touch.

I was very happy to find this book at all since I have just begun working at a day center program for persons with Alzheimers and dementia. This book is full of practical advice on the many ways and reasons we talk to persons with dementia and in that way, the book is extremely valuable. However, the overall emphasis of the examples is on what NOT to do, which is very frustrating. One of the reasons people seek out such a book in the first place is that they have already had some communicative breakdown and they are looking for ways to fix it, not more lists of what not to do. We already know what doesn't work. We want to know what does work. That said, please know that there is a wonderful small section with a parallel list of Don'ts and Do's near the end of the book.

Not only is it boring, it's embarrassingly logically flawed. This is just another Christian with an agenda trying to make money by selling things to gullible followers. I'm sorry if you find that offensive but there is no other explanation. And as a student of philosophy I find it highly offensive when theologians call themselves philosophers. No one who cares that what they write is true could ever possibly have written this book. It's just absurd and insulting and not even entertaining. If you can avoid this book, do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Girard at his most brilliant","review":"Over the course of his long career, Girard has moved from literary criticism to anthropology to Biblical exegesis. This work of comparative religion sees him at his clearest and most brilliant as he compares the Gospel readings of violence to mythological interpretations that conceal the role mimetic desire plays in our conflicts. Especially revealing is a late chapter on \\"the concern for victims,\\" the absolute value of modern culture. But it is in the book's final pages, where Girard finally postulates the existence of a power superior to violent contagion, that I See Satan Fall Like Lightning becomes truly great. This is a work of superb intelligence, among the most powerful and thought-provoking I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stereotypical Mish Mash","review":"I could not even get all the way through this film because of the poor acting skills of the leads...To begin with the actor who plays David (Eben Gordon) looks twenty six and not sixteen and Rob Morretti (Kenny) is flat and achingly dull in the role as teacher/seducer. So much of the content was stereotypical and almost comedic such as the mom (who is a boozer) who hides her stash in the toilet tank or Kenny putting his hand on David's shoulder and uttering that old cliche \\"if you need someone to talk to\\" There are so many great gay films out there, however, this is not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIDNT LIKE IT","review":"Its not that good of a movie, maybe for watching one time.

Rob Morretti directed an autobiographical movie about a slimy actor turned drama coach who seduces one of his teenage students, leading the boy into a dark world of sex and drugs. In a twisted move, Morretti, who in real life was the student, plays the teacher in the film. With the possible exception of the teacher's friend and sort-of conscience, there is not a single likeable or sympathetic character in sight. The production values are bad, the acting pretty awful, the writing is trite. Perhaps the film provided therapy for the director, but I can't imagine any other reason for its existence.Don't make the mistake of buying this movie, like I did. Don't even bother to rent it, or watch it for free at a friend's house. It isn't worth the time. All you'll get from watching it is a bad taste in your mouth. Avoid at all cost!"},{"rating":"2","title":"RCA Victor 80th Anniverary","review":"This product is superb if you have a range of interests, e.g. the evolution of: - arrangement of music, big bands, and the recording of music. In the early recordings from 1917, you can sense the recording engineers trying to eke out the best from their equipment, up to the 50's, 60's, and onwards where they could record the instruments to sound as though they were in the same room as you. The album has some good jazz classics, and big historical names as far as jazz is concerned. While you enjoy the good big band music, listen...listen and pick out your favourite musical instrument as it is being played, or your favourite artiste as he/she plays.

Almost everyone in my class who has this book has had problems with hundreds of pages falling out (these books were all purchased new and not used).Furthermore, if you like concrete examples and not simply proofs followed by convoluted explanations, then this is not the book for you. The general feel of this book is very unprofessional and it looks like the author typed it in Microsoft Word, added some poorly drawn pictures, and called it good.

Though I don't own the flip-up screen, there is also room for that.Since it's a hard case with dense foam lining, there really isn't too much danger that you'll damage anything inside it, and it's size makes a great footrest when you're not using it :-)The only thing I would warn against is trying to fit 4 wavebirds in the case at once - the pocket for controllers is nice, but it's designed to hold 4 of the standard controllers, not the slightly larger wavebirds. If I did own a fourth wavebird, I doubt I'd be able to cram it into the case without some serious effort (if at all).Overall though, this is one of the most accomadating and durable gamecube cases I've seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!!!","review":"This game case does not look like much at first but wait until you try it.

One of the lines is constantly displaying the current folder number, track number, and time, leaving only one line for navigation and displaying artist, album, and track. Navigating the folders is very clumsy and the limited characters per line can make finding a track by name difficult. The scrolling of the ID3 info on the one line is slow and hard to read at times. This unit also has trouble reading several types of CDRs. It was able to read Kodak Golds fine, but the blue Imation CDRs were unreadable by the MP3 player, but could be read fine by a PC. Overall I suggest finding a unit with a larger LCD display and better capabilities of reading all brands of CDRs. The one positive I find about this unit is the included extras.

While many other reviewers figured out and posted a bunch of \\"rules\\" to get the player to work right, I didn't really care too much. The rules were much too much for me to deal with. On top of that, the LCD screen is poorly lit and unhelpful, with its undecipherable little codes. The controls on the player were also a real bother to work with.

The fact that it is limited to only 200 songs is a major drawback, since I can fit three times that amount on a CD. There was no limit listed anywhere on the package, manual, or online. That was bad enough, but there was a disturbing glith in the audio every 30 seconds or so, on both MP3's and CDs (even store bought).

Also, I have the proclaimed \\"suffix A\\" model, and it is still a sorry machine. Just using it at home with the adapter I haven't had problems, but it also skipped very bad when I was running and had batteries in it. I would reccommend this product if you only want something to hook up to your home system. Otherwise...wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great unit with some flaws","review":"For the price that I got (under $40) it was a very nice unit. I've had the unit for over six months now and so far, only some skipping occur, but not much at all. The skippings usually seem quite random, and doesn't happen because th eunit is being moved or anything like that. The unit I have contians the suffix A sticker.The car kit that came with mine, though, is a little weird. At times the volume will be too soft for no reason, but mostly they all worked great.The only things I really don't like about this unit are 1) the display LCD isn't backlit, making reading practically impossible at night, and 2) the search option is not very user friendly, and the unit doesn't seem to respond too well to it.Over all, I give it 4 stars, for its price, and that it hadn't died on me yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio cd file yes, mp3 no","review":"This unit skips mp3's in various places.

Overall I am pretty pleased with it, especially given that it came with kit components.I'm slightly disappointed by the fact that the player always plays MP3 tracks in alphabetical order for a given folder (not counting when it's set to random), so when I listen to a folder with tracks from a symphony or soundtrack, they don't play in the order they were ripped.Of course I could append a track number to the name of the file before burning MP3 CDs, but I'd prefer to be able to set the player to process by file creation date (i.e., track order as ripped) or alphabetically.I've sent e-mail to Memorex's customer support with this question, so we'll see what they say."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing is terrible","review":"I bought this becuase t had positive reviews and I can't help but think they were planted.

Some songs would stop in the middle and refuse to continue until the fast forward button was pressed to skip over the defective section. And finally, the quality of the sound was not up to par. The same songs played on my Rio PMPs 300 were fabulous by comparison. All the songs that refused to play well on the Memorex played perfectly on my computer.

The ESP works fine. The only thing that matters is that your songs are encoded at 128-192 KB/s; over that, it just stops playing. Also, the VBR format is not well supported. After that, it works fine. The random mode is also a nice feature in MP3 mode.. I should say that a Resume feature would be very appreciable, and that the searches should be easier than that. WMA support is also something that lacks. All my songs were in VBR format, so before making the MP3-CDs, I put them in constant bitrate (128bit) and then it reads all my songs perfectly.

Unfortunately, the unit did not live up to my expectations. It is heavier and bulkier then it needs to be, and the construction seems flimsy. The MP3 functionality is extremely picky in terms of files and CD's that it will read. First I thought it was me, but after reading other people's experiences I realized it was the unit. Manual is worthless, and the manufacturers web site offered no help. I returned the player and invested a little more in the Sonicblue Rio Volt. Boy am I happy I did!

The player will skip and stammer all the way through these tracks. DOn't waste your money. You can get something better for very little more. Hard to find specifications on these portable players.

I'm spending more money next time and getting something decent."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was so-so inside, but failed the car test.","review":"The MPD8505CP seemed to work OK when I tested it inside, albeit with a few skips here and there. Unfortunately, when I tried it in the car the skips grew much more frequent. Even during smooth highway driving I could expect a skip in almost every song. Inclines in the road seemed to cause the player even more problems. I might have kept it if I was planning to use it in the house instead of the car, but I returned it since car performance was my main concern. The MPD8505CP soured me on CD-based MP3 players, so I decided to go with the Nomad Jukebox instead.

It works good as a cd player and it never has skipped on me. The mp3 cds can hold ver 100 songs and are VERY COOL!!!! un fortunatly, some of my mp3 files didn't play through the cd player, and some didnt even show up on the display. It is kind of difficult to make a cd and get it formatted right. Several of the cds i made didnt work at all, and it took several tries to get my first mp3 cd working, but once i did it was very usefull. The text search feature is kind of cool but i never use it. When u can get an mp3 cd to work it is very cool but it is kind of hard. RThe manual sucks. The cd player is kind of bulky so i wouldnt try jogging with it. but most mp3 cd players are pretty big. It gets scratched easily so watch out. but overall it is very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had higher expectations of product","review":"Despite the fact that this CD player comes with a car kit, and is explicitly labeled with a 45-second anti-skip protection, its performance is very poor in a moving car.

The volume became fixed and unresponsive despite no trauma and no exposure to heat, cold, etc. It skips- often. The buttons are perfect for bumping into when working out. It shuts off spontaneously in the middle of playback even with fresh batteries and a well-burned CD-R. Needless to say, Memorex has refined technology right up to the point where it breaks down past the 90 day warranty. Do NOT buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a pleasing experience","review":"I was very unhappy with this product for the followig reasons:The anti shock protection was very weak, specially when playing regular music CDs (as opposed to MP3 CDs).The unit froze up and stopped working after only 2 hours of use. During the time it did work it proved itself to be a rather bulky, non user-friendly unit.I do not recommend this player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good after all...","review":"(note: I'm on my second one, I exchanged it after a while) It played good at first, but then dropped off real fast. The MP3 feature would sometimes blow a big high pitched skip sound, which is very disturbing. Now it skips a lot. Both MP3 CDs and Audio CDs. Plus, when is skips with the \\"ESP\\" on, it causes it to halt for a about 20 seconds. Sometimes it will halt, and never come back.I work with MP3 often, and honestly, I don't think this MP3 CD technology is very good. I can listen to a song on an MP3 CD, and then listen to the song on an Audio CD, and the MP3 version sounds really muffled. This isn't so listening on a computer.Maybe another would be better, but I'd suggest staying away from MP3 CD players for a few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Memorex MPD8505CP Portable MP3-CD Player","review":"Don't buy this unit. The claimed anti-skip feature doesn't work, whether you're sitting on your couch or driving in your car. The unit is also flimsy and cheaply put together. Memorex claims to have fixed the anti-skip problems in units manufactured after December 2000. Not so. I purchased mine from Amazon in June 2001, so even the units they're sending out right now haven't improved. Memorex has some work to do on improving this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did it ever make it to the market?","review":"I am absolutely disappointed with every aspect of this player. I am an engineer myself, and I agree with other reviewers that Memorex skip the testing phase of the design process. This unit is FULL of engineering flaws... What MP3 player can't support >128kps, or VBR??? I am more curious to know how Memorex designed the button-layout of this unit, did some just randomly picked out the position where each button goes? They are not friendly at all. This unit skips more often than a $15 cheap CD player, not because someone bumped it, but because of hardware/software bugs. And what a battery eater, a fresh set of Duracell Ultras, runs only about 3.5 - 4 hrs... My Panasonic CD player last 6 to 7 times longer on a same set of battery. This unit looks cheap, cost cheap, and performs cheap as well... I guess you do get what you pay for. I'd stick with my solid-state MP3 players for now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For Real...","review":"This would have been a book better left in French. I have been a student of metaphysics for over 25 years and this book is just too unnecessarily difficult. I don't know if it is a bad translation, the author is full of himself or I am upset that it was required reading for a Master's level Communications class on Content Distribution and the professor still has not made a connect to the book and the outcome of the class. There are many other books that explain this concept in simplier terms. The concept is excellent and I agree with much of what he said, but it was just too complicated to get to the bottom line.

Going through it again I find myself having the same reservations, Baudrillard's style is overly dependent on these really repetitive, almost cheekily nihilistic assertions. And while his in-your-face style is provocative, ultimately, it just amounts to an aweful lot of empty rhetoric about how totally empty everything is. A lot of it just seems like stuff he read and regurgitated from Deleuze and Foucault and then mixed up with his own sense of cheap posturing. Also, the second half feels incredibly dated with its cheap analysis of late cold-war tensions and half-assed attempts to synthesize a 4th grade level understanding of genetics and emerging cybernetic jargon into his broader system of thought, or anti-system of thought, or whatever it is he thinks he's doing here.

But whose inspiration was it to publish these thousand or so words as a midget book? Did she, or some editor, really think the basic premise -- that perfection cannot be attained -- so original and profound that it merits this treatment? Sorry to say, it does not. It would make a nice commencement address (and apparently it once did), and a very nice newspaper or magazine column. And that's about it. The point has already been made, by many others, often with much greater eloquence. That doesn't detract from its basic validity, of course, but there is no reason to spend good money to read it here. Check it out from your local library. Or don't even bother -- read it at the shelf.

And this isn't even Quindlen's first offense of this nature!!! She did the same thing with A Short Guide to A Happy Life (with the emphasis being on \\"short\\"). There is nothing in here you can't find somewhere else for considerably less money or for free. I literally read the entire book while eating lunch! I used to like Quindlen, but think her writing has gone steadily downhill. (I thought her novel Rise and Shine was horrible. But at least you got over 200 pages!)

Based on reviews, I couldn't wait to get this book. Don't let the 48 pages fool you...half of the pages are pictures, and the half with writing on them are double-spaced with wide margins. Took me all of 20 minutes to read (and only that long because of all the page turning). Nothing wrong with being concise....except that the philosophy here is overly simplified. Quindlen goes to great lengths to equate \\"Pefection\\" with \\"Conformity\\" and condemning it as inauthentic. I do believe that women tend to set unrealistic expectations for themselves (i.e., wanting to be the perfect mother, perfect daughter, perfect wife, perfect businesswoman); therefore, it creates warm, fuzzy feelings to hear someone criticize perfection as being \\"boring\\". Unfortunately, to claim that \\"[well-behaved women] don't make good lawyers....or businesswomen\\" just doesn't follow. This is not deep reading. 20 minutes?

Although I love Anna Quindlen's columns and novels, this book warning about the displeasures of perfection is not worthy of hardcover treatment -- it should be one in a collection of essays. There is nothing here that has not not been said before, many times before by others, some even more eloquent than Quindlen.

Goldsmith establishes soaring wildnerness melodies, than lets the music dissolve into primative percussion attacks. The thundering build of \\"Deadfall\\" will just about wring you out! (Watch this scene in the movie and notices how much Goldsmith's powerhouse attack contributes to the sequence's success). The final track adds a new layer to an already intricate album: a rhytmn jazz reading of the main title.

Men who oppose political correctness or question placing women in combat are, ipso facto, sexist/racist/homophobic hypocrites, and probably rapists and murderers too. No doubt it makes life easier to see things this way, but it doesn't leave room for a well-crafted novel. (For example, feel free to skip over Chapter 21 entirely. It's an anti-Republican screed that adds almost nothing to the storyline.)Truscott's background and experience allow him to create a vivid atmospheric portrait of the federal academy setting. However, the statues on the Plain are more three-dimensional than the characters in this novel. For a responsible (non-fiction) balance to Truscott's political agenda, I recommend 'The Kinder, Gentler Military' by Stephanie Gutmann (Scribner, 2000)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read and a look at the institution","review":"As a grad of USMA I thought this book was an interesting look at the Academy. I notice that other 'reviewers' disagree about how realistic it is. Well, that depends on one's experience while a cadet, but I try to remember when I read fiction that it's just that. So if you want a book about West Point with a relatively exciting plot, this is a good one. Another good one is THE LINE by Bob McGuire as an earlier reviewer noted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple-minded propaganda.","review":"Andrew Rogers' review (see below) is dead-on. I give this book 4 stars for excellent insights into West Point traditions and history, then subtract 3 stars for the blatant propaganda in favor of women in combat. Truscott's thesis is simple: West Point is better than it used to be, not in spite of the presence of female cadets -- but BECAUSE of it. Why, it'll be even better when the Commandant and Superintendent are women, not to mention all the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Why? Don't ask, just believe it. Mr. Rogers is right: skip this fiction and read the facts in Stephanie Guttman's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had potential but fell short of expectations","review":"The plot is imaginative enough, but Truscott just didn't write a good enough story to go with it. He should of kept his politics to a bare minimum and focused on developing a more exciting and interesting story instead. If you want to read a good mystery novel, try one by Stephen Frey or Linda Fairstein."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Fooled! This Is NOT Realistic!!","review":"Lucian Truscott IV proves again what some TV talk show hosts prove every day - some people have to resort to sensationalist trash to get attention. This book bears absolutely no resemblence to actual life at West Point (I should know, I graduated from the Academy).

Don't waste your time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"so bad I returned the book","review":"I bought this book while stationed in Korea. I enjoyed reading \\"Dress Gray\\" while I was a cadet and I was excited to see that Truscott had written a sequel.

I am tired of books that insinuate that women at a mostly male school equals a scandal. See also, \\"A General's Daughter.\\" Hey guess what--I was a female cadet in my opinion and West Point isn't some mysterious old boy network where crimes get shoved under the rug--it goes completely against the principles that the academy stands for.Don't waste your time on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cable, especially for the price","review":"I needed this cable to pull down an HD signal- our TV is poorly placed, so we have to position the antenna all the way across the floor.

Great!Only 4 weeks LATER they called to say they can't replace it, they're out of stock, they will 'buy it back' from us. Gosh, they have them on their web site, but they can't ship one. Turns out, it will take 6-8 WEEKS to process our return, in addition to the week to ship the mailer, and the 4 weeks we've waited for the replacement to begin with.13 weeks is supposed to be 'hassle-free' replacement ??I will -NEVER- buy another kitchen-aid product, and I will encourage everyone to realize that their 'hassle-free replacement warranty' is absolutely worthless!!! Totally false advertising!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"careful to buy","review":"i purchased the hand blender and was so excited. however i used it 3 x and somehow stopped working. it doesnt work anymore. smoke started coming out, i dont know why. good thing it happened early so i was able to call the company and they will issue another one under 1 yr warranty. warranty should be longer than 1 yr. just like the cuisinart. oh well. i recommend using the product quickly and see it doesnt wear out."},{"rating":"2","title":"So glad I bought it","review":"I absolutely love the product. It is easy to use and easy to clean. It comes with so many attachments, whisks, chopper, blender etc. I find that I am cooking more at home these days as a result. This works so great, I may be able to get rid of some of my other appliances. If you have been looking for a hand blender, this is the one. Don't give it another thought, just buy it. Also, I found the price on Amazon to be a few dollars cheaper than the price it was going for on Macys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product.","review":"My husband was looking at Kitchenaid immersion blenders when I ran across this set. I bought it for him for his birthday but I ended up being the first one to use it. I love the chopper attachment. The first time I used it I chopped broccoli and turkey for a turkey/broccoli braid and then chopped turkey, onion and pickles for turkey salad. It was great. I have a hand chopper that I really liked but this beats it. I usually use my food processor for chopping turkey, onions, etc. but this is smaller and does just as good a job. I've also used the chopper to chop walnuts and it was wonderful. I have only used the whisk attachment once and haven't used the immersion blender attachment yet at all but I'm sure we won't be disappointed. I would highly recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitchen Aid Hand Blender","review":"This product is fantastic!

I would say that for the price you get fair product with strong motor and nice design. Unfortunately, it is impossible to clean food that gets beneath the plastic disc under rotating knife!!! This can easily cause food poisoning! I've spent 50min cleaning remains of mayo I made, using hot water, soap, and even paper to reach under the disc, and still there was more coming out when disc is pushed down... Too bed they messed up this part. I've returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's with the bag?","review":"Everyone likes this appliance, I do too, so I won't rehash all that.My comment is: What's with the dorky bag? It is a perfect example of a great idea done wrong. If you are going to make a bag, make it fit everything. A bag to hold the mixer base and all the attachments/bowls would be a huge innovation. Aren't you tired of rummaging through all your drawers for that one little attachment? But a bag that holds MOST of the stuff is just senseless. Now a nice stand for it all... Sigh...Buy this thing, you won't be sorry. Just don't expect too much from the bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Versatile Versatile, Excellent addition to any kitchen","review":"I received one a few years ago. I use it almost every day. I recently gave one to a friend who was thrilled to receive it. I chop, mix, puree, blend, stir. You do have to use a bowl with plenty of room however for the whip attachment. It may be my technique but the liquids do over lap the bowl edge easily. This is a great food processor alternative for 1 or 2 people households. Clean up of parts is a breeze and it fits easily into a drawer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Powerful but plastic disc came loose","review":"The plastic disc between the blade and the housing came loose and got caught in the blades chopping some of the plastic into my smoothie which I unknowingly drank. When I asked Sur La Table(specialty kitchen store) if that part could be replaced I saw that their Kitchenaid demo's disc was also loose and had been sheared by the blade. I've had Cuisinart and Braun in the past and their motors burned out. This one was my favorite so far. I guess I'll have to get a Viking next and hopefully last."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective","review":"I am in the process of returning my third one. Each one failed when I was blending soup.

The extras beat out just the blender by itself. I have found that I will use this in place of the counter top blender as it will handle the small portions needed and not have too much to wash after.

Makes great soups and gravies with the stick blender. The food processor attachment is amazingly better than by old Braun unit.

Other pieces of Blender do work very well. Having the warranty, I called the customer service. They wanted me to send a fax about the product information and told me that they'd send me the new piece. I sent to fax several times and nobody call me, nor they did send the piece.

If you aren't VERY careful to get it totally seated, the gears in the housing strip at the first use and the entire unit becomes unusable. Initial use can be difficult wih any unit even when reading the nstructions. It would be nice if they would include new gears so they could be replaced..or better yet, make them of metal. $89.00 down the tube.;-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it until it died","review":"I owned this for 14 months and loved it. I used it to make all types of things and it was really handy to own. When I purchased it I skipped over the lesser models planning to own this for a long time. I should have saved my money. One day as I am pureeing some soup it just stopped working. Nothing. Of course I was a few months past the warranty so I was stuck. Now I am buying a less expensive model with the plan of replacing it every so often.To it's credit I cook a lot and I use my equipment a lot. Reading the reviews of people that love this and call it tough, I imagine they do not do as much as I do. Because of that they might get five years if they are lucky. In my book that is not good enough for this price tag.So if you are an occasional cook and color and brand name matter buy this. Otherwise save the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not stand test of time","review":"Sadly, the blender attachment does not stand the test of time. We have used this blender on an average of 5-6 times a month over the course of the year as it was purchased in November 2008 and given as a Christmas gift. Now the blender blade will no longer turn when attached to the motor. The part on the motor handle that grips the end of the blade and should hold on to it so that it turns has degraded. The food processor still works for now. It should be able to handle making smoothies or pureeing veggie soups for longer than one year, it's not as if we tried to mix concrete with it. Needless to say, we are extremely disappointed in KitchenAids quality on this product and cannot recommend it to anyone who wants a small appliance to last longer than 1 year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take it from a pro, this is a great blender set!","review":"I read the one star reviews about this machine breaking and I can't believe it. I am a chef, classically trained at the CIA in NY, and this blender can handle anything I throw at it. I use it at least once or twice a week and have had it for around seven years now. It has great power, the whisk whips up cake mixes(yes, I cheat sometimes) like a dream, and makes creamy mashed potatoes right in the pot you boiled them in!! That saves a mess! The food processor is great and easy to clean, decent capacity too. The blender works quickly and the variable speed lets you start slow and work up, which is essential with some foods. All around this is a beautiful machine that I wouldn't be without in a home or professional setting. I just can't say enough about it, I'm a believer in the KitchenAid name and this product is certainly no exception. In fact, just using this blender makes me smile, simply a pleasure to blend, whip and process!! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my second kitchenaid immersion hand blender","review":"This is my second Kitchenaid immersion hand blender. I am what the world calls a Foodie. I put my kitchen appliances through the ringer. I use them on a daily basis and hard use at that. So the fact that my first blender lasted over 3 years says a lot about the quality. I am a big fan of Kitchenaid products. I made the mistake of buying a Magic Bullet and it was a piece of junk. Also they did not honor the warranty because I did not buy it directly for the Mfg.. Like a coworker said once you buy cheap stuff you get cheap stuff. Spend the little extra and buy a good blender like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid and Useful","review":"I ordered the KitchenAid KHB300 in lieu of the Cuisinart SmartStick from Crate&Barrel because of the reviews. I'm very glad I decided to do some research. The KitchenAid's stainless steel shaft is solid and durable, the blades on both the blender and the food chopper are sharp and well positioned. The unit feels professional to the touch and I love the variable speed (1-9) functionality that many of the immersion blenders don't offer. I have used the blender every day for the past 3 weeks for smoothies, guacamole, grinding fresh coffee beans and making pesto. It cleans easily and with the right amount of pulsing and speed adjustments you are able to get the consistency just right for everything you might need to blend/puree/grind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful blender","review":"Really liked this immersion blender.

This item was recommended to me and I am pleased with its performance.

Being a rabid fan of heavy metal for most my life, and loving bands with singers that had TRUE TALENT...you know, have a vocal range worth something. Bands like Soundgarden and Queensryche and few others have such quality singers. Sacred Warrior DOES! The songs to listen to are definately \\"Master's Command\\", \\"Paradise\\", \\"He Died\\" and \\"Rebellion\\"...in that order, if possible. These will be tunes you will catch yourself humming! But by all means, LISTEN FURTHER! Their third and fourth albums are extra rich in talented lyrics and soulful singing.

They refuse to play when you make a selection. When I placed them in multiple CD players, they sounded as if an airplane was taking off. These are very poor quality CDs for $100. Do not waste your money on this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorest Quality","review":"I have never had so many problems with a CD set as I have had with this one. I returned my first set to Amazon due to several of the discs being damaged to the point that the tracks I needed could not be listened to. Right out of the box some of the discs were scratched or had visible imprints from the case material on them. Amazon was great and quickly sent me a replacement set, but amazingly I had the same problems with the next set. I, like you probably do, need the set for a college class so I could not afford to lose more time in returning another set for a replacement. After spending $90.00 for an item you are required to have it is infuriating to deal with this sort of thing. Unless you are absolutely stuck don't buy this CD set or you will really be stuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"After reading this book, I would never consider a trip to Vietnam. Ms.Muller showed no redeeming features to the country and there has to be some!

Can't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"vietnam ego trip","review":"My friend and her husband are going to Vietnam to adopt two girls. We read \\"Hitchhiking Vietnam\\" as part of our book club and were very disappointed. I was amazed at the similar reactions other readers had (at Amazon.com). We thought it was highly self-promoting, forsaking the experience of foreign travel for an ego trip. I was annoyed by the author's condescending attitude towards Vietnam's people, wildlife and land. The most I can say for it is that it did generate a lot of discussion! It certainly did seem like a lot of truths were left out of this story..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Colorful!","review":"not sure how I got this book, but it is one of my favorites. I enjoyed Karin's style of writing and her sense of humor a lot. Not sure how reflective her experience is of the current life in Vietnam but to me it sounded real and specific. I found her details of everyday vietnamese life rather enjoyable and down to earth. Her attitude towards the country is objective and even when she is poking fun at unusal issues or happenings true to Vietnam it is done with a warm and interested attitude.Great book. I'm looking forward to reading her future books."},{"rating":"2","title":"The fabulos Tale of a very Brave Woman","review":"Spellbinding true story of a very adventureous womans journey through Vietnam.

She is also a good writer and had her moments in the book.Otherwise, she seemed quite naive about the culture and state of Vietnam, was overly optimistic about the people and when she was disappointed, became extremely bitter about her experience.If you want to read about reasons not to visit Vietnam, read this book. I would also change the title of the book because it is misleading. She really only hitchhiked about the last quarter of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Vietnam through Western eyes.","review":"I first got turned onto Karin Muller's trip by her PBS website, http://www.pbs.org/hitchhikingvietnam/ Her story was engrossing and I think that I read every page on the site. I picked up the book a few days later and saw her film footage on PBS shortly after that. One needs to look at all three to get the complete picture. The book is good and stands out by itself, but the film and website add so much flavor and texture to the story. Karin Muller spent seven months in Vietnam as a simple vagabonding tourist. She experienced broken down motorcycles, breathtaking farmland, sketchy border crossings, scurvy, fields of rubies, saving leopard cubs at an animal market, arrests and planting rice with rural farmers. So does dwell a bit on the negative aspects of the \\"New Vietnam\\" and the book leaves a lot of the story out. Again, read the book, watch the movie and visit the website (in that order) for the entire experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Karin Muller is an honest, fun and entertaining writer and world traveler.The book is a joy to read (finished in 3 days)I have read her newest book Japanland and loved it.As I always do when I read a book by a writer I love, I trace other books by them.Many times older books are not as good, as many writers mature and get better with life's experiences.Not in this case, I was not disappointed and very happy that I did not take to heart the reviews on Amazon.We also bought her book ALONG THE INCA ROAD and I can't wait to read it.

Muller's increasing sense of \\"ownership\\" of the country over the course of the travelogue reaches its nauseating nadir when she subjects the Northern Hill Tribes to her gawking false commiseration; she too knows what it is too suffer: you see, that selfish Jay decided to pursue his own vacation rather than act as her own personal rickshaw driver. What a foul piece of self-aggrandizing fiction; nicely targeted at the Oprah Book of The Month Club dimwits. Let me suggest Devla Murphy to you if you'd like to read a travelogue from a woman with guts.I heartily recommend Catfish & Mandala if you'd like a sense of contemporary Vietnamese culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad, sad egomaniac","review":"I saw Karen at a reading years ago in SF when she was promoting this book. She could not speak Viet at all other than a few simple words. She made several inaccurate comments that made many Vietnamese Americans in attendance look at each other in puzzlement, but everyone was too polite to point out her errors to her. One of the commments was about how a truck driver's salary was less than the cost of postage of her letter to the US! Oh, my God! The woman has no idea what she was talking about at all. I didn't bother to read her book for years after that, but one day I found myself with time to spare and with only her book on the shelf at a friend's house.Dull layman writing with plenty of offensive conjectures.Actually, I don't blame Karen for writing the book. Everyone is entitled to her opinion regardless of faults.

My friend had it on her bookshelf so I asked to borrow it. She does write very well and is easy to follow but that is the only positive I saw. It felt like she wrote more about her negative experiences and I kept reading on thinking it would get better but alas never did. It seems to me she had a horrible time and would probably never return again. I also went out and checked out the film version from the library. Besides the title it didn't even look like it was based on her book. Her travel campanion, Jay, wasn't even in it although she was nice enough to acknoledge him in the credits. The book was bland and the film was even worse. I returned the book to my friend and told her to keep it at the bottom of the stack.

I have always wanted to support my boys' feelings but was reluctant...for all the reasons described in the book. After reading \\"Boy Talk\\" I feel freer to provide this support.I haven't totally changed how I teach or parent. Rather, as the book suggests, I started doing a few small things differently. As a result I have observed fewer behavior problems in the classroom. (I think the boys just generally feel more respected and supported, too.)

Cramer's book is far superior in my opinion, mainly because it comes from an unbiased author.

Morris is a petty little man who claims to have never made money off of Joe but writing this book is terrible. Nice to paint yourself in such a light that Joe owed all his financial wins to you. What a jerk. Please do not do Morris anyfavors and buy this. Nice that Morris spends less than 70-80 pages on his career but over 50 pages on how everybody tried to screw Joe out of money.

The first part chroniclesthe early life of Joe Dimaggio, all of which can be found in other books. In most of the rest of the book, Engleberg is more concerned with rehabilitating his own reputation than he is withsetting the record straight about Joe. Morris portrays himself asgenerous, selfless, caring, loyal, and crafty. This self-picture contrasts with the descriptions other authors have given of Morris.

I had hoped to get a special insight into his baseball life but instead got Engelberg's self-congratulatory evaluation of their \\"friendship.\\" Speaking of, I think they had the most dysfunctional relationship I've ever witnessed between two grown men.

The plot was well developed, but on the negative side, the continuing change in area was confusing. The constant change from city to city was confusing, especially when I would go a few days without reading it. There was also many main characters, and so it was hard to remember who was who. I still enjoyed it, however, because it taught history, (which i don't particularly like), in a novel setting, so it was more fun to read. I have already recommended this book to someone else.

I wasn't even going to read this book but my wife insisted, reminding me of how disgusted I was by the Wellstone memorial service and the taking of money from the boys and girls club for Air America. I was very pleasantly surprised by the book and impressed with Skorski. He exposes one of America's loudest voices of deception and dishonesty. Like other superstar leftist opportunists (Michael Moore comes to mind) Franken shamelessly promotes himself with no regard for truth or genuine leadership. (Why the mainstream media gives Franken any credibility is beyond me.) Skorski's book is the opposite of what I was expecting. It's balanced, thorough, well-researched, and filled with facts I believe can be verified easily.

It's as if Republicans and conservatives would rather not discuss our beloved and blessed President Bush's increased government spending, squandered budget surplus, record debt and protection of frozen embryos everywhere in lieu of vital medical research and concentrate on nonsense.Orwellian double speak and petty distraction....ah, the tools of the ruling class.

After skimming through some of the nay sayer reviewers who are obviously just out to smear Skorski, a number of them appeared to have based their attacks, not from reading Skorski's book, but from an \\"email alert\\" from David Brock which falsely attacks Skorski.Just how credible is Brock? Just read what one liberal critic wrote of his book, 'Blinded by the Right'Whiny, histrionic, and so factually unreliable....'Blinded by the Right' offers plenty of evidence that for Brock, lying has been a lifelong habit...It's good to know who liberals are counting on to refute conservatives.

His 2 chapters on the subject, include a number of emails between Skorski and Franken, with Franken admitting that he never bothered to read the news column he cited to blast O'Reilly as a pathological liar.In another chapter I skimmed through, Skorski makes a strong point that Franken's USO Tours are nothing more than props for Franken to say, \\"see, I'm more patriotic than you are\\" even as Franken mocks and undermines our troops when he gets back on US soil.I'd be interested in reading other reviews, provided they give specific examples of what they liked or didn't like."},{"rating":"1","title":"False information","review":"Don't waste your time on this book.

Not because they are comedians, but because they are ignorant, besides being liars. Mr. Skorski is not a comedian. He's just a fool. But he may succeed with his book & get rich. Like Al Franken did.

Maybe it was just user error, but this isn't the first time I've done T-shirt trasnfers, yet only two out of the included 6 actually came out right.

Ruined a couple t-shirts in the process.Also, hp printing software will flip the image horizontally when you select \\"iron-on transfer\\" in printing properties, so if you have already flipped your image in the document, when you print onto the transfer paper the image will have flipped BACK without warning.

Many other ideas may be inspiring to many new parents.Now the negative:There are many ideas in this book which are useful but require close supervision. I didn't feel like the book discussed safety measures enough. For example, I personally think that toys like walkers are ok as long as one is closely supervising the infant (whether they provide enough value is another question), and many of the toys seemed to me to be possible choking hazards if used without proper supervisionAll in all, I would recommend the book.

Now with Tiger installed I can't use my SCSI port (which was installed by Apple when I bought my computer) without the system crashing (another incompatibility Apple hides from users). Even with hours of technical support I've found the upgrade installation to be a buggy, constantly crashing and uncertain process. Tiger seems particularly crash prone working in the Classic environment (9.2.2)O.K.,so now there's on screen widgets which seem like a gimmick to me. And a fancy finder function called Spotlight.

Other labels remaster older recordings at a budget price. This recording SHOULD be at a budget price, as it's old material. Not only that, I am not impressed with the sound. It is a clear recording, with a lot of midrange, but limited highs, detail, and thin bass. Not really a full range orchestral recording. Not a premium sound. I give the performance five stars, but the sound only three. That comes out, for me, four stars. I am happy to see these old classic recordings come out again. But not happy with the price or sound.

However Notre Dame had virtually no role in its downfall. That isn't opinion that's history. The rise and fall of the Klan and the rise and fall of Notre Dame are well worth telling but they aren't really tied together as the book implies. Todd Tucker takes an isolated incident and try to portray it as instrumental in the fall of the KKK's most powerful faction. That is just not true.It's an interesting book for the history of two powerful groups but let's be clear Notre Dame had NOTHING to do with the downfall of the Klan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story worth telling","review":"Todd Tucker's new book, \\"Notre Dame vs. The Klan\\" is one of those efforts that reports an incident in American history and helps to broaden its larger scope in the process. In doing so, the author has enlightened his readers as to what the climate might have been like in Indiana in 1924.Tucker gives a decent overview of the Klan's history and gives a more fascinating look at the emerging prominence of Notre Dame. This book would be an ideal primer for Notre Dame students (one of my former students plays on the current Notre Dame football squad) and to that end, I think this book has merit. However, linking the Notre Dame incident and the Klan's demise is more than a bit of a stretch. Historical novels tend to see things in a more readable light but even given the author's admission of creating a narrative of his own, I commend his efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Legendary Event in the History of the Fighting Irish","review":"I am a Notre Dame graduate(class of 1959)and had heard of this clash between the ND student body and KKK, but I knew only the barest details. Therefore, this book was most welcome. It not only covers the 1924 confrontation in almost minute-by-minute detail but serves as a fascinating informal history of both the KKK, especially its post-\\"Birth of a Nation\\" spread in the North, and of the University itself from its 1842 founding date. The book should therefore be fascinating to any ND alum, including those of the subway variety, and would probably be of interest to a general readership was well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Knew?","review":"Very interesting history of both Notre Dame and the Klan in Indiana, particularly relevant to anyone with an interest in either Notre Dane or the KKK. (We all might have guessed that a prominent member of Indiana society was a Klansman, but who knew that he kidnapped a girl and bit her to death?) Tucker's book is a little less sensational than that previous sentence implies, but this is a nonfiction book that reads with a lot of drama and excitement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fills In The Blanks","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely. While focusing on a little known event in the Catholic experience in America, it actually filled in the blanks on the history of the Ku Klux Klan. I did know that at one time the Klan controlled politics in Indiana, but I was always curious as to how these yokels took over a Northern state. Mr. Tucker does a great job in expressing the emotions and attitudes of 1920's Indiana and probably much of America at that time. This is a great book for anyone interested in Catholic history, US history, and the history of hate groups in the United States. This book is a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty darn good, but I'd rather read history","review":"In my opinion, this book rates 4 stars because it deals with an interesting topic, and deals with it in what appears to be a more honest fashion than other so-called historical novels. In fact, I dare say that the book would have been more interesting had it been written as a sober history.To my mind, the author, though villifying the Indiana Klan leader, was very easy on the organization as a whole. Maybe he's right -- maybe they are simply yokels who are not even worthy of contempt. But I'm surprised that anyone -- especially a Catholic -- would not be more offended by the Klan and the conditions which gave rise to it. (For that matter, I'm surprised that a Catholic would refer to The Catholic Church as the author did not once, but twice -- as a \\"denomination\\".But then perhaps I'm too easily surprised. The author wrote a pretty darn good book.

At least he seemed always to try to make something of the music he performed, which is my highest desideratum in readings. But his approach always seemed to emphasize the potential sound -effects in music. He seemed little interested in conveying the basic structure of the music, which to me seems to hold the most possibility for drama and beauty in great works. But, again, at least he tried to do something. Well, here is a performance where his approach seems to have hit a golden mean, and is spectacular. Oddly, his sound- effects approach is even more present than usual. But somehow it brings out the contours of this work in a very uncanny fashion.

Not only is it Roxy's worst effort, it's not even close to the rest. Buy any other Roxy disc & you'll have a much better time. This one's flaccid & boring. Roxy was completely misunderstood in the US, where very few people saw them live. You would never know it from Roxy's press here, but Roxy was a terrific Rock band. They played loud, stomping, pounding stuff live, backed by one of the mightiest drummers on Earth (Paul Thompson). Problem was, Brian Ferry's lyrics were literate & witty enough to induce pretentious critics to dust off all the French & German artsy-fartsy words they knew, thus scaring off the folks who really would have \\"got\\" Roxy.

A full 3/4 of the book is dedicated to C#, Visual C++ and SQL Server 2000. There is only about 10 pages dedicated to Java, and that is mostly outdated and poorly written and designed Swing code.The reviewer who claims this is the end all be all book and includes source for both languages has not read this book completely.It contains some [bad] Java code for a client, and C# code for a client and all the server side coding ( which in their poor implementation is 99% of the functionality ) is C++ and SQL Server 2000 based.This is nothing more than a mis-named Client/Server book, on how to write a server side application for Windows in C++ with SQL Server 2000 as a database and how to write a Java and C# client to access it.It is ANYTHING but P2P . . .Stay away, this is the first book I have ever returned to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very basic book with lots of filler","review":"50% of this book is a printing of their code line by line, the whole app!

Hello? that was a year ago, and their web site still has Beta 2 code on it.The book does not cover the more challenging topics of P2P development, such as, what to do with clients behind proxys and firewalls.

One thing i particularly like about this book is that you get two fully working P2P applicaitons, with a choice of development languages between Java and C#. At the time of writing this review, C# is not as big as Java, but someday it might be, and the choice of C# just shows the insight of the authors and developers involved with this book.I have this book, one of the very first of my P2P collection, and i don't think you would be disappointed with it either.Have fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of cracked code!","review":"As for many others, reading this books was a disappointment for me, too.

She has a crooked nose and teeth and her hair is short and messy. But Jane is very kind and beautiful on the inside. Which one do you think the prince chose?This book reminded me os Sleeping Beauty because it was based on that book. If you like retold fairy tales you'll like Sleeping Ugly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly is as ugly does","review":"The story begins well, but the intended portrayal of the Plain Jane as inwardly beautiful fails when she reveals a desperately wicked heart, taking no pity on the hapless sleeping princess who is ugly inside but beautiful outside. Plain Jane even abuses the still-sleeping princess by using her as a hat stand and hangs a \\"no kissing\\" sign on her to prevent her being \\"kissed awake\\" by guests. In effect, she condemns the sleeping princess to death, thus exalting herself and becoming ugly in the eyes of those who know true beauty would never do such a thing. I consider Plain Jane more insidiously ugly, for she pretends to have true beauty (of heart) while her physically beautiful counterpart offers no pretense at inner beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let sleeping princesses lie, and lying princesses sleep","review":"This is an enjoyable, and very readable, princess story about manners, and seeing what is below the surface.

It was only recently that I read the opinion of some \\"enlightened\\" reviewer that labeled this book as \\"feministic.\\" What is so feministic about the idea that someone would look past the lovely facade of one to see the inner beauty of another? I read this book to my class of five-year-olds, and I had just said, \\"The end\\" when they began chanting in unison, \\"Read it again; read it again!\\" At the end, continuing in the strain of humor that flows throughout this tale, is the story's moral: \\"Let sleeping princesses lie, or lying princesses sleep . . . \\" while in truth, it teaches something far more important."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Illustrated History, NOT an Atlas","review":"I teach world history and own several world history atlases. Of all the world history atlases that I own, the National Geographic Atlas of World History is the most Eurocentric and least useful.

Works well with both; the image is clear and colorful and the audio is clear and clean. The clip it comes with to hold on to the screen is somewhat unstable to use with the IBM Thinkpads given that the screens on these notebooks have a wider edge.

This album would mark the band's transition into a ballad hit machine with the songs 'Hard to Say I'm Sorry/Get Away' and 'Love Me Tomorrow', which are both good. On a review about Chicago 19 I mentioned the band's selection of hits/singles. While 2 ballads were chosen, the band could've easily picked 'What You're Missing', 'Waiting For You To Decide', 'Bad Advice', 'Follow Me', and/or even 'Rescue You'. All of the following songs could have, would have, and should have been great hits. But since turning into a ballad machine saved Chicago, I guess it was best for them to do so. I still love this album, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Album","review":"The singles released from this album (\\"Love Me Tomorrow\\" and \\"Hard to Say I'm Sorry\\") are really the weakest of the bunch. \\"Sonny Think Twice\\" is one I play over and over again, and would be at home on most Smooth Jazz format radio stations. \\"What Can I Say\\" is one of the finest, catchiest ballads on which Peter Cetera has sung lead. \\"Waiting for You to Decide\\" is another that will stick in your head.

After 3 more-or-less disappointing albums in a row, this turned out to be almost entirely a Peter Cetera/David Foster project--yet nowhere NEAR as exciting as the previous PETER CETERA solo album. James Pankow's \\"Bad Advice\\" has lots of brass & attitude, and Robert Lamm's \\"Get Away\\" may be the most exciting moment on the album-- even if it's only an epilogue. Cetera's \\"Hard To Say I'm Sorry\\" is a beautiful love ballad that's probably better than a number of sound-alike tunes that followed on later albums. And Cetera also wrote my 2 favorite tunes here: \\"Rescue You\\" and \\"Love Me Tomorrow\\".

The book is very well written and with good pictures and drawings. It is not directly with a lot of scientific references, probably because of the lack of scientific groundwork available until now.

For one, the lay-out and print quality are absolutely embarrassing considering the times we live in. One of the few musical examples actually looks as though it were rendered by a dot-matrix printer. Further, the unrealistic exercises are ambiguously described and seldom illustrated. They are also a complete waste of time since one is better off sightreading real compositions. That's why it's better to invest in sheet music/ etudes that suit one's tastes. The Musician's Institute Sightreading for Keyboard book is far more helpful and complete at a comparable price, offering several chapters of exercises and etudes without making ludicrous promises--very professional indeed. There is really no substitute for practice; forget the nonsense of \\"secrets\\" and invest elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"This \\"book\\" is more like a short document you could download off the internet.

It may not be the most impressive or expressive or moving or even the best played but it is the one song of his that transends any need for acceptance of anyone.

These three vital components of Dr. Bernstein's approach are very powerful because they guide parents to bypass the emotional reactivity of defiant children and teens. If you really apply the techniques in this wonderful book, you will also be very pleased with the results. I have not only found Dr. Bernstein's approach helpful for parenting, but also in all my dealings with difficult people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource","review":"This book provides a step by step way to handle odd children and I have recommended it to the parents I work with for their children. As a therapist this is a great resource"},{"rating":"2","title":"Common Sense","review":"This book is just common sense that so many parents over look because they believe parenting means they are the boss and they fail to understand their children. It encourages being firm and having rules, but not being controlling and getting into power struggles with your child. Understanding and love are the key to a happy home and well-behaved child who is not filled with frustration and defiance because she is being constantly controlled and cannot understand why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Practical advice","review":"this book provided solid, practical advice about how to change patterns of behavior between us and our 13 year old moderatley defiant child. Although not perfect, the methods do work and changes in behavior patterns are instantly recognizable. It also provided very good insight into why traditional methods of parenting do not work well for these kids. the books also helps you to gain an understanding of THEIR thought process, and once you understand you dont see the behavior as \\"defiant.\\" My only wish is that it gave more examples of how to deal with particular situatons. i still find it hard sometimes to know what consequences are appropriate. DEFINATELY worth reading"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Resource for Home and School","review":"I have had the pleasure of reading 10 Days to a Less Defiant Child. This book is a packed with many valuable suggestions and tools. I have both the perspective of being a parent and a school administrator. Dr. Bernstein's program helps parents and teachers build relationships that truly lessen defiant behavior in children and teens. I only wish that I and others had access to this book years ago. Dr. Bernstein's approach shows how to keep defiant children accountable while keeping parents and teachers out of the mess of power struggles. This book is easy to read and chock full of fantastic, true to life examples. I have been encouraging my friends and colleagues to read this book and I encourage you to do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"A highly valuable, practical book","review":"Dr. Bernstein has really put together a fantastic program to lower defiant behavior. My wife and I are thrilled with the tools we have learned to better manage our children. One of my kids was highly defiant and now using the strategies from 10 Days to a Less Defiant Child, I am thrilled to share how much better things are. We have learned the power of his calm, firm, non-controlling approach and the results have been incredible.

( like the dad)So she asked for advice from dear auntie, I said \\"get expert advice\\" and sent her three books.Report, ten days later all is on track, kids are minding, not screaming, and not throwing control fits and the dear neice has grown up and realised to be a parent you give kids what they need, not what they want. Love is not enough.Dear niece called and thanked me today for helping her with good advice.Have not read the book ,but am hearing good things with results. Be brave, do tough love."},{"rating":"1","title":"This guy is nuts","review":"I do not believe this person has ever dealt with a truly ODD child. He gives examples that are not realistic. If you give your ODD child praise you will not hear thanks thats all I needed to hear. The truly ODD child will take any limits or suggestions you give and try and take it one step further. There are some very good suggestions, no yelling ODD children shut down when the parent yells. But to say I do not approve of this or that just tells the ODD child to see to what extent you don't approve. Remember they think they are the adult you are, they must be reminded that they are not they have not gone through the life experiences you have and have learned by, they also think anything you learned from is dumb they could have done it right or better. Stay away from this book if your child is truly ODD I suggest \\"The Defiant Child: by Dr douglas A Riley"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mark's Review","review":"Excellent book to reduce defiant behavior. By following the suggestions, our child improved within a week and each week we see further improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I thought that this book was really helpful and really supportive towards parents. Bernstein was able to get me to address MY issues as a parent and look at what changes I needed to make without making me feel like I'd screwed it all up. He uses some self-disclosure which gives him a very humbled tone - easy to take advice from because he's not coming off as condescending or superior. The author also seems very balanced in terms of praise and consequences instead of so many books which are too harsh or way too coddling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Help for Parents of Strong-Willed kids!","review":"We just learned our 7 year old daughter is considered \\"strong-willed\\" and found this book to be the easiest read on the subject. It contains practical information and is written in such a way as to keep our interest. It is not bogged down with a lot of psycho babble which makes us crazier than we already are! Highly recommend you take a look at this book if you have a child in this category."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very helpful book","review":"This book is very helpful if you are dealing with a child with oppositionality and defiant behavior. Parenting children with these types of behaviors can be draining and it is easy to lose sight of how to respond. In our house we had a litigator-in-training who could give you 10 reasons why any request I made of her was stupid! It is very easy to develop \\"battle fatigue\\" and become a less effective parent, which only does the child a disservice in the long run when they interact with the real world.The best part about this book is that the steps are easy to follow and while they can be done at your own pace, they are designed to move the process along fairly quickly.The book contains helpful insights and practical advice to help you have a more peaceful house. If you are reluctant to read this because you are afraid it will highlight all of the things you should have been doing all along, I assure you that is not the tone of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda narrow","review":"These were very narrow but the colour was cute and the style had to send them back though"},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful, original, enlightening","review":"I've been researching the mythology of Lilith, especially contemporary interpretations, and Nick's story is by far my favorite. Frankly, I am growing tired of environmentalist and feminist tales, where Lilith is the harmonious nature-goddess or the woman who doesn't need a man.

So I know what good chowdah is. And this ain't cutting it. I like other people thought that because it was expensive, it would be good. Wrong.

The clams tasted like metal as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lacks Certain \\"Key\\" Ingredients","review":"This soup lacks the key ingredients that make a canned clam chowder great: Partially hydrogenated vegetable oils (soy/cottonseed), dehydrated potatoes, modified starches of all kinds, hydrolyzed corn gluten, MSG, potassium chloride, sodium phosphate, disodium inosinate, disodium guanylate, and succinic acid. What good is a classic New England clam chowder without these classic ingredients?Instead, the first ingredient listed is: Clams. Next you'll be telling me it's got butter in it (it does? Oh.).On a more serious note. Bar Harbor makes a good tasting clam chowder. The first list of ingredients came from Snow's and Campbell's condensed New England clam chowders. This Bar Harbor stuff is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exellent soup!","review":"I am not a fan of canned food but I cannot not equate this product's quality with such. It is very tasty with lots of seafood content. It is not watery and has a very nice natural seafood taste to it. I like to keep a few cans in my pantry in case we run out of food or want an easy meal. Very good tasty product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"will buy again","review":"For canned soup this is very good clam chowder. Those who give it 1 or 2 stars are comparing it to homemade soup or restaurant style soup. I would buy this any day over other brands. You can tell it is all natural and without loaded msg, salt and other nasty ingredients. Pure and clean soup. Those who rate it badly, some say it has no flavor or there aren't chunks in it. The flavor is mild, but that is good- not overwhelmingly clammy and not over salted like conventional brand canned soup. If I want to, next time I will add a potato cut up in chunks to boost it's contents- not a big deal to do. I would prefer to do that than buy a conventional brand that doesn't care about healthy ingredients and sourcing of ingredients. I will buy this again- good source of iron as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"I, too, am perplexed","review":"I've just prepared my first can of this soup. It tasted incredibly bland, and didn't have much clam flavor. So then I added more milk, butter, onions, salt and fresh ground pepper, plus white wine. For 2.92 per 15 oz. can, all of those ingredients should have been adequately added in there already, except for the pepper. Bar Harbor brand certainly didn't stint on the other ingredients in order to increase the amount of clams, that's for sure. There were larger pieces of clams than in Progresso's - but that's damning with faint praise. Next time I'll buy the clams and make my own, for less, probably. I'm just perplexed by these reviews; I think I can safely say Progresso's tastes better. And, of course, it's much less expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely disgusting.","review":"I chose this brand because it was the most expensive option at the supermarket and claimed to be authentic.

Lobster soup was very fishy for starters and the Manhattan chowder was very watered down. The New England chowder is somehow creamy and void of flavor. The Clam corn chowder was not enjoyable.I am real soup eater and take soup at least once a day and always when I dine out. Long story short... This is the most tasteless soup and just not good. I suggest you pass on this and I am sure Cambells will be a much better choice than these soups...

Frankly, I had to skim a huge portion of the book because I was totally lost with the military, fighting dialogue. It is undecipherable to the average person who has never served in the military. At times I totally lost track of the plot - or what little plot there was - because of the obscure military \\"speak\\". Based on the reviews, I ordered the remaining 2 books in the series before I got very far into the 1st book. All 3 books were a total waste of money. The characters were one dimensional and much of the background was never explained - like why were the aliens attacking Earth and what was the difference between the different types of aliens?This series contains a lot of bad writing, an undeveloped plot, cardboard characters and obscure military acronyms. Save your money and buy a book that is well written and interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting plot; badly needs editing","review":"I think this book has a clever, interesting plot. Unlike some other readers,I was entertained by the military jargon used. The only detraction to mewas the non-existent editing, which stuck out like a sore thumb to me, anddetracted from my enjoyment. A few examples would be: Injecting Procaine in atraumatic amputation victim; use of 12- and 24-hour time references in thesame paragraph; continuing to refer to pay phone use in a time frame \\"14years from now\\"; hiding from the bad guys while continuing to drive the samevehicle, not even changing license plates, etc. All in all, a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read","review":"This was an excellent read.

God rest his talented soul","review":"When I heard Mitch had passed away a few weeks ago, I had to buy both CDs knowing I'd never get to see him perform again.

My favorite from this CD ... the koala infestation. Oh gosh...I feel a giggle coming on. He's brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Man, you really like Tide.\\"","review":"This is one of the best stand-up CD's I've ever heard and certainly one of the few worth buying. The material is funny, cute, and just basically worthwhile. The show is kind of vaudvillian in its appeal - there are a lot of one-liners, and Mitch was clearly really smart, but his confused stoner schtick makes everyone listening take themselves a little less seriously, which can't be a bad thing. Pay no attention to the parental advisory sticker - it's only worth worrying about if you think the f-word is the worst thing anyone could possibly say.

I did not look back. Several topics that were covered in the various exams were not even mentioned in the books, such as NLB affinity. The information contained is many times incomplete, or too general to be of any use on the exams. As the exams are more real-world experience based now, the \\"memorize this\\" format presented here does not serve as well as in the past.I recommend the Microsoft Press and Syngress books as far better resources.

Frankly, he should have had a ghostwriter or some such to do this up for him; that, or he should have written a biography about his years as the last governor of Hong Kong. Now that would have been some story...but,alas, what we have instead is nearly dry as dust and only half as interesting; \\"where the minnows talk like whales\\", as Faulkner would say.

Though many of the stories I am sure a veteran of Kiss books will know, there are a few good tidbits.

And he seems to be extremely concerned with everyone's wardrobe.I was impressed with his coverage of the band's financial situation, especially during their lean years, and, I cannot in any way question Lendt's Financial Management expertise.

I think the characters are pretty well portrayed and the cases are good, but I liked \\"Double Dealer\\" better, because I always prefer the entire team working in the same investigation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite the TV show","review":"I love the television series of CSI. This book did a great job of capturing the feel of the show, but it is just not the same. It is a great book, I just believe I enjoy the television show in all its drama better than the book.In this story, there are two murders to be solved. The first is a missing wife. Her husband is suspected for the murder, but seems to have an alibi. The second murder revolves around a stripper who is strangled on the job. Everyone seems to be blaming her ex-boyfriend, but there is too much evidence that points to a female.No matter how crazy the murders seem, they are never to hard for the CSI's of Las Vegas. Give the book a try. It will have you turning pages faster than you realize."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slight alteration necessary","review":"Purchased product, shipped flawlessly, but needed to be altered a bit to get it to fit in my 2001 integra application.

Then takes you through each step of the process of preparing what you wrote for the reader.Murray talks to you like are sitting in front of you. You feel like he can hear your questions, answers them, and then shows you what he is talking about.The most important part of the whole book is Chapter 9, \\"'Read' as a Writer\\". He analyzes today's writers as a writer, a major step to really understanding the craft.Other writing books tell you about practice sessions, structure, and voice. Murray shows you how to do the work.Yes it is a very...book, but weather it is a textbook or not, it is a book of valuable information for those of us who can't work at the Boston Globe or go to Harvard--yet our passion to write is very real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Write to learn","review":"This is a good book-it really encourages you to break the mold when writing and it's easy to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grrrrrrrrrr","review":"Purchased the book with the Infotrack extra intact.

It is quite comfortable in practice.There is no brand name displayed on the strap (yeah). Op/Tech has a video that demonstrates a great way of keeping the strap ends under control. Because there are no \\"quick connect\\" features to this strap, it is probably never going to suddenly fail."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd","review":"this cd is just awesome all around. by far the best promise ring release there is - especially better than their new cd which sucks. the only reason it didn't get 5 stars was because it was too short. a cd this great should go on forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get to know Solomon Burke","review":"Having seen Solomon Burke twice with the full band, interviewed at EMP, grew up in Burke's backyard in Philadelphia and done church with Al Green at his Full Force Tabernacle in Memphis (where Burke preaches on occasion) I can attest to the reality of these interviews and family stories. To know Burke, preacher, singer and mortician is fascinating. The musical clips are GREAT. You gotta love this guy, the man who invented Northern Soul and the first Soul man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why isn't he better known?","review":"Wow! Watch this DVD and see the raw, and yet nurtured talent that belongs to Solomon Burke. It's stylists like Burke who make real music - music with a melody - enjoyable. I'm so sick of modern \\"artists\\" who without samples of innovators like Burke, would not even have careers. I never have understood why true, authentic talent like this is not embraced more by the mainstream. In this documentary, he comes across as a smart, savvy, man of the world who also loves God and family. The DVD has many great performance clips that I wish were available in their entirety. This documentary is long over due!"},{"rating":"1","title":"some info please...","review":"This isn't a review, but I wanted to say that you should really give the potential buyer some info about what it is they are thinking of purchasing.

My son was 1 when we started his collection and they have been a favorite ever since. When they like the trains it cuts down on a lot of other bulky toys so the clutter is minimal.This piece named Salty is fun plus we like to do the voice! He has a cute cheeky grin on his face. The paint is durable and the plastic pieces are minimal and will be great addition to your Thomas collocation.Here's a TIP for saving money on Thomas and Friends - If you have a Michaels Craft Store close by and get the Sunday circular they usually run a 40 percent off coupon in the paper. I am told they do not do this in all markets but here they do. We take ours into the store and receive 40 percent off of the trains which in some cases on some trains it is a considerable savings. You may want to try it."},{"rating":"2","title":"He Longs for the Sea!!","review":"Salty is a dockyard diesel engine that loves to tell stories of the sea, but he sometimes bores his audience without meaning to.

It will please gays and hipsters, but that's about it. Chorus almost unlistenable, unless you happen to like the Bee Gees (shudder).

When used in this manner, and with hard lifting, you will really see some results. As a gainer shake, I would recommend TRUEMASS by BSN, it is great tasting and will get you all those calories you need to see real gains."},{"rating":"1","title":"They want me to down 4 Tbsp of this?","review":"Perhaps I should do a video review and sample some just to show the reaction to this flavor...sour doesn't begin to describe how harsh this stuff is. I would much rather down cough syrup than this stuff (another reviewer thought it tasted slightly better than it). Obviously the taste camp is pretty diverse amongst reviewers. If the other reviewer thought this was the best tasting liquid amino supplement he's tried, well, I don't want to try any others. Also another reviewer said it was a great replacement for powders - this is to be taken in addition to protein powder - and get a blender bottle and a decent powder and you won't have those issues. I'm sure this stuff is functionally amazing, but after I finish this thing, unless I see totally awesome results, I'm not buying it again. It's a shame too because ON tends to make awesome supps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenience with a capital C!","review":"Even though this protein supplement has kind of a harsh, sour fruit taste (the reviewer below doesn't think so, and that's fine, maybe you won't either), it's still the best thing out there simply due to its convenience. No mixing, no blending--just pour it into a tablespoon (four times) and you're done! I grew tired of the messy, cumbersome protein powders years ago, especially the brands that claimed it mixed easily with a spoon--well, they never did. It was impossible to dissolve those powders enough so that you didn't end up with a sludge of the powder at the bottom of the glass--grrrrrr! If you can relate to this, then this Liquid Amino punch is for you. I discovered it about 10 years ago and have never looked back since. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"~I won't buy this product again~","review":"I was really hoping this product was going to taste good. Unfortunately this product tasted only slightly better than cough syrup.

Beverly Sills and Sherrill Milnes -- two of the finest singers of the 20th century -- are particularly outstanding as is the conductor, James Levine. Personally, I don't think a better performance of these highlights exists.

White, kind of sherpa-type fleece on the inside and a woven polyester fabric on the outside. There's a bluish stripey fabric and a pinkish one and a brown polka dot and a pink polka dot.I thought the picture looked like this was a new version with a fake-fur interior, but it's not. These are still good cuddle cups and they wash up great. I have a pile of them so I always have a clean one to swap out as soon as they get damp or dirty. 4 stars for the picture not looking like the real cuddle cup!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great for my guinea pig.","review":"I bought this cuddlecup when I first got my piggie, thinking it seemed very comfortable and a nice place for him to sleep.

The Andis trimmer is louder when compared to the Panasonic.The size and grip are the same as Panasonic.My experience with the Andis was very disappointing. It worked for two weeks and then one morning it was dead.I replaced the battery just to eliminate that angle, but it did not help.Very poor reliability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay if all you want is a nose massage :)","review":"In order for this to cut any hair, you have to pretty much manipulate each strand of hair into one of the slits (like threading a needle) and then hope the blade cuts it. If you run this around your O2 hole long enough and tilt it in all kinds of directions, you will end up trimming (although not always to an acceptable length) maybe 50% of the hair. But your nose will tingle for a while if you like that sort of thing!I'm sure Amazon would have taken it back, but didn't want to go through the trouble for this cheap item."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a perfectly fine device","review":"For $10, this is a bargain. It does exactly what it's supposed to do. Quick, not too noisy, easy to clean. Clips without pulling. Battery lasts and lasts. Fairly light. What's not to like?

I finally dropped my last one & since the company is now gone I figured I would have to go back to the \\"barely works\\" kind. But no, this trimmer works great! It cuts close, it's quiet, and because it only uses a single AA it's small and light. Smaller is better for me due to travel. I also like the vented cap (which fits tightly) because I can let it dry after rinsing without having to keep the cap off. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it doesn't have a light (I did like the excellent light on the Sharper Image trimmer). This trimmer is a real bargain for the price.

When I turn the switch on, nothing happens. After I check the battery connections and the blade cover, still nothing. I changed the battery for a known fresh battery, still nothing. Once or twice, I was able to get it to turn on by gently tapping it against my palm. When that happened, it stayed on until I turned it off and seemed to trim as expected. After sitting in the drawer, though, it always didn't work upon the next attempt to use.

The orchestrations are often to noisy and chaotic, and the singing/ shouting give you a headache after a while. Georgia Brown needs to soften her voice while protraying a lovable charcter such as Nancy. The only cast member that sticks out is Fagin portrayed by Ron Moody , Moodys portrayal of the character is perfect and he knows how to balance the serious / comedic sides of the role. Don't get me wrong Oliver! is a great musical at which is near to my heart but this recording needs a change for the better.

I sent copies of the printed volume to college professors, school teachers both public and private, and church leaders. These were all friends of mine. The professors did not respond at all. The school teachers said that they liked it but would not use it because they were afraid of law suits or they diagreed with my usage of Biblical quotes. The church leaders were too busy to read it.

Fortunately for us my son and I found no humor in any of the situations so we didn't have to go back, but if you do have to 'go back' there are no instructions as to what to do then. Do you read everything all over again? Naturally I know you don't REALLY have to return to the beginning, however the book is lame. There is no plot, no story- just a couple of 'funny' situations awkwardly introduced by a 'nice' pig and not-so-nice reptile (crock or gator? I don't remember).

It's about a thief who goes all over teh world in search of treasure, aided by his samurai and gangster friends, while competing with his femla ex girlfriend, and running from a persistent Inspector Gadget-like detective. This one's about an ancient treasure from Babylon, and Lupin meets up with a gangster nemesis who wants the treasure to fulfill his father's lost dream. Lupin meets up with a shadowy old lady who somehow is able to guide him to his search. For anime fans, the conclusion may/may not be predictable, but overall, the characters and pacing make this title a keeper.

I figured she would go nuts over this toy. However, she barely even looked at it. My daughter is 27 months, but developmentally delayed. You can drop the balls through the center hole and music does play. The two holes on the sides are hard for her to get the balls into because you dont DROP the balls down through the holes. They go horizontally through the holes. I am disappointed with this toy. I wouldn't recommend this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"My baby loves this!","review":"My 10-month old received this as a gift and just loves it!! He likes to pull on the net and watch the circle above it move around and make noise. I think once he figures out how to put the balls in the holes in the sides he will really enjoy the noise it makes, too. In fact, his 5-year old cousin came over and had a blast with this!! The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because it is light and won't support him if he pulls up on it. I definitely recommend this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH BUYING","review":"When we bought this toy for our 8 month old son, we thought he was going to love it...he didn't. Within the first night he broke the net off, which will never go back correctly. He is easlily able to knock the whole thing over. The balls sometimes get stuck inside and you have to reach in to get them. Overall I would say it is not worth buying.

Skillfully building upon a history of the use of visuals to influence taste and choice, Adatto uses very current examples to document the sometimes pernicious influence that visuals have on public opinion and elections. Although a late chapter on heroic images in American film seemed like an add-on that does not flow with the rest of the work, even it was enjoyable and well written enough for me to give this work 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Writing, poor quality photos","review":"nowhere near picture perfect.

It starts out well but then degenerates into a bunch of random points which the author tries to use to argue his hypothesis that the universe was designed to give rise to intelligent life as a final outcome. The blurbs along the margin were major distractions & made it hard to stay focused on the actual material in the book. The book just kind of wanders around the various fields of science trying to find evidence to support the author's premise and then ends with the pronouncement that we're the peak of creation (very Genesis-like). I'd have to pronounce this book mildly interesting if you can wade through the claptrap and the biased agenda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsense","review":"The first half of this book gives a quick tour of science, and seems well researched and presented. The second half, however, delves into the realm of science fiction. While the ideas presented could be true, there is no possible way to verify the authors concept. It is really metaphysics, and is merely given the illusion of credibility by the passable bit of writing which preceded it. The author could likewise have postulated that the universe will contract to form a massive lollipop at the end of time, and the theory would have similar certifiability.I don't mean to discourage those who want to dream big, but to codify an imaginary scenario as a plausible and reasonable scientific theory is at best, disingenuous, and at worst prosthelytizing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Glasses","review":"These glasses are great.

The graphics seem to be off, but I can't quite put my finger on what exactly is off about them. The gameplay is monotous, and after a while, I really didn't even care if I completed the game or not. Control is not the best in the world as the layout changes from mode to mode to mode to mode, and you have to change from mode to mode to mode to mode.

At first I thought the movie would be stupid but I love slasher films and the latest ones in cinemas have been terrible. So I made the purchase with my favourite slasher films in my mind (I Know What You Did Last Summer, Scream, and Urban Legend). I made a good choice. After watching this movie I was quite surprised how good the storyline actually was. The killings were ordinary despite Wendy's death which is superb. The disco area gets boring fast but it does help you get a feel for the era that this movie takes place in. Overall an interesting and classic slasher that isn't anything more than fun to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"80's Horror Nostalgia","review":"This is literally the first slasher movie I remember watching when I was a kid. Since I was a horror movie virgin, I had no idea who the killer was until the very end. Nowadays, more sophisticated audiences will be able to guess the ending in the first 10 minutes. But aside from that, Prom Night is still one of the better slasher flicks from the late 70's/early 80's era and holds up surprisingly well almost 30 years later. The director manages to create quite a suspenseful mood throughout the film, especially during the chase scenes. The movie is helped by a very creepy score (not to be confused with the disco music). Leslie Neilson is wasted (what was his purpose?), but Jamie Lee Curtis earns her title of Scream Queen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorest DVD Quality Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I love this film as I'm a big fan of B/grade horror and slasher films.

The movie was weird, dumb and totally pointless, and compared to Halloween it was too gory! Leslie Nielsen was in this movie too and it was made long before he made all those silly comedy movies he has become so famous for. Prom Night wasted the talents of Jamie Lee Curtis and Leslie Nielsen! I find it amusing the comments by people who obviously have grown up watching Leslie Nielsen in his comedy movies like the Naked Gun movies who seem to think Prom Night was made after those movies but Prom night was made years before Airplane and The Naked Gun movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Disappointed","review":"Wow. I was really excited to order this movie, but it's not good. First of all, NO BONUS FEATURES. Secondly, we don't see the killer slashing anyone until towards the end of the film. Also, this film is trying to hard. It's a combo of 'I Know What You Did Last Summer', 'Carrie', 'Halloween', and even... 'Saturday Night Fever'! Jamie's face looks kinda strange, too. And when the killer is revealed it's not a real big surprise. Just not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"really a 2 and 1/2 star","review":"A pretty standard \\"who's killing the teens?\\" movie.

And I do mean funny! It was much different than I expected it to be. I expected it to be similar to Halloween but boy was I wrong! What was really funny about Prom Night is how the people die. The killings are SO lame it made me laugh so hard I almost cried! It only has one suspensful moment that I can think of, but nevertheless its a classic horror movie. I think my favorite scene had to be Jamie Lee Curtis doing that dance!! I mean she was awesome! I don't think we are going to see her do that in any future movies... It is really cool to see her so young. Don't miss this movie! Its a must."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have to admit it...(* 1/2)","review":"No matter how many times I try to like this movie, I always can't help but think it SUCKS. And the thing is, I SHOULD like it. It's from the early 80's, it's a slasher movie, AND it has disco in it! But I CAN'T! It's not scary at all, and the action doesn't start till 20 mintues 'till the end! The prom part is boring, but everything leading up to the prom is VERY boring. The only good thing about \\"Prom Night\\" are the clothes, hair, and music."},{"rating":"1","title":"FOR PRETEENS ONLY","review":"A disappointment indeed. This movie is to much like scream and all the other late 90's teenybooper films. Its about Prom Night the lamest night of them all. It does however have Jamie Lee Curtis in it and she is a terrific actress,but Leslie Nielsen should to stick to Naked Gun movies he was pretty bad in this film. Lastly this movie wouldn't even scare three girlfriends at a sleepover,its not scary just comical that they made a film that was on prom that was actually gonna be scary but instead failed miserably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prom Night - was never this boring!","review":"Doubt if was even scary when originally released during this [ugh!] Disco period. Best parts: Jamie Lee Curtis's young and too-brief 38D's brazier shot in the locker room and the ending credits; cutting her teeth on two-bit films like this, Jamie eventually evolved into both a sexy and superior actress (i.e, 1994 True Lies). Worst parts: documentary-style scary scenes, over use of twilight filtering and the lazy editing with redundant 4-second shots of meaningless high-school bulletin boards, vacant walls, etc., before eventually the actors walk or run into these shots. And the sound-track competes as worst element."},{"rating":"1","title":"A parody of itself- what a bad movie!","review":"I rented this movie because, like everyone else has said, Halloween wasn't bad and I was in the mood for a horror film. Not only was this more gory, it also had very little plot, lackluster characters, annoying disco music (they spend almost 10 minutes on a disco dance scene that should never have been put into the final cut), and TERRIBLE acting. The characters are very fake and even if the movie would have been entertaining just to see people die the death scenes are not even that creative. The script is terrible and the events seem very random.

Though it has fallen off the radar for most horror lists, definitely check it out at some point. There is plenty of 80's low budget cheese to be had, and it makes for a good history lesson in the evolution of horror over the past thirty years.

It was published in 1999, and unless you want to focus on movies from 1931 to 1998, this is a poor choice.There is no good reason why this book has not be updated, such as \\"1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die\\" which has been revised, adding 17 newer movies, and deleting 17 of the prior 1001 movies. (I wouldn't have minded them simply adding the 17 movies, without deleting any older movies.)Another good choice is Peter Travers' new \\"1000 Best Movies on DVD.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Why include unavailable movies?","review":"This is going to be the shortest review I've ever written. I checked out this book from the library and photocopied the \\"by genre\\" list in the back. I checked off the ones I had seen (suprisingly few considering how long I've been an avid film fan.) Anyway, as I was going through the list I found the 1950's version of \\"Death of a Salesman\\" listed. Now, everyone who has ever looked for that film will tell you it's not available on home video. So, why include it? Anyone who dared to try and tackle watching even a fraction of the movies listed here would have to use another guide such as Leonard Maltin's just to ascertain wheather or not the film is available. I am thinking of looking into \\"The best Films to Rent you've never heard of\\" Its actually an achievable goal and at the very least you know the films are available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indispensable !","review":"This collection makes for hours of great reading.

If you don't like it you probably didn't discover anything. The fun of it is figuring out the puzzles but the book helps. The ending was disapointing but it just makes you want to get Riven. Does anyone know of some good games you have to think to figure out, like MYST?"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!!!","review":"For those of you who say it is boring, that is because you just aren't thinking enough and you don't like chalenges. This is a great game for those of you that that like to think and be challanged.

But, the choice is yours."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this game!! (sorry NBA)","review":"If you don't like great gameplay, wonderful graphics, and a riveting storyline, this is not the game for you. But if you are into mysteries and have a lot of time on your hands to solve puzzles, GET THIS GAME!! (hint:Go for the strategy guide.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alternative to the mindnumbing slashers","review":"Myst is a game you either love or hate. If you like slashers/blood & gore/explosions/disgusting things attacking your \\"character\\" or any number of mindless reactionary scenarios, then this is definitely NOT the game for you.BUT, if you like incredibly detailed scenery, an unbelieveably stirring soundtrack, non-trivial puzzles that for once your dog can't solve as fast as you can, and something that actually encourages you to think outside of the box, then this is the game for you.I'm not saying that those death and destruction games don't have their place, but for the more sophisticated user the choice is clear. Myst is definitely not for the undisciplined.For the most enjoyment, be sure to purchase along with your system a medium to high quality speaker set (they've gotten so good these days that it almost doesn't matter which you get). The sounds from the game often play a part in the experience and you wouldn't want to miss a single note."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walk Away Renee","review":"I purchased this CD for its hauntingly beautiful version of the l960's song, Walk Away Renee.

I loaded it to iTunes for him and after almost 30 years listened to the songs again. She's just amazing! Not for the masses but if you're keen on the beauty of human harmonics, captivating lyrics and music that can move your mind, body and soul, you will love Rickie Lee Jones! I do - so much so I just turned my collection of 2 CD's into 10. I was able to find (some on Amazon) all of her pre 2000 works including the very rare 'Girl at Her Volcano'.

No Aerosmth? What????","review":"Boston is one of the greatest musics scenes known to man....Aerosmith may be the most famous band missing, but the ommission of the Mighty Mighty Bosstones is a travesty. At least they included \\"Tessie\\", the song made popular in 1918, and by doing so, they included the Dropkick Murphy's, another great Boston Band. But no Bosstones, Aerosmith, Guster, Aimee Mann, Pixies, Buffalo Tom, Slide (who released a CD in 95 or 96 entitled \\"Forgiving Buckner\\"), Julian Hatfield, The Lemonheads, Chubby, or other great Boston Bands. Could have been an ode to Boston, instead, it was a joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect & balanced recording","review":"This is one of best choices for Tchaikovsky's 1812 Ouverture.

I thought your character's withdraw scene scared the crap out of me. Okay, let's get to the scene when Halle's character and the kids are at the funeral. She has this mean, stoic look on her face. When Benecio's character comes by, she doesn't shake his hand or anything. My question was:\\"Why is she so cold towards him?\\" Then, when it came to point of the man living with them, that's when she spat out, \\"Why couldn't it be you?\\" she was even meaner.

My only regrets are that I didn't see it YEARS ago, and that I didn't have more tissues close at hand for the first time I watched it. The second time around, I was well prepared - but, don't get me wrong, it is NOT a \\"chick flick\\".

Keep in mind that I think the Incredible String band is probably the most innovative band to ever pick up instruments...That being said, even they had some nerve racking moments, most memorable to these ears was on Hangman's Beautiful daughter....Nothing there could compare to the lows encountered on this record...In some cases, it is almost completely devoid of structure or melody...Very disappointing....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep Searching","review":"This battery lasts 'maybe' a day in my Cingular 3125 with very light use.

If only his novel was that relevant and riveting. Instead, his tale is filled with flowery language, little character development (motivations often make no sense like the obsession between Hirsch and Ned). Never did I feel I was actually experiencing Charleston in the 20s; there is just not enough detailed description (which is sad since it appears the author is and excellent researcher/historian).I think a nonfictional account of his research for the book would have been a much better subject for the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Built in Cambodia?","review":"These hanging file folders could be a bit more sturdy.

I rate Higher 5 Stars PLUS PLUS PLUS!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soulful synth-pop","review":"This classic album came out of the early 1980s synth-pop craze. OMD and Eurythmics were two other duo's that produced superb music in the style, and Human League's wonderful album Dare dates from the same era. Moyet's soulful vocals blend perfectly with Clarke's simple but engaging synth melodies to create timeless pop classics like Don't Go, Situation and the sublime Only You (The Flying Pickets recorded a remarkable a capella version). This song is sheer poetry! Not all the tracks are of this high standard, but they're all interesting, including the sound collage thingie I Before E. This is certainly one of the masterpieces that brought synth-pop to the mainstream in the footsteps of artists like Kraftwerk,David Bowie, Suicide and Gary Numan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A defining moment of 80's musical history","review":"Yaz is one of the greatest musical offerings from the 80's Alternative movement. Their music helped to define and give rise to many artists. Any true 80's fan should have this albumn in their collection. I would invite anyone who has not heard it to give Upstairs a spin on their player. I think that any true music connaisseur should make Upstairs at Eric's a part of their collection. This is more than a good listen; it is sublime. You have to hear what Eric has upstairs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitive '80s Album","review":"If I were to produce a soundtrack for a movie set in the early '80s, (The) Situation from \\"Upstairs at Eric's\\" would have to be the lead theme song. Without a doubt, Alison Moyet's powerful, human voice contrasting with the nearly mechanical synth sound of Vince Clark really reflected the tensions during the Reagan/Bush/Thatcher years. This was/is political music of the era -- and you can dance to it. This is an album that every serious '80s New Wave fan must own. It is defintive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fond memories:","review":"Great synth-pop! Classic!

Adios amigos..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Best Electronic Albums Of All Time","review":"DM's \\"Speak & Spell\\" came out a year before, and everyone was in awe over the British Electronic Band. And then Vince Clarke left, and formed Yaz(oo) with Alison Moyet, and what a great move it was. For both Clark and DM. \\"Upstairs At Eric's\\" is a masterpiece of music making. It was the first time that anyone had heard a bluesy female singer backed by dark electronic sound. What a combination. Not only did it sound good. The songs are good as well. \\"Don't Go\\", \\"Only You\\" and \\"Situation\\" are classic synth-pop songs. Alison's laugh in \\"Situation\\" has been sampled by dozens of other songs including \\"The Macarena\\", while other Yaz songs have been sampled or covered by many an artist, which goes to show how much of an influence these two were. Other tracks which are outstaning are \\"Midnight\\", \\"Goodbye Seventies\\" and the brooding \\"Winter Kills\\". This would have to be in my Top 20, of the best albums ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Classic","review":"Yazoo (that the duo's real name) was a short lived act but both their albums \\"Upstairs at Eric's\\" and \\"You and Me Both\\" are classic 80's synthpop albums.

The comedy was not needed in this movie. The star of the film, Cliff Lok, did his best to make up for the boring plot line. If it wasn't for Wilson Tong doing the fight directing and movie directing, it wouldn't probably be the big hit that it was. This is definitely one to add to your collection, for the fight scenes are superior, especially the ones with Wilson Tong and Li Hai Sheng in them. Maybe not a genius movie, but not a bad idea!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of real-fu action","review":"Not bad at all. No wire-fu (I like wire-fu) but the intensity and complexity of the fight scenes kept my attention and the plot had a few interesting twists and so was not as predictable as some. The styles were an invulnerable 'spiritual' style and lots of animal styles. The weapons were knives, staff, hoop(!) and fans.The reason I did not give it more stars (I would give it 3.5 stars if it was possible) was because once in a while the choreography allowed us to see that it was, indeed, choreography and the *attrocious* sound quality. The video quality, well, like many others of this genre, it was taken from an old reel of film - but it did not distract me from the movie itself, except during the very 1st and very last frames."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pulls your hair, painful experience","review":"I bought this product after visiting the manufacturer''s website, and by recommendation of a professional stylist.

There was NO way to override it or choose which device to which it should install. I contacted Customer Service (an issue in itself) via phone and email. Emailed response told me to uninstall my Palm software. How stupid! I have no intention of uninstalling the Palm just yet. Meanwhile, trying to PHONE Customer Service was a joke. I tried a few times, once spending over 60 minutes on hold, another over 90 minutes, with no human contact. I have a business to run, not plenty of time to waste!

For people that don't have the courage to watch the VERY scary parts of The Exorcist than they must watch Repossessed. Because i think that Linda Blair is a great actress and people must see at least Repossessed because she can act great when it comes to demonic possessions. If Linda Blair reads this than i want to say to her that she is a great actress and must keep up the good work. And the last thing i want to say is that people must watch Repossessed and The Exorcist because their both are great movies.

But most people found it pathetic that Linda Blair used comedy to hang onto her one shot at fame. Linda was not funny in this film at all. If it weren't for Leslie Nielson I wouldn't have wasted my time. I loved LN in Naked Gun and he's funny no matter how bad a film is. He proves it with Repossessed, a tired comedy remake of The Exorcist. There were some very scary moments in this film and it started with Blair thinking she had comedic skills of any kind. She was a great child actor but the fuse sparked out a long time ago. This is okay to watch if you don't want to think or laugh that much but there are far more better horror comedies out there.\\" Transylvania 6-5000\\" and \\" Scary Movie I \\" are hilarious.

I think the problem is they makers could not decide whether this is a Nielsen or Blair movie. The movie ends up being about neither one. Neither very scary nor that funny.I got it because of Nielsen because I love his acting. I have got his stuff from Forbidden Planet all the way to Naked Gun series and more. I wanted funny! It has its funny moments but for most part it padded with \\"filler\\". The first third was slow; boring and not that funny. Then it got better as there was more of Nielsen. Then it goes down in the final third. Basically the good parts are a direct function of having Nielsen. The rest you might as well skip. It seems like they went cheap on the movie and instead of 100% Nielsen we get about 1/3. The padding is done by a whole lot of second rate music video. They should remove the fillers; and make it half as long then it will go up a few stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Father Mayai?

Well, David, should we check with the Atlanta Falcons and Philidelphia Eagles and ask if they're part of the conspiracy? Icke also goes to point out other things, like the fact that the domes in Paris, London, and Washington look the same. So what! It's called a sytle, like Gothic or Baroque, you know?

You can't just say:' No way.. balogna..\\" because of the researched facts he has.One glaring error that I can see is,his inability to see the power of the hand of the creator, in all of this.

I agree with the book that we are being controled and lied to through, banks, religion, war ect, but the only way to believe the reptilian part of the book is to see one of these things shape shift.

Icke is to be commended because he is one of the few researchers who does what a researcher is supposed to do and that is to look at ALL the evidence and not just part of it to find truth. He presents the evidence and you decide the truth. I found his evidence compelling but there needs to be more to give it a probabilty of truth.

As a historian, I can tell by his writing that he made no attempt to disprove his own theories or try to question them in any way. He just read the fact and wrote it down. For an high school research paper this is excusible, but for a published book no. Icke needs to lower his ego a little and doubt his own accuracy. I certainly feel that his style left much to desire, as well as his research, little of which did not come from \\"biased\\" material. (Reading a simple history book one can still connect events).

I must say that for me the stand out tracks are \\"Fool For Your Loving\\" \\"Cold Sweat\\" & \\"Kill The King\\" which they totally shred. But that being said, there aren't any bad tracks on here. All of the tracks he has put that Jorn touch on and made them in most cases very much better. It is a shame that the American market doesn't take notice to this Norweigan born vocalist and embrace a true artist. Credit needs to be given to where it is due.

The documents are interesting, though a little confused, especially as regarding the plates that illustrate them; it is not always possible to tell what is what. And the first section is a fascinating overview, well written (or well translated [from the French], it's hard to know with a translation), though with little in it i didn't actually know already.

Having struggled for years with stains on carpets due to cats, mostly, I found carbona. It has the most effective solution, along with a brush applicator, that cleans remaining stains from becoming permanent stains. There really is nothing new to say about this product, except to say that I have thrown away the others, and only need carbona."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not even silent!","review":"I don't think I have the ears of a dog but I sure can hear the piercing sound of this \\"silent\\" whistle.

Its on a drawer somewhere but has not been used. I feel like I bought something cheap so it's worthless too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this item from Amazon!!!","review":"This lawnmower was broken in several places when it arrived. The handlebar was torn, a metal piece on the handlebar was split in two, the clip on one of the wheels was busted, and the bottle of oil that was supposed to be included was cut in two and everything was covered in oil. I was stunned!!! Amazon refused to take it back and told me to call a Lawn-Boy service center(which I had to find on my own). I took the lawnmower in to a service center. It has been two weeks and I still do not have my mower, as the parts have not arrived. I would recommend going in to a retail store to buy this item, so you can see what you are getting. This has been awful!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sensa-speed fragile, delivered broken","review":"Mover arrived broken. The sensa-speed had been pulled out of its track and a little plastic part was broken. I bet the mower will run awesome once it's fixed but in the meantime I'm left with a new mower and having to jumb through hoops. Called Lawnboy and they said they wouldn't have shipped it that way so it may not be a warantee item. Not impressed with buying lawnboy mowers, didn't seem like they stand behind product unconditionally. Lawnboy cust service recomended we contact Amazon about returning or UPS to file a claim and blame them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality Control","review":"This unit shipped without a hole drilled in the handle for attaching the brake. The gas cap was also missing the vent. This caused hours of frustration as the mower would mow for 5 minutes and stop. Now that the mower is working it is a nice mower. But the lesson here is never purchase something online you cannot return."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived Damaged","review":"My new Lawn Boy arrived from FedEx today. When I saw how the box was all beat up and torn, I was worried. Sure enough, the plastic clamp at the end of the cable that drives the rear wheels was broke. I found a place that services mowers. I'll bring it in for service tomorrow and and will provide an update later. Some of the parts look flimsly so I'm a bit worried how this machine will hold up over time. Also, I don't have much respect for FedEx as it appears that they don't have much respect your stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"best lawnmower ever had","review":"had a lot of different brands of mowers, this is the best . I will always buy lawnboy from now on.definitely would buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lawn Boy Insight 10685","review":"The Lawn Boy Insight 10685 is a great value. It starts really easy and the Sens-a-Speed propulsion system makes it feel like the mower is gliding easily in front of me as I walk. I can get the lawn mowed quick. The grass bagger is easily removed and replaced. The quick stow handle is a great feature too. There are other mowers with more bells and whistles, but this mower is a good solid mower and a good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mower for the price","review":"I used this mower only once for now, but was impressed by the ease of use.This is my first self propelled mower, and the sense a speed function was great. You never fight the propelling function; it just follows you, stops when you stop, starts when you move, effortlessly.Both my sons were excited to try it (14 and 12) and they could use this machine very easily, even though they had problems on our slope with our previous non propelled mower.Very happy so far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Satisified","review":"I bought this one because I really liked the features I couldn't find on any other mower. The ease of bag removal,great handle storage and the sens-a-speed. All have proven to be fantastic. Started right up and I was off and mowing. The shipping speed was amazing... I had it within three days of ordering. You won't go wrong with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware if you buy from deerso","review":"I Purchased a lawnboy from Deerso through amazon online as a birthday gift for a friends mother who had a broken lawnmower. I told the mother and friend it would arrive in a few days as that's what the website said when I checked out. Two weeks went by. It never showed up. Deerso never sent the item and amazon help said that deerso canceled the order and did not notifiy anyone. No phone call. No email. Nothing. They did not tell me or the person it was going to who now has two foot grass and is angry with me. Amazon thought deerso was probably out of stock as they quit selling the particular model I ordered that week. Because of the way the order was canceled it's not possible to give deerso direct feedback as a seller- but beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use","review":"The box came in 2 days, and we pretty much just opened it up, filled it with gas, and started it up! Cuts grass quickly and without much effort. We like the feature where you can fold over the handle to store it in the garage."},{"rating":"2","title":"good when it works.","review":"Product came out together but the plastic oil jug was secure in the blades and it had a leak in it. It spilled all over the box. Had to buy another can of oil. The sensor speed stop working on the 2nd lawn cut. Had to tighted the line going to the motor. It works great when it does."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good mower so far","review":"Mower came in a box with the handle and parts half assembled so it took a bit to put it together. The manual was not that much help. Cranked up fine and runs great, just like the manual said. I did change oil after 2 hours use and a pin from the handle shut off lever got loose when I tipped the mower and it dropped out, I was lucky to find it in the grass. I have had a self propelled Lawn-Boy last over 11 years before this one, I hope this does as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended unless you have mechanical ability","review":"Bought this and upon 1st use the clip on the handle which holds the cables kept popping off, had to secure it with a worm drive clamp. On its 2nd use the drive stopped functioning, had to reset the cable and torque the retainer, which is plastic, hopefully this won't be a continuous problem. I can not in good conscious recommend this mower to someone unless you have mechanical ability to keep repairing this mower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful no muffler guard and not for hills","review":"Got 2nd degree burns adjusting the wheels, there is no muffler guard on the side of the muffler to protect against burns.I am small and it is difficult to use on hills and rough sod.

Seems like it should've lasted longer for the price..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mower...","review":"This Mower is a fine piece of machinery. Light-weight and easy to control with the sens-a-speed feature. Very powerful. My neighbors love it too! There are two minor drawbacks. The plastic clips that fit over the metal tines to adjust the height of the rear wheels were put on backwards at the factory and broke during the first attempt to make adjustments. A new set were put on correctly and work fine. If there is a detractor to the system, its the grass catcher... it is a bit small and requires more empties than my old machine; but I am willing to put up with an extra couple of trips to the dumpster for the ease and power of this machine! Overall, I am very happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lawn Boy Mower Model #10685","review":"Used it 3 times, the third time a grinding noise was heard and the drive would stop. I took it into a lawn boy approved service center which aftertwo days concluded that the transmission was rubbing against the rear drive wheels. He did not know how to repair it. Called the factory and within a day they gave a recommendation on how to fix it. He now had to order the parts. The repair is still in progress, I don't know whether it will like new or a rube goldberg type repair.I will demand a new mower if the repair is something less that a new mower. Of course my demanding a new mower is likely to be laughed off. We shall see. Will update this when I get my mower back, talk to the service guy and see how well it runs.I am really disappointed in Lawn Boy and Consumers Report ranked the model that I bought as a best buy.Chet Doerr"},{"rating":"1","title":"Came Broken..Lawnboy customer service needs help.","review":"After initially having a problem with Lawnboy customer service over a part that came broken during shipping, this lawnmower has turned out to be a joy to work with. You just touch the handle and it just starts moving on its own. Can't believe I never had a self-propelled mower until now. This seems to be a very strong and dependable mower so far after a year of use. It did come packed very unsecurely in a flimsy box with hardly any protection for the mower inside but luckily Amazon came thru and allowed me to return this non-returnable item and sent a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously imbalanced, dishonestly biased.","review":"Serbians did commit genocide and other horrible atrocities in Bosnia, and Serbian Orthodox clergy and laity played parts in these both implicitly and explicitly. The sanctification and legend of Prince Lazar played a part in the justifications and mentality of the Serbs as well. However, Sells systematically ignores the Serbian church's frequent and often dangerous resistance to the wars and genocide. He has a remarkable ignorance of the history of the Balkans before Tito. Finally he overestimates the significance of the Lazar myth in the Serb's actions: not all nationalistic myths produce large-scale genocide!Sells barely veils his hostility toward religion (not only Serbian Orthodoxy), and although the events are tragic and terrifying, I hope we value clear thought and honesty more than Michael Sells. He feels passionately, but his book is merely another inflammatory tirade, nearly as mythological and certainly as simplified as the Serbs' Lazar myth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trenchant insight into the Bosnian crisis","review":"Unlike other accounts of the recent wars in the Balkans, Michael Sells' book does not merely chronicle the events that led to the catastrophe. The value of this fine work lies in the author's ability to present the underlying ideas, cultural constructs and religious passions that have flamed the genocide in Bosnia. The author focuses mostly on the Serb-Orthodox construct of Christoslavism, but also shows how the Western prejudices against the region have allowed genocide to occur in Europe at the end of the twentieth century. Resting on well-documented research (over fifty pages of footnotes plus appendices), it is an erudite and passionate argument for kindness and humanity towards those less fortunate than us."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read","review":"This is a unique look behind the conflict in Yugoslavia and the mythology created by Serb nationalists that fomented incredible crimes against humanity. He looks at the religious and cultural mythology created and revived by a warped interpretation of Balkan history that many nationalists used. I only wish this book was longer, it is a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Realities","review":"Perpaps no other single book does so much to be 'scared straight' about the realities of 4 critical issues: how religion (here Christianity) and abuse of history can be mainpulated to cause war and attrocities; how and why the word (and international law implications) genocide was avoided; the resulting complicity of the press and international institutions that are supposed to keep peace and stand for principles; how simple answers like 'always fighting each other' were lies and evasions by people wanting a rationalization for not getting involved and even for not caring. It will be difficult to understand the early 21st century without reading this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely unhappy with Marin Fig bars order!","review":"My order arrived open and very stale! Some of the packages were open and the fig bars were rock hard! I ordered them in good faith trusting the figs would as least be edible. I was not able to return this product either, totally wasting my money! There is a no return policy in fine print. I'm very dissatisfied with this 0rder!

Good quality but metal swivel slams against camera and make much noise. While at all times seeking to be as non-existent as possible while shooting something - from wildlife to a youth sporting event - the noise is awfully distracting. Great quality - poor decision to use metal parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm...","review":"Mr. Lowenthals description of his Dark Retreat didn't seem to have a lot in common with the 'real' Tibetan 49-day Dark retreat and its practices. I know at least 4 people who have done the 49-day dark retreat of which one is very close to me and as much a Westerner as Mr. Lowenthal. It is 'unthinkable' to leave the dark room, even if it is with a mask on, as well as having sex, food brought into the room by a person or even talk to several people while doing this practice. I must say... It is good he wrote \\"A Western Approach\\" as this certainly is NOT the Tibetan approach :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the music?","review":"Sadly, this DVD lacks the required musical underpinning to keep it afloat. I wonder how anyone made the required voyages in the opera with such poor sound from the pit - and hence a general lack of bouyancy and direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Adventure","review":"What a fun book! Enjoyed it thoroughly, and admire the author's meticulous research. His love for Verne and his characters is evident. Anderson pulls off perhaps the advenure novel of the year."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO!","review":"Not my cup of tea at all. If I could edit out about half of the book. The nonsense sections where the impossible happens, then it might be ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trittbrettfahrer","review":"When books are successful,like Jules Vernes books were, some of us think we can use the character or name of that character that made the book successful and become equally succesful. That is true in this case. Maybe just a clever sales gimmick. Not as interesting as one would expect when hearing the name Nemo. Nemo was an Indian Prince and will remain an Indian Prince. His achievements were better known by Verne himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"The pot calls the kettle black","review":"So:Jules Verne, one of the founding fathers of Science Fiction, is revealed to be a bad writer who relies on a severely bastardized Captain Nemo to supply him with ideas. This is just beautiful! I find it fitting that this premise is conceived of by Kevin J. Anderson, a writer who has relied on other writer's ideas for his career (Star Wars, Dune, X-Files, etc.).Please, if you have any respect for Jules Verne or classic literature in general, do NOT bother with this book. Nemo, as envisioned by Anderson, bears almost no resemblance to the character depicted in 20,000 LUTS and Mysterious Island. I checked it out of the library, so at least I didn't have to pay; however, that's 4 nights of reading time that I can never reclaim."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captain Nemo","review":"I am about half way through the book and it does a good job of seaming how Captain Nemo became the man that he did and the connection with his supposed friend Jules Verne is a very interesting premise. I do see how Kevin Anderson is using the Verne books to write the storyline and waiting to see how it all ends though foreshadowing has not been apparent. So far a decent read but I am waiting to get into the how and where the Nautilus is built and Nemo's reason for using it, though it is hinted at in the book with his bad experience with pirates as a cabin boy on an exploration ship."},{"rating":"1","title":"It came from the bottom of the sea....","review":"I'm not going to mince words, this book is horrible...It's a pastiche of Verne's life, intercut with the adventures of \\"Andre Nemo\\" who wanders around the world, involving himself with incident after incident drawn from the pages of Verne's novels, and minor character, after minor character named after Verne's charactersMy biggest gripe however is the vision of Nemo presented, this is not the mysterious stranger of the 20,000 leagues under the sea, or the technocratic Indian Prince, driven from his home after a failed rebellion against colonial masters as presented in Mysterious Island. Having all the works of Verne to draw from, and KJ Anderson, instead chose to draw his Nemo from the wide screen, he has drawn his \\"Dark Genius\\" from the vision of Walt Disney, and Harper GoffThe result is what you expect, a poor adaptation of an adaptation, true neither to the original, or the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"If you are a Verne's fan then you have to read this book. I really don't like to analyze the style of the author or if the events make sense or not because this is the type of book that you just live the adventure. If you can visualize a story while you are reading (I love to do this with all of Verne's stories) then you have to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed","review":"As others have said, Anderson describes Verne as a no-talent hack unable to come up with any original ideas without his periodic letters from Nemo. I find this especially ironic since Anderson has done nothing himself but tell synopses of Verne's work with only the barest of cohesion to fit into his storyline.The only redeeming virtue of this book s that it may inspire readers to explore Verne's orignal works for themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"The World Through Another's Eyes...","review":"Anderson paints a wonderful picture of Verne and Nemo's lives, loves, and the characters that will eventually be added to Verne's tales. They are flesh-and-blood believable, even while experiencing outrageous things.Having praised this feat, however, I have to admit being put off by the constant theme of Verne not being able to accomplish anything without a heavy Nemo crutch. Far from being one of the most imaginative authors of his time, he's shown bereft of creative thought. Reads more like a critique than an homage at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Captain Nemo(The Fantastic History of a Dark Genius)","review":"The novel was amusing enough to complete but nothing great. It struck me as a sort of Disney version of Verne's characters and would probably make a fairly decent film for them. I haven't read the Jules Verne novels in years so I can't compare K.J. Anderson's story line to the Verne novels accurately. What this novel did do was spark an interest in me to go back to the original stories and reread them. For that alone I think the novel was worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointed","review":"The audio and video components cut out for over five minutes through out the video.

Unfortunately the quality of the recording sounds like someone took a cassette tape recorder and recorded the songs off an AM radio. You can barely hear Willie on some songs, his voice fades in and out, and one one song it seems someone must of started the tape recorder late and cut off the first few seconds of the song. His voice is still pretty good so it seems these recordings are from the 80's. It's a shame that before someone made this CD in their mother's basement, they spent some money cleaning up the tapes. Someone thought the sound was so bad that it must not be stereo.

Although they were recorded roughly at the same time (early sixties) the difference in sound quality is drastic.Chesky really did a good job in remastering this one, the presence and detail is stunning, really puts to shame many digital recording from last tuesday :)I also had never heard of Massimo Freccia, but I must say I like his job as well.

I'm gonna make a long story short. this thing is great if your never gonna use an attachment and your only gonna use it for 5min. It is one step below horrible at cutting with attachments and it gets very very hot after about 5-10min. I'm talking 3rd degree burn hot. With my old one I could cut mine and my three boys hair all in one sitting, but with this I have to stop half way through one head just to let it cool down.

I no longer get irritated skin and the razor bumps on the back of my neck have all but vanished. I was very surprised at how close it actually shaved me without causing any irritation whatsoever. It definitely gets closer than the rechargeable trimmers that I am used to and has the power to easily work through my coarse beard hair. My only disappointment is that I did not by this kit sooner!

So far my 2nd one has lasted many shaves now great for bodybuilders or anyone who hates body hair and wants a very fast shave.

I am going to try and order the professional model and am going to return this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak T-Trimmers","review":"I had these trimmers less than a year before they became unusable. Prior to that they were ok, and I mean just ok. The power of the motor is extremely low, or weak, and the blades became dull very quickly. So much so, I would have to stroke the same area two or three time before I got the desired cut. I tried adjusting the blades but that didn't help. I would not recommend these clippers for the following reasons:(1) The motor is very weak;(2) The blades became dull very quick (even after trying to adjust them); and(3) The overall life span of these clippers is relatively short, less than a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is it","review":"i realy love the clippers they work like the gray ones that they use at the barber you will no belive how good these are and lower cost check them out youll like to thank me i wish i could tell everyone who needs edgers these are the ones and cheaper"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth & Quiet....","review":"I purchased this clipper as a replacement to the traditional t-liner that has served me well for over fifteen years. So far, this new clipper set is proving itself to be every bit the measure of the t-liner, and then some. The included guides make trimming and shaping my \\"Caesar\\" and facial hair a one clipper affair. Smooth and quiet, I can trim my hair every other morning without waking my wife(truly a blessing in itself). I would say, though, that unlike the t-liner, this clipper is deceptively sharp. With the t-liner, you know immediately if you've pressed too hard. These, however, are so smooth, you don't realize you've cut yourself until after the job is done. One thing I find annoying is the placement of the switch. You can accidently turn the clipper off in the middle of a trim or line up; not the end of the world. All in all, I find this clipper to be very satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Substitute for Razors/Shaver","review":"I use the trimmer to shave, shape-up and/or shave my head. It's GREAT! It is very comfortable - close cuts w/no nicks, cuts, or scratches. Excellent for the neck area (front&back). I use a different brand of clippers when I'm not bald but I can't use them to shave or shape-up b/c the shave isn't close, the blades hurt trying to get a close shave and I cut myself if I'm not careful. My 1st set of Andis clippers broke after 5-6 yrs, but there's no comparison - I had to go back to Andis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Clipper Horrible Reliability","review":"I purchased these clippers on 1 March 2012 for many reasons, one being the reputation that Andis has, one being my barber recommended it, and one being friends that regularly use it recommended it. The clippers worked great everytime I used them, I kept them clean, never dropped it, treated it like a limited edition hall of fame baseball card... And here I am not even two months into it and the clippers have suddenly stopped working in the middle of trimming session. I'm hoping Andis will honor their warranty and fix/replace the clippers. These clippers do a great job of shaping up beard, necklines, etc, everything it advertises, just wish they lasted longer than two months! It's inconvenient to have broken clippers and wait for a solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Terrible. Got one use out of it, and then the thing was useless. Awful product.

Not a single piece of hair fell from my head.I pulled out my old but faltering Wahl, turned it on and we were off to the races.Maybe this product was defective. Or maybe it's junk.

My own fault as I went for a cheap set instead of investing money into a model that would fulfill my needs. This model overall just feels cheap. Additionally, the blade arrived off center and remains so to this day, no matter how many times I've tried to adjust it. At times it works well enough but too often I can't tell if it's actually trimming any hair. Not worth the money, pay a little more and get a model that actually works all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLOSE CUTTING CLIPPERS!!!","review":"PROS: THIS CLIPPER CUTS VERY CLOSE AND IS ALSO VERY COMFORTABLE.CON: THESE CLIPPERS GET VERY HOT VERY QUICKLY.THEY ARE DECENT FOR THE PRICE.Rom 5:6 Christ died for us at a time when we were helpless and sinful.Rom 5:7 No one is really willing to die for an honest person, though someone might be willing to die for a truly good person.Rom 5:8 But God showed how much he loved us by having Christ die for us, even though we were sinful."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT MEANT TO CUT MY TYPE OF HAIR!!

I shave my head regularly but my old clipper had broken so it had gotten to maybe a quarter inch long. I tried to trim it with this clipper. I would go over the same spot over and over again and it would still be super patchy with little clumps of hair everywhere. After 10 minutes and only having a quarter of my head done, and that with still random hairs still sticking out everywhere I gave up. I borrowed a friends shaver to finish.

Vladimir Nabokov created the original novel, Peter Berry wrote the screenplay (why are writers downplayed so much?), and Marlene Gorris directed.

I never owned any of jorns albums except the debut album of masterplan and 1 song from avantasia so I had to get me atleast 1 of his solo albums with more songs as in a compilation album so I got this. His singing was outstanding (I guess anyone can take a hint) and I didn't expect much from the music but it was a real metal paradise and the album cover looks awesome with the crows the lake and that fancy chair.Im still pretty much a new fan to jorn's stuff so I figured this is the best place to start and any jorn albums are worthy of owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"thunderous riffs to melt your ear drums","review":"In addition to a covers album, Jorn Lande delves into his vault to resurrect some forgotten favorites, as well as re-working a few here in there.

There are unfortunately not 5 new tracks here, only 2 (tracks 2 & 16). Track 8 comes from the Millenium \\"Hourglass\\" disc, track 11 from the 1st Allen-Lande disc, and track 14 from the 1st Ark record. Of the 2 previously unreleased ones, track 16 \\"Big\\" is really not up to par in the lyrics department (\\"I'm big in Japan, they know my name in Iran\\")(!!). So because of that and the omission of further details, only 4 stars on this one. I didn't A>B all of the tracks against their originals but I can hear re-recording or possibly new mixes on several, except for the track from the Allen-Lande disc; that one is a straight lift to my ears.Not a whole lot here for the Jorn fan who has everything else, but nice for those who don't.

This song is a mediocre borderline country pop song that isn't all that great. I mean it's not terrible, but it's simply a very generic top 40 pop/country/rock 3 and half minute radio darling.

Trust me you'll love it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"aint that much distruction","review":"thug 2 is sweet. its called the world distruction tour but there isnt that much distruction. all the create modes are back including create a graphic. you make a graphic and then use it to tag walls. for what is of the distrution you get to skate in more places. what sucks in the story mode is that you cant choose what team you're gonna be on. first you go to Tony, then Bam, and back to Tony. remember in the first thug game when eric was there well hes on Bams team. instead of cars they have scooters and go karts. in this game you're not just you. you can be up to 4 people. the pro, guest, secret man, and you. comparing to the last game this game is short unless you're on sick. it dont matter what system you have just buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty koool","review":"this game is really awesome becuz it has millions of new features that the other game doesn't have. its sweet cuz there is like a classic mode where u play like older games. the thing that sux about this game is that the story mode is really confusing. its wayyyyyyyyyyyy different than the other games."},{"rating":"1","title":"booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo","review":"This video games stinks the graphics stinks.

Tommy also said the first level is hard and that is not true you just suck, the first level is so easy. My only complaint is that this game is easy even on medium mode and also it is to short.

Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, and Tony Hawk's Underground 2. I would have to say, this is surely the ugliest of the bunch, with many more rough goals and strange humor. The kid in the wheelchair is disturbing, the goals are sometimes a little off the wall, and the skaters will go to any means for a good practical joke. On the other hand, the gameplay is simply addictive, as I seem to get stuck playing it for up to 4 hours at a time.So I guess if you are 15 or over, and enjoy the Tony Hawk games, this is a no brainer. It's just plain, excellent gameplay, and that's all there is to it.All in all, this game is a positive playing experience, every bit as good as the Pro Skater series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"This overall is a very good game.

Or would people have to order the combo puppy with spray bottle and Kong? Anyway...I sprayed the, um, spray on the wooden furniture. My puppy sniffed it, walked away, came back to gnaw some more. Bummer. I think that the efficacy of the spray depends on the tastebuds of the dog.

We even tried spraying it on his waste to keep him from licking it, but that didn't work either. Since it doesn't work, I'm not sure it's good for anything else, so I guess I'll throw it away unless I can use it as a glass cleaner or something!

It actually makes him sneeze, so he might be reluctant to chew things sprayed with it because he doesn't like sneezing, rather than because he doesn't like the taste.

I hosed down my briefcase, and I mean literally soaked this thing in the bitter spray and laid it next to my dog. At first she wasn't paying any attention, but when she noticed it was there, she immediately began to chew, and the spray did not deter her from going at it like a ribeye.

But no, he had to write a long, left-wing diatribe against Bill Clinton's political adversaries, and for good measure, take a gratuitous swipe at ol' Joe McCarthy and cross-reference him and the current Republican Congress with Hitler. This book was long, drawn-out and chock full of sacrifices on the altar of the Democratic Party. And he calls the Republicans \\"ideologues\\". Talk about the stove and the freaking kettle. I cannot recommend this book to anyone interested in the Clinton impeachment of 1999. I would hardly consider the chief spinmaster of the Clinton Administration to be an objective source for anything but the Clinton Administration's arrogance of power.Theodore Roosevelt said that the average citizen owed the President loyalty insofar as the President showed loyalty to the Constitution and the United States. And in writing this review, that is precisely what I am doing."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT BOOK to help you get to sleep at night","review":"Boring, boring, boring, zzzzzz, he just keeps repeating himself and repeating himself and trying to come up with 1000 ways to say the same thing so he can create a whole book, and then he repeats himself and its boring and he repeats himself and its boring and he repeats himself and its boring and zzzzzzz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carville is treading water here","review":"This book reminds me of a typical Saturday Night Live movie: one good joke and 85 minutes of filler. The story of Carville's history with the Clintons and why he defended them is interesting and well-written. Unfortunately, once told, Carville needed to write over a hundred more pages in order to have a book-length volume. At almost every juncture where he could have written something insightful about loyalty (like his marriage to a very partisan Republican and his love for his racist grandmother), he rarely fails to back away, throw his hands in the air with a \\"gosh, ain't that weird?\\" sort of attitude, and leave it at that. If you're a hard-core partisan Democrat, you might like it just because it hits all the right spots by beating up on nearly every prominent Republican in sight. But that's not exactly tough, and other books like \\"Rush Limbaugh Is A Big Fat Idiot\\" do the same thing, but with humor and more than ten minutes of research."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Political Book","review":"This is largely my fault for not reading reviews carefully, but if you're looking for a book with great Political insight like Love, War, and Running For President...this is NOT the book for you.While it's an entertaining book and I like Carville's style, I wish there was more info about WHAT Carville did for Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal and HOW he went about doing it, than hearing all his views on loyalty.I just wanted something different out of this book and don't be surprised by what you DON'T get"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinkin'","review":"I had to read this book for my book group, so I finished it. If I hadn't had to do so, I would've quit after a chapter or two. The book was poorly researched, poorly written, and poorly organized. It reads as though he took everything he could easily find about the topic of loyalty, threw it together, loosely organized it, and called it a book. As an example, Carville has a chapter on \\"The Traitor's Hall of Fame.\\" He devotes about 10 sentences each -- the equivalent of a 10-year-old's school paper -- to four obvious examples of traitors, and calls it a chapter. In between, he injects anti-Republican diatribes. In short, the book stinks.

There's a reason for that lower price! The cheapness of the material was instantly palpable, and upon the first throw, within just a few minutes of one of my dogs doing the death-headshake on his way back to me, the plastic laminate on the back was peeling off all around.

It flies both far and will glide too, so that dogs have more time to catch it in the air. Unlike other tough/heavy frisbees which fly far, but fall to the ground quickly. The only problem with this, is that it is rather pricey. AND, with my GSDs, it only lasts a couple of weeks. They only play fetch with it, but they do not have a 'soft' grip. Over a couple of weeks, all the seams just start ripping apart.

I emailed Booda and they shipped me a replacement plus a free one. So I will always use this company for dog toys.

We love to play frisbee and she has used both the hard disks and the floppy discs and I can say that she catches more with the soft floppy than the hard. Also she enjoys it as it seems to stay in the air slighlty longer than a plastic disk. Best of all in a small yard there is less chance of me throwing the frisbee over the fence as these discs do not travel as far as the plastic discs. The only reason for 4 stars is because my dog gets a good grip on the disc she tries to play keep away and the it will rip if you try and pull it from her.

Oh we'll, will try another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dogs love this","review":"My dog loves this floppy disc. Every other dog at the dog park loves it too, which is a problem. If two dogs get in a tug of war with it, you can bet that the center is going to rip. Also, if you let your dog chew on the center cloth after retrieving the disc, he will rip it, which will affect its flight capabilities. The outer part of the disc is very tough, though, and I have lifted my 50 lb dog off of the ground by pulling the disc while it is in his mouth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Border Collie & Shih Tzu love this disc!","review":"I originally bought this disc to teach my Border Collie puppy to play frisbee.

I will be buying a 2nd one of these so that they can each have a turn with this great toy. TIP: if you have a dog that likes to destroy soft toys do not let them have this toy on their own for long. I found that I have some teeth marks already with this toy from the Border Collie (she destroys anything soft), but as long as I keep her fetching and staying active with this toy it will last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Torn up 1st day out of the box","review":"Previous reviews misleading about durability of this disc. My 1 year old German Shepherd tore the fabric on the edge of the disc within 10 minutes of play, exposing rubber ring.

However, durability appears to have been sacrificed in the process."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 a year? Try 3 a month!","review":"They're the best, says our small, agile mutt. She prefers the 7 inch disc size (she's about 25 pounds), which she fetches and catches relentlessly.

The disc is pretty durable, but will wear out eventually when treated too roughly - like tug-of-war with big dogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price","review":"This toy holds up well. My dog and I like the way the larger size flies. Don't save a few bucks on the smaller ones - not as much fun. Other dogs often get hold of it and chew on it at the dog park, or start playing tug-of-war with my dog. These things are pretty tough.

At first glance, it appears to be nicely letterboxed, but after a while you might notice a lot of foreheads and feet getting cut off at the top and bottom of frame. This is due to the absurd placement of \\"letterbox\\" bars over the top and bottom of a standard tv-ratio \\"Pan and Scan\\" image. So not only are you losing the sides of the image as you always do with widescreen films reformatted to TV, you lose the top and bottom as well! That seemed impossibly incompetent to me, so I compared the same frame from a Pan&Scan VHS and from the DVD, and my fears were confirmed. If that wasn't shoddy enough, there's an annoying one-pixel jag in the superfluous top bar. This movie is terrific, but this DVD realease is the worst I've seen yet.

Don't get me wrong I love Dio but stick to your own songs man! I would have givin' this album a 4 or even 5 star rating if he would have done his own stuff but every time I hear him do an Ozzy song I cringe, it totally ruins the entire CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"STOP, YOU GUYS, I CAN'T BREATHE.......","review":".... I'm laughing too hard.I guess I'm very picky when it comees to live albums anyway.I like DIO, I really do, but he never sounded more like a fruit than he does trying to cover OZZY songs.Those flambouyant wails just don't belong in songs like N.I.B or BLACK SABBATH.I'd stick to the studio material if I was you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Blasphemy","review":"It's bad enough that Dio made mediocre music with the members of the once mighty Sabbath,but please, he just murders their classic material.One of the most worthless live albums ever made, Save your allowance. Get Live At Last instead, the sound may not be quite as good but at least it's true vintage Sabbath."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRAGEDY ...","review":"I don't really believe the people who said this is great Sabbath album. Without falling in the old struggle Ozzy x Dio, the simple fact is that this CD is horrible. Why ? Bad song selection, unbeliavable bad production ( Vinnie Appice's drums are almost gone,the crowd seems to have been added in studio ), it's a record destined to fail since the start, due to the band internal struggles. Dio's Sabbath was the last hope Iommi had to mantain the band strong and with its charisma untouched. \\"LIVE EVIL\\" (released after Dio and Appice already had left )marked the beginning of the tragical era of infinite line-ups in \\" IOMMI SABBATH \\". Forget this album. It is nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you really like old Black Sabbath, stay away from this","review":"this album is stinky. That Dio guy sure cant do much right"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dio w/ sabbath","review":"The Dio era with Sabbath was a rebirth for the band after the departure of Ozzy. The material from Heaven and Hell and the Mob Rules stand out here (IMO) over the older Sabbath tunes. R.I.P. RJD. You are greatly missed !"},{"rating":"1","title":"not totally live","review":"The conflict between Dio and Iommi came to a head.Each of them went into the studio to try to make their parts more dominant than the other's.Result: one of the most boring \\"live\\" albums you'll ever sit through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better buy Reunion!","review":"There is only one but big reason not to buy this album: More noise than music. I can't hear anything but the guitar and the voice. Better buy a studio album or Reunion. Black sabbath rules, but buy something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Try Ozzy's \\"Speak of the Devil\\" instead","review":"Iommi, Geezer, and Dio don't seem very enthused on this live set. Ronnie tries to get the crowd going a couple of times but they are so far back in the mix that they have almost no effect on this record, and that's the essence of live records. I was shocked to see Dio's name on the song writing credits of \\"Paranoid.\\" What, did he change a phrase or add the word \\"rainbow\\" to the song or something? What a crock! No wonder Ronnie was soon gone due to clashing egos. Try Ozzy's (also 1982, all Black Sab songs) live release of \\"Speak of the Devil\\" instead. The Oz never fails to get his crowds into a frenzy, and his then-guitarist Brad Gillis and drummer Tommy Aldridge are in peak form thoughout. I would love to have a huge poster featuring the cover art of \\"Live Evil,\\" that is awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I like Sabbath, I like Ozzy and I like Dio -- I don't like Dio doing Ozzy","review":"Dio's renditions of the classic Ozzy-era Sabbath Songs sounds wrong. His arching vocal style, which sounds fine on Mob Rules and Heaven and Hell just does not fit with hard rockin' tunes like Iron Man and Paranoid. Worse yet, on several songs he resorts to \\"talking\\" the lyrics like a bad Vegas act. I say skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"FORGET ABOUT IT!","review":"The biggest laugh of this one is how low and far away the audience seems ...not to mention DIO's attempt at singing OZZY. In fact, there probably wasn't even a live audience to begin with. From a producer's stand point, this is as weak as it gets for a live CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong version of \\"Mob Rules\\"","review":"Be aware that the \\"Mob Rules\\" track presented in this MP3 version of the album is actually the studio version from the Mob Rules album. If you compare to the Rules of Hell box set you can hear the actual live track that is supposed to be here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality live album","review":"A redeeming factor for this album is that it is probably the best live recording featuring Ronnie James Dio on vocals. Even when doing Ozzy's material, Dio is in top form. The entire band is in top form. It's too bad that this album caused so many problems for the lineup. But at least we got Holy Diver out of Sabbath's implosion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Then explain to me this","review":"If this album is anything at all, why is it that Ozzy's live album has out sold this one time and time again. If you want to hear Dio whine some more, waste your money, if not, just by \\"Speak of the Devil\\"(Talk of the Devil in England) if you want to hear the Sabbath classics with a bit of spin(Rhoads take on Iommi's riffs is amazing and respectful)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live Evil a truly great album.","review":"Live Evil is one of my all time favorite live albums. This was Sabbath fronted by Ronnie James Dio with Vinny Appice on drums. Truly epic versions of Mob Rules, Children of the Sea, Heaven and Hell, Neon Knights and Voodoo. Plus you get Dio's takes on all the Sabbath classics like Iron Man, Children of the Grave and Paranoid. I still remember how excited I was to get this on vinyl in 1982. It holds up after 27 years. I know most people will tell you Sabbath is only Sabbath with Ozzy on vocals. For me however Sabbath with Dio is Sabbath at its finest. Do yourself a favor and pick this CD up along with Heaven and Hell live at Radio City Music Hall to hear the greatest heavy metal band of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dio shines in otherwise bleak Sabbath performance.","review":"Many Sabbath fans just can't get over the loss of Ozzy. Nonetheless, Ronnie James Dio has a voice that carries the powerful Sabbath lyrics to new heights. His booming vocals give power that simply overwhelms any effort Ozzy has ever put forth and blends with the music better.Unfortunately, the rest of the band pretty much just plods along, again due to Dio, whose weakness is playing to the crowd and feeding off their energy, which is Ozzy's strength. Dio might as well be singing with a metronome (sp?).Yet overall, this album gives a new twist to some old favorites and is a must have for any Sabbath or Dio fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect mix of ozzy and Dio material make this a great disc","review":"Overall this album is fantastic it didn't recieve a five because the crowd doesn't even seem to be at the same concert and the album doesn't seem to flow very well with some obvious breaks inbetween songs. However Dio nails his own hits esspecially children of the sea and mob rules and also does a great job on the ozzy songs. everybody always says he can't sing the ozzy songs like ozzy. well no kidding. its not the same but that doesn't mean its not good. His version on N.I.B is the best i've heard. Heaven and Hell is played beutifully but a good but way to long guitar solo makes it hard to listen to on a regular basis. And the enchore Children of the Grave is really played well by the band. This is a must for dio fans and if your a big fan of the ozzy years I would say it's a must have but I guess it's not anymore because of the new reunion CD, which is also very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not even deserve 1 star","review":"Well i hold nothing against amazon.com because they are wonderful, but this camera was a waste of time.

Seems logical right...wrong. The concepts are poorly presented and difficult to grasp without a semi-good grasp of programming in general. Rather than small isolated programming examples, as this book builds upon previous examples you forget what previous code(that you studied say two months ago) does and you continually find yourself having to go back and reread the section that covered it.

The book is well-designed, clear in content and format, and provides a good introduction to Java for anyone. However, a couple of failures. You have to ready about half the book (entire is c.300 pages) before you can do much programming.

When some \\"pro-twins\\" rebuilders suggested that a vote should be taken to pick a single design to go against Pataki's plan, Berzon opposed it. He is taking his anger out on a plan that remains superior to his.Rather than being a book about corruption, it reads more like a childish editorial, filled with excuses about his own failed plan.His cries only try to incite anger rather than any form of unity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Berzon hits it out of the park","review":"Berzon's excellent research shows why the redevelopment of the World Trade Center is about to become an internatonal scandal -- self-serving politicians are having a field day, convinced that they can do as they please at Ground Zero with no accountability whatsoever. Berzon proves them wrong. Read it and weep!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing really new","review":"I've been able to read a lot of Justin Berzon's information beforehand on his site. He does a good job in collecting information about how the rebuilding process wasn't all that fair. His goal isn't so bad either (rebuilding the twins). However, the fact remanins, that because of many factors, the twins are not going to be rebuilt. It's sad, but an unfortuante truth. The current plan has potential though. Berzon's book is a weak and losing effort. Wheter he knows it or not, his efforts won't end up in the twins being rebuilt, but rather Ground Zero remaining a hole. I for one, am ready for NYC to start building.I actually recommend looking into this for those who are interested in seeing how politics and competition have a big effect on not just the WTC, but any major development site. However, I wouldn't recommend it as a guide to the ultimate truth about the rebuilding process, since a lot of his work reads like an angry letter to an editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad","review":"This book does not contain facts. It is basically a disgruntled loser. Justin Berzon is simply angry his plan (which wasn't creative) had no chance in the process.

I can't understand why this record company didn't remaster these classics, and do this great artist an injustice like this, not to mention this is a fairly new release. This is not the Faron Young essential, this is just a false title, so, take my advice and purchase Faron Young's complete Capitol hits double disc compilation instead, a few more bucks but well worth it, I think still available at Amazon.

This game's graphics weren't that good either. I mean eventually you kinda ignore them, but when you first turn the game on you are like whoa this graphics are terrible. The music isn't bad and not annoying like many games that I have played, and the voices of the characters are very close to the real thing so that was a good!

Business turns sour when The Kid is \\"asked\\" by his partner to pay shakedown money to the mayor. So, in a quest for truth, justice and full ownership of the club, The Kid challenges his business partner to a music battle.The plans for the movie started in 1987, but delays - primarily due to casting problems - kept delaying its production. Prince was king with Warner Bros. due to his incredible marketing power of cross-promotion within many categories of pop culture.

Dr. Brown demonstrates the expectation of God and the reality of holiness that is part of our heritage in Him. Go And Sin No More is a measuring stick along the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old time baseball fun for school aged kids","review":"This is fun for kids and friends.

She is a wonderful writer, with a gift for creating characters that you care about from page one. Combining warmth and humor, she has penned a lovely story about two wounded souls who help each other find the happiness and love that has eluded them. The thing about the book that impressed me the most was the fact it is told entirely from the hero's point of view, yet as a reader, I never missed being in the heroine's head, because Ms. Reavis is such a skillful story teller that you know what Kate is thinking and feeling simply from her dialogue and actions. There are some laugh out loud parts to this story, but there are also teary-eyed parts, too. Thanks, Cheryl, wish you could write faster!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little bit of everything","review":"This book is definitely over-rated by others (my opinion). However, I would agree with a couple of reader's comments that some of the pictures are good, but the discussion on the topics of bonsai are too general (and kind of shallow indeed).

Personally, I prefer \\"learning by example\\" when the tutorials and exercises are part of a larger project - it's more important to learn how to employ the concepts and tools in a realistic project setting, as opposed to a bunch of unrelated topic-specific exercises.Also, the included CDROMs border on useless. There are only a few dozen sample drawings per volume and not much else. The exercises consist of \\"open drawingx.dwg from the CD and perform one or two operations on it.\\" Surely, with 650MB of available space, more could have been included than a few megabytes of drawing files.These books do get good marks for thoroughly covering all the topics. The lack of real-world application severely limits these books' usefulness for self-learners."},{"rating":"1","title":"little scout info","review":"If your looking for Pickup info this book would be ok, but to say Scout in the title is misleading. of the 130 pages, only 15 were scout & scout II related.

Attempting to be broad-based and to describe the Great War as a truly World war, Strachan gives equal emphasis to aspects of the war which are of manifestly disparate importance. (Spending over 30 pages tracking Lettow-Vorbeck around east Africa is a waste in a book intended to be a general introduction to the War.) From this book you would hardly know the French were involved at all. The writing varies wildly from chapter to chapter, with the 3 chapters at the center of the book the best by far.Not recommended for a general reader's first overview of the war, and not a lot here for anyone attempting to expand upon basic knowledge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understanding history?","review":"This should be a must read for high school students.

I considered it as a text for my students on World War I, and found it dry, boring, and simply confusing. While Strachan clearly knows a great deal about the war, the book focuses almost exclusively on military stragegy. He seldom addresses the experiences and opinions of soldiers fighting in the war, and when he does include them, they are not contextualized in a useful way. Although Strachan makes good points about the novelty of industrialized warfare, the details are lost in an array of names and dates. Anyone without a background in the history of the war would find this book completely unintelligble. A dazzling array of useless data without any coherent framework."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love Mannix!","review":"Both my and my husband's Dad watched Mannix and we barely remember the show.

It's all garbage to me. It does stay on the true path, but there are too many detours in every step of the way that it is not even one percent of what the book was all about. The film fails to depict the following virtues: honor, integrity, nobility, subtlety, courage, loyalty, romanticism, justice, comradery, and esprit de corps. What I saw in the film is a demonstration of total ineptness. Whoever made the decisions on casting should've never worked in movies in the first place.

Margaret F. Rosenthal put this book together with careful thinking, allowing it's readers to skip to different poems and letters easily. I am not reviewing Ms. Rosenthal as much as I am Veronica Franco in her writing. The poetry is revolved around her daily events, none out of the ordinary. My particular favorite being Capitulo 13-A Challenge To A Lover Who Has Offended Her. Excellent for those interested in this portion of history, a Courtesan's life, and one who loves poetry. Very beautiful! I rated it 4 out of 5 stars-it only lacks the one star because it take a working brain to relate the poetry to what it actually means.

Now I have it mounted in my office closet up high enough the little one can not reach, plus having the tester right there allows me to verify I am grabbing a new one.The only complaint I have with it is I wish it had more AA & button cell storage. Since most electronics these days are smaller and use AA, AAA or some form of button cell batteries I find buying them at costco exceeds the standard slots. I found one work around since we do not use that many D size I can fit 4 AAAs or 3 AAs in these slots."},{"rating":"2","title":"battery storage & tester","review":"I haven't hung my yet, but have it flat in a drawer.

It was placed in the laundry room and looks neat. Thanks for the Product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helped organize my junk drawer","review":"The built in battery tester has been a money saver for sure. My junk drawer is now a normal drawer thanks to this pitching in the last helping hand I needed to rid myself of roaming AAA batteries. It's got plenty of storage for all popular size batteries and mounted easily to a kitchen closet wall. The plastic it's made with feels like it could crack apart if it was dropped so be sure to secure it appropriately if you mount it. That's the only thing keeping it from a 5 star, needs to feel a little more rubbermaid but then again it is pretty inexpensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great organizer","review":"I bought this because I have a haphazard basket of regular and rechargeable batteries. I was initially worried that they batteries may fall out if I mounted it on the wall, but they fit snugly and the pockets were deep. I did not give this a 5 star rating because some batteries fit a little too snugly and you have to hold the organizer to pull the battery out. Having the charger is very convenient. I am also glad they have the pocket for the small disc batteries. I have only had this for a couple weeks so I do not know how durable it is after a lot of usage. I would definitely recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, nice organizer","review":"This is a handy little organizer, and the battery tester is a nice bonus.

If you pushed them all the way in in the slots that were too tight, they would get stuck in there, so I had to just lightly let them stand in which looks ridiculous, others were too loose and they just easily dropped in, which isn't a problem but just shows the plastic forming process is poor. The battery tester is garbage as it is very hard to keep the battery still and you can't clamp down on it like you might think from how it looks in the picture, it keeps quickly slipping away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Range Kleen WKT4162 66-Battery Organizer with Removable Tester","review":"Was excited to get battery tester and storage unit.

When I use those battries they did not work even in a tooth brush was does not demand that much juice.

So far the tester is working well and everything is pretty good except storage is limited for AAA and button batteries. One day later the tester stopped working completely.

I love that it holds so many standard batteries. It has a spot for only a few (literally 3-4 I think) watch batteries. This drawer for them also can't be used if it is hanging on a wall or the watch batteries would just fall out when you open it. The tester works fine and was an added bonus for me. I find myself using it a lot more than I thought I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed, but","review":"Fits nicely into a formerly cluttered drawer in our kitchen.The battery tester is a nice feature to have, but it is a bit awkward to get a battery oriented correctly to make contact with the tester unless you remove the tester from the box. Since I already have a small battery tester, I would rather have the space the tester occupies given to more battery storage.Same with the 10 spaces for C and 8 spaces for D size batteries. I'd like it more if the C & D sized spaces were reduced to make room for more 9V, AAA, and AA sized spots. I don't think we even own anything that use C size batteries.This product come with anchors to hang on a wall. I don't plan to do that & I don't think the box has enough grip to keep the batteries from falling out easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate at best","review":"I am keeping it because it was cheap and there are surprisingly few battery organizers available. But this is the barely adequate. It should have more AA and AAA spaces, and half of the D and C spaces. Or more all all. The biggest problem is that the spaces for the AAs are too tight for rechargeable AAs. Rechargeable AAs tend to be every so slightly larger than alkaline AAs so this is not a great choice if you use rechargeables [I personally think alkaline AAs and AAAs should be be illegal, because they are old tech that needs to die, and stop polluting the environement. Plus, why would you buy a battery you can only use once? Really?] Some company needs to step up and offer something good in this category so that using rechargeables is less of a hassle.Oh, and the battery tester does not work. Not worth the bother to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Solution for a Great Price","review":"This thing is great. I am a rechargeable battery kind of guy, and I have struggled to find a battery organizer that has the options I need. With the included tester and the massive amount of AA and moderate amount of AAA storage, this thing is great.The only drawback is that they C and D battery holders take up so much space. I only have one application that used C batteries, and they are typically in the device if not being charged, so essentially HALF of the organizer is not being used at any given time. I have solved this by using the spots as RCR123 holders, but the amount of wasted space is still a drawback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work x2","review":"First one worked great for a day, tested all my batteries, filled it up and it seemed fine. The next day tried to test some loose batteries,and nothing, maybe they were dead, but then checked the new batteries from previous day, again, no reading. Exchanged it and the new one was also defective. This one at least tested D, C and 9 volt batteries ok, but would not register AA and AAA which is what I would use it for most. These batteries were brand new and working fine in remotes, flashlights, etc. The storage part is handy, too bad it doesn't work right."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't go wrong with this product","review":"Who doesn't find them themselves looking for working batteries?

I agree with the other reviewer that the chuck must be perfectly set in order not to leak. At the same time you are trying to get this right, you must ensure that the gauge is turned to face you if you want to read the numbers on the psi scale. Since the gauge pops out, you can't tell which side the psi readings are on until it is out, and I often found it facing the other direction. Lastly, I found the readings to be much higher during inflation. Once I released the chuck, and then reapplied it, the readings (confirmed by separate gauge) were easily 10% lower. For the price, it looks good. But I'm going to buy a different inflator that is higher in quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Youth Baseball's Must-Have Resource!","review":"This set is comprised of Marty Schupak's best baseball DVD's.

They're aliens who were apparently freed from the bugs in an earlier campaign. It's a little cliched, but the whole new guy who isn't trusted getting taken into the group is handled very well.

And you can't get a handle on what she's really talking about because it is totally removed from the reality of transracial adoptees' lives. If she had ever talked to someone who lived the situation she might realize that regardless of what she calls it, people are always doing it. I mean, if you are black and you have white parents and you've grown up around white people then you have no choice but to figure out how to \\"navigate\\" that. It isn't some great revelation that she bestows on us. It's a lot of pontificating supposedly about ethical choices adoptive parents make, but all she really talks about in that sense is whether or not it is racist for white parents to choose to adopt white kids.

And then: \\"There's even a rock in the garden Fenimore Cooper is supposed to have stubbed his to on during a garden party in 1842.\\" At that point, I was lost, and couldn't read it fast enough. (College English major at the time; who could resist a line like that?)The rest of the book enjoys that light hearted humor. No one except Uncle Enos takes himself too seriously.

I saw a terrific show there when I was in Chicago a few years ago, and at the end of it an actor did a fabulous rant about all the infiltration of corporate America. Blasting corporate icons like Starbucks and Blockbuster Video, and how they are stripping America of its individuality. He even got people to cut up their Blockbuster Cards! After reading the second half of this book, it is clear that Second City has become what it is trying to subvert. They seem to be looking to open a new theater wherever they can. And that seems very sad to me. What was once the Harvard of comedy, is now just another string of community colleges. Why try to aspire to greatness, when you can just wait for them to open up a Second City in your town. The book is about comedy, but it's really an American tragedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-Congatulatory Text/Superb CDs","review":"Patinkin has scribed a look back at Second City that is full of self-love for all the club stood for and all the comedians who traipsed through the door. The book would have benefited from a more honest account that featured the failures as well as the successes.The two compact discs are worth the price you'll pay for a copy on the used book club market, however. They are full of funny bits featuring many famous comedians, and will give your money's worth back in laughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Rest Of The Story?","review":"The first half of this book is such an excellent look at the early years of the Second City, it is really such a shame the rest of the book is filled with self-serving, half-truths from the current producers. I didn't plunk down $40 dollars just to read quote after quote from the producers Andrew Alexander and Kelly Leonard. I'm sure the actors who have had to work for Mr. Leonard and Alexander would tell a very different story. Unfortunately their views are nowhere to be found.

The songs Bringer and Vertigo are predominately percussion and well suited to a big bonfire at any modern Medieval (SCA) gathering.

The feel-good movie of the century.","review":"Albert Finney does an outstanding job portraying Scrooge. The music in this film is unforgettable. \\"I Hate People\\" will leave your family convulsing in laughter. And then, when Scrooge sings in reminiscence of his childhood, and when he sings in retrospection of his one chance at love, it will leave nobody in your house (with half a heart) dry-eyed.The unique choreography in the dance scenes is worth noting, too.There is one part in the film, however, which leaves the viewer wanting. Scrooge in his boyhood is inside, while the other children, including his sister, are outside playing. Why is he forced to stay inside?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Musical Adaptation of a Christmas Carol","review":"My wife and I both like this musical version.

I have seen pretty much all of the adaptations of Charles Dickens Christmas Carol and besides the classic one with Alistair Sims, this is my all time favorite. The music in this one is great as well as the way Finney delights us with his intepretation of the old miser. I especially love when he's in the future and everyone is singing Thank You Very Much and he has no idea why he's being thanked. You'll have to get this movie to find out the answer to that puzzle.As I said, after having seen many of the Dickens' interpretations of this classic, this one for some reason always delights me and I'm thrilled to have been able to finally replace the one I had lost.Merry Christmas and God Bless Us Everyone"},{"rating":"2","title":"finally !!!!!","review":"We are from Holland and looked for this movie in our own country for many years.

Leaving aside the fact that Finney won a Golden Globe for his Scrooge, and that the score and finale were nominated for Oscars, I can tell you only the most cold-hearted grim ghost of Christmas yet-to-be could sit through this movie and not have a good time, or even be rather moved. Finney's performance is fantastic (a ridiculously believable old codger at only 34 years of age) and his conversion in the end so moving that often I'm crying for most of it. Heck, I cry at the opening credits. But seriously, please see this version of A Christmas Carol for yourself and ignore the overly-critical. It's just that great."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Thank You Very Much\\"","review":"I looked for years, made many 'Scrooge' purchases, all in search for my favorite musical Scrooge with the song \\"Thank You Very Much,\\" and I've finally found it!!! So, I bought 6 and gave them away to my parents and siblings at Christmas, because we'd all grown up having seen this movie on TV, and then none of us could find it for years. This is truly a 'feel-good' Scrooge movie, and you'd be missing a great Christmas tradition if you don't buy this and watch it every year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scrooge","review":"This is a classic that has been well preserved over the years.

I was going through a tough time growing up, and our family was having a hard time, also. This movie gave me hope and made me believe in 'the goodness' of mankind. It is based on a classic novel by Dickens, yet it is unique with the beautiful numbers, from the sad 'Beutiful Morning' to my favorite 'Thank You Very Much'(which won best song at the oscars). My family has drift apart since the first time we saw this movie, yet whenever 'Scrooge' is playing on the video everyone can't help but look at it and smile and before we know it, we are seated together watching the movie.

Good production, color and pleasing songs. Dancing in the street fits in very well too. They got the essentials in, a touch of humbug with the hell scene, but other versions have taken liberties as well. There is plenty of room for a variety of interpretations of the fine story, as long as it stays the same story. That is done here, and it is an attractive production. It is good to have more pleasing street, office and various domicile uplifts. The only thing that stayed the same as the much older ones is Scrooge's dismal digs. But, that fits. To me, a bad remake is changing it up and calling it the same thing and/or a poor production. Neither occured here. This is a good version, true in essentials and contributory in the enhancements. And all those catchy tunes really stay with you. Thank you very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Keogh review for amazon shows he knows nothing","review":"This is the best telling of the Dickens story.

First is the 1951 version with Alister Sim, second is the 1984 version with George C. Scott, third is this version. What I love about this one is it's overall British feel, great photography and lighting, and some of that great Christmas cheer. The songs in it are decent enough for a musical, but it's no Chicago. It's not as \\"heavy\\" as the other two versions, but I still believe it's one of the best.

As an individual, I still enjoy some of the more serious treatments of the Christmas Carol. However, none of them produce the sheer holiday wonderment that we find in this movie. The musical numbers are fabulous...some are touching and some will make you want to dance. The special effects are a step up from the older versions and enhance the spookey \\"ghost of Christmas future\\" fun that many of us enjoyed in this traditional Christmas story. The romantic parts are moving, as are the nostalgia of Scrooge's early days. The costumes and old English feel are wonderful. Any way you view it, this movie abundantly stirs up all the heart-warming joys and sensations of the Christmas season. Please, please release the DVD, so that we can appreciate this wonderful music even more in a full 5.1 digital treatment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Popular Favorite at Our House","review":"A cynical old curmudgeon like me isn't supposed to like movies like this; after all, it's not a favorite of the critics.

I like Albert Finney and think he did a Fantastic job of recreating the \\"crochety\\" old Scrooge. You'll love the ghosts that visit him especially the Ghost of Christmas Present.

This is one Tom where Alec Guiness gives a stunning portrayal as Marley, Finney as Scrooge -- not a great singer but its an admirable performance. I don't know how critics sit down and just enjoy a movie (or not) for what it is. The title of their profession is accurate.This is my favorite version of a great idea for a story. I remember getting up Christmas morning and watching this on the local ABC station. I must have seen it 10-15 times. When I originally bought the VCR, I didn't know the scene near the end had been cut from the TV version. The scene where Scrooge descends into hell and is getting his chain -- it makes his transformation that much more enjoyable. I am in the process of converting all my VCR's into DVD's. I can hardly wait to see the DVD version.Hey Tom -- maybe you should try out for Scrooge in a local production.

I bought this video because I love musicals, well the music in this movie is sadly lacking. While the songs \\"Thank You Very Much\\" and \\" I Love Life\\" are wonderful songs, they are done so poorly in this version that it is painful to watch. The casting is awful! Scrooge looks like some old backstreet drunk, rather than a miserly old man. I can't imagine what the thinking was for the casting of the ghost of christmas past and an elderly woman. The best parts of the background story of Scrooges life are left out of this version almost no time is given to even develop any sympathy for Tiny Tim and to much time is given to the parts with the ghost of christmas future. The \\"hell\\" scene is particularly awful.I do not reccomend this movie to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not ever receive the package!!!!","review":"Haven't been able to track the package - no help and haven't received it yet.. one month later."},{"rating":"1","title":"ghastly!","review":"I am astonished at the number of glowing reviews for this DREADFUL version of Dicken's classic. Even Mr Magoo's version is better. Certainly Alister Sim's version is the best. This one is appalling! I couldn't believe how bad it was. Dreadful, embarrassingly bad acting, terrible songs, beastly supporting cast. While I love Alec Guinness, he should have his Oscars revoked for this stinker. I had originally bought an extra copy to give to a friend, but my daughter and I watched it together and threw out the extra copy as simply too awful to give to anyone else. Yech! Yet I recognize that 480 5 star reviews to 5 bad reviews are pretty long odds. I think I will have to watch it again this season to see if it is just as bad as it was last year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Madness takes its toll!","review":"I really don't believe all the rave reviews for this stinker. To start with, the musical numbers are annoying at their best, and quite disturbing when they sink to their lowest. Further, how dare anyone call Finney's performance the best Scrooge, or even place it in the top ten? Will someone explain to me why he chose to play the character as a developmentally delayed adult? He seems to have based his performance on a resident of a group home at which I once worked. Rent it and make your own observations, but don't trust the hype!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scrooge-a pitiful excuse for a christmas movie","review":"I'm sorry but to be the bearer of bad reviews but in my point of view this movies really bit the big one!

Some of the parts are laugh-out-loud funny, and Albert Finney does a fantastic job as both the unrepentant, miserable miser, and the rehabilitated, jovial man we see at the end of the movie. Also has surprising good special effects for the era, but it can be very scary. I was frightened of some parts when I was a child, so I'd recommend not showing it to children under 8 or maybe 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scrooge","review":"The very best representation of Dicken's Christmas Carol.

Much better picture and no tracking problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great Christmas surprise!","review":"We just finished watching this film, as we have each and every Christmas for the last decade. However, this time our kids are ages 3, 5, and 7. It was fun watching them become wrapped up in the movie, and in the dancing that takes place throughout the movie. After putting them to bed, we checked online, purely as a whim, to see if the DVD copy had been released. To our delight, there it was! Up until now, we have had to borrow the in-law's copy of the well-used VHS tape. We can't wait to show the DVD to them: Mom and Dad will be thrilled, as this film is easily their favorite.I used to wonder why everything seemed so grey and dark in the movie, until I discovered that it's an intentional cinematographic style which was popular in the sixties and early nineteen seventies: They mute all the colors of the extraneous scenery (and sometimes even the extras) in order to focus the audience attention on the primary actors and story. This film pulls it off wonderfully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong country code","review":"I tried to play the DVD and was told by the player that I had the incorrect country code.

Albert Finney nailed it. He has done the best job of E. Scrooge that I have ever seen. I have watched alot of other movies of a Christmas Carol and I just don't feel like the part of E.

Tiny Tim's performance will have many in your household dabbing their eyes. Watch out for the ghost of Christmas yet to come! He'll send a tingle down your spine. Again, the movie is great.

TERRIBLE!","review":"All you need to do is read all the submitted reviews to determine that the editorial review heading this film listing should be withdrawn. To join most of the other reviewers, I have brought out this musical version of A Christmas Carol every year since I first saw it at the Radio City Music Hall, where it played for months. The songs are certainly not poor as suggested by the editor - they are heart-felt where necessary and quite lively and fun where appropriate having the quality of staying with you long after you leave the film. I am so happy that this is coming out in high definition blu-ray as the film as seen originally in the theatre was beautiful. So, as another reviewer said, \\"Thank You Very Much\\" indeed!Sim's version is wonderful and a classic. This version is different, very entertaining, and equally wonderful.

This is one of my favorite Christmas moviesgbark"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scrooge Review--Skylar and Daniel","review":"We have recently read the novel A Christmas Carol and followed it up by watching the movie Scrooge. We felt that the excessive amount of songs took away from the mood at a certain point. For example, when Scrooge is with the Ghost of Christmas Future it's supposed to be a serious moment in which Scrooge realizes that he is dead and then the town breaks into a joyous song. The acting was very uncharacteristic and made the story less interesting. We felt that the actor playing Scrooge did not fit the description and therefore made Scroode more pleasant than he is supposed to be. The quality of the movie was lower due to the lack of advances in technology. The picture quality was poor because of it being made long ago. The final song, finale, was drawn out too long. It made the ending less meaningful. Overall, the mavie would be better without the musical layout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got screwed on Scrooge","review":"I was VERY disappointed.

The songs in this movie are for adults and children alike. It pulls at the heart strings and fills it with the warmth and love of the yuletide feelings. Everyone will be humming at least one of the songs. It does contain a little bit of the Third Spirit's warning of how Scrooge must change his ways, or spend eternity suffering from his scroogish ways. The background set in Victorian England gives it the final touch needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical Scrooge","review":"My husband and I saw this movie years ago and had never seen it again.

My wife and I are involved in drama and will be preparing a different version for the stage. If anyone knows how we can get the rights to the Albert Finney production, we would love to hear from you. The music reminds us of the music in OLIVER. It has the same energy, especially in the choreographed numbers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring and Timeless","review":"The Amazon Editor who reviewed this movie obviously knows not of what he writes. This movie/musical is a beautiful and timeless adaptation of Charles Dicken's classic. The songs are powerful and the acting is true to the spirit of this tale. My eyes still well up with tears each time I watch this masterpiece. This film has played a part in my family Christmas tradition since I was little. Had Charles Dickens lived to see this film I believe he would have chosen it over all the others to represent his book. Now I hope that the music will be released on CD. \\"Thank you very much, thank you very much, that's the nicest thing that anyone's ever done for me!!!\\" I'm so grateful this is finally on DVD. I can't wait to get my copy. I'm buying one for everybody in my family."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love It","review":"This movie to me depicts A Christmas Carol the way it was meant to be, at least to me it does. Albert Finney has to be \\"the\\" best \\"Scrooge\\", and the rest of the cast is excellent, as well. I saw this movie when I was 19 and have been looking for it ever since. There are only two other Scrooge movies that come closein my opinion; Scrooge/Alaistair Sim, and Scrooge/George C. Scott."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Trip Through Dickens in a beautiful way..","review":"I researched the websites to order this flick again, because our old copy fizzled out. Its an incredible story and scary at the same time in its own way. Finney is remarkable, and Guinness as well. The old Victorian settings breathe a kind of life in to the film well worth remembering. Tiny Tim is heartwrenching and the sadness along with joy is one worth rewatching each Christmas. I give Finney a true five star rating performance for his authentic performance as Scrooge. If you dont own this, get it...Merry Christmas 2002!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Version","review":"Albert Finney's reading of the classic Dicken's character is by far the best. Ebenezer's character is more fleshed out. We learn that he was neglected as a child and gave up his pretty bride for the love of gold. We even feel sorry for the old (...).Unlike Oliver (1968), the music of Scrooge (1970) fits perfectly. Not being a fan of musicals, I found the songs in Scrooge to be very catchy and they help move the plot.Get this great holiday movie now. It is the BEST version.[DW]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Christmas Favorite","review":"We watch this every year- I am not a big fan of musicals, but I love this one.

It is fantastic, Albert Finney is outstanding as Scrooge and all the other actors/actresses are first class. The music is wonderful, infact I have just bought a cd of the stage play of this wonderful film, just so I can hear the music. I wish I knew why they never issued the soundtrack of this film, I am sure it would have sold, I am now just waiting for the DVD to come out and I shall buy that. BUT I highly recommend this film to young and old, once you have seen it you will want to see it again and again. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas tradition","review":"This wonderful version of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" has been a holiday tradition since we first saw it in the theater upon it's original release. The songs and performances are delightful and never fail to evoke emotion: especially in Finney's rendition of \\"You...you\\" in which he regretfully watches his younger self lose the love of a woman who at one time adored him. And as others have noted, songs such as \\"Thank you very much\\" and \\"I like life\\" will be remembered all season long.

Of course there are many other \\"contemporary translations\\" in the marketplace. I just like the NLT because it was introduced to me by one of my favorite teachers and friend, Dr. Robert E. Webber.

Winnie is a twelve-year old girl who has just lost her mother and is struggling to find herself. She ends up finding a horse infamous for her wild behavior, and she becomes determined to tame it, as her mother, a horse gentler, would have. But taming the Wild Thing might be more than she though it would be! I loved how the author was true to life in this story. A bond with a horse is almost never truly magical, and although a girl trying to tame a horse is rare, it's not unheard of. I loved how she learns to trust God as the horse comes to trust her.

The \\"heroine,\\" Rose, elicits sympathy, impatience and furor from the reader while the dementia of her charge, Alice, is almost mesmerizing.The one complaint, if it can even be called that, with this book is that it always seems as though it is setting up some great metaphor with the embroidery (seemingly the only industry of the town), but that metaphor is never fully developed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget this book","review":"No fully developed characters and a plot that goes nowhere and is itself uninteresting,...I can understand why an author would want to title a truly forgetable book \\"Remember Me.\\"However, do yourself a favor, and don't bother reading this, then you won't have to waste energy trying to remember why you bothered to read it.Other reviewers have mentioned that the first 50 pages are hard to get through.

Needlessly, I won't bother to say anythihng to Amazon, as I'm getting accustomed to their \\"rip-off\\" tactics now.

The introduction to the book is a fascinating attempt to explain the Romantic Era as a reaction to the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. The problem is that the book does not include very much information about the individual poets, or the poems themselves. There are only a few mentionings confined to the introduction, which is not enough. The Romantic Era is a period during which it is especially important to have information about the authors and poems, whose lives were often fascinating in their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but I'm looking for other show.","review":"This is a good DVD, but I'm looking for a Meat Loaf concert, when Patty Russo use'd a wedding dress in a stage.

It takes up enough space that it is difficult to use the second outlet for anything other than a small two-prong plug, so this is not a great option if you often need the second outlet for something with a power-brick. It looks good - very much like a theatre-style path-light and is not obtrusive. The sensor turns it on when there is a low light level but there is no on-off switch.

I found that her continuing characters had feet of clay. I was more sympathic toward the murderer than the hero. There are three lovely moments the death of a cat, the tale of ancient atrocities and a mother's notification of a child's death which brought a tear to my eye and kept me reading to the end.

The DVD does contain a few short but interesting comments about people like JFK and Castro; in general, though, it is a superficial treatment of history. I remember vividly everything about the Vietnam War and Mr. McNamara's prosecution of it; he was a true automaton who seemed to relish spouting facts and figures. He hasn't changed much.

Just as we entered Iraq fueled by a fairy tale (weapons of mass destruction), so did we enter Vietnam fueled by another fairy tale (the domino effect). I hope the people of our nation will see this film and recognize that preemptive war is always wrong because it arrogantly assumes we know what will happen if we don't invade, and what will happen if we do. In fact, we cannot know what will happen in any war, particularly in a part of the world where the culture is radically different from ours.

The movie, however, is mostly just McNamara justifying the horrendous things he and Curtis Lemae did in Japan and the things he did in Vietnam. This movie was billed as a movie that would make people think twice about war but Morris doesn't challenge McNamara at all the entire interview. McNamara even admits that he answered the question he wished he had been asked during press conferences instead of the one that had been asked and he certainly uses that tactic in the movie.

Although the news media has trivialized the comparison, the hidden value of this film, then, is that it points out the lessons we are currently experiencing in Iraq.

You don't have to feel sorry for MacNamara, but you owe yourself the chance to listen to him articulate what he has learned and how much he regrets.

The only faults I have are that the numbered lessons are not always congruous to McNamara's words and that the off camera questioning of McNamara sometimes sounds loaded and sophmoric in contrast to McNamara's testimony. Although I disagree with McNamara on very fundamental issues concerning the inevibility of war, I see this as evidence of self-conflict in his complex character particulary in light of the influence he had in averting global holocaust during the Cuban missile crisis. As far as I can tell, the overriding lesson is that war is the product of bad diplomacy. We are Americans, we should strive to be good at everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing exploration of the power of rationalization.","review":"I loved Morris' \\"The Thin Blue Line,\\" so I was expecting something good. This, however, is without question a stunning documentary! I do not know how Morris managed to get McNamara to be so frank about what McNamara tacitly admits are \\"war crimes\\" -- committed by the United States, but we are all the wiser for it. The movie uses a lot of Morris' techniques and a score by Phillip Glass, so it will be familiar on that level. However, the power lies in an apparent spontaneity in McNamara's as he gives his views. He simply opens himself up and says stuff that will blow you away. I was mesmerized. Highly recommend it, especially given our current predicament in Iraq."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Documentary Worth Seeing","review":"In this era of \\"reality\\" TV and pop documentaries it's refreshing to see a no spin political documentary that basks in it's truth rather than manipululates it. Robert McNamara becomes a rarity in Washington by candidly reflecting on his mistakes and triumphs as Secretary of Defense under both Kennedy and Johnson. He does this because he feels that he has something to teach us, our administration , as well as future administrations about war and politics. It's an incredibly important documentary and should be required viewing for anybody taking office.This emotion impact of this film is surprising. Credit goes to both McNamara and Errol Morris who takes such a complex subject and simplifying it both visually and emotionally; by the end of the film you'll want to give McNamara another shot at redemption."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"Just to listen to JFK and McNamara discuss the plan for the Cuban missile crissis and how close to war we really were was eye opening and a wonderful historical account and well worth the cost.To see and incredibly intelligent elder, stone faced, tears welling up in his eyes, talk about America and what we did through out not only the cold war but Vietnam is stark, gripping and an extremely important account from one of the most influentail powers in recent American history.This should be required viewing for all Americans. It's dark and depressing and the truth that we don't really want to see but history that we must never forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will We Ever Learn?","review":"This documentary presents a chilling account of the horrors of war (WWII and Vietnam) and a superb insight into the lessons learned from these wars. It talks about the mindset of war and aggression and how that war crimes are just part of that mindset. Killing hordes of enemy civilians doesn't seem to be a bad idea in the grander picture of things. It seems like we never learn from our mistakes. With nukes scattered across the globe, our learning-from-mistakes curve has been reduced to a single dot; make a mistake and you won't live to learn from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Errol Morris is a genius","review":"Errol Morris is a GOD. No, I didn't say he's THE god, just A god. The man simply makes brilliant films. I think anyone who lived as an adult during the 1960s should flock to see this film. I didn't enjoy this movie as well as some of Mr. Morris' others (\\"Vernon, Florida\\" is, in my mind, one of the best documentaries ever), but it still rates 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ramblings From the Nation's Worst Secretary of Defense","review":"After listening to the inept, revisionist McNamara ramble on in this film, one wonders what's next -- a documentary from Jimmy Carter on how to be a great president? Step one: create double-digit interest rates. Step two: stand impotent in the face of terrorists holding Americans hostage for 444 days in Tehran...What a shame America abandoned the people of South Vietnam, who were then steamrolled by the Soviet-backed North Vietnamese army, where millions of South Vietnamese were then murdered in communist \\"re-education camps,\\" or died while fleeing into the open sea in small boats to escape the communist onslaught from the North.The film gets two stars because it's at least instructive to observe the failed McNamara flailing about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of context and some dubbing detected !

In addition to this, pay close attention to the part where he talks about the fire bombing of Japan. You hear the number \\"100,000\\" but look at his lips.

This approach offers a new perspective on this beloved repertoire and reveals both its similarities to and differences from Western art music. The introductions to each analysis--offering general information--can be enjoyed by all; and the analyses themselves, while complex, are fascinating for the scholar. Altogether, this book helps instill a new respect for these popular song composers. Only partially appropriate for the general reader, this book is essential reading for those seeking a more scholarly approach to the topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"pass","review":"According to its blurb this book \\"seeks to illuminate this extraordinary music indigenous to America by revealing its deeper organizational characteristics\\". Professional music theorists and graduate students familiar with the earlier and notorious \\"The Structure of Atonal Music\\" know that this is something more ominous than \\"heavy handed academese\\". The author's method of \\"revealing...deeper organizational characteristics\\" is to arbitrarily circle arbitrary sets of notes, assign them meaningless names like \\"4-17\\", and make trivial assertions about the integers from zero to eleven.

The GeForce 3 takes full advantage of Microsoft's Direct X 8.0 programming API. This, unfortunately, is its weakness, as there currently are no DX-8 optimized games on the market that take advantage of this card's impressive features. In fact, the only way to see these features in action now is to either run 3D Mark 2001, or install the Nvidia technology demos that ship with the card.However, if you can afford the card, it is worth the price.

I had two main problems. The first was the questions were too easy. With the multiple choice format, even with the hard questions it was easy to pick out the right answer. My biggest complaint was the second time I ever played the game, it started to repeat some questions. That happening after only two games in unacceptable!!Anyways, if you are looking for a more enjoyable trivia game, I feel Jeopardy! is superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting low budget offering from Mike Hodges","review":"First let me say that this disc is far from being a great transfer. This is pan and scan, the print is somewhat damaged. However the sound is really pretty good. At the price, who can complain. Now, the movie: I am exploring the work of Mike Hodges, and this like the others I've seen is an interesting film. Rosanna Arquette is very good. Jason Robards is good, but he's repeating a role he played many times. Tom Hulce shows that Amadeus may have been a fluke in which he was very well directed. But the story is interesting and the the bones are there for a better movie. This is really a British movie about people in the US. The different viewpoint is always facinating.Great cinema? No way. Worth a rainy night's viewing? For sure. And worth some study if you're a film buff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black Rainbow DVD","review":"Black Rainbow is a very well-made psychological thriller with fine performances; however, the quality of the DVD picture is rather poor, hence my two-star rating.

I heard them for the first time in a record store in Norway and bought the CD that visit. Solid rock grooves with heavy bass & drum lines, reminiscent of the music here in the states from 30 years ago. The songs are simple, as are most of the instrumentals, but that's kind of the beauty of it; in this day of overdoing it, Bigbang simply...doesn't! Listen with an open mind, trying not to be too critical of the sometimes loose organization of the play, and often quirky sounding english translated lyrics. I'm sure they flow better in their native tongue! All in all, a nice listen that transports you back to simpler English & American rock music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough and informative.","review":"This little book packs a good punch. It has thorough instructions to build a small injection molding machine capable of creating small 1\\"-cube-ish size items.

It would be nice if you could download a larger version of the plans, electronically."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good starting point","review":"This book is great for someone who is interested in casting plastics and wants to get some basic experience without buying thousands of dollars worth of machinery. It is written well with lots of hints on how to keep the cost down as well as things he tried that didn't work out so that you don't make the same mistakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good read, but has anyone built it?","review":"The book is a well constructed account of how to build a bottom-rung plastic injector, and may be useful to anyone who wants to understand the workings of such a thing from a hands-on perspective. But I must agree with another reviewer that the device appears to have no practical value at all. What items can you really make with a device that takes appreciable effort and cost to build, and can't produce anything that weighs more than half an ounce? The only example the author has provided is to make a control knob for the machine's height adjustment. Perhaps anyone who has built this device and found it worthwhile could provide their own comments to counter this, but until then, I can only recommend the book as a quick ground-level read on injector background."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"For as interesting as the promo describes this book, it is a very nothing book. You soon realize that the device the author built has absolutely no practical purpose other than to form the basis for the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have just used man iostat/sar/vmsat/ps","review":"Let me start off by saying that this book is not really bad. It doesnt really give any wrong information, it is organized in fairly nice fashion, and for beginners its probably a great place to start. The title is a little misleading though. It doesnt really give a bit of advice on how to optimize Linux performance. It is merely a beginners language version of the man page for tools.I was expecting something that would explain how to resolve thrashing or cpu usage issues, not simply give me a rundown on the tools that can find those situations. I found the cause, now what? This book doesnt help answer that question at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid book","review":"This is a great book for isolating and resolving performance problems on a single host.

David Janssen was the perfect actor for the role; there is a \\"wounded\\" quality to him, combined with a morality and decency, that makes his performance very powerful. I really wish there were extras in the DVD, but with Janssen being the only important recurring role, and with him dead, I guess it's sort of hard to do extras. But can't they include SOMETHING on subsequent DVDs? Even just trailers for the show or director's comments or info on all the many, interesting locations would be fun to see. Especially the locations; how about a then and now on the many places they filmed? After all, it was a totally on-location show, and I wish they would include more than just the shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANY version is better than NONE!","review":"I for one am THRILLED to learn of another volume of the series. Would I prefer the original music? Of course. But I am happy to have the episodes in any form whatsoever. Frankly, I had no idea that the music in the last volume was not original until I later read the comments.It's fine to be a purist and turn up your nose at the new releases if you've got your little cache of VHS tapes to fall back on. Not all of us do. Music is one element of the show, but it's a supporting element--it's the writing and the acting that are in the forefront. Those are still on display in all their glory, and I can't wait for the next installment of this marvelous series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"On Amazon, one can find several five-star \\"reviews\\" of products that haven't been released yet. These reviews are almost always worthless wastes of bandwidth, as evidenced by the many positive pre-release shills for The Fugitive Season 2, Volume 2. Mr. Dahl has captured the essence of this DVD set in his ammended, one star, review titled \\"Mutilated\\". CBS/Paramount has continues to display a stunning level of amaturishness with regard to their DVD releases. Removing music that they own, removing Public Domain music that they could've kept in for FREE, substituting blaring horns/synths for period cues that weren't an issue with season one, yep, that's REALLY \\"(P)utting classic TV on a pedestal\\". CBS/Paramount is not likely to offer replacement discs for this set, so, buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is a Paramount Rip-Off","review":"As a fan of this wonderful TV show, one very important and major component of the series was the outstanding music specifically written and masterly matched with each scene. For Paramount to take such short-cuts to \\"save money\\" and take out the original music is in my eyes, totally unforgivable. Under NO circumstance, will I buy a single DVD of THE FUGITIVE with altered music. The music is equally instrumental in making the series a classic as the writing, directing and photography. The fans got the shaft, we should return the favor and give it right back to Paramount by refusing to buy their product and hit them where it counts, in the pocket book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If music is like the last set, I will reject this one","review":"I will wait to hear what was done in terms of the music on this set.

Unaware of the music alteration, I DID buy S.2-V.1 but how can CBS/Paramount possibly think anyone would trust them to fix the music bastardization of S.2-V.1? With all the public criticism, are the CBS suits so demented to actually distribute another debacle like Vol. 1? I guess the asnswer is YES!Remember Dr. Smith on Lost In Space quoting, \\"Oh the pain\\"! The entire season two has been a complete washout and is just painful to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably still sux","review":"I read today that Seaon 3 volume 1 will be released soon. I seriously doubt the music problem will be fixed. In fact, would not be surprised if the entire run of the show is released in this bastardized format.

For those fans that grew up with the series it is a huge distraction and disappointment. If CBS/Paramount own this series they also own the music. This series only had 2 musical themes, the one by the original composer Paul Ruggio and music from The Twilight Zone. I have both series of The Invaders, another Quin Martin production, they didn't change the music on those episodes. I am really upset.... changes the whole mood of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fool me once shame on you, Fool me twice shame on me!!","review":"This is an absolute travesty. Do not buy this tainted product. The whole time that you are watching the episodes the crime that CBS has committed festers in the back of your mind. This is not how the episodes should be watched. The whole music substitution concept is baffling. This flop will someday be a case study taught in colleges throughout the world. Gerard is hunting the wrong man; he should be hunting the clowns at CBS who are responsible for this egregious event. He should also take me in for questioning for being foolish enough to buy this botched release especially after the first go around with Season Two Volume One."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dig out your old VHS tapes","review":"The Season 2 Fugitive DVDs are a complete disappointment due to the replacement music. For a short time, CBS was offering to exchange Volume One for an edition with more, but not all, of the original music. I had bought Volume One as soon as it was released, and I was not aware of the exchange policy until after the Sep 2009 deadline. Instead, I bought a second Volume One from Amazon under the assumption that it had the original music. WRONG! They're still selling the edition with the replacement music.Volume Two proved to be almost as bad as far as the replacement music is concerned.Since then, I've dug out my old A&E; Network Fugitive VCR recordings from the early '90s. They're a much more enjoyable way to see the series without having to be periodically jarred by out-of-place music. Obviously, I've given up buying anymore of this CBS reissue. They've made a complete mess out of this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fugitve Season 3, Vol. 1 Coming Soon: Leave It Alone, CBS!!","review":"One should keep in mind that, CBS is most likely still selling the re-scored DVD copies of Season 2, Vol. 1 in stores, and are ONLY creating enough replacement discs for those who take the effort to mail in a request for one, or actually just burning replacement copies PER mailed-in request!!So I had assumed that Season 2, Vol. 2 would end up the way it is, since the composers that CBS hired had obviously re-scored the entire season before-hand, and CBS would simply sprinkle back in a few original cues for each episode, just enough to appease caring fans and quiet the complaints (IT DIDN'T WORK!!), while keeping the costs of restoring all of the original cues to a minimum, for MASS distribution of the DVDs.However, Season 3 Vol. 1 is scheduled for release on October 27, 2009, and all I can say to CBS is: DON'T MESS WITH THE ORIGINAL CUES, IF YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE ANY MORE BUSINESS!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's Going On","review":"How do all these commentators know the difference between original and replaced background music on \\"The Fugitive\\" year 2, vol. 2?And I have another question.

What's going on?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Music is still screwed up!","review":"The Fugitive: Season Two, Vol. 2I bought this thinking that they corrected the music problem, but in the very first episode you can tell right away that it's not the original music. The first episode has many scenes with a carousel. Instead of a calliope sound, you hear and overbearing carnival song that sounds like it was made on a radio shack keyboard with electronic drums. It is mixed so loud that it is distracting.The whole DVD release of The Fugitive is full of this awfulness. I honestly think the only original music is the Theme itself.I give the DVD two stars only because it is one of the best TV shows ever made. What CBS did to the music ruined it. In some other shows it may not make a difference, but the music in the original Fugitive was very important to the show.I guess they figured that no one would remember the music. It is a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't look good","review":"Since they haven't re-released Season 2 Vol. 2 the way it should have been done I very much doubt they will have properly restored the original music for this one.

Maitreya seems to coerce Wayne Peterson. The message is do this or these are the consequences such as the tree crashing across the street in Washington, D.C. when Peterson questioned Maitreya. True spiritual Beings of the Light give information when asked but do not cajole nor chastise if the person does not follow through nor promise to reward them if followed through.

A must read!","review":"Wayne Peterson offers to readers one of the most astonishing personal testimonies of our time. This book will undoubtedly shake the very social, political and religious foundations with which humanity has grown both accustomed and comfortable. In his journey, Mr. Peterson has not only been privy to the restricted, international circles and halls of power, and the leaders and individuals associated therein, but has managed to discover, unravel, and offer in this book one of the most compelling, hidden truths the world may ever hear. I can assure that any curious reader who reads this work and considers Mr. Peterson's story will never look at the world - or their life - the same again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive Introduction","review":"Mr. Peterson has taken a subject with vast implications for the future and has sifted information about it coming from worldwide sources into a short, highly readable introductory volume.

An ideal starting point for those seeking a lucid explanation of the future of global culture, and the manner in which we are to arrive at it.

In fact, she compared the new pair to a very similarly designed pair bought a year ago at CVS. The older pair is sharper and cost about the same as the pair ordered on Amazon.We do like the blunt safety tips of the Tiny Dog Grooming scissors, a desirable feature for scissors used to trim a squirming puppy. The scissors also fit the fingers comfortably and open and close smoothly.My take on the range of ratings given for these scissors is that the blade sharpness and quality control at the factory are inconsistent. The Tiny Dog Scissors do seem to work a bit better after a few swipes with my blade sharpener.Shipping was quick for this item, and it was packaged well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very precise, durable","review":"Very precise, durable scissors for grooming in those hard to reach places.

Parnell was right on about what goes on during a postal exam from stating that the fact that practicing his techniques is your best bet at a good grade, right down to treating your pencil like it were poison when you aren't filling in those little bubbles. The techniques were excellent. If it hadn't been for them I would have felt very lost during the exam. With them, I was able to put everything else aside and concentrate on my exam which helped me to achieve a great score. The only thing that was better that his hints on acing the fourth part of the test was the audio timing CD. That was a wonderful addition. My thanks to T.W. Parnell!"},{"rating":"2","title":"T W Parnell 473 and 473 Postal Exam Training Book","review":"I bought the version of T W Parnells book that came with two audio CDs. I had two weeks to prepare for my postal exam and would not have scored in the top 5 percent of my testing group without this excellant book. The audio practice test CD replicated the exact time and instructions of the real test. I went into the exam knowing exactly what to expect and had practiced all of the helpful test taking tips numerous times. I finished each section of the test before the time limit, giving me time to review my answers and correct any mistakes. I am now near the top of the list of eligible candidates for employment with my local post office. I strongly recommend buying the pencils too.

However, I have to laugh at the guy that said he only spent a few hours programming it. I spent about 15 minutes programming my Harmony Remote. With this remote, you have to type in codes on multiple remotes to program it. With the Harmony remotes, you simply answer questions like \\"What kind of DVD player do you have?\\" and \\"What kind of television do you have?\\" and then it programs all the buttons automatically. It really is pretty amazing. And, the Harmony remote actually looks good, whereas this Sony remote is one of the ugliest ones I've ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is amazing!

Adrian Goldsworthy is becoming by far my favorite author for historical events. I have read several of his works and he has done an outstanding job in this edition.

There are several index ones, including a Fuller, where the bits continually fall out of the hole in the spinning handle. Many others have a cap on the handle to hold the bits, which as you all know, immediately unscrews any time you're trying to put some serious pressure on the screwdriver. A lot of times, the multi-bit drivers are just plain flimsy, with thin shelled handles. Not this one. It's got a nice, meaty handle with thick walls. Each bit has 2 ends on it, so you get a fantastic variety of bits. The storage handle is not threaded, it presses on, with big, substantial index points that will never twist. And the removable portion of the handle doubles as a stubby screwdriver. I'd be hard pressed to come up with a better screwdriver design.

You basically maneuver Billy around a beautiful and lush 3D world, looking for and pushing/rolling giant eggs. It is hysterical when you jump on the egg and start rolling with it like a downhill \\"snowball\\". As you are either rolling or pushing the giant egg, you can destroy you enemy (sharks), jump over abysses, and crash through baracades. My 3 year old was laughing the the whole time at the funny visuals this game provided. As you roll over your enemies, this \\"feeds\\" the egg (or at least it's inhabitant), and the egg gets bigger. The egg contains an \\"elder\\" that must be fed and ultimately hatched. OK, its not \\"Grand Theft Auto\\" or \\"Splinter Cell\\", but its a great arcade game that is challenging and won't give your kids nightmares!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Of course there are some problems...","review":"...But overall this game is fun!

There are several things that I have found quite frustrating about the gameplay. Control of the egg is quite difficult at times. You can't go slow - you're either stopped or at full tilt. Jumping on buttons is \\"buggy\\" also. At some points, you have to bounce an egg on a button to continue the game. Well, I have bounced on them sometimes as many as ten times without activating them! I have also landed on a button and fallen off, leaving the egg up on the button and me on the ground. The other problem is the camera. It doesn't \\"point\\" in the direction you need at times. For instance, when fighting the \\"boss\\" on Pirate's Island, level 2, he jumps around a lot, and when he lands behind you, you have to stop and reposition the camera so you can take a shot at him.

Where this book really fails is the inordinate use of stereotypes and glib commentary.

While I loved the intelligence displayed in the character of the Mounty from Saskatchewan, and it is true that we have winter in Canada (although Minnesota gets it worse and they are the equivalent of two states lower than where I live), I simply could not excuse the inappropriate use of the word eh. Far too many sentences ended with eh. Most Canadians don't even say eh, let alone those who are highly educated such as a forensic scientist must be. The myth of the Canadian accent is dead.

Yes ladies and gentleman, West attempts all this and more in her Cajun black comedy She Flew the Coop. The story is told by a myriad of characters, the most convincing of which is an old Negro maid named Sophia, who's still in love with her violent river-dwelling husband. And that is the extent of my praise. West's other characters get bogged down by pop clichés and never get off the ground in terms of development or complexity. Still, the story may have flown had West not laced the entire narrative with copious amounts of gratuitous sex. The result? An unsatisfying read that tastes more like KFC take out than the home-cooked southern supper I was hoping for."},{"rating":"2","title":"WAY TO GO VANGIE","review":"I was extremely happy with the decision Vangie made regarding Henry and stuck with it.

Given the editorial reviews and other reader reviews, I thought it might be a humorous look at sex and the lack of sex in the post-baby relationship as well as ways to rekindle the romance. What I read was much different. There was information on how the sex life changes (hence the 1 star), but I was turned off by a lot of the recommendations. For example, women who are suffering from post-baby negative body image probably wouldn't find the tip to rent a pornographic movie or let her husband read pornographic magazines helpful. Nothing like comparing that body to the idylic ones in the magazine pages...Also there were sections called \\"hide your smut\\" and instructions on how to handle when your children find your \\"treasure chest\\" of adult materials.

In our neighborhood, we have 3 Labs, a Chesapeake Bay Retriever who weighs 120 lbs, a pit mix and a Great Dane/Rhodesian Ridgeback mix who weighs 179 lbs. They ALL play tug-o-war with it and the ring hasn't split. And they're great because they float in the water, which the Kong does not.If you have one and are discouraged that there's a hole in it, DON'T throw it away! They can still play with it!

This is much better than the Kong disc which only lasts 2-3 play sessions with my pooch. The Hyperflite is holding up nicely, but I keep that one in the car and only use it maybe weekly. Also, I prefer the soft rubber material of the West Paw Zisc to the hard plastic of the Hyperflite since my dog isn't a graceful catcher and cut her lip on the plastic disc.

Although West Paw Design allows you to exchange all the zogoflex products for a new one (only once) if your dog is able to damage it, I am here to buy another because over a year is definitely more than any other toy has lasted close to this long (I cannot even leave the kong frisbee with them for more than a second or they will tear it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for chewers but works","review":"Update: We like the way they fly, easy for the dogs to pick up from the ground and won't hurt the dogs mouths when they catch it.

I am glad I rented it instead of buying it.Here's my opinion on the game:Scores out of 5Gameplay : 2Graphics : 3Fun : 1.5Durability : 1My Overall: 1 or 2I hope this review was useful to you"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"Do not buy. Do not waste your time on this absolutely horrible game.It starts off by first acting like it's a remake of a Sonic game for Dreamcast, but inevitably it becomes tedious, repetitive, and the camera is absolutely abysmal.

I think her story would be particularly valuable to immigrants and the children of immigrants because many of the issues she faced are common to people in similar situations. While I've decided to use this book in a college composition class next semester, I did hesitate somewhat because of the very \\"spoken\\" (read \\"ungrammatical\\") language of the text, but I think her messages outweigh any language concerns. I also strongly believe that the Palestinians' story is one that needs to be shared, and Hammad does a nice job of introducing it in a personal way. A couple of things I did find annoying, though, were the unending references to those \\"drops\\" and also a couple typos within the text that should have been caught by an editor before going to print. All in all, though, it's a quick and enjoyable read that encourages thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works 100%","review":"I bought the Medi-Dyne StretchRite for my wife who HAD plantar fasciitis. She follows the instructions in the user's guide and has been stretching every morning for around 2 months. Despite the fact that she jogs every day and does not have any other treatments nor visit the doctor, the plantar fasciitis is now gone.The product is strong and very well designed. At first I thought a belt would do the job but finally decided to purchase the StretchRite. It works great. The handle knobs are easy to hold and your hands will not get hurt when stretching. This is a purpose-built tool and worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Medi-Dyne StretchRite Exercise Strap","review":"Don't waste your money.

This album includes byplay between the \\"cat\\" characters of such toe-curling inanity you will be lunging for the Raffi tapes for relief. While the excerpts from Peer Gynt and Rodeo are nice, the majority of the music is the Nutcracker Suite, one piece that most children already have ample opportunity to hear. The characters also reinforce stereotypes -- the girl is smart, the boy is dumb, the maestro is a male with a European accent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rugrats Kwanzaa","review":"The video does give a brief background of the history of History. ( e.g. Kwanzaa was created in 1966). I think kids will enjoy hearing the names of the symbols of Kiswahili. There are some inadequacies that existed in the presentation. For example, Aunt Susie says that Harbi gani means how are you in Kiswahili, but actually it means \\"What's the news?\\" Overall, the video presentation will give families an overview of how to celebrate Kwanzaa, a great to start celebration the holiday."},{"rating":"1","title":"The perfect book... if your interested in dating 2nd graders","review":"This is perhaps the biggest waste of paper I have ever purchased. It's aimed towards teens and adults, but it has \\"dating activities\\" that are mostly remenicient of childhood group games, such as \\"Duck, duck, goose!\\"I highly reccommend not purchasing this, unless you want to find silly games to play with a bunch of kids. It states the purpose of dating is \\"getting to know your partner better\\", but completely ignores any concept of romance. In the \\"group dating activities\\", it's games have you doing mostly silly things that don't encourage talking, or getting closer to the person.Please, do yourself a favor and do not buy this hideous piece of crusty rodent droppings. 1 star is too high a rating, but it is the minimum Amazon allows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dating for Under a Dollar: 301 Ideas","review":"I would highly recommend this book.

It has the exact same storyline with many of the same animals except it doesn't have the catchy and clever Karma Wilson rhythms and rhymes that help kids learn to read. Wilson's\\"Bear Snores On\\"was published three years before this book so she wasn't the one to copy.

The lack of a detailed bibliography is frustrating, but once you get past the legends and tales portion of the book and reach the guts of the story, its exciting reading.If one is intent on chasing the dream of finding the confederate treasure it would be worth the price of the book for the bibliography, legends, and myths. Certainly, any treasure story such as this is by nature half truth and half fiction with a pinch of doubt. I don't think it proves that the treasure remains or ever was in Danville. But that may have been the writers intention :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Hyperbolic Hoax","review":"The book seems to be based on the untenable premise that Shunju, a not very good chain of izakayas, are some of Tokyo's finest restaurants. This is just not true and though I live in Japan and am blissfully ignorant of the hype surrounding Charlie Trotter, the man has revealed himself as either shameless, or an ignoramus in an embarrassing introduction in which he claims Shinju has launched a culinary revolution in Japan--trust me it is not even on the radar here. The food at these places is not very good and the book is very badly written and edited, but it must be said that the restaurants and this book are very well designed and photographer Kawana has taken some excellent photos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"If you have ever visited one of their excellent restaurants, Shunju in Tokyo, you know what I mean. Not only their simple, yet very creative Japanese food, this book introduces you the essence of what makes their food special. If you want to learn and appreciate the sprit of Japanese food beyound Sushi and Tempura, this is the book for you. The photographs are beautiful, and cooking methods are very easy to follow. I highly recommend this book for any food lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"simple & elegant","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I noticed other reviews here lamenting the dearth of ingredients and technique written for the recipes. However the focus of Shunju is on exactly that, minimalist elegance that celebrates the inherent flavors of local organic ingredients, with as little possible alteration of nature. Some of the passages introducing the ingredients do seem a bit under-edited and perhaps amateurish (translation perhaps?), however the dishes speak for themselves. I love that it reads like a book. Every recipe has a gorgeous photo and a story...and each section is divided by the seasons. It is worth the money if your have an eye for art and a love for healthy Japanese cuisine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shunju: New Japanese Cuisine","review":"This is a wonderful book to own...and give as a gift, which I have done several times. The text explaining the cuisine philosophy of Shunju's owner, Takashi Sugimoto, the exquisite sense of design - architectural, table, book - and breathtaking photography make this book a treasure to have and share."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Piece of Junk!","review":"The forward of this book by Charlie Trotter should have been a warning to me to avoid purchasing. But I didn't based on the stars. For those of you who haven't been to Trotter's or have been living on Mars, Charlie Trotter is the king of hype in restaurants. This book is also the king of hype. Both authors are not chefs but designers, the recipes are short on technique (if at all)and long on art signifying absolutely nothing! Example: 'Grilled Oysters on the Half Shell': Open the oyster and place shells on the grill until cooked, add a drop of soy and serve with Sudachi(Japanese Citrus). Recipe is on one whole page and poorly shot picture is on the facing page. Need I say more. Avoid this book at all costs. -Dick"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Looking Asian Doll designed by Corolle :).","review":"I am living in Korea, South. and I wanted to find out good-looking Asian doll for my 14 month-old baby girl.I wasn't able to find the product in here:(.

Bing is an American phonograph salesman who takes on the Austrian aristocracy with humor, charm and the character that is only Bing Crosby on the screen. Sets and costumes are also well done.

I am simply reviewing the remastering of the disc, which is excellent. This record never sounded so good; I noticed nuances in Vivian's guitar playing that I've never heard before, and overall every instrument is brought to the fore in this sonic wonder. Ronnie's voice in particular seems to literlly jump out of the speakers and attack you, but without overpowering the other sounds. Everything is very well mixed. Highly recommended!!! Also, the interview spans various toipics such as the formation of Dio, RJD's leaving Black Sabbath and the making of the tracks on the album. It was quite interesting, although some bonus tracks would have been nice.

His first solo album, Holy Diver, is a magnificent encomium to metal pioneers like Ritchie Blackmore and the Sabs. But Dio does not imitate--he creates and his creation of great driving loud songs combined with strange mystifying lyrics have propelled him into stardom, as well as the album, which remains one of Warner Brothers top selling albums of all time. Dio had worked with the leaders of the established metal tradition and, not only followed it, but added a greater amount of focus and intelligence. A metal classic and one that will be played until the very end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rest In Peace to a heavy metal icon, Ronnie James Dio","review":"How can you not call this album a classic?

This two SHM-CD paper sleeve edition is the bomb. It represents how Dio wanted this album to be heard. Bar none the SHM-CD is the cleanest( besides the BLUE-SPEC CDS ) you can get. It's what record collectors always wished CDs could sound like. Now they finally do. It's expensive but get this edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic In Theory but Overrated in Reality.","review":"There's no denying Dio's relevance in heavy metal's canon - however, I think the importance of this album as a musical statement is a bit overstated.While the songs, melodies, and riffs are memorable, I find Dio's LATER albums - particularly Dream Evil, Lock Up The WOlves, and his more recent, pre-death output - Magica, Master of the Moon, and Killing the Dragon, in particular - much better.My main beef is the production. Is it me or is the drum sound on this album TERRIBLE? Annoying....If Dio put this album out later on in the 80s or 90's, with real production values, I'd rate it higher.R.I.P.

This cd is a must have for any metal fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid debut from the Royal Roar","review":"I thought that HOLY DIVER was a very good debut album, but i don't think it is his best work. I have always liked Ronnie's work from Rainbow and Black Sabbath, and i think his albums like RAINBOW RISING and HEAVEN AND HELL are far superior to this one. Even his later solo efforts are better, LAST IN LINE is alot better then this, but still, this album rocks. It has the big radio hit RAINBOW IN THE DARK, and that is one of his best songs. The guitar is sharp and fresh, it simply shreads all over the place, people who think Randy Rhoads was amazing should listen to Vivian Campbell's work with DIO, Vivian Campbell would prison-rape Randy, no contest. The bass guitar is ex Rainbow and ex Thin Lizzy bass player Jim Bain, who does a good job as well. Vinny Appice is a firey drummer, he has some pretty cool drum fills. The album is a good intro into the world of Dio, the cover art is very representative of what his music is about. This is considered a classic, and it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, THIS is what the album sounds like!","review":"I always wonder about these gold CDs-are they really better?

Songs like \\"Stand up and Shout\\", \\"Holy Diver\\", and \\"Rainbow in the Dark\\" make Dio's Holy Diver a great album, but of course these are not the only good songs.

Beware!","review":"First off, let me say that this should be a 5 star album. Dio is incredible, and his solo debut album is one of his finest.That said the mastering of this album is terrible. The guitars and bass are too quiet while the vocals are far too loud. Distortion and digital artifacts are easily heard all over the album, especially when Dio's voice reaches its high peak. Every time his voice soars it's accompanied by horrible crackling and popping. The guitars also exhibit this effect, especially on Rainbow in the Dark. It's almost unlistenable at points. The versions of these songs on my Dio Anthology collection don't sound like this at all, so it's definitely the mastering on this particular version."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must have for college guys!","review":"All I can say is that this video blew me away!

Maybe they'll take the Bartok assasins into consideration when they build the next fortess in the Hapes system. I think that the Bartok assasins could be more than a little trouble, since they don't care if they die.

Sargent spent 4 decades polishing this jewel. I purchased the original vinyl in 1978 on the Quintessence label(#P3C-2701). Previous reviewers have said it all, but let me add a few thoughts. Conductor Sargent, The Royal Philharmonic, The Royal Choral Society, and especially the soloists have woven a beautifully balanced version of this classic. And the Recording Engineers at both Quintessence and Chesky have done outstanding work producing both the original and the digital versions."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best cd ever made","review":"I would recomend this to anyone. I bought it for myself. I grew up with the care bears when i was little. I still love them. Since i have a job now, my job can stress me out so bad and make me so angry sometimes. When i get home in the morning after work i would listen to the cd and i'm asleep half way through the cd. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best lullaby music ever!","review":"I had this on CD when my now 5 year old son was a baby. I spent many wonderful nights playing this for him and rocking him. I love that it has lyrics to it so when I'm was super annoyed I would sing and it would make it all better. I'm now pregnant again and this music will once again be played to rock my baby to sleep. So glad I found it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"'80s Alternative at its finest","review":"This is a great album and I'm happy to have it as part of my collection. \\"Back On the Chain Gang\\" and \\"My City Was Gone\\" are classics. Chrissie Hynde's got a great voice and wrote some great lyrics. The '80s were crowded by Pop music (which isn't necessarily a bad thing), but it's a great to find an Alternative Rock gem in a decade ruled by Pop.5 stars/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching","review":"When Serina, a little girl, is threatened with heart problems, her friend Joey, who is kind of strange, is afraid that when she dies, there will be no one to love him. He has an older brother, played by Randy Travis, who doesn't seem to particularly want anything to do with him. Monica and Tess step in to help, and end up in a dramatic climax. I don't want to spoil it for you, so I'll just say I've never seen Monica look more angelic. Later on, a con man comes to town and cashes in on the \\"Miracle,\\" as the town's calling it (Monica's fantastic appearance). It turns out that Wyane (Travis) is somehow connected to this man's past. Joey belives that this man can heal him and a crack baby that he found in the manger of the church's Christmas Scene. The ending is excellent, and the movie well worth watching. The only drawback for me is that our favorite Death Angel, Andrew, was not asked to make an apperance (it's another angel named Adam). But I still love the movie, and reccomend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable and Comfortable","review":"I ordered a pair of Levi's shorts for my daughter and me.

It is a great vest for cooler climates, or if you like to be very hot. The mesh on the vest is too minimal to provide any real ventilation. I find that the only time this is good for me to use is in the early spring or late fall early winter. The only place I have enjoyed wearing the vest is in a completely air conditioned venue like a museum or sports arena. If you are like me and do not like to be hot when you are out photographing flowers, or other wildlife outside look for a cooler vest.Other than that this is a great vest, lots of pockets that I have found extremely useful for holding lenses, filters, batteries and other accessories. If it was cooler to wear I would use it all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Modem great, cord is terrible.","review":"Installation was easy and it seems to work perfectly. However, the cord is a pain. It has a lously little connector that easily gets pulled out of the socket if you brush up against it, and that happens really often since the cord is only 3' long and its always hanging in mid air. This is a really crappy design and a pain to work with, I am going to switch to another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy construction","review":"The great thing about the Lomo aesthetic is its emphasis on improvisation and instinict, leaving room for the happy accident and running away from premeditation.

If you're looking for anything akin to what she normally writes (and what you've come to expect from her), get Operation Starseed or Scarred.

It was shown annually on television for several years and I tried never to miss it. Having a copy of it on DVD is great. If you haven't seen this one, you are really missing out. It is a very \\"Christmasy\\" experience. I mean, it just has that \\"feel\\" of years past (it took place in the 40's). The little girl in the movie, Addie, lives with her Grandmother and very moody father (Jason Robards), who refused to let her have a Christmas tree because he has never gotten over the grief of losing his wife (Addie's mom) after Addie's birth. That's all I'll say for now (don't want to ruin it for you), but it is very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"The House Without A Christmas Tree","review":"Was not what I thought it would be, Older film.

The movie, however, is one of the worst I've ever seen....and I even like some of the sappy B-grade movies. The film quality itself wasn't up to standard. It had a soap-opera quality or more accurately, the film quality of those cheap British soaps. In some scenes it was like a home movie with a camcorder. So, unless my Amazon purchase somehow landed a weird, pirated DVD, it's not worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story BAD filming.","review":"This is a great story, but the filming quality is terrible. I was not expecting the \\"sesame street\\" type studio it was filmed in. There are some actual shots of an old school and house outside, but the filming on the interior is like watching a high school play on stage, so it was hard to get into the movie, kinda corny, actually.

Now that's a great classic family christmas movie.!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A House without a Christmas Tree","review":"The last time I saw The House without a Christmas Tree was back in 1977. Since that time, it has never aired on Television, especially with all the cable stations, I thought it would definitely be shown. Finally after 24 years, I am going to see this movie due to my recent purchase. To me, this picture exemplifies feelings and values which are no longer displayed in movies. Eventhough the dialogue may seem simple and \\"goody goody\\",no film has left such an impression on me as this one.Sometimes the most simplistic things can leave more of an impact on one.This film reminds me of the times when life was simple and children were children, and people had values and morals.

There was also a Thanksgiving show and Easter show made with the same characters, but these were not as good.\\"The House Without a Christmas Tree\\" made an impresssion on me as a youngster and I was so happy to see it again.

Lisa Lucas was wonderful as Addie, and Jason Robards was perfect as the emotionally aloof father. It was indeed like a live play on video, and every year I hope to see it included in the Christmas programming. The last time I saw this show was in 1990, and it was a rare snowy Saturday afternoon. Rare because I am in New Orleans and we have a light dusting of snow every ten or twelve years, but it went perfectly with this suberb show. I cannot wait to purchase the tape and watch this tender, warm Christmas special again and again. Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a great show","review":"I saw this show many years ago. I still remember it. I must have been about 8 when I saw it because I remember that I could really relate to the young girl in it.

It brings wonderful memories of a time long past (for me)... just as it is a movie of a father relationship to his young daughter in 1946 which remains withdrawn, sad and at times angry due to the death of her mother at childbirth. This production is much like a stage play (filmed on video), and so, one feels closer to the characters than if it was filmed. The acting by Robards, Natwick and Lucas in quite fine. In a time - now - when Christmas movies are filled with elaborate special effects, this movie stands out as loving and heartfelt story-telling at its best. I highly recommend it as part of your annual holiday viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good experience","review":"I received my order very quickly and it was exactly what the seller stated.

This is a show that was filmed in a kind of play form - which just makes it that more special. It's heartwarming, without being gooey, funny, serious and meaningful all at the same time. Get this and watch it with your kids so they know what a QUALITY show is - not the stuff they show today. I've seen this when I was a child and it stuck with me through adulthood - it made that much of an impact. FYI - all of the other \\"Addie\\" shows are the same.

Lisa Lucas if you read this - God bless !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The House Without A Cristmas Tree","review":"To be honest, I haven't seen the movie just yet but I do intend to see it just as soon as I get a chance. According to an individual who saw the movie when it first came out in it's heyday, truly believes that I'll love the movie after I see it and I'm told that I will probably wonder why I didn't bother to see the movie right after I bought the CD. First of all, it's in color today not in black and white like it was way back then and second, they just don't make movies as entertaining as they used to back in the good old days which should certainly make the movie so much more enjoyable. But most of all, I was assured that the movie was a warm, most rewarding, memorable and highly inspirational movie classic so what more could anyone ask for and which I'm happy to say that I was able to get from Amazon The House Without A Christmas Tree, and so I grabbed my own copy for my own video collection at just the right price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-See Christmas movie!","review":"I'm so happy this is on DVD!

I searched like mad for the movie \\"Addie and the King of Hearts\\", and hope that it will someday soon be available to own. When I watch \\"A House Without a Christmas Tree\\", it takes me back to the warm fuzzies of my childhood. I wonder where Lisa Lucas is these days-- would love to hear her take on these movies from an insider's point of view. In my opinion, this movie should be considered right up there as a Christmas classic, like \\"Charlie Brown Christmas\\" and \\"Rudolph\\". They should start showing this one again every year, in my opinion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgia...","review":"My children and I first watched this movie more than 20 years when it was a Hallmark Hall of Fame television movie.

Sometimes the camerawork can be awkward as Neon walks toward the camera, and it starts to cut off her head. However, showing her at numerous angles doing the moves makes them easier, and she teaches them at a perfect pace to learn them quickly. I mainly dance at Middle Eastern and Latin nightclubs, so these moves naturally go with the music, but these can easily be used at any other club as well. I love this DVD and how easy Neon makes it to learn each move."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bayla","review":"I was disappointed when I watched these dvds. I purchased both of Neon's volume 1 and volume 2, and I am returning both. I am sure I could learn something from them, but the flavor and the spirit is not what I was looking for at all. I find her approach interesting, but I am going elsewhere.I was expecting more of a traditional type of instruction. Neon seems very talented, and is quite easy to understand, but this was not what I wanted. I am sure she is an accomplished dancer, but I wanted authentic music, and more traditional instruction for someone interested in belly dancing for belly dancing, not for clubbing, not just a surface approach.I have to say that the spacy techno music is HORRIBLE!!. How she chose that as accompaniment is beyond me. I love middle eastern music, and that was a real let down.I have to move on to something more to my taste. Sorry Neon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Instant Disapointment","review":"This DVD was quite disapointing. The structure was choppy. The overall look was cheesey and rough.

However, while I was testing them, I came to dislike the ear pieces - the part that connects over the ear. Instead of giving a better fit - or holding on to the ear, they tended to get in the way and be a distraction. The size seems good though - as I wanted something small that would let me use Skype while traveling."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you figure out how to use this item...","review":"The design of the ear pieces make this product borderline unfunctional. The ear buds are covered with the common type of padding making them too large to comfortably fit and stay in my ears and since the ear bud is the only thing to keep the headphones attached, any movement causes them to fall out. There is a roll of rubber under the earpiece allegedly to hold the wire away from your cheek/neck, but this adds to the frustration of putting them on. The added weight of the microphone makes the microphone side even more difficult to keep in a good position for talking. The sound quality seemed good, but the mic seemed especially susceptible to sounds of breathing, yawns and the depressed sighs of me trying to keep this contraption on... (and obviously the sound of the mic hitting my desk as it yet again falls off because I decided to look over shoulder.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound and very comfortable","review":"I spend a lot of time during business hours on Skype and this is an extremely comfortable headset.

He might not be as famous as the others but it is just because he can't accept the recording quality of major labels.With this CD, the super natural recorded sound can ride you thru extreme aspects of the piano & I have feeling like having Wild at home to play my favourite music just for me.If Chesky has a lot of money to spend on advertising as EMI, DG or Sony this CD might become a hottest sale already.

I cut the wire on the end I could reach, and tried to push the wire against the end that I couldn't get the scissors into. This is really a pretty sadistic toy. On the one had the birds absolutely love to hollow it out, but as they do they are tortured by the wire jabbing them the whole time. The ads for the toy claim the log is held by sisal, but sisal probably didn't work because the bird would chew it and the toy would fall.

While I admire the ICOC for its zeal and unity, I have to also add that they hold an unbiblical view of authority and also hold to some traditions of men such as their clergy/laity system (for more on this see Frank Viola's book Rethinking the Wineskins and also Who Is Your Covering?)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HAVE OWNED BETTER","review":"I am very disappointed in this curling iron.

The Toilet valve installed easily. It adjusts easily and works well in combination with the flush flapper. The only issue that I had involved the valve sporadically not releasing water on a flush. The float would drop, but no water flow. I could remove the tank lid and tap on the the top of the valve (blue piece at top of picture) and instant water. So, after about 6 times of doing this (again it was sort of random), I decided to take the blue top off of the valve. Warning, turn off the water first! I learned this the hard way. You push down and twist the top like a medicine bottle cap. It comes off and reveals the valve. I let water flow through it, reseated the top of the valve and haven't had a problem since.

Easy to install, took about 5 minutes max. Easy to adjust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent water saver","review":"I had a cracked fill valve that wasn't working anymore, so needed to replace it. While browsing the repair section of the local hardware store, I saw several products that would \\"tune\\" the water flow into the bowl to save water.Of the two, one had a roller valve that compressed a section of the hose and this one. Combined with the J tube to clean the tank, I was sold on this one.Installation was no harder than any other valve, though the connection to the valve was longer than previous, meaning my existing fixed line wouldn't work. Fortunately, I had picked up some flex hoses, so that wasn't a problem, but saved me a trip.Adjusting the flow of the refill line was easy, but involved flushing the tank a few times, so a bit of wasted water early on to save water in the long run.I'd recommend adjusting the flow to be half, and increase the flow if the bowl doesn't refill completely. Odds are you'll use your toilet again before the lack of water is an issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed after 6 months","review":"The valve got clogged up after 6 months, and water flows out to a trickle so it takes forever to fill the tank. No easy way to fix. My standard fill valve lasted 10 years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Installed easy, works well, didn't save me any water.","review":"This device makes a couple of claims. One being that it will save you water, and the other it will keep the grim off the bottom of your tank (which will potentially extend flapper life, etc).The claim about saving water may very well be correct for older toilets. However my newer american standard toilets, it didn't save anything. I measured the amount of water coming out from both of them, and they were nearly identical. Now I could lower the amount of water it puts out, and save some water, but it would compromise the flushing of the toilet.The cleaning part may very well be true, the water does come out the tube on the bottom, and seems to keep the bottom clean. Time will only tell if that will help or not.If you have a newer high efficiency toilet, this may very well do nothing for you, but for everyone else, this could save you a lot of water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, yet very effective","review":"I didn't exactly understand how this device worked until I got mine installed. When you flush a standard toilet, the incoming water does two things; it fills the tank which provides the force for the next flush and it fills the bowl. Water is directed to both purposes based on how high the water is in the tank. This is inefficient because the water in the bowl is at fill level well before the tank is and will just keep running with its excess just going down the drain.What this device does is to add a regulator to the bowl filling feed. With that regulator, you can calibrate it so that the bowl has just enough flow as to fill in the same time that the tank takes to fill. While this is simple, I'm %100 positive that it works as advertised and will save you the water that they claim it will.The cleaning tube thing is pretty neat too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Installs easily, quickly and really quiet!","review":"The hydroclean HC660 cleaned out the sediment in the tank in just 2 flushes. I had to use my channel lock wrench to get off the old valve, but the new valve had \\"wings\\" on the nut that made it easy to install without tools and the nut \\"clicks\\" when fully tighten so you don't accidentally over-tighten and damage the plastic housing! It fills the tank quickly and quietly. You can hardly hear the tank is filling its that quiet. I purchased the hydroclean HC660 at the local big box hardware store for around $12 and its well worth the $4 extra over the same cheaper valve that was replaced! I am seriously think about replacing the valve in the other bathroom even though it still works! Saving water is important and saves money too."},{"rating":"1","title":"PX-708A Stopped reading / writing DVDs","review":"I owned the PX-708A for less than 2 years.

Ladd's thesis is that the coming of Christ was the fulfillment of Israel's hopes for a Kingdom of power and glory. Jesus himself was the hope that the Israelites were looking for. The Kingdom wasn't a socio-political entity to put on earth during the first century but the spiritual reformation of those who became members of the Kingdom. The only problem I have with this book is that Ladd's view of the Gospel borders on works-salvation since he puts a lot of emphasis on the judgment theme. Overall, though, a good book for those trying to get a good understanding of the Kingdom of God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book - highly recommended","review":"I read this many years ago. It provides a fresh presentation of the message of Jesus based upon what the Gospels actually say rather than 2000 years of later interpretation. It is written in an easy to read style. It gives a clear understanding of the framework of how Jesus and his contemporaries understood his message of the Kingdom of God.This book overlaps with Ladd's more scholarly treatments 1) \\"Jesus and the Kingdom of God,\\" which in its second edition changed its name to \\"The Presence of the Future,\\" and 2) his wonderful book \\"A Theology of the New Testament.\\" I've read all of these and recommend them all.
