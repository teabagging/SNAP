No evidence is given for these accusations other than they altered the text to make it conform to their beliefs or to make certain narratives more alike. Prove it Mr. Metzger.The manuscripts for the Critical Text of which Mr. Metzger is so fond was found in Egypt. Wake up boys and girls, that's where the Gnostic heretics lived. They had access to the egyptian manuscripts and were far more likely to alter them than a christian scribe who believed he was copying the actual words of Jesus or the apostles.The Byzantine church kept to the original teachings of Jesus and the apostles far longer than any other group.

It isn't. Its gameplay hinges on using the stylus for everything except moving. That's never good.To dribble the ball, you have to continually tap the screen, which gets annoying after too long. You also have to memorize which way to swipe the stylus to make any shot, so if you're like me, you'll just memorize one shot and keep using it till it goes out of style.You pick three of your favorite characters to be on your team and face off 'tourney-style' against 3 other groups. That's kinda nice, but unlike Mario tennis or the other Mario sports games, your computer team mates cannot interact with the ball. You have to press the 'L' or 'R' button to switch to different members, and then control them to pick up the ball. Again, this gets really old really quick.All in all, I didn't find it much fun.

The only problem I've had with it so far is that my character sometimes throws the ball in a different direction when I want him/her to throw it to another teammate. Also, it can be hard for people that are left-handed to play this game because you have to use the D-pad(on the left side of the DS) and use the stylus at the same time.

It came packaged with 4 rather generic 6' DVI cables, which I used to connect the components to the switch, saving the MonsterCable for the switch's output to the TV.The result was great in all cases. That's when the scientist in me took over. I started swapping cables like mad, and asking any poor soul who happened to be around to identify the best picture. The result?

That is, I find myself getting bored with his albums as I wait for the tracks I like. I had purchased a big 4 CD set before and found that it was just too much for my tastes as well, but this 2 CD \\"Essential\\" set has all the great tracks and performances that I want, in fact, this (for me) is the best Willie Nelson album I've ever heard.

I am not a die hard Willie Nelson fan, but I have a couple of his CD's and have been to two concerts. I couldn't imagine these overly sweet versions of his recordings. I had a hard time believing that he could sound so bored. In track after track it was as if he were apologizing for his voice using back up singers that didn't fit him or his music."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Wilhelm I to Willie Nelson....great men will shine!!!","review":"Although Willie Nelson's Hohenzollern lineage has been debated for years, there's no doubt that he's the reigning emperor of country music. And this Willie will never abdicate the throne. From \\"Always On My Mind\\" to \\"On The Road Again,\\" Herr Nelson places us into the cockpit of one of the greatest thrill rides in contemporary music history, and all we can do is gasp for air. He may have traded in his pointed helmet for pig-tails, but there's more than one way to skin a cat. If anything, this self-professed \\"Outlaw\\" has been proving that all along. Gitty-up, my dusty-jeaned hombre!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good","review":"This was a gift for my wife, and since I live with her and occasionally drive in the van with her, I have heard this CD several times. I would not call myself a big Willie Nelson fan, but I have come to appreciate his music, thanks to my wife.

After setting it up for the first time, we were surprised when the DVD tray wouldn't eject after the first week. Thinking that we would get it repaired, but still needing a mini-system, we ordered a second system, expecting to re-deploy the first to another room. The second system worked for about a month until, lo and behold, the same problem occurred! Perhaps it was a coincidence, but fool me once, shame on you - fool me twice, shame on me. We won't be fooled again.

So, when I found a book with a title \\"How to write successful Fundraising Letters\\" it was as if I had won the lottery. I couldn't wait to get my hands on it because I was on a dealine to write a fundraising letter for a non-profit organization for which I had volunteered. I ordered the book, and paid just as much to have it deleivered the next day (local bookstores do not carry it). I found the book to be a tutorial and not something I could quickly benefit from. It is written to teach how to properly write and follow-up a fundraising campaign letter. The samples provided were very specific to 3-4 scenarios and did not offer much context. I guess I was looking for a book with hundreds of samples so that I could pick and choose phrases, paragraphs, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Search Elsewhere...","review":"I love Russian history and was hoping to find a book that dealt less with speculation of Ivans reign and more with the truth. Most historians tend to demonize Ivan based on little evidence, most of the evidence we have comes from letters written during his reign by a host of people, since I have read most of them I am not sure why I expected to find any kind of new information. She does a good job ignoring many details of what Ivan was faced with and instead decides to chalk everything up to, he was a maniac. Not a strong leader who was surrounded by enemies in and out of his own country, with several attempts made on his life due to the reforms he put in place, namely the Oprichnina. There are a handful of books I have found that can shed a much better light than this one, The Third Rome, Reinterpreting Russian History, and A History Of Russia Vol.1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely not Lite Reading","review":"Engaging and comprehensive history of Russian Tsar Ivan IV (Terrible). The prose is very dense, and at times the information flow feels almost overwhelming - sometimes making me feel as if I should be taking notes :-) Scholarly and well done work about an extremely intriging individual and period in Russia. For a general audience, perhaps a more narrative prose style would be more accessible -- but an excellent work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to Read Biography of Ivan the Terrible","review":"This biography of the 16th century Russian Tsar Ivan IV, or Ivan the Terrible is a certainly a well thought out and deep exploration of the life and reign of this eccentric and terrible autocrat.That said, it is a very academic treatment and the organization and prose make it an extremely difficult read for the layperson. I have read a lot of Russian history, including very academic works, and I found this biography a real chore to read and understand. Unless you have a very good background in Russian history, I would not recommend this biography."},{"rating":"2","title":"A WONDERFUL BIOGRAPHY","review":"This is probably the best book ever written about Ivan IV.

Those tracks start out heavy but not too much, the singer is screaming his lungs out, it's allright, but then the whole band slows the tempo by a half and the screaming increases and that's when most people will stop listening. Now don't get me wrong this is a great cd but i just think it dies today should make more singing tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing special","review":"They offer up nothing new or special on this release, just an average metalcore album.

The breakdowns are brutally heavy, but I can do without the cleanly sung choruses. I give it two stars because the breakdowns were so heavy, and the guitar work was very good, otherwise I would have given it one star. This is extreme pop-fashion-girlie pant-wearing metalcore that the young 'uns listen to...too trendy for me, but a good debut, I guess..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive debut - boys got big time game","review":"I'll put it this way - there's only 3 songs that you _won't_ want to play every time you pop this disc in. 8 excellent tracks (the other 3 are just brutal heavy, which suits me fine sometimes) - melody, Gothenburg flares, structure, double-bass, complexity, dark lyrics telling a full story, can def sing along. No amazon previews, it appears, so there's an ecard at itdiestoday.com, that has tracks 5 & 7... there's six more tracks like those on the disc, if you enjoy.It Dies Today leaps straight over Killswitch, Unearth, Atreyu, Shadows Fall (crushes easily), and The Haunted, into the top tier, if you ask me... #1 on that list, not a doubt. I haven't been this impressed with a thrash debut since Slipknot's first.Mainstream? Sure, why not. This album deserves to sell half a million."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great band","review":"I saw these guys live about a year ago in my little town of Johnstown before I knew who they were and they blew me away. They were a definite crowd favorite of the night and after hearing them I went out to buy this CD. This is a very awesome and heavy CD. I especially love Freak Gasoline Fight Accident, the title inspired by the movie Zoolander where Ben Stillers model friends die in a freak gasoline fight accident, hahhaa, thats funny. Anyways, I am glad I got to see these guys live before they were widely known as they are today due to their music videos, it makes me feel special.

I think melody and screaming are two perfected combonations of pure emotion in music. These guys are all about it! The screaming make you wanna bounce your head off the wall while the singing parts stick in your head like a mouse to a glue trap.

The only thing that sounds professionally recorded are the vocals, and even then they are sometimes lacking. Leave it to Trustkill to not take the time to put out a decent product...

Even though this was released at 2004, this is still good! I would say that they most brutal tracks in this CD are \\"Caitiff Choir: Revelations\\" and \\"The Depravity Waltz\\". Which are also my most favorites. But, Nick just doesn't say the words clearer, even when he sings with his clean vocals, he doesn't say the words correctly. I get lost in the lyrics, he ven say things that aren't in the lyrics, and I get so confused. But this still good, \\"Caitiff Choir: Defeatism\\" and \\"Severed Ties Yield Severed Heads\\" have very beautiful choruses. But, \\"Marigold\\" and \\"Naenia\\" are the least brutal songs in this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"I heard It Dies Today through the TrustKill website looking at eighteen visions stuff. I should mention also that i hate metalcore and emo/screamo whatever, with the exception of eighteen visions. It Dies Today is simply the hardest \\"metalcore\\" i've ever heard, sure at times the singer shows us how well he can sing clean, but his growling, deep screams shatter everything around you, and definately take the cake. The first track's opening guitar riff is mind-boggling, as it's an odd chord progression that sounds amazing. I would highly recommend this album to anyone that doesn't nessessarily like \\"metalcore/emo/screamo\\" but comes to music with a more metal approach, for the singing is very melodic....the brutal vocals give the album a finishing touch of hatred."},{"rating":"2","title":"My all-time favorite!","review":"I know some people find the scent of Canus' products to be too strong, but I found that the smell really grew on me (so much so that I've gotten their adult formula goat's milk body wash for myself *g*) And it doesn't really linger very long, it's just like a blast of fragrance when you pull the wipe out of the package, and it makes the um, cleanup a little more pleasant.As for the wipes themselves, they're strong, soft, clean well, and are kind to my daughter's skin."},{"rating":"2","title":"love the scent!","review":"These wipes are well worth the money.

This performance, culled from a public television special, is truly a special one, although it is marred by low video and audio quality.

Seeing the band laugh, smile, and just \\"have fun\\" brings it all back. My favorite performance on this DVD is Bruce Johnstone's extended intro on \\"Got the Spirit\\", reminding me why I loved this player and this band.

So though it may not be for the Jazz-only crowd, it appeals to 'eclectic' funk-rockers.

Will and a school buddy then find a tunnel on one of their digs, and follow it - down, down into a culture resembling their own but of a past era. But there is danger, too. Then they learn that they are going to have to descend further, and into the unknown interior of the earth itself to find Will's father. What else will they encounter? This book is first of a series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A snore","review":"I found this play to be extremely dull. There is very little action and the jokes are very dry. The storyline of a man who has had his dreams stepped on his entire life now finally seeing them about to become a reality is marred by the trite stereotypical characterizations. Several of the characters do not add to the story and their presence doesn't even make sense. Further, the story just plain isn't interesting. This is one I would definitely pass on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Floating in My Mother's Palm","review":"Not as good as Stones from the river. I was looking to read more about the community of Bergdorf and the characters as they moved forward in life. Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why so morbid?","review":"Wonderfully written but generally morbid. I loved Stones and immediately again appreciated Hegi's incredible writing ability. Like Stones, the environment in which the stories take place is grey and depressing. Some of the stories are very uplifting but most are about horrible things that happen to regular people. The only reason the repetition of this type of story makes sense to me is that at a certain age these are the types of things kids focus on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich and Poetic","review":"Rich with a poetic style and flavor all its own, Floating in My Mother's Palm, is a beautiful exploration of the complexities of small towns.

Hmmm.I would find it confusing if I hadn't read \\"stones\\" first. Absolutely an amazing writer. Her ability to describe thingsand use the correct words are phenomenal. A love her injections, as the butcher giving them the legs from the chickensand then they tantalize their friends by pulling on the cords and making the toes go claw-like.

Even the data sets used throughout the book cannot be found on the book's website. It is also very dull to read. I feel like I am reading a dictionary or reference book. It could be better if they contained updates that fixes the errors in its formulas, provided exercise problems to practice all the Excel skills it tries to teach you, and provided a CD or website location that contains all the data for the examples the book uses. It should try to relate its examples to real world problems or projects that you would actually use in a job situation. For example, the book can try to build several Excel models, with each chapter building a function or module of the overall model. All in all, I would not recommend the book. I'm surprised all 5 reviews thus far has given it 5 stars. It makes me say hmmmmmmm."},{"rating":"2","title":"The machine is great, BUT !","review":"The machine is great.

An excellent A to Z book for a beginner, as well as an intermediate kayaker. Very well written, magnificent illustations, great (British) sense of humor. The deficiencies: very vague on correct forward stroke techniques; describes many variations of eskimo roll, but again somewhat vague on how to learn to roll. Also the section on features of different kayak models is 15 years out of date, not updated for this edition. RECOMMENDATION: Buy it by all means, but it should not be your only book on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careful!","review":"This book is very exciting, taking a tried and true real estate investment technique ('subject-to' purchase) and adding a twist that supposedly makes the exit strategy (what would otherwise be known as a 'sandwich lease-option') safer than the traditional method for everyone concerned.Further investigation, though, indicates the practitioner should be very careful in following these recommendations. For one thing, the argument is used that the land-trust technique touted by the author's real estate services company prevents the mortgage-holder from exercising a due-on-sale clause. Cleverly backed up by a partial citation of a federal regulation, but not true.This technique may indeed be valuable, may indeed make everyone feel safer, but the central premise is faulty. I recommend Mark Kohler's 'Lawyers are Liars' as a balance to this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"This is an excellent book on land trusts by the best \\"guru\\" around.

It has traps, puzzles, and red herrings. It has a kind of dungeon ecology, in that it has many societies who stake out portions of the dungeon.And lest you forgot it, it's huge. Massive. 840 pages. Well worth it, even if you break it into 15 chunks and run them as seperate adventures instead of one very long one."},{"rating":"2","title":"worlds largest dungeon","review":"Really good book at good price.

Wading through the dungeon, itself, is a massive undertaking, forcing the reader to do the publisher's job too is simply asking too much.The uncountable minor errors will plague the hapless reader throughout the tome, and major gaffs will have more attentive readers scratching their heads (changing the name of the Goddess in Region C halfway through the Region).Unless you have a high tolerance for incompetence, I recommend that you stay far away from this goof-fest!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worlds Most Boring Dungeon","review":"I bought this with the hopes that it would be a good old dungeon crawl with all the great things we all love about a dungeon. Unfortunatly after 2 levels of the dungeon my group and I had to stop. With room after room with nothing in them and , door after door with nothing behind them we grew so bored we just couldnt go on. Reading ahead, I do see that there appears to be a bit more content but it is few and far between. This book may be best used to pull ideas from but certainly not to run from begining to end. If you want my advise, DO NOT bother with this book.

A lot of the same square rooms and hallways as we try different ways to speed up mapmaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"And the party enters another empty room.","review":"This book is certainly large, and with all of the maps, a value, but a GM will need to modify it heavily to suit his campaign in order to make it useful.As other reviews have stated, there is not a lot of variety and it can get just plain after you have played a level or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Girls Next Door Second Season DVD set","review":"I love the Girls Next Door, the second dvd set is much better than the first because in the second dvd set they offer a watch all episode feature so that you do not have to keep going back to the main menu to start another episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Season 2-Girls Next Door","review":"WOW WOW WOW!!

It's so obvious that this is a Christian storyline- Simba is returning after he's turned away for so long and he finally takes up his responsibilities...just like humans. We take back our responsibilities as disciples of Christ. God bless and enjoy this soundtrack!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Adults: Three, Kids: Five","review":"Based on the 1994 Disney movie, \\"The Lion King\\" is a visual masterpiece on the stage, with its creative sets & animal costuming. The parade of animals during the show's opening number, \\"Circle Of Life\\", is alone worth the price of the ticket.But the production left me feeling so-so, as it's clearly a show for children.Listening to the score does not change my opinion. The music is mostly beautiful, with a cast providing the appropriate feel of the plot's locale, but certain songs refocus the attention to the production's primary audience.For family-fare, this is an extraordinary show & is an excellent introduction to theatre. For adults, this is a beautiful show with a few great songs.Best Tracks include:Circle Of LifeCan You Feel The Love TonightHe Lives In YouAdults: Three, Kids: Five, Average: Four"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch","review":"This is not the recording for the Broadway show.

I saw the show and aside for the spectacular visuals it was SOOOO STUPID! The movie was MUCH MUCH better. I can't believe the Tony committee would committ such an atrocity and give this show its top honor, when Ragtime is the best musical since Les Miserables and deserved that award!If you want a REAL Broadway musical - get Ragtime. Ragtime won best score/book/and orchestrations...how that doesn't add up to Best musical I'll never know.Stop now- go up to search, type \\"Ragtime\\" and buy it.The Lion King is a garbage cartoon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A theatrical masterpiece","review":"I was never an extreme fan of disney, and was hesitant to veiw the production in Toronto because I thought it would be too childish. I will be the first to say how wrong I was. That play could have only come from a theatrical genious, and the songs reflect that.This complete collection of the shows songs feature an amazing instramental variety that one would have to be deaf not to appreciate. The vocals are amazing. All the great old favorites are here (circle of life, can you feel the love tonight, etc) along with some amazing new pieces (He lives in you).Any fan of broadway, any fan of the lion king, and anyone who can appreciate good music must get this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Applause!","review":"I have this cd, and it is wonderful.

It's a marvelous cd, and for those avid broadway fans (Or anyone, really), I recommend picking this cd up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, with some rough spots.","review":"I bought this CD shortly after watching the Broadway show. Most of the songs were great, but \\"Rafiki Mourns\\" and \\"One by One\\" weren't to my liking. And some parts of \\"The Madness of King Scar\\" are pretty suggestive. I could see how someone could find the song offensive or too racy for younger children. However, I liked how they used some instrumentals from the movie as songs. \\"Chow Down\\" is pretty funny, too.So basically, if you're worried about your children listening to suggestive lyrics, I would consider buying this with a bit of caution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe it won the GRAMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"OK, I haven't seen TLK on b'way, but I own the CD, and must say it lacks the excitment (from what I've seen) of the staged version. Yes, a disc is just a one-demensional form of viewing it. But look at Chicago, it is a great CD.The songs from the movie do justice to the stage, but who thought of those new songs? Except for Endless Night, they're all TERRIBLE! I'm not one for african, but I have a \\"good ear\\", and know that the new music doesn't belong on the CD....but it may belong onstage. I just don't know. The CD without the film songs would be a total waste, and abuse to a fine work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great voices","review":"The CD arrived on time and in excellent condition.

I still enjoyed the song Circle of Life."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD","review":"The broadway musical \\"The Lion King\\" is a combination of incredible musical talent and vocal performance. That is why it would be sad NOT to buy this cd. If you have seen the animated version of Lion King release by Disney, you will find all the great songs like \\"Just can't wait to be king\\" and \\"Circle of life\\" (here comes the lion). Yet in addition will find a very fun song in which the hyenas sing about there soon coming meal of Simba and Nala. Also included on the cd are fun versions of \\"The Lion Sleeps tonight\\" as well as songs found on Disney's sequel to \\"The Lion King\\", called \\"Simba's Pride\\". All the great ones and some new ones are found. If you have a choice between buying the original soundtrack and the broadway musical version...buy the Broadway version.

But just as impressive, and the motivation behind our purchasing this CD, was the music -- \\"Chow Down\\" and \\"I Just Can't Wait To Be King\\" are viral and sometimes echo in my mind unbidden; others, like \\"Hakuna Matata\\" and \\"He Lives In You\\" are great sing-alongs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"Many people who have heard the music from the movie The Lion King would be surprised to know how outstanding the Broadway recording is! Using songs from the movie and also new ones, this CD has everything - from cute songs (\\"The Morning Report\\") to African chants (\\"The Lioness Hunt\\") to truly moving pieces (\\"Endless Night\\".) The performers are so incredibly talented, and the music is beautifully written! I haven't yet seen the play, but I am going in just two weeks and I cannot wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, Powerful Music","review":"One of the most memorable c.d's I have ever listened to, this album is not just about one type of music, but diplays a variety. It goes from African chants to rock and roll. The individual voices are memorable, but the ensemble is absolutely teriffic. It especially bring a liveliness and power to the African chants. Some songs are embedded in emotion and power (such as \\"Shadowland\\")but others are more light and humorous, (i.e. \\"The Madness of King Scar\\"). No matter what mood you're in, you are sure to find a song which will couple with your emotions at any given point.

Other awasome songs are: The Circle of Life, Shadowland, Endless Night, Can You Feel the Love Tonight, King of Pride Rock/The Circle of Life(Reprise), but I think that the whole cd is perfect, awasome something that just Broadway can do"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disney Spectacle!","review":"This recording proves a lot of things...First of all it proves why Ragtime should have won the Tony, because with out the bright costumes and special effects, you have this album - which besides \\"Endless Night\\" are all recycled songs from a cartoon movie. The Ragtime CD - which I highly recommend, is much more exciting and inspiring even just to listen to. A great musical (worthy of a Tony winning) should not rely on special effects, and should be just as affective as if the cast were in street clothes (which applies to Ragtime)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Take away the special effects and you get this recording!","review":"I recently saw The Lion King on Broadway, and as I sat in my seat I thought to myself \\"Disney is trying to buy it's way to Broadway, YES \\"The Lion King\\" has all these \\"great\\" special effects BUT the music/story are not comparable to such great Broadway hits as RAGTIME (which should have won the Tony) and such less known musicals as the \\"Scarlet Pimpernel\\" Don't waste your money go to the video store and rent the movie!

It had the upbeat feeling that is the usual trademark of Disney. Elton John made his mark in \\"Chow Down\\". It was very Elton John, but not all the songs are like that.

Well, this will blow you away! The songs from the movie were redone beautifully, and all the new songs are superb! \\"Morning Report\\", \\"Chow Down\\", and \\"Madness of King Scar\\" are clever and give some more due attention to Scar, Zazu, and the Hyenas. (though I personally was not fond of Scar's Broadway portrayal). Then there are the Grasslands Chant, Lioness Hunt, and Rakifi Mourns, sung in Zulu with a very authentic feel. And who can forget \\"They Live in You/He Lives in You\\", \\"Shadowland\\", and \\"Endless Night\\", which are variations of songs from \\"Rhythm of the Pride Lands\\". \\"Shadowland\\" has got to be the only song that rivals its RotPL counterpart, \\"Lea Halalela\\". Also, the scores from the stampede scene and \\"King of Pride Rock\\" are excellent. \\"King of Pride Rock\\" has more of that beautiful, soft, wrenching music than in the movie, it's lovely!

I just saw it a few weeks ago and bought the CD hoping that the original cast would be better than the cast on Broadway now.The CD is wonderful and there are some beautiful songs such as \\"ShadowLand\\" and \\"Can you Feel the love tonight\\". My only disapointment was that some of the voices were better in the cast I saw. Scar who now is played by Partrick Page is a much better singer than the original person and so is the Rafiki, even though the original does have a stunning voice.So I still treasure the CD for its memories, but I would say try to see it on Broadway and see Page as Scar...his plays that part perfectly and his voice is so much better than any on here."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lion King Soundtrack","review":"We love this soundtrack so much! We saw the Show on Broadway which was AWSOME! My Favorite song on there is \\"I just can't wait to Be King\\" and \\"The Moring report which has a fast and snappy tune.

The war remains at a distance, percolating by drops into the story through the reactions of the adults who surround Matia and her cousin, Borja. Spanish cultural patterns and insights make for colorful and interesting reading. Matute's style of writing is uniquely different: lonely, stark, and intensely detailed. The story is bizarre at times, almost surrealistic. Camus-like images of the sun and light and glare evoke the excruciating realities of existentialism. Images are strong and not always pleasant. Tender moments are tender indeed, but the undertoe of isolation, cold-hearted authority, and prejudice pulls the reader into a world poignantly desolate, foreign, and ultimately, cruel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away","review":"Very disappointed in this record.

We used this cream for about a week, with great results...until one day when the cream adhered to her skin, causing burn-like sores on her diaper area. We discontinued immediately--had to use antibiotic ointment for days until it healed. Maybe it was just too strong, but I was very disappointed as this product claimed to be gentle for sensitive skin. Boy is that wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product!","review":"With 40% zinc oxide, I challenge you to find another product with this and at this price.

The problem is.... is that when you do come to buying the album, you'll soon find out that the rest of the tracks have nothing in the songs to offer to you, and since all the other tracks are not interesting, you soon lose all interest into the songs you did like before.Don't get me wrong, but i believe that Trustkill Records used to be a whole lot better a couple years ago, but now it seems they have lost most of their BEST bands and put in some that just dont seem to divide themselves from all of the other bands in the music industry. and although roses are red are not horrible..... their just not the kind of music to be really deeply into. and because of that i would not recommend this cd..... or at least borrow, or find another way to hear all of the songs before buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hires to you, Blossom!","review":"This recording is indeed a rare gem. After her stint with Verve Records ended in the early 1960's Blossom recorded this wonderful album for the Hire's Root Beer Company (yes, you read that correctly!) in 1963 as the cover suggests. You could purchase it by sending Hire's two bottle caps and 50 cents to cover shipping costs. Needless to say, this is one of her rarest releases... Luckily our friends in Japan have somehow secured the rights to distribute it! (with the ever-groovy OBI strip and inner booklet in Japanese) The recording does have a couple of mastering flaws as it is in mono and lifted directly from a mint-minus vinyl copy of the original. However, these little shortcomings are soon overlooked as you enjoy Blossom's ever-fabulous rendition of 12 standards. My particular favorite is 'I wanna be around'. Grab this CD now while it is still around!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the home office","review":"I had mentioned to family that I was considering a small bookshelf system for my home office/guest bedroom, and this one materialized as a Christmas present. It's perfect - the sound is excellent in an 11x12 foot room (it's actually just as powerful as my big set in the living room). The sound quality is a big surprise! It's small enough to fit into just over 2 feet of shelf space. I'm living kind of in the boonies in relation to the city, and the FM antenna pulls in a lot of stations I hadn't been able to get before.

Steven Watson stears clear of glorification and awe, and brings you inside the little worlds of these real life characters.

I especially appreciate the in depth look at Joan Vollmer Burroughs, an often overlooked main character of the Beats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pictures, great quotes","review":"This was one of the better written books I've seen on the Beat Generation.

He is one of the BEST COMEDIANS ON THE PLANET! His material is unique and always funny. He is not afraid to make fun of himself or to poke fun at the hecklers either. He will draw you in with his story telling skills and leave you in stitches on the floor. A lot of his routine is geared toward the 30-40 something crowd, but there is something there for everyone. You should definitely give him a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is no \\"Uncool\\"","review":"I have loved Greg's comedy since the first time I heard him do standup on late night shows. I have worn out the Uncool CD and my wife still wears her Uncool T-Shirt. He's a great comedian.However, on this DVD he seems...off. Off color, off-base, off-kilter...just off. Yeah, he swears on Uncool, but it's in the service of the great and varied stories he tells. On this DVD, he spends almost the whole first half of the DVD dropping the F-bomb and talking about anal and regular sex and related tangents. It had moments that were funny, but it was just too long on essentially the same subject, and the F-bomb ratio seemed to be way higher than on \\"Uncool\\" and it seemed really lazy as a result.I can't recommend this DVD. The second half is much better, but it's just not enough to overcome the tremendously slow first half. It's just not that funny overall. Enjoy Uncool instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blast from the past","review":"Discovered the song \\"Shine\\" as end credit music on a DVD. What can I say...it totally caught my ear. Great music & lyrics. A keeper for sure. Nuff said..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am glad the DVD was scratched...","review":"We rented this movie thinking it would provide a great deal of humor and entertainment but it didn't. We kept waiting for it to suddenly become funny but all of the clever lines were used during the out takes before the film's premier. When this movie started skipping and then stopped it was probably trying to self detonate because it just was not funny enough to be worth the cost of renting much less purchasing and storing in your own home until the end of time. It was painful to watch and I certainly would not recommend it for purchase. The movie critics may say it was a fantastic work of art but I wanted to be entertained and I wasn't. This story line had a lot of potentional but sadly it missed its mark. I only gave it one star because a zero was not available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drags","review":"Is it just me or does this movie seem to drag on and on? I was expecting more from the director of \\"Broadcast News.\\" That was an excellent movie and this is not. Adam Sandler should stick to comedy. This movie didn't come together like it could have. It was disappointing. The only bright spots were the acting of young maid and her daughter. Cloris Leachman is not a funny drunk, she is a stupid drunk. Let's not glorify drinking for the young kids, OK?"},{"rating":"1","title":"One star too many","review":"Who keeps hiring Adam Sandler and why? He plays the same, unappealing, barely dimensional dolt who's no more appealing than lint and even less functional. The film is rumored to run for 130 minutes but it seemed like days before my daze won out and the off button took the lead role. Tea Leoni was obnoxiously and annoyingly good in her role as the neurotic, insecure wife. I couldn't stand her. Cloris Leachman was the only real talent so naturally, her screen time was limited. Paz Vega shows potential but in this vehicle, I can only imagine that she jumped before it ever stopped moving. She did in fact, attempt such a move. How symbolic that was! Do not pay to see this movie. Instead, buy a pack of cigarettes. The effects will be preferrable to sitting thru this farse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spanglish movie","review":"This movie is about an immigrant family of a mother and a daughter who move from Mexico to California.

I love that it doesn't have your predictable ending that all movies have. I don't want to go into to much detail as to not reveal anything. All I can say is that this is not only a must see, but a must buy.

Don't touch this with a barge pole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now I know why I don't see Adam Sandler movies","review":"I thought that this movie would be pretty interesting. The previews for it made it seem like it was funny. I however found it very boring in parts and sort of stupid. The charactors were either over the top or fall asleep dull with very little middle ground. Also the running time was too long, it says it was just a little over 2 hours, but to me it felt like much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"A flop about a wimp and a nonsense issue","review":"Disappointing. I agree with the professional reviewer on this site who said that Adam Sandler was in over his head in this role. He does poorly in it. Why is he played as such a sap? Why is it that you want to smack him every time he fails to assert himself?I don't buy the multi-cultural nonsense either, the big deal about the Hispanic daughter losing her culture. What kind of issue is that? What kind of moron thought that was a big issue? Oh hell, you don't want to hang out with Anglos, you don't want to go to a prestigious school, you just want to live in the Barrio. Oh give me a break. It's idiocy. A non-issue for dummies.The film is simply a big flop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Unbelievable","review":"Spanglish is a big boring mess, with terrible performances by Adam Sandler (completely miscast) and Tea Leoni. If this had just been a movie about a Mom from Mexico trying to deal with raising her daughter in the US, it would have been great. The performances by Mother and daughter, Paz Vega and Shelbie Bruce, were excellent.The most unbelievable part of the film was that the audience is supposed to believe that Adam Sandler's character, a chef and restaurant owner in LOS ANGELES, speaks not a word of Spanish! Not a chance in real life. Who do you think is working in the kitchens in these fancy restaurants? Spanish speaking employees."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spanglish","review":"I think this is a great drama! Adam Sandler does well in a serious role. The dynamics of culture and family relationships were shown very honestly - you could relate to the characters and feel the emotions the characters felt. The movie leaves you feeling sorry for Adam Sandler's character because of his wife's problems. I did feel bad for him in that he was in a difficult marriage with a difficult woman. However, while his wife had an affair - Adam Sandler also seemed to have an emotional affair. I also felt he made it pretty clear he'd be willing to go for an physical affair of his own if given the chance. So in some ways I didn't think he was the \\"bigger man\\" but this movie will really get you feeling invested in their story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Culture clash","review":"This movie starts out with the college application to Princeton by a young Hispanic girl who is writing about the most influential person in her life--her mother (Paz Vega). She relates the story of how her mother was hired to be a housekeepr by a neurotic Anglo woman (Tea Leoni)who demeaned her daughter for being overweight and who did not appreciate her long-suffering husband (Adam Sandler). Paz's warm and accepting manner wins over both Sandler and his daughter, but does not endear her to Leoni, who spoils Vega's daughter with outings she does not have permission to take. This movie touches on issues of race and social class, and has surprising depth. As many of the other reviewers, I expected this to be a shallow comedy, but I was pleasantly surprised by its thought-provoking content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pandering, Insulting Mess","review":"... and those are the good qualities. Since when is breaking the law seen as \\"funny\\" and \\"whimsical\\"? Apparently it's when it involves breaking our immigration laws. Sad to see how \\"freely\\" this movie depicts the act. It really shows how we've somehow slipped into this euphoric state where we longer care about our borders. Really glad the Minute Men have the guts to do what our goverenment DOESN'T. Back to the movie: Ok, the characters were not likeable, the pacing was dull, and even Adam couldn't salvage this mess. If you liked real comedies like As Good As It Gets or Punch Drunk Love steer clear of this train wreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"So unbelievable, I'm pulling off my hair","review":"The only believable thing about this movie is that it was made in Hollywood. Who the hell thought of casting Paz Vega as a Mexican maid? That would be believable only if she were an upper-class woman who went bankrupt or that for some reason had to assume a new identity. Go ahead and check every damn house in L.A. and find me a maid that looks like that--as white, as sophisticated, and as beautiful.

I think the acting was great from the entire cast. I really loved Cloris Leachman. I just wish the ending was a bit more uplifting."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this movie about?","review":"Aside from the misleading trailers that pitched this film as a comedy, this movie never finds its voice. Is it a wise and knowing comedy? A drama about culture clashes and the crazy things Anglos get hung up over? I'm not sure. The characters give us no clue. Adam Sandler looks lost as the perfect dad/celebrity chef. His motives are never really clear. I think Tea Leoni is a great actress but her performance here is one note and manic. The maid character Flor is so perfect and wise it feels like a stereotype. There is wackiness here and there is drama but the characters are drawn so broadly and the plot is so meandering that it's hard to care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your typical Adam Sandler Movie!","review":"I have never been an Adam Sandler fan; however, this movie is really wonderful. Sandler has matured as an actor and is apparently taking roles with more meat and less physical comedy. His character is the polar opposite of Tea Leoni's. His love for their children and his understanding of human nature just shine through. Leoni is perfect as the neurotic, narcissistic wife and mother. A wonderful foil to Sandler's even tempered character. While you might think this is a great date movie, I think it's a better married with children couple date movie. Lots of truisms here. Favorite line: When Leoni's character tells her mother she isn't helping with her low self esteem, and the mother replies \\" these days your low self esteem is just good common sense\\". Sandler just might make it to my must see list for the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad","review":"I purchased this on someone's advice - to see Cloris Leachman. Turns out she had a very small part. This is a movie strictly for Adam Sandler's diehard fans. Even he's not at his best here. The writing was one cliche after another. Bored, I found myself wondering how much exercise Tea Leoni has to do to get that body."},{"rating":"1","title":"Relentlessly Phony","review":"Some of the worst acting ever seen on screen. Sandler is totally unbelievable as an adult to whom any responsibilities would be given. Leoni is a frenzied wreck. Each character is a type rather than a person. None is developed. One leaves the movie exceedingly grateful that caricatures such as these (the husband and wife, both of whom are half-witted or addle-pated)do not inhabit one's world.The film is poorly written, execrably acted (except for the Mexican contingent and the banshee's daughter) and directed, wretchedly edited, and a sorry excuse for entertainment. It is totally baffling that anyone would give this morass a positive review. Only the first and last five minutes (featuring the sane mother and daughter) are tolerable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice surprise.","review":"So much better than what the trailer suggested. Great hunour and a lesson in the importance of families."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good","review":"I wasn't sure how I'd like this film so I waited for it to come on video before I watched it. I found it rather pleasing and full of little life lessons that anyone could take away. Like that fact that if you don't tend to your marriage, you could find it slipping away and if you don't have enough strength of character, a love affair could occur. And that communication is a vital necessity in families, and without it, life is just one BIG chaotic mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spanish a Romance Language","review":"Spanglish was worth the wait. Adam Sandler did a wonderful job in the romatic comedy. It really showed the range of his acting ability. This was great movie to watch with someone you love. You will learn to appercaite them when the movie is over. Tia Leoni's character was a bit annoying but the rest of the cast made up for her annoyingness. Has some great suddle chemistry between Adam Penolope. Really has a story line that will pull at your heart strings. This was one of the better movies I have seen in a long time.

My head was ringing. Truly, this is one of the worst movies I've seen in years; you find yourself bewildered at what you've just witnessed: hysteria, over-the-top \\"acting\\", crying, yelling, communication breakdowns that become positively exasperating, etc.Every single character is a stereotype - no one ever deviates from their stock-role: hysterical rich white woman; long-suffering husband; alcoholic grandmother with a sharp wit; children who are smarter than their parents and shockingly un-damaged by it all; and the coup-de-grace: the Mexican housekeeper who is noble, wise, and quintessentially feminine.This film falls apart all over the place - how can no one see this when it's being made?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good!","review":"If I had known how good this movie was, I would have went to see it at the movies instead of waiting for it to come on a movie channel.

The movie is told from an essay, an essay Flor's daughter writes. I don't see a real point in this movie. The ends aren't tied well, and after the movie is finished, I am left with questions.The script is bad too. One part in the movie, Leoni (who plays the wife of Sandler) hires a woman (Paz) to work in her house when the woman speaks absolutely no English and has a complete language barrier? It makes no sense.Adam Sandler is the big-name in this movie, and I like his movies, though this one isn't one that I enjoyed.

A fitting tribute to Bon Scott. Brian Johnson is a legendary perfect fit for what seemed an irreplaceable front man. AC/DC will rock yer socks off. This remaster is awesome.

It's worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Upping the big riff, stupid lyrics ante","review":"Deprived of their third greatest asset (assets one and two being, respectively, their gift for grimy working-class hard rock riffs and their disinclination to apply those riffs to unreasonably weighty subject matter), AC/DC's first post-Bon Scott album finds them scratching out their most convincing batch of riffs and matching them with some of their silliest lyrics. Songs like \\"Given the Dog a Bone\\" and \\"Let Me Put My Love into You\\" leave even less to the imagination than the most adolescent minds need. But the scratched-guitar intro to \\"Back in Black\\" has been stuck in my mind for nearly two decades, \\"Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution\\" is a title for the ages, and \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\" is the finest song they'll ever write and a high point in the history of heavy metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"BACK IN BLACK!","review":"who DOESN'T own this album?!? man what are you waiting for? click add to shopping cart. why? let me explain :a) this is known as one of AC/DC's greatest albums of all timeb) this is known as one of rock's greatest albums of all timec) with songs like hells bells, shoot to thrill, let me put my love into you, back in black, shook me all night long, and noise pollution...how could you POSSIBLY go wrong?!?!now this isn't a typical review for me...I usually write long, educated, specific reviews, but I figure this album speaks for itself.

Brian Johnson really did his job as the new vocalist in Back in Black. The Young brothers also did great(As they always do). Here are the best four songs on the album.HELLS BELLS- haunting but great. Makes you really think.SHOOT TO THRILL- Great opening. Lyrics are a bit strange, but the lead guitar is unbelievably good.BACK IN BLACK- One of the most famous rock songs ever. Perfect beat, perfect lyrics, perfect guitar, all in all, a perfect song. This one goes in the history books.YOU SHOOK ME ALL NIGHT LONG- My God, these guys are crazy, but that's why they're great. This song is so wraunchy its not even funny.There you have it, the four greatest songs on this album. Every AC/DC fan(or rock fan, for that matter) must have this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Transition","review":"Ok, AC/DC was, at this point, just getting over the death of their first lead singer, Bon Scott. They Hired Brian Johnson and with this album they gained their greatest fame. The only real problem you may find with this album is that every song ends in a similar way, with a little jam session or bent last note. However, this is a worthy album of any CD or album collection, and is for the most part a most impressive album. Angus can whale and is fun to listen to, Brian has an amazing high register, and Malcom lays down the rythem perfectly"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the greatest rock albums of all time","review":"after the death of bon scott are thought the band was dead too.but they came back as hard as ever.brian johnson filled in for bons shoes very well.this was the only release i wore out 2 lps and two tapes playing this one.thank god for cds. hells bells,have a drink on me,shoot to thrill and let me put my love into you this rocks this is a must have for any one and i sure most every one owns a copy of back in black"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back In Black...? ... YES!!","review":"AC/DC is BACK IN BLACK, baby! This album is kickin', and if you don't wanna get up and jam your ... off when you hear it, I don't know what's wrong with you! The guitar is killer, especially on my favorite tracks, Back In Black, You Shook Me All Night Long and Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution!This is their best yet, and they did it without the legendary Bon Scott. Johnson has not dissappointed. Back In Black, and like Hell too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginning of the End","review":"Although this is the first full-length with Brian Johnson on vocals, the band had already seemingly reached their musical peak during the Bon Scott era. The 8 releases that followed this album are almost identical in substance, and weigh heavily on the release of the title track from each respective album to keep fans interested. The previous 6 studio releases with Bon contained at least some variation as the tracks progressed through the album. It seemed like producer extraordinaire, Mutt Lange, mastered the tracks for this album to sound polished and radio-ready during the recording process. You can hear similar over-production on titles such as \\"Hysteria\\" and \\"Come on Over.\\" Stick with the earlier AC/DC releases for true gritty rock n' roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop Whining You Tools","review":"For gods sake, 'brian cant sing' 'its stupid becaus bon isnt there' GROW UP. brian is a fantastic singer, even tho he might not hav the sneer of bon, he makes up for it in concerts. he gets the crowd into it much more than bon did A GREAT PERSONALITY. i gave this a 4 bcaus it is nowhere near ac/dcs best album, any of you who think this is ac/dcs best album annt fans.

But The Rest Is Filler"},{"rating":"2","title":"bon who??","review":"when this album came out in 1980 people were not expecting much from the thunder from down under.. especially after the death of original singer bon scott. Well everybody knows what happend after that.. back in black has become one of the best selling albums of all time and one of the best rock and roll albums of all time. Every single song on the album is great. my personal favs are back in black hells bells and what do ya do for money honey, i suggest you by the record if you like rock n roll or hard rock.. The best hard rock album of all time in my opinion"},{"rating":"2","title":"um...anyone heard of Australia?","review":"I wasn't going to review this cd, because most people already know it's a classic. However it seems as though not a lot of people know where they originated from. First of all, none of the band members in AC/DC have any ties to the U.S or Texas for that matter. The majority of the band members were born in Scotland/England and Phil Rudd/Mark Evans (early member) were born in Melbourne, Australia. Despite this AC/DC grew up in and became an Australian based band in Melbourne, but had ties in Adelaide and Perth.As for the cd, there's not really a lot to say about it that hasn't already been said before. It's by far Brian's best effort, and is one of the best Australian cds ever released. I would recommend that the remastered version is purchased, as the sound quality is a lot better and also has enhanced links to additional extras via their website.Oh..and please don't ever compare Limp Bizkit/Korn to Black Sabbath and AC/DC again, thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing..","review":"No lyrics, no new histories,no bonus tracks.

Hell yeah!","review":"After Bon Scott's death, the future for AC/DC looked pretty grim. However, not listening to what the critics said, they decided to recruit a new singer, Brian Johnson, and give it another try. That \\"try\\" became one of the staples of true rock n' roll. \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\" , the title track, \\"Shoot To Thrill\\" and \\"What Do You Do For Money Honey\\" are nothing but classics.

It comes at you all out from the beginning and never lets up. This is proof that rock and roll doesn't have to be fancy to be amazing. The booming drums come straight at you with nothing fancy but they get the job done in a big way. It is a wonderful experience to hear how the vocals, guitar and drum come together to create an amazing sound.Most any other band would be proud to put this forth as a greatest hits album for their career while to AC/DC it is just another great album.I love this whole album but my favorite track is \\"Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution\\" followed closely by \\"Back in Black\\", \\"Hells Bells\\" and \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music is good, dualdisc doesn't","review":"I'm very dissappointed with this dualdisc, unfortunately this dualdisc is only a CD side and a DVD-Video side, I thought it would be a DVD-AUDIO side with high resolution audio and it's not, it has standard, compressed, lossy dolby digital audio in 5.1 channels, what's the point?, music is good, im just reviewing this dualdisc edition which doesn't really add any good to the standard CD version which i already have! so it makes this a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Great!","review":"I remember being 13 years old when this album came out, and everyone talking about it at school. 5 years later I was singing in a rock band and trying to sound like Brian Johnson.

Pick this one up for sure....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Dookie","review":"No, of course not the album, which is obviously a classic. The dual-disc is a complete ripoff in relation to its advertising. As an audiophile (wannabe), I bought this version for the \\"entire album in enhanced LPCM Stereo\\" on the DVD side. Typically that would be at a much higher sampling rate, better bit depth, or something enhanced. In this case its 48khz, 16 bit PCM, which is basically the same quality as the CD side (more or less, perhaps a slight uptick). They didn't even use that much of the available storage on the DVD side and they gave us this! It's just wrong, wrong, wrong. Poor product design and deceptive advertising. No wonder this version is not a classic with the audiophiles. Who makes these decisions?"},{"rating":"1","title":"AC/DC Back in Black CD","review":"This was a gift for my husband. He is a huge AC/DC fan and only had the album in vinyl for Back in Black. He was so excited to get it in the CD format.

He sounds like a cat with its b@lls caught in a vice. Absolutely talentless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good as Gold","review":"The entire album is good, head banging, body rocking fun that lifts you out of your chair and onto the floor to shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it!

Its so rare for lightning to strike twice for a group after a lead singer goes but here it did. 5 stars best of the best!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"<<< FEEL >>>","review":"So many bands consider AC/DC music as simple three chord blues but this is just not accurate enough. So many bands try to cover these classic songs but they never get it right or hammer it home. The reason of course is what is called \\"feel\\". The sound of this album is so atmospheric, you could cut it with a knife. You can feel the sadness, the anger and despair of losing Bon. You can feel the sense of urgency to make what had to be the best product of their career and what you get out of listening to this is an education. You learn exactly why AC/DC has outsold The Rolling Stones, Aerosmith, and even the mighty Led Zeppelin because the music is never pretentious. It never tries to be more than just what it is which is good time, hard driving sweat soaked rock and roll and it is sincere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock, y","review":"Los rumores apuntan a que Bon Scott dejó escritas las canciones de este disco antes de morir ahogado en su propio vómito tras una fuerte borrachera. Parecía imposible superar \\"Higway to hell\\", pero \\"Back in black\\" es la cima no sólo de la banda, sino de todo un género músical: el heavy metal nunca volverá a significar lo mismo que en la década de los ochenta. El cambio de compañía ha demostrado que los japoneses (Epic) son más cuidadosos y cariñosos con sus ediciones que los dinosauros de Atlantic."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD-Audio Quality Disappoints","review":"While the audio quality is okay for a CD, I bought it for the DVD-Audio quality. Everybody's correct in saying that it's two-channel PCM, and that's why I'm disappointed. Sure, it smokes next to other CDs, but it's just flat when you compare it to other DVD-Audio disks.If you want good surround mixes or lots of dynamics, take a listen to any of the Talking Heads discs included in their Brick collection or to Donald Fagen's Morph the Cat. Even the Who's Tommy, which was originally recorded in the late 60s, on DVD-Audio, has much more dynamic range and detail than this disk does.Sure, the music's good, but I was really hoping that the opening of Hell's Bells would rattle my teeth. Instead, it just rattles the cheap plastic clock I have hanging on the wall behind my system."},{"rating":"2","title":"An All Time Top 10 Rock n Roll Album!","review":"If you're looking for a handful of tunes that are filled with heart-felt insightful lyrics meant to change the world, you're in the wrong place. If you instead want an in-your-face rocker that'll kick start pretty much any party, this is the one you want to plop into the CD player. Back in Black deserves to be on every rock n roller's short list of best ever albums! Yea...the lyrics are filled with innuendo and sexual overtones, but as far as 'thumpin' classics sure to get even the dullest member in the crowd rockin', this baby warrants very serious consideration. If you like 70's rock n roll...this one's a must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Album from Rock Legends","review":"With Back in Black, AC/DC not only achieved their greatest success but showed signs of crossing over from the bluesy bar-rock of the 70's into 80's Arena Metal. The opener Hell's Bells is very much a dark metal song, but every track is delivered with the same attitude and intensity of AC/DC's earlier efforts. I like to break albums down track by track but here it's not neccesary, the tracks are all very similar. Regardless the AC/DC sound never gets old and the final track only leaves you wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Album Through And Through","review":"I first listened to the cassette version of this album when I was 14 years young. I am now 31 years young. Many things have changed during this period. I loved rock/heavy metal music then, but I prefer rap music now. I recently chanced upon the aforesaid cassette when I was tidying up my store room. I wiped the dust off the cassette cover and it returned to its original black. It brought back a lot of my memories .... both sad and happy ones. I looked at the condition of the cassette and I was certain that it had deteriorated beyond repair. I looked at the titles of the songs and started humming the tunes. I still remember the rythm after 17 years! The material put out by rock/heavy metal artist nowadays has not come close to within a light year of this album. So, to the younger rockers out there ..... \\"you ain't heard nuthin' 'til you heard dis\\".I will buy the remastered CD version of this album first thing tomorrow. I am sure my beloved son will nod to this too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Guilty pleasure record......","review":"This is one of those cds that my dad always cranked up in the car when i was a kid and I now still love the songs and they really stick to me. \\"Have a Drink On Me\\" and \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\" are my two favorites.\\"Hells Bells\\" and \\"Given The Dog A Bone\\" are fun songs just to headbang around to. It's really fun music. Have I emphasized how fun this cd is.This is a must have cd. Period."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Album that made me listen to everything else","review":"This is probably the single most important album I've ever heard. Without this, I wouldn't be anywhere with music. I'd be listening to all this new crap that sucks. From the opening gong of Hells Bells to the final note of Brian Johnson's favorite Rock N Roll Ain't Noise Pollution, you will not be disappointed. When I saw them in 2001 on the Stiff Upper Lip tour, they played half the album, or close to it. I saw Hell's Bells, they opened with Shook Me All Night Long, Halfway through I heard Rock and Roll..., Back in Black, and the second song was Shoot to Thrill. If you don't own any version, someone should smack you. Where have you been? This band holds the 2nd highest number of catalogue sales in the U.S. second only to the Beatles, but that's no surprise. Most of the album still gets radio play. Buy it now (probably the 2003 remaster) now. Then go back and listen to Bon Scott piss people off."},{"rating":"2","title":"AC/DC Back In Black","review":"After being sad about Bon Scotts death AC/DC set out too find the replacement singer. They soon found what they were looking for, Brian Johnson and than set out work on there biggest album too date 1980's Back In Black. By the time they were done recording it they had 10 hard rock tracks that were destined too sell such classics as, \\"Hells Bells\\", \\"Shoot To Thrill\\", \\"Back In Black\\", to the hard rock ballad, \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\", things never stop rocking on here. Though its not the same as Bon Scott era AC/DC i think it lives up too that. Too date this album has sold over 25 million copies worldwide and still sells to this date. And its actullay a silent tribute too Bon Scott. It truly was the beginning of an era and era thats still living to this day with AC/DC's upcoming realese, \\"Black Ice\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back In Black","review":"What can be said about the greatest rock album ever?AC/DC were at their best on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids Love It","review":"My kids heard the song \\"back in black\\" when they watched the movie \\"Iron Man\\" and they asked me whose song it was.

This disc does not contain that. It does not contain any dvd audio at all, only the DVD-Video content, for which the audio track is 16bit/48khz.A true DVD-A disk has content in the AUDIO_TS folder on the dvd when you explore the folder structure on your pc. This disc has an empty audio_ts folder, just like any other DVD-Video disk would have.Sony is misleading in the advertising of their dualdisc.

There are none in the entire series, even in records that, in their first CD print, contained them (Example: DIRTY DEEDS DONE DIRT CHEAP).

It represents the strongest and most consistent songwriting of the Australian band's career. The riffs on such tracks as \\"You Shook Me All Night Long,\\" the title track, \\"Hells Bells\\" and \\"Given the Dog a Bone\\" are irresistable. This isn't complicated stuff, as evidenced by other songs with names like \\"Let Me Put My Love Into You,\\" \\"Have a Drink on Me,\\" and \\"Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution.\\" But the band achieves a sort of simple mastery here that they would never quite reach again. It is the milestone of their long career and one for heavy metal music in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"its ac/dc mach 2, what more do you want?","review":"with the exeception of the awful let me put my love into you (thats really sweet, guys), this is only a cut below highway to hell. my one complaint is that the humor is not all there, but given the circumstances of creating the album right after bon scott died, its quite understandable. that said, this album definitely stomps. brian johnstons vocals were once described as \\"singing as though someone was holding a cattle prod to his scrotum\\" and the description holds up here, the vocals are inhuman! the riffs behind you shook me, what do you do for money, and back in black are phenomenal, the solos sizzle, its simply one of the best hard rock albums of all time. after this, there was nowhere to go but down."},{"rating":"2","title":"An all-time classic, start your collection here!","review":"I borrowed this cd from my friend and it blew me away how cool it was, and I just had to have it! Every AC/DC collection should start right here, because it is amazing. This was Brian Johnson's first album with the band and I have to tell you, his vocals seem eerily similar to those of Bon Scott - in a word \\"raspy\\". Very cool, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best dumb party albums","review":"AC/DC continue on as if nothing happened, finding a new singer (Brian Johnson) with a more extreme, high-pitched growl, and punching out this 10 million-seller. This album became amazingly successful, considering how heavy it was for the time. The large riffs and anthemic hooks continue, making this one of the biggest beer-drinking, burn-out dope-smoking albums of all time. A thousand bands (most of which sucked heinously) would attempt to duplicate this album throughout the 80's, without success. Somehow, this seemingly dumb and simple sound works for AC/DC and very few others. Biggest hit single, \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\", actually gets played in dance clubs pretty frequently, a testament to the song's massively catchy rhythm."},{"rating":"2","title":"ARE YOU READY TO ROCK N ROLL???????","review":"I bought this CD last year with the new epic version. I still can not give it a break from the CD player I truely love this CD. The sound is better than the orginal also their is videos on the CD if you pop it into your computer. The booklet included has out of this world pictures of all the band members at their best. And the song list is HELLS BELLS, SHOOT TO THRILL, WHAT DO YOU DO FOR MONEY HONEY, GIVIN THE DOG A BONE, LET ME PUT MY LOVE INTO YOU, BACK IN BLACK, YOU SHOOK ME ALL NIGHT LONG, HAVE A DRINK ON ME, SHAKE A LEG, AND ROCK AND ROLL AIN'T NOISE POLLUTION. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"when rock was rock","review":"Rock broke the mold with this album/CD. I first heard this when it was on vinyl back in 1980. We all knew, deep down in our bones, that were witnessing magic. Twenty-odd years later, it's obvious we were right. Compared to the crap called rock today, this CD is incredible. These guys today playing \\"heavy\\" rock are missing the one important thing that matters most-hooks! It's all about the songs, folks. None of AC/DC would win awards for being great musicians. But they perform enertaining music that \\"sticks to your ribs\\". They are The Beatles of hard rock!Every song here is a winner. Not to endorse drinking, but try not to slam a beer if this CD is playing! If you can, my hat's off to you. Own this piece of history!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great \\"in memory\\" album","review":"This album came after the death of Bon Scott, one of the most unique singers in voice and style for our time.

This is a great album, and one that actually has no \\"bad\\" songs, and all the songs are worthy of hearing actually."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back in Crap","review":"TO ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO THINK ACDC ARE THE COOL GUYS, WHO THINK THEY ARE THOSE CRAZY GUYS, YOU ARE WRONG, ACDC ARE LAME, VERY LAME, THEY KNOW LIKE THREE CHORDS AND HAVE THE COMBINED MENTAL AGE OF A FIVE YEAR OLD.

But then again it's too UNSTRUCTURED and SIMPLISTIC and -- dare I say it -- H E A V Y ! You get some primordial sludge like Fun House on your CD player and you'll come out a fulfilled person; you put on this and you get mild ribaldry and riffs that sound the way cold oatmeal tastes i.e. bland as they come.

While cited for being over the top sexist, every rocker girl I knew understood it was just saying out loud everything that was being said and done while the chase was being plotted. All part of the game,and this was perfect background music for the whole ritual. Yes,it's about booze,dr#gs and women.Regarding this remastering job, it's one of the best I have ever heard. Sounds like this is being played live,instead of being a studio effort,and I mean this as an absolute compliment. We KNOW how much studio time and effort went into this album,but for this to NOW sound like a perfect live recording?!

If you don't already own the CD, the popular songs you'll know are Hells Bells, Back In Black and You Shook Me All Night Long. If you like them, then the rest of the songs on this CD won't take long to grow on you. Especially, Let Me Put My Love Into You. I promise that this CD will not disappoint.This is one of my three favorite Hard Rock/Heavy Metal albums from the early 1980's. The other two are Judas Priest's \\"Screaming For Vengeance\\" and Def Leppard's \\"Pyromania\\".Hope this helps.Darium"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Album","review":"Ahh........the sound of my youth. I am sure that just about anyone from my generation has heard every song on this album at least a couple of times. Party anthem after party anthem. The band basically has copied this formula on every album they have put out since this one. The album starts out with \\"Hells Bells\\" and ends up with \\"Rock N Roll Aint Noise Pollution\\". The album contains one of my favorites \\"Have A Drink On Me\\" (tribute to the late Bon Scott). Some of the lyrics on the album are pretty bad, and the music is about as basic as it gets, but this one will always remain a classic rock n roll disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most overhyped album ever.","review":"This was the AC/DC comeback album after Boon Scott died and they picked up Brian Johnson.

AC/DC one of, if not the best known bands of all time. Although their lead singer, Bon Scott died shortly after the recording of \\"Highway to Hell\\", AC/DC carried on. And boy did they! Nobody else could've done this CD like Brian Johnson did. His singing is part of the reason this CD did so well. Of course it also helps when your band has great guiarists, an excellent drummer and not to mention one heck of a bassist.As soon as the album starts and you here \\"Hells Bells\\" you know your in a a ride.

There's just too much I want to own, and for certain artists, owning a CD full of their best stuff is perfect. But AC/DC doesn't have a Greatest Hits compilation. So what's the next best thing? Get \\"Back in Black\\". It's nearly a greatest hits record. I love every song on here but one (just not a big fan of Given the Dog a Bone).

This 20 million selling disc, released in 1980, still stands the test of time.

March to Quebec is history as a primary source, and it is amazing. The volume consists of the journals of then Colonel Benedict Arnold and several of the patriots who accompanied him on his ill-fated march through the Wilderness of Maine during a sneak attack on quebec. The idea, which Arnold and his mentor General Washington cooked up, was to take Quebec and add it as a 14 colony/state. There was much adventure and intrigue. Some famous names invloved on the March are Nathaniel Green, Daniel Morgan, Dearborn, and even a young Aaron Burr.

This movie can give the viewer an education on the charasmatic Moroccan leader Abd el-Krim and the Riff wars 1911-1927, they portray him as an honorable and noble yet brutal leader. March or Die can be used as somewhat of a history lesson for this period in world events.

In the late 1930s, it is Juan D'Arienzo that they denigrate, and in the preceeding decade, it is Francisco Canaro. Never mind that he was the most recorded tango artist of all time! It's true that as the 30s became the 40s his music lost sublety, becoming almost martial in its beat, but in earlier years he still stands with the best. This CD presents some of his best recordings from that period, beginning with \\"A media luz\\" from 1926, his first electric recording.A few track details.

But, unfortunately, radio will not give her the time of day. And that's a shame. The lack of radio airplay for this record shows the deeper problem w/ country radio. They've abandoned the TRUE STARS & performers for \\"personas\\".

Oslin strongly announces her return to the music world with this outstanding CD flawlessly produced by Raol Malo of The Mavericks. K.T. effortlessly delivers convincing vocals in every track, whether the song is uptempo and fun, or filled with the sadness of a love gone stale. Favorite cuts for me are the title track, Mexico Road, I Can't Remember Not Loving You, plus Drivin', Cryin', Missin' You. The listener gets a pleasant surprise with the stripped-down version of If You Were The Only Boy In The World which flows right into the laidback swing of Mean To Me. K.T. sings Cole Porter and it's a match made in heaven! And with her sultry technopop rendition of Come On A My House, K.T. promises much more than candy!

Katie begins working with Willow King to help his legs straighten and turn him into a champion.This is an excellent book for all horse lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly outrageous!","review":"Willow King by Chris Platt is the most exciting and entertaining horse book I have yet read. Katie Durham's struggles in raising the crippled Willow King into a quality racehorse teaches the young girl something about herself as well. Gifted with such a strong spirit, King never gives up in the process of straightening his legs; Katie, possibly short on self-confidence in certain areas of her life, learns from her horse that one must never fall in the face of defeat. Dealing with a snobby neighbor girl and a handsome ninth-grader only adds to the excitement of the tale. Will Willow King be able to correct his crooked leg problem, and be able to go on and win such races as the Kentucky Derby as Katie dreams? Willow King is definitely a must-read, far outshining other novels in its class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This book is great, though you have to admit, it could have been written a bit better.

It was done by his father, but if you go to www.joeypearson.com and buy his new CD, Novel, you will see a huge different. Not only has Joey's voice improved, but the tracks are awesome, and very well done.

I think maybe he had his friends write some reviews for him because he isnt as good as everyone says I dont think.He sings like a little kid who can sing pretty good. But he does Opera type trilling in every single line and it is annoying to me. Besides that the echo is triple a normal recording and the songs are pretty silly.I think he must have recorded himself in the garage and then put it out here. Oh well, lived and learned. When his voice gets stronger he will probably be better and he may have some real songs to sing as well. Maybe I will check him out in a few years."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's amazing that he is only 10!","review":"I can hardly believe that such a developed and strong voice can come from such a young person.

He's a great kid with a wonderful personality. I believe that he is really going places. One day I will see him on a big concert stage with thousands of screaming fans, and I will say, \\"I KNOW HIM!!!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm quite impressed!","review":"Joey Pearson is, in my opinion, a pretty darn good singer for his age; not the cream of the crop, but better than most 10-year-olds. I'm not sure whether he takes vocal lessons, but if not I think they could really benefit him. He has a very strong vibrato but he needs to learn to control it, as I must say it hurts my ears. His voice is also rather tinny, which can get annoying after a while, but he's definitely got talent, and I'd definitely give him a chance! If little boy singers that sound like girls ins't your cup of tea, you don't have to like him, but I happen to love little boy singers! No one I've seen so far can compete with Billy Gilman, but I still will acknowledge their talent. Good luck Joey!

The button for the contrast does not work at all, making the numerals invisible at night. My other complaint is the user's manual. We had several questions about the operation that should have been addressed in the manual but were not. For example, we tested the alarm with the ipod and the first song came on. How do you set the clock to wake up to a particular song? Can you even do that? The manual did not address that. There was not even a parts list, leaving us wondering what two items were.

Despite his devotion to blues/rock, he never quite reached the fame and accolades that he deserved. This CD reveals the depth of Rory?s talents and his ability to play many different styles, mainly acoustic, including flamingo, rag, roots and traditional Irish music. The CD is mainly a compilation of songs Rory recorded at various times and locations that never saw the light of day until now. The songs are beautifully arranged and serve the memory of Rory well. It is time to gather your pennies and buy a little bit of history. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rory Gallagher music","review":"Rory was everything that a rock star should be - and a whole lot more besides. Despite being lumped in with the early \`70s guitar virtuosos on the strength of his spirited and prop-free live shows ( check out Live in Europe and Live Irish, not to mention the Taste power trio ), he was an extremely sensitive as well as exciting musician of the highest order who liked to mix light and shade in his recordings.Here is a beautiful set of acoustic Rory which reveal the more eclectic side of The Man, sometimes neglected during his highly successful career in favour of ( some very special ) Stratocaster and slide pyrotechnics.He himself always reckoned that his live performances were a kind of antidote to the more melancholic, personal material in his songwriting ( check out Rory Gallagher 1 ) and vice versa. Here you get a very satisfying blend of the two. Marvellous. Rory Gallagher music. Brings a twinkle - and a tear - to my eye. Cheers mate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Acoustic Work from an Electric Legend","review":"I have been a fan of Rory's since his days with Taste in the late 60's.

I shall treasure it always, and recommend it to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Duggan knows his stuff","review":"This was a fine and accurate depiction of the Roman army.

It details the lives of two Gauls serving in the Roman army who end up among the captured legionaries serving the Parthians after Cassius' defeat. Unfortunately, it is merely an extended set of episodes, not a unified narrative. The characters and context are likewise thoroughly undeveloped--no immersion at all in the world of Gauls, Romans, or Parthians. The novel is equally disappointing from a military perspective--no rich descriptive material on tactics or events. The book feels like an outline for something much, much richer, but as it stands is merely an uninspired exercise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst ever","review":"Nothing like reading a very dull book about an imaginary looser.

Frankly, it made me think about things which, as a woman in my early 20s, I simply don't want to think about. Growing older. Losing the ability to perform simple tasks which I once took for granted. Feeling alone and unloved. The fact that it made me want to think about these things, that it made me keep turning the pages when I was tempted to put it aside, I think that demonstrates its power.I think it's no accident that many of the negative reviews for this novel here are by teenagers -- I don't know if it's possible for someone that young to be as touched my this novel, to understand it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It portrays realistically the life a strong women.","review":"Margaret Laurence did an excellent job at balancing the past and present.

I found Hagar's character to be so bitter, angry, and grouchy that it just put a damper on the whole thing. She (as well as the other characters) is well fleshed out and that just makes things worse.There are several things you can pull out of this book but the most obvious one is the classic example of a person who is so proud and stubborn that s/he is unable to accept love or give of it. That's the character of Hagar and like her, this is a novel you'll want to avoid because it's a very dour thing to contend with.Darkhorse86"},{"rating":"1","title":"this book is pointless and uninspired","review":"This book was very irritating to read.

If you pick up this book, you are in for a boring read."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only there was a God.","review":"Everything about Hagar Shipley is repugnant. From rathervisceral descriptions of huiman ugliness, I could find some literaryvalue. It's a technically solid book, but quite honestly, it's -boring.-Authors should feel in some way compelled to be telling a story. One of those simple mysteries, it seems. It seems a rather fitting sequel to W.O. Mitchell's who has seen the wind, and in fact I see a lot of sharp parallels. Unlikable narrator (though little Brian is simply incipid, while Hagar manages to be thouroughly horrid), dawdling, Seinfeldian plot that isn't really a plot at all, and a vcery frank account of praire life.I find myself wishing Bampton would just smack this woman.

Really, who wants to read about growing old and dying alone because you hated life and all the people it brought to you. This book is full of regrets and is endlessly tormenting to the reader that your every mistake will kill you in the end and that self-independance is a killer. They make you read this book in high school now and everyone in the free world with the right to education knows that a book they have to MAKE you read is not one that most people would WANT to read. Too bad you cannot make it no stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book that leaves nothing to the imagination","review":"The Stone Angel by Margaret Lawrence is a novel that doesn't leave much to the imagination. Hagar Shipley describes everything from a fart to being undressed in incredible detail...so much that the reader doesn't really need to know.It is also a novel where Hagar tries to give advice to other people without taking it herself. She is full of pride, so much so that she dies while fighting over a glass of water with her daughter. It is a sad book, but not emotionally sad. It is pathetic that Hagar can't accept the fact that people will be people, and there's nothing that she can do about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring english assignment","review":"I am a straight A student (grade 12) and a bookworm.

On the other hand, Every single Female in the class loved the book, while every single male hated it. The women said that they could get in touch with Hagar and they could understand what she's going through.

Yes they make you read this book in Canada! How can anyone be so cruel? How horrible is this book you ask? Let me put it this way, you'd have more fun watching your toilet seat than reading it. It's about a very old woman (ancient) talking about her failed relationships with men, and complaining about how her kids abandoned her, yada yada yada. And if you're Canadian like me, you've probably had to do quizzes on it in grade 12. Let's see \\"Who gave Hagar water when she was in the hospital?\\" or \\"What was her favourite flower?\\" ...It's boring, unimaginative, and a woman's guide for hating men.

It is an excellent book from a technical perspective, but lacks a lot of feeling. The emotions in this book, while well defined, were a bit dry and didn't draw me in. I was also REALLY tired of hearing about Hagar Shipley by around two thirds of the way through (and I do realize that this could be the author's intention).

Lines such as, \\"with thoughts too wild to speak about, I think of you, I can't live without it, because you're everywhere and all around me, I'm dancing on the rooftops by the sea\\" from \\"These Reasons\\" are both image-filled and Dylanesque.

We can create the stories, but the reality itself is more chaotic and never fully explainable.On another level, the book is easy to understand. Boy moves to city, boy finds self and falls in love, boy's friends get AIDS and die. Although this plot line is somewhat of a cliche, and truly heartbreaking, the vivid characterizations and passions of the characters in their life make it a book about living rather than about dying.This is one you'll ponder for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"E-X-C-R-U-C-I-A-T-I-N-G","review":"Readers who have already experienced The Man Who Fell in Love With the Moon do not need to be told that Tom Spanbauer can write a stunning and excruciating book. But I do think that they will find In the City of Shy Hunters to be more stunning and more excruciating than even that earlier work.Without saying too much, this is a novel that any serious student of literature or culture cannot afford to ignore, and I hope it finds an audience far wider than that. Buy it, read it, lend it to your mother.

The descriptions of the characters' dress, of places and things mundane lard the tale like cholesterol in an artery. The accretion of the quotidian eventually becomes mind-numbing. (What was his editor thinking?) The situation isn't helped by the fact that the punctuation -- there are no quote marks -- is affected and annoying, leading to sentences like: \\"Maybe I should just confront, I said, The chef, I said, Maybe I should talk to Daniel.\\" By page 100, I began to skim, looking for names or phrases that might signal an advance in the plot. This proved fruitless, however, since the narrator frequently recants what he has just said. Eventually, I put the book aside. The really unfortunate thing is that Mr. Spanbauer has considerable talent. I suspect this same story would have been terrific if he had indulged the reader instead of himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing style is horrible.","review":"This book is barely readable.

It was too big for the camera, but too small to put an extra battery in the case with the camera. The thing was just too bulky and for all that bulk it didn't cradle the camera very well at all.

The author went too fast and did not describe the principles of the parts of speach in depth enough. He even used grammar principles that he hadn't described yet to describe the current principle of that section. In fact, he even admits a few times throughout the book how hard it is too follow. Another problem lies within the ways he tries to explain the principles; they're too abstract for any person to make a difinitive conclusion on weather that is the part of speach they're looking for or not.

Now, I'm already planning on passing AIRFRAME on to another co-worker when I go back to work next week.I can attest to the authenticity of Chrichton's coverage of the inner workings of the \\"Norton\\" plant in Burbank, (one of the actual Lockheed commercial aircraft plants was still located in Burbank around this time, and I myself had worked at a medium-sized Lockheed plant 40 miles to the east in Ontario)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Found this at a library book sale for $1...","review":"...I overpaid!I usually enjoy Michael Crichton books. This was not one of them. Lots of rambling and technical jargon with plodding, forced and uninteresting corporate suspense worked in. Crichton clearly did alot of research about airplanes and aeronautics; unfortunately, he shares all it with the reader and most of it is boring. The book reads like a movie script. I'm guessing Hollywood was smart enough to realize no one was interested. Read Crichton, but skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've read 7 other Crichton books and loved them, this misses the mark big time.I've always enjoyed the way Crichton teaches the science behind his chosen topic. He's always been able to write it in as an interesting part of the story. This time it was so predictable and dry - every time something technical is explained it's to begrudgingly train the new guy...boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"never really got good","review":"It grabbed my attention at first, only to become kind of boring.

It is so unlike Crichton to produce such trash. He gets so technical that I'm certain this book would appeal more to an aircraft enthusiast than it would a lay person. I really hope he produces better stuff in time to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Boring","review":"I like Michael Crichton's books. I started reading them before he became famous.

Please Michael, go back to your old style."},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid.stupid.stupid.","review":"I checked this book out of the library with high hopes of another masterpeice along the lines of congo and the andromeda strain.........not so.One has to wonder if the cabin pressure was'nt a bit low on the plane when MC thought up the ending to this pathetic offering. avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost as factual as Dr Seuss.","review":"Not as factual and not as entertaining as the good doctor. As an aerospace engineer, the only reason I finished the book was to see how inaccurate a book could be. The concept of flight testing an aircraft after it has exceeded design allowables is inane. Even the desciption of an aircraft plant was impossibly exaggerated. Maybe Mr. Crichton should have gotten a tour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sort of blah. But an okay read.","review":"I read this book in three hours. I skimmed past most of the jargon, since it had barely anything to do with the plot. Every once in a while I'd stop and tell my wife, \\"This is a dumb book. It's boring and slow.\\" And she'd say, \\"So stop reading it.\\" And I'd reply, \\"Nah, I have to find out what happens.\\" And perhaps that summarizes Crichton's skill, to be able to write engaging mediocrity. A stellar example of pop fiction--brain candy, an okay distraction from real life, better than a made-for-TV-movie but instantly forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Lousy","review":"Unfortunately for me I read this book shortly after I read Cold Mountain - kind of like following up Filet Mignon with a big bowl of Apple Jacks. I suppose there are those who prefer Apple Jacks though...The character development is exceptionally weak. None of the characters were interesting, all were predictable and cliche. The ploy of the 'assistant' who needs all of the details explained to him is especially sophmoric. This book is a good mindless read, nothing more. A few interesting details on the inner workings of aircraft, delivered with a pretty awkward touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Airframe: an instructions guide of how to deal with planes","review":"I just can't say that Michael Crichton hasn't the Gift to write. Yes, he does. The problem is that he's too much worried about research. I'm not saying that an author who's writing about a subject he/she doesn't dominate shouldn't research about it. But Michael Crichton is so worried about it that his books sometimes seem to be written only to those people who understand about it. And instead of a good entertainment, we have in our hands an instructions guide. That's exactly what happens to AIRFRAME. The plot is filled with information about those biggest airplanes and their structure and the whole thing. Boring. Boring. Boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"Where is the thrill that MC used to turn out? Not only is this book thoroughly dull, it's terribly written.

Typical Crichton style up to the very end. Awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and flat","review":"This book is a trite mystery written by a bad mystery writer. Facts emerge that the reader never knows about, and in the end the conclusion to the mystery is absurd! Flat characters, unexplained events, and sterotypes make this a poor work of fiction. Some humor though. Newsline (Nightline?) and Reardon (Koppel?) are humorously portrayed, but alas they too are mere stereotypes. Save your money. This book has little; kids might like it though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow to the start, but a smash, bang ending.","review":"Definatly not his best. I suggest starting with Andromeda Strain if you want to read Crichton."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD AMERICAN STANDARD","review":"Pros: A good book full of suspense and a sympathetic female main caracter in a technical environment. I had fun to read it in a few days. Like in his best novel (Disclosure) Crichton provides (or seems to provide) some inside aspects of professional life in technical companies. Moreover, when looking at recent news, parts of the plot have become reality. Cons: Crichton's language and his dramatic means are limited. You find repeats of certain phrases a bit too often within the text."},{"rating":"1","title":"too many give aways","review":"The biggest problem that I had with this book is that I had the thing figured out by page 40. I enjoyed the tense writing style once the media got involved and I enjoyed the overall pace of the book but I think there were just too many obvious clues dropped as the book went along. Try Agatha Christie if you want a tough mystery!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This is my first Crichton book. As a Private Pilot myself, I have a HUGE fascination in Air Disasters, and thought this would be 'right up my allay'. It wasn't. In all fairness I've only read 1/2 of it but don't intend to finish it because it doesn't seem to be going anywhere?! Starts very well but then slackens off rapidly. I've found that there are too many characters which are not established long enough to be remembered (I had to keep flicking back to remember who they were!?!) The plot doesn't thicken, there is way too much technical jargon (some of it might as well of been written in Latin) and the chapters are too short, so there's a lot of chopping around. My advice... unless you're an aeronautical engineer with a lot of time to spare... skip it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Soooooo disapointed","review":"I was serioulsy expecting an entertaing book when I bought this. When I finished, I finished VERY confused. The plot seemed to jump all over the place, and didnt teach me a thing, which is unusual for a Chrichton book. It was boring and slow and confusing. Hope Timeline will be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Boring subject makes a fascinating read","review":"Air frame is about the plane industry, the new form of gotcha journalism, the labor union, corporate intrigue and an investigation, into deaths aboard a Norton-22 Widebody plane flying from Japan to Nevada. The story is told in bits giving you key elements to the story through four or five characters. All the characters are really convincing, and have believable personalities, there's a lot of character's in this story and even the minor one's have quirks that separate them.This is a story that I would have passed on otherwise if not written by Crichton, He know how to and intrigue to a story, this novel is very fast paced and has it's edge of your seat moments, wondering how this is all going to come together. It does have a cheesy plot where the bad guy tells his scheme and says there's nothing you can do about it.All in all it's a good quick read that seems very real"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"This is the third Michael Crichton book I've read and definitely the worst..It is very slow moving and way too much airplane technical lingo..."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"I kept waiting for this story to get better, didn't happen.

One fantastic twist at the end and you want to cheer ! Take that Newsline."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't be able to put it down","review":"True to form, Michael Crichton writes yet another novel about a topical issue - this time the issue of public airline safety in the new deregulated environment we find ourselves in.There's something about Michael's novels that seems to capture me, but I just can't seem to put any of his books down once I start. The characters are plausible, and you often feel like you've learnt something after reading any of his novels.Airframe is no exception. In presenting the troubles of a fictional airline manufacturer that competes with Boeing and Airbus Industries, Crichton exquisitely illustrates the motivations and the vested interests of everyone in the industry, from the manufacturer to the airlines to the media and the public.It's an incredibly thought provoking read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting, but not very convincing","review":"I am not interested in how in depth this book goes about unions and toher inter large corporation scandlas.

I loved Jurassic and Rising Sun,but please do not waste my money again. You just left out ...lights..action...! Your screenplays are excellent and make for wonderful TV and movies. Please just make up your mind which hat you are wearing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Plot weak, characters so-so, technically excellent.","review":"The characters are probably portrayed more accurately than I would care to admit. The plot left a good deal to be desired. However, as a former employee of a major airline I can relate very well to the electronics, and the wires hanging all over the place. Chrichton has had to have done quite a bit of research, and walking about in a hangar to have related the technical details as well as he did.The plot was not at par with Chriton's better works. However, compared with the work of his peers, it was none the less very good. The story went very quickly and did manage to hold my attention. There was a considerable amount of white space, and I can't help thinking he could have saved a few trees by combining a few of the chapters.The overall rating is the lowest I have given Chrichton for any of his works, and that is mostly due to the plot. It's a good book for a rainy weekend, or when your mother-in-law is over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking","review":"The storyline was slow to get started. The action becomes intense as an investigative reporter is introduced into the plot. The book becomes a real race after that.

So Technically accurate it's scary!","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely!! As with many ofMichael Crichton's books it is so accurate it'sscary.

However, I must say that this book lacks anything new. In my opinion, this book is just Disclosure with a woman in the lead and the airline industry instead of computers. Take note of these similarities;The company is in the midst of a significant event. In Disclosure, we have a merger, here we have a big sale to ChinaThe leading person finds himself/herself in a situation where he/she in in danger of being out of a jobMeredith and Arthur conniving against Sanders while here, we see Marder and Richman conniving against Casey.Again, the monday, tuesday, wednesday thingThe ending's almost the same, the hero finds himself/herself in public spilling out the beans.Well, that's about it. To boot, I already knew the ending. That son thing was topic of a news article around a year ago in an airline company somewhere. It really did happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Airframe...don't bother!","review":"Well, I decided to go ahead and read this book, even after the poor reviews.

In a word, \\"terrible.\\" I felt like I was reading something I may have written in Junior High School!! Don't bother folks, save your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Airframe crashes and burns","review":"One thing consistent about Crichton books is that they are difficult to put down...and I found that to be true of Airframe, although I disliked it. The characters are flat and I found myself struggling to root for the protagonist. Crichton obviously has an axe to grind against the media, to the extent that it damages the novel. The depiction was so one-sided, my book actually leaned over when I put it down.That said, I have to admit that I read the book in one day. The story picks up considerably in the last few chapters. The author did a good job of keeping the mystery alive until the end. The background on airplane manufacturing was informative, although also somewhat dry.Reading Airframe reminded me of eating a big bag of potato chips -- you open the bag and find that you can't eat just one, the next thing you know the bag is finished and you feel somewhat ill, full but not satisfied"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tou Lee's Review","review":"Like many Crichton books, Airframe has a a good story. This book will keep the reader glued to his seat, like for me, it was a one-sit reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Crichton","review":"As usual Michael Crichton delivers an exciting narrative, though almost in a different genre from his other thrillers such as Jurassic Park, Andromeda Strain, or Congo. Airframe is fascinating to readers who appreciate Tom Clancy, though it is easily dull and tedious to those that do not. It is loaded to the brim with Clancy-like research and page upon page of technical jargon which might discourage some readers, though as a whole it is a satisfying, interesting, exciting, and informative novel, easily read in a day or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Airframe","review":"This is the best Criton book I have read so far. The characters were well defined. I have read other Criton books, and this was by far the best. The suspense was unmatched in this one.

I still thought this 3 chapters in, but then it slowly faded to a boring novel about a bit of turbulance that killed 3 people. Not a very good plot, a very disapointing climax."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meant to be a Classic!","review":"Definitely, one of his better works. I really enjoyed it.

I couldn't put it down and read it in a day. Michael Crichton's usual style embodies painstaking and massive research--and this book is no exception. I learned much about the airline industry by reading it--for example: I never knew that \\"ariplane manufacturers\\" do not make the engines that power the plane. It was also fascinating to learn what happens after an \\"incident\\" and the amount and type of testing that goes on by manufacturers. Although not as \\"exciting\\" as some of his other works, Airframe is definately worth reading"},{"rating":"2","title":"Crichton can still write !!!","review":"After reading the \\"The Lost World\\", I was very disappointed with Crichton as a writer. Airframe was a pleasant surprise !! Granted that there were similarities between this book and \\"Disclosure\\", but this book provided an interesting insight in the aircraft industry.

Right after I completed this book, a commercial airline experienced the same problems that this \\"fictional\\" airline did! It makes one think twice about air travel. I highly recommend that if you enjoy Michael Chrichton's writing style, that you obtain a copy of this book. You will not be able to put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"A distinctly low-altitude Crichton performance","review":"Cardboard characters, a stilted plot, wooden dialogue...where to begin? When Norton Aircraft VP (of Quality Assurance, no less!) Casey Singleton told another character that the wing spar of a particular plane was \\"two hundred feet long - almost as long as a football field\\" I knew I was in for a rough ride. Doesn't anyone edit this kind of dreck?Aside from an amusing take on the media (particularly a TV newsmagazine reporter obviously meant to be Mike Wallace), the book slogs along for 431 pages before coming to a tepid conclusion.I'm a sucker for books on airplanes and the aviation industry in general but I can't recommend this half-hearted effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull unless you are a airplane mechanic","review":"I found this text to be dull and predictable. The continued reference to structure, by part number or something similar, was extremely boring. You could sense what was coming next for the characters.I have read every Crichton novel and this one is at the bottom of the heap. Save your money. This may have been done for bucks rather than bounce. Airframe needs to be grounded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beach fodder","review":"Crichton knows how to write a page-turner. Yet in this case, it's analogous to eating Doritos. You know they're not great food, and after the first few, they're not even that tasty...you just can't stop. An hour later, after you've eaten the bag, you definitely don't feel all that great.Characters are stereotypes and flat as paper. We don't really learn what makes these people tick. Plot is relatively predictable. If the whole cast of characters crashed in the plane most readers probably would not feel a bit of loss. The only characters that we may feel some empathy with, the young family in the first scene, are disposed of and never referred to again. Ironically, Crichton's main thrust here is a criticism of the vapid and substanceless media of commercial television news. And that's pretty much what he delivers up here in print.You'll read it to the end but it's lite stuff. Beach fodder. Put it in the empty bag with the Doritos and coke cans when you're done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner","review":"The one thing I have to say about this book.

As another reviewer mentions, I have been contemplating writing a novel myself; I'm positive I can do better than this.I eagerly read through the book, finishing in three short evenings. But I blazed through the bog just *knowing* that Crichton would have a dramatic ending, and would reveal a fantastic reason the plane experienced its ordeal.I won't reveal the \\"shocking\\" ending here out of politeness to those who have not read it, but I can assure you it is quite tame. Very, very disappointing. I could sum up the entire plot in two or three sentences, and you would gain nothing more by reading the book (unless you are in the aircraft manufacturing business).Read \\"The Great Train Robbery\\"; it is Crichton at his best: weaving an intriguing, complex story. \\"Airframe\\" is indeed an aviation mishap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Crichton's best, but still highly enjoyable.","review":"This keeps you turning the pages to see what happens next, but I wouldn't read it if you're planning to fly anywhere soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of crichton's top three","review":"I read the book in less than a day during a vacation in Antigua.

A definate reccommendation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book had a great concept but simply lacked interest.","review":"The book started off interesting and had a well-considered plot and concept but it carried on too long. When an interested reader picks up the book in a store it seems to be very interesting but it was a let down. Crichton lacked interest in the middle of the book and I started to no longer want to finish the book. The ending is a surprise and it is something that a Crichton fan will enjoy. But for the first time Crichton lacked interest in one of his stories which was really surprising. It's a book that you can read if you don't mind long amounts of time with nothing resolved. And if that wasn't enough, the technical terms and abreviasions of companies and government branches make the book at times boring and hard to follow. So if you're in a mood to pick a book that is not fast paced, it's yours ! I guess the saying 'never judge a book by it's cover' stands true to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Airframe by Michael Crichton is probably his worst to date.","review":"I was a HUGE Crichton fan before disaster struck. This book was overtly technical (which was unneccesary to the plot), and long winded. The climax was not the usual intensely satisfying \\"death by chocolate\\" experience we have come to expect. More like a \\"huh? That's it?\\" However, I readily forgive the master of fiction in anticipation of his next novel"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little less than expected, but still decent.","review":"This is definitely not Crichton's best work. It is typical Crichton and was a decent read. It is a definite vacation/weekend read, even a one nighter. It was enjoyable and kept my attention. If you want to read typical Crichton, this is the book for you. Don't read it on an airplane. There is no escape once you are up in the air"},{"rating":"2","title":"This was my best ever read","review":"I have a reputation of only reading books with pictures. In this case I was recommended Airframe by both my wife and daughter. It is the first \\"big book\\" I have completely read in the last 5 years and I couldn't put it down.

As always, Michael Crichton has done deep research on his subject, and educates us on the details of the airline industry. The action and suspense is gripping, however I felt like I was reading \\"Disclosure\\" all over again, with a different set of characters and stage, which I found somewhat disappointing. This, however, does not take away the fact that this book is excellent reading and educational.

I am no longer a fan, or at least not with the same enthusiasm. I have not picked up a Crichton book ever since. I am still recovering from this literary disaster. Crichton has a knack of going into great technical detail in the middle of his books to further inform the reader. In every other book I read, this flowed quite smoothly, in Airframe, this technical information could not have been drier. The book never seemed to get off the ground as the action happened within the first 5 pages, and the remainder of the book dicusses the investigation. Simply not Crichton's best work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent read","review":"I don't particularly care for Crichton's works. I just pulled this one at random from my uncle's bookshelf in the den because I needed something to read while waiting at the mechanic's shop. Airframe is certainly entertaining, but don't expect anything too serious out of it. It has that \\"made for cable tv movie\\" feel to it. The character development, even among the main characters is rather shallow. I think they were intended to be almost like caricatures. The characters didn't seem to matter all that much. Their development is to give you an idea of the type of person the character is. There is no need to go beyond that. For people looking for a \\"Summer Book\\", this isn't a bad choice. I use that title lightly. It applies to rainy days, which we do get a lot of down here, or cold winter nights, which we don't. hehe Most people can probably tear through it in one sitting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly, His weakest work.","review":"If you like Crichton and haven't read this one, get it.

Crichton goes into so much detail with all his aeronutical knowledege that the plot becomes almost non exsistance. I was up to page 300 and was resisting the urge to wipe the tears of boredom out of my eyes.Jenifer Malone is probably the most stereotyped character I have ever seen in seious novel. There is no realism to her. Casey, the heroine, is not much better.The technical mumbo jumbo does make it intresting for the first hundred pages or so but after that it just becomes to much.This is classed as a thriller but in my opinion it is not. If your idea of a thriller is having to read through two hundred and fifty pages of pointless jargon then there is something deffinetly wrong with.Michael Crichton has done a lot better than this and I'd recommend that you read one of his better books such as Sphere, Jurasic Park, Disclosure or the Andromeda Strain."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor read with a failed attempt to jazz up a bad plot.","review":"This book's a shocker. It has such a thin plot and the characters are transparent and boring. Even the potential exitement of the news story fails to thrill. It is low on action with the exception of the initial air mishap, which is riveting, but then the novel drifts in to cliches and predictability. It is hard to believe that an author who wrote the superb \\"Andromeda Strain\\" can write such a childish novel as \\"Airframe\\". It has more value as an introductory aircraft technical manual than as a thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the plot?","review":"Except for the technical aspects, could have been a short story. Only reason I kept reading was to find the answer to one or two questions, but there is not much character development, almost no action - nothing happens along the way. Not to par with Crichton's other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Caffeine needed for this book!","review":"Do not under estimate this book.

How can I forgive myself after I wasted my time and money reading that monumental piece of garbage--Michael Crichton's Airframe. How can I forgive myself when there are countless literary masterpieces that I have not read, and yet, I stupidly read this awful book? How will I ever explain to my kids that I read this worthless \\"novel\\" even though I had long ago realized that Crichton writes terribly? Why, I must wonder, did I submit myself to the same kind of unconvincing characters, contrived plot, and insipid prose that characterized Crichton's Disclosure? I cannot understand or justify my actions. But don't despair, for I have learned my lesson. Never again will I waste my time on Crichton's work. I promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Airframe, too much air....","review":"I didn't feel that this was his best work. I liked the characters and the story line was great, but lacked in suspense until the 6th of 8 tapes. Too much detail on mundane stuff.

I have another one of his books on my shelf but I'm in no hurry to read it.On the plus side the story was well researched and it provided, to a novice, an insight into crash investigation. However, the book was slow and only the fact that I'm stubborn I would have given up on it.The ending is very good but it take a long time coming.In summary, give it a miss.

The 'info-dumping' was painful, the characterisation was crass ( a redhead with a fiery temper? How does he think of these things?) and the subject, for a thriller, was mundane. But it was the casual racism which pushed this reviewer over the edge. Crichtons' insights into the minds of the Vietnamese Americans (\\"Quiet, self-contained..hard-working\\")or Chinese(\\"great attention to detail\\") made me wonder about the rest of his legendary research skills. If you can't trust a writer to describe things you know with any realism, then you can't trust him when it comes to imparting esoteric knowlege about aircraft engineering, for example. Crichton is a fantastically successful writer. He does not need to write for a living any more. The biggest mystery about 'Airframe' is, why did he bother? Michael, baby, take a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crichton at his worst....(sigh!)","review":"I usually like what Crichton writes, but this book is awful.The Plot: Thin, and uninteresting, mixed with the old Corporate In-Fighting theme, repeated from Disclosure.The Writing: Crichton as usual. Sharp, undecorated text, not much value as true literature. Crichton doesn't usually write well. It's usually the plot that is interesting.The Characters: Cliche, all over again. A single mother with a child! Stressful and agitated corporate stereotypes.Boy, Hollywood is going to have a wild time making an awful film based on this novel. It'll be one of those fast-paced junk films with tolerable actors.My advice: Even if you love Crichton, this one is simply too boring. So sorry, Mike."},{"rating":"1","title":"A 100-page story puffed up to look like a novel.","review":"This was my first Crighton book, and it will be my last. The one-page chapters, the many divisions that yield blank pages, the tables of data, the irrelevant dialogue--these are the indicators of shorter story stretching to pose as a novel. The topic is good, and the story is somewhat catchy, but the lazy execution left me feeling like the author and publisher took my money and left me holding a half-blank book"},{"rating":"2","title":"As in all of Crichton's books, you learn something while being entertained.","review":"Michael Crichton excells at teaching you while you are reading (or in my case, listening - I heard it as an audiobook read by Blair Brown).In this case, Crichton tells us about the world of airplane design and construction. However, the more compelling story is that of the news media getting the story wrong due to lazy work - the same theme as is developed in \\"The State of Fear.\\" Seeing stories that are produced on the local level in my city about items that I have personal knowledge of, I cannot say that I disagree.Entertaining, informative read.Final grade: B+"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ","review":"This book is definitely the best I have ever read. If you liked this you have to read the \\"Andromeda Strain\\". That was one of the best too. The way he writes his books iof phenominal. I really wonder how he does it. Absolutely amazing. Only Took me two days to read because i couldnt read it. I know someone that read the whole thing on a 6 hour plane ride. I obviously reccomend this book and all his others. I give it a 10 STAR report! Best book in the world. Do yourself a favor and read it. :-) Please"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nearly His Best","review":"This is one of Crichton's best books. The suspense is first-rate and it never lets up. Crichton writes in such a style that it is near impossible to put one of his books down once they are started, and this is no exception. Aiframe is a very good book, and I gurantee you that you will be hard-pressed not to read it in one setting.Also, as always with Crichton, you will learn a good deal about the subject matter of the book by the time you have finished it, a testament to his legendary research. You will learn about how airplanes are built, who makes them and what goes into making them, the various problems that an airframe manufacturer runs into, and more. Imagine that, educational fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"What the Title Means","review":"The back of my book talks about a thriller that will make you scared to fly -- for me the experience was quite the opposite. The book underscores all the safety precautions of the airline industry. Instead, what the title refers to is the media -- how they take a story made of nothing but hot air, and by framing it sensationally, injure innocent and hard-working people. I think this book is reading for this point alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Just One More Page...\\"","review":"I love this book! Michael Crichton writes his books in such a way that they are near impossible to put down. This is accomplished primarily by the fact that the story never gets boring, and he usually ends chapters on a cliffhanger note, thus nearly forcing you to turn the page. This applies not only to Airframe, but all of Crichton's book.Also, his documentary approach to the novel of suspsense (complete with a very posh looking intro) will leaving you wondering whether or not the story really happened, such is the level of detail. It's a shame that this wasn't made into a movie as it seems more fit to be one than some of the other Crichton ones that they've made into movies (Rising Sun, Eaters of The Dead (13th Warrior).I can gurantee one thing, after reading this book you'll either never worry about riding an airplane again, as the safety measures of them are recounted in this book so painstakingly detailed, or you'll never fly in one again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book had a great concept but simply lacked interest.","review":"The book started off interesting and had a well-considered plot and concept but it carried on too long.

I truly loved his early books; Congo, A Case of Need, Andromeda Strain, Sphere, but Airframe and The Lost World were just terrible. Shallow writing, no suspense, nothing to grab you from the get-go and keep you through the entire book. It seems that Crichton, along with Grisham are paying more attention to the potential dollar signs at the end of their movie credits rather than producing a novel that lives up to their previous, and stellar work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Suspense","review":"I'm sorry to say that AIRFRAME didn't please me at all. The plot wasn't that difficult to figure out from the start. During my reading I was over ran by many technical terms that only made sense to pilots and avionic experts. It was a major disappointment to me and probably others as well. On the back of the book read \\"The pacing is fast, the suspense nonstop.\\" I didn't seem to find much suspense in the story. Where was it? The best part of the book was at the beginning, and it only lasted 2-3 pages. He also kept switching the scenario on me. It became confusing at times while trying to visualize the scene.

I would have thought with a wait so long, he would have had time to at least make it as good as his other works...I am truly sad to say this falls way below Chrichton's past works of art. As a simple story, it was good in it's own way, and Chrichton DID keep the pages turning, but it just didn't have any 'magic'. His other novels are SO good that I kept reading in anticipation that a major cliffhanger would arrise and take my breath away...unfortunately it never did. I cannot tell you how sorry I am that I feel this way...like I said earlier, I am a HUGE fan of Chrichton, but NOT of 'Airframe'. Sorry for those who disagree.

Worse, if you've read \\"Disclosure\\" or \\"Rising Sun\\" it's easy to predict the ending from the opening pages.Nevertheless, \\"Airframe\\" does keep the pages turning. It may be a cookie-cutter style novel, but at least it's fun. Crichton fans will be disappointed, but those new to his work may get a fresher read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"The book is really full of air-industry information - and the absolute majority of its readers will never be sure if it is accurate or not. Characters?! I don't think Crichton has ever heard of that... And, by the way... After all those pages he must have real low esteem for his readers because he wants us to believe that absurd - and childish - explanation for the accident... Ok... he probably is under pressure because he needs to keep up the 1 book (i.e. movie) / 6 months pace. Dear Amazon.Com reader: don't waste your time. Buy someone's smarter and less compromised with money work"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't fear the physics - this is techno-thriller fiction at its best!","review":"In \\"Airframe\\", the late Michael Crichton weaves deep science, fast-paced action, and characters that we both empathize with and loathe into a gripping novel. His \\"false documentation\\" technique is used to great effect here, and he is able to give some characters and plot devices an air of mystery that leaves the reader furiously turning pages in anticipation. Yes, there are healthy doses of engineering, physics, and aerodynamics - but who wouldn't be curious to find out how an airplane works (especially the wings)? If you liked \\"Andromeda Strain\\", you are sure to find something to enjoy in \\"Airframe\\" as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definate page turner","review":"Fast-paced, engaging story.

I like the way he portrayed the main character Casey Singleton. She is portrayed in a strong way, not as a helpless female.

I recommend this book to anyone who likes a great Who-Dunnit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is Crichton so popular?","review":"This book gives me the urge to write myself.

The setting is within an aircraft company, ostensibly about aircraft safety. However, the theme goes far beyond that. Aircraft safety issues are raised, but read carefully and you will find the story more about the media and business. I especially enjoy the epilogue to the end of the story. It concludes the action and suspense with some provoking ideas that enrich the book. If you are looking for action, adventure, mystery, and an intelligent hero(ine), this book is a sure winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling story about the present problems with the media","review":"I felt that this book had gave us more information about the current state of the media in the US then it did with the aircraft.

It has something for the airplane enthusiast and the media enthusiast in all of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"An all-around good novel for Michael Crichton fans","review":"Airframe captivated my attention after just reading one page. The suspense and drama of Airframe captures the reader's mind as the plot thickens. There isn't one dull moment in the book...not even when it comes to those long, technical descriptions of machines, charts, and numbers Michael Crichton includes in all of his books. In fact, if you read the technical details of Airframe closely you may be able to solve the mystery of the novel long before the main character, Casey Singleton, does.The main character was one of my favorite things about the book. Smart, tomboyish, courageous, determined, and hardworking all describe Casey Singleton. Her life describes the lives of females who work in jobs that are usually held by men. She proves that she can do her job just as well as the men she works with can.Overall, I strongly suggest Airframe for all fans of Michael Crichton novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun and engrossing suspense novel; also educational","review":"***** LOOKOUT for the review by Lauren Brown.

I felt empathy for the main character and appreciated all the obstacles she ran into. I learned some neat stuff about commercial planes and aviation. Don't worry, it's quite easy to follow for anyone of reasonable intelligence.I especially liked the last 50 pages or so, as he really brought the story in for a rapid landing (get it? ;-)If you read real carefully on the last page or so, you get a good chuckle when you realize what the \\"official report\\" actually said (and WHY it was said that way)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must have missed something...","review":"Because I didn't like this book at all. It was bogged down w/ technical jargon. It didn't refer to the underlying intrigue enough. The only reason I continued w/ the book is because I kept thinking it would get better.

Crichton's Second Best Novel...","review":"... only behind by Sphere (I recommed that as well).

To get straight hair usually higher settings work better only, but tourmaline worked well. I only wonder how long such straighteners will last.Here's what folica.com had to say about tourmaline:Tourmaline, a precious stone, generates up to 6 times more negative ions upon heating than traditional ceramic irons.

Lisa Reagan's voice is haunting and strongly reminiscent of Loreena McKennitt. McKennitt is, in my opinion, the better artist of the two, but if you like McKennitt's work, you will like this album.In addition to Reagan's voice, the music on this album has a strong beat, thanks to some expert drum work (somewhat unusual for new age), and good work on the strings. The best track is \\"I call the rain,\\" which has an almost irresistible catchy chorus you will find yourself humming long after the song is done. Other strong tracks are \\"Spirit Dance\\" and \\"Tapestries in Time.\\"In sum, if you like the work of such artists as Loreena McKennitt, Enya, Deanta, Maire Brennan, and Lynn Morrison, this album is definitely worth a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the mark","review":"The music is kind of interesting.

I upgraded to 512 ram immediatly, added an external cdrw, and wireless card. With these three upgrades it has been a decent desktop replacement (though I dont play many games). I seldom turn this system off (usually only when traveling). I would say it has been on 60% of the last two years. I am able to multitask very well, often having four or more IE windows open plus Adobe Photoshop and an office app. or two going all at once. It does max out the procesor often and can be slow at times, but overall it gets the job done. The drawbacks are: gets a bit hot and loud, no internal cdrw, 20GB hardrive to small, speakers not very loud, and the case is very prone to cracking. I have never dropped this system but both corners near my speakers have little pieces broken out and of coarse the hinges have cracks.

It seens to play my mp3 CDs fine, but there is too long of a pause between tracks, and it won't play plain regular audio CDs at times. Then tonight, I tried repeatedly to eject disc 3, and it kept opening the 4th tray. Then it wouldn't open disc 2 either. I had to shut the unit down.

I never had a chance to see Season 1 when it was on T.V. Criss is amazing. I especially like his smaller magic tricks that he does one on one with people. His escapes and stunts are also amazing, but made me very nervous!!! I know he says he likes to blur reality and illusion, and he does this very well in these episodes. There is something about him that draws me in, he has a very warm personality. And he's pretty darn cute! I recommend this for anyone who loves great entertainment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Puuullleeeeeze!","review":"Okay, so Criss Angel has style ... but only if you're 13 years old and think that torn jeans, nail polish, and wearing your hat backwards is so cool. But as a magician, he has no substance. The lack of any disclaimers about trick photography, phony camera angles, bogus audiences, and prefabricated set-ups is a dead giveaway. He is a great TV magician ... the important word being TV. Anyone who thinks that Criss Angel is a true magician probably also believes that an aquarium is the same as the ocean.

SLYDINI!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"Criss Angel uses camera trickery. 75% of the stuff he does can not be done in front of anyone but stooges (people he has placed into the crowd to go along with the trick). \\"His\\" coin-into-can trick isn't even his, it was created by someone named Wayne Houchin (which has much better illusions than Criss Angel, mind you)."},{"rating":"1","title":"sweet","review":"on wednesday 8/2/06 at 10:22 angles last trick was fliping sweethe was put in a wooden box handcufed and went through a woodchiper there was blood and chunks of bones it was disapointing but when you thought hes gone he jumps out the back of the truck every body was cheeringhow do you do it good job chris!=)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Windbag!","review":"I know I am not the only person who finds this magician an overblown windbag.

I don't believe in magic at all, but one thing i do know is that this man is a beautiful man. He is not anglo saxon, but middle anglo (a totally different world from the white anglo)you could say...he is Meditterean. He has substance, how do you say? He has feeling and emotion in the things that he does. I saw a picture of him dressed as the crow (like brandon lee), he looks excellent, a very attractice man. Magicians and envious fans may put down his magic but you never hear of them placing/putting down his looks. He is blessed By God (in the dept of looks).

The effects are better. There are more over all effects. Best of all, no lame hanging from a helicopter kind of episode. I have read a lot of magic books, and know how a lot of effects are done. However, at least once per episode of Mind Freak I am scratching my head.I don't really buy into the dark mysterious personna of Angel. I really like his behind the scene personality that shows he is a regular goofy magic guy. This side of him seemed to come through a lot more in Season 2.

Too much audience interview and less substance as well. A real Shame. Fun to watch but keep in mind it's just TV. They could've hired any actor to do most of the stuff being done.

He has left the old paths and on the contrary has returned the magic a renovated splendor, sharing with common people without that so expensive paraphernalia of great stages that tend to isolate the artist; and this a very remarkable aspect to take into account because it constitutes a smart device to get into a broader target.Fantastic and mesmerizing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Criss Angel - Mindfreak - The Complete Season One","review":"I have only recently caught glimpses of Criss Angel's magic...and that was because my husband channel surfs so fast...but when I got a shot of HIM, I made my husband go back immediately!

While this book if often described as a Western, I didn't think of it as such. I thought it was more literary fiction or women's fiction. The writing made the story believable and authentic.

Clark's \\"Faith And Saving Faith\\" is perhaps the best book written on the subject of the nature of saving faith. In this book Clark exposes just how ridiculous much popular thinking on faith is. The much used and abused distinction between \\"head faith\\" and \\"heart faith\\" is here demonstrated to be unscriptural, as Clark conclusively demonstrates that in Scripture there is no distinction between the heart and mind (see pages 67-77 under the heading \\"Charles Hodge\\"). Clark takes the classic theological understanding of faith as being divided into notitia (knowledge), assensus (assent) and fiducia (trust), and exposes it as the logical nonsense it is; since fiducia or trust is a synonym for faith, it therefore cannot be one of faiths components. I unreservedly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The historical context of christian anti-intellectualism","review":"Unfortunately, reasoning and thinking skills of this quality are not to be found in contemporary pop authors. This book touches on many things, but foremost it is a linear logical critique of the ideas and doctrines of men in a historical context. Clark moves through history with a critical eye on faith and saving faith exposing the lack of logic and clear thinking on the part of specific individuals in regards to saving faiths definition. His position is one in which, to believe propositions (facts) about someone is to believe in them. There is no more to it than that. Thus, rendering the concept of easy believism empty and meaningless. Also, it's a sort of prophetic warning against the descent of popular christiandom into anti-intellectualism, which at this point is an established reality. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to enlarge their understanding of these issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as pictured","review":"Your picture of this rings shows blue sapphires so I was disappointed to see that the ring I received has such dark stones that they appear black.

For those who say that the installation is a miracle from God, it's not, it's the same. There are several things lacking in 8.0 that were there in 7.3: DVD Player, Mpeg Player, MP3 playback. What are they thinking? Devices that should be working by now still don't: PDA's, Scanners, Webcams. Not to mention print quality for most printers is pathetic.

Like it or not windows is entrenched in the corporate and home users world. Its like shouting in the middle of the forest to constantly tout the benefits of Linux without a way for anyone to here you. This distrubution by RedHat finally gets it right. The installation was easy and the desktop is polished and professional. The MAC is what I think of when I look at the BLUE CURVE interface. REDHAT gets it right without trying to look like windows.

Meanwhile, the worthless (and I mean really, really worthless) installation guide was of no help-it kept on telling me to use the Red Hat CD. Well, that would be great if it WAS one CD. RedHat has no customer service for 8.0, so what did they tell me when I went to technical support? Buy a manual. I was VERY disappointed with the company. Buy SuSe, I have seen it installed and it is a vacation. The OS is probably good, but because Windows XP users can't install it, and Red Hat itself doesn't help you, I am guessing I will never find out.

These paintings and drawings are not grotesque: these works are packed with the immediacy of facing a finite life whether that terminal state is due to disease as in the artist's case or to other horrors such as wars, brutality, homophobia, random acts of violence. Caballero was a brilliant draughtsman and captured so much movement in his line that the figures, though languishing, still maintain a quality of constant movement. Edward Lucie-Smith adds his usually fine comments to this monograph. This is one collection of art that goes beyond just being art to being an homage to the artist's plight. And isn't that what great art is, afterall?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Battery!","review":"I bought this for my 2003 Roadglide. As advertised, it is the same dimensions as the Harley battery with one small nit: the terminals are slightly recessed as compared to the Harley battery.

I found this picture book to be of little value as a tool to help teach my daughter Italian. The pictures in the book are too cluttered, there is just too much information on each page. Considering that this book was packaged with a CD to be used with children under the age of 2, it is just not useful at all.

The bottom line - this Neiko tightens bolts almost twice as tight as it is registered.Also, the circular head of the wrench was not cast straight. The Neiko wrench was angled about 5 degrees off.

We were able to easily locate an unused part of an old wagon train trail near the area we were camping. So with metal detector in hand and nothing but this book and a county map, off we go. Using the landmarks and county roads referenced in this book, we found a two-track trail that our four-wheel drive pickup could handle. This lead us to an abandoned town that was not visable from any of the roads. There were 4 buildings still standing, including the livery for the Pony Express riders. Also, an old gravesite marked with a historical placque and stone markers identifying this as part of the Oregon Trail. This was the highlight of our trip and out teenager is now hooked on HISTORY!

Not too many artists I can say this about. The live album is an excellent compilation. This one continues their musical explorations with some modernisations. I have had it for a while and have tried hard to like it. Unfortunately, it just does not grab me in the way the previous recordings do. Maybe it is the sound with modern percssion etc, perhaps the melodies / songs aren't as strong as before. Either way I don't get drawn into the exotic Lo'Jo world in the way I have previously. So I am disappointed but please check out the other CDs. They are great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Compared To The Toshiba Satellite 1955-S803","review":"My friend has this laptop because when I got the 1955-S803 he got this 5205-S703. You have to be an owner to realize how good the 1955-S803 really is. This only has a 15\\" monitor while the 16\\" really helps out when computing around the web or playing a game on the nVIDIA Graphics with 64 MB. 60GB is very good especially for a 2002 notebook PC. Battery life sucks so badly because I've had it for 2 years and now for some reason the battery only lasts for like 45 minutes! This notebook does have okay battery life. This also has a DVD-Burner which doesn't exsist in the 1955-S803. Both have Windows XP Home Edition. Both are Pentium 4 but the 1955-S803 has a P4 2.49 GHz Processor (It does have WiFi) while this has a P4 2.0 GHz Mobile Processor.

Really nice, but could be cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the time.","review":"Highly interesting and exhaustively detailed first-hand account of the first female UK premier. In the 1980s, Britain could arguably be defined by three things: Diana, Pop music, and Margaret Thatcher-- it is refreshing to see the least showy of the three recall her memoirs. Although the Iron Lady's sometime turbulent relationship with the Queen is hardly ever mentioned. In fact, Her Majesty barely appears at all...in that case, you will have to consult a biography for her infamous debacle with the Queen over the Commonwealth. Still, highly recommended...even if you need to take it's mammoth size in small doses. A great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative And Challenging","review":"I thought that this was a very interesting biography of an most unusual modern leader. Lady Thatcher gives a very detailed account of her 11 years as British Prime Minister, devoting a generous amount of space to the Falklands War, the Troubles in Northern Ireland, her dealings with a wide variety of foreign leaders, and her tackling of major domestic problems. While I found the book interesting, I had difficulty with some of the terms that Lady Thatcher uses, as I am not familiar with the finer points of British politics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply put it is as boring as can be !!!","review":"It is a huge book but the content is boring, I suggest looking elsewhere for an informative and interesting biography ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!!!","review":"Although I purchased a different unit, the GoVideo 8440 Portable DVD Player, it played exactly 6 movies before dying.

I called 2 weeks later to inquire about the pen and was rudely told that it would be 6 weeks before I could expect any information and that surely the pen had not been even looked at yet.

While the story initially raises some interesting questions about theology and Catholic doctrine, Saul eventually forsakes those topics completely in the pursuit of a ridiculously far-fetched tale of obsession and mind-control. There is literally no character development whatsoever, and Saul goes a step worse in drawing on multiple character stereotypes: the sinister priest, the disbeleiving psychologist, the popular jock, the picked-on \\"ugly girl,\\" and more. If Saul had done anything memorable with such characters, it might be worthwhile, but this is simply unacceptable. To top off the frustration, the ending is simply atrocious, and does nothing to conclude the story; it feels like a bad horror movie where the killer is still alive at the end (though that is somewhat of a recurring theme in Saul's work). Not recommended at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"If you are a John Saul reader, you do not need a review. You know how good he is.

He does start the stories pretty well, but the wheels don't just come off the wagon, they fly off at light speed! Relaxation therapy? The musty odor of semen? Monsignor's huge organ? The characters are as flat as a postcard and the plot is outlandish and not just improbable but ridiculous.Someone please explain to me why 1)Balsam would have ever chosen to stay on in the first place considering the treatment he recieved from the beginning and 2)why would the Society choose this guy when there had to be a zillion other weaker-minded types they could have recruited to drizzle their, uh... religious fervor... all over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some books age well, others don't","review":"This was definitely in the second group. A long, slow build up to basically nothing, no mystery, no resolution, nothing more horrific than a secret undercurrent of homosexuality in the Catholic Church (imagine that!).

Why is this book still in print?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!","review":"I've read two books by John Saul (I'm reading them in order of publication).This story dealt with suicide. There was blood due to the suicide methods, but nothing in the sense of \\"blood and guts\\", except for the opening scene. The story did revolve around Catholicism. Catholicism has always been a focus in horror films and such. This story by no means was a jab at the Catholic faith, but just this specific fictitious church in the story. The author I felt did a good job with character development. He slowly peeled away layers of the story to reveal the plot. It wasn't as \\"intense\\" as I might have liked it to be, but still was enjoyable and kept my interest throughout. John Saul does a good job with keeping the plot mysterious to the reader. I'm looking forward to reading his other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saul's Best?","review":"To date, this is by far the best *and also the first) John Saul novel I have read.

Cozzens is a racial, nationalistic, religious bigot. He is a smug, pretentious writer. He does not improve with age. Book is worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"a carefully written novel for perceptive readers","review":"This book combines a number of uncommon qualities that will reward the patient reader: it is beautifully plotted, with no loose ends or errors in continuity; it is based on meticulous (but not flaunted) research into the subjects depicted; and it realistically portrays aspects of modern life that rarely draw the attention of serious novelists. Here, as in his other major works, Cozzens focuses on people's jobs -- how we make it through the day, dealing with the unattractive challenges life throws at us. Admittedly, his outlook on many topics is old-fashioned (something he acknowledged), but he generally appears to be someone honestly trying to look at the world as objectively as he can. (If one reads his major works in chronological order, it becomes clear how this striving for objectivity enabled him to grow beyond many of the prejudices of his class.) A priceless view of one aspect of modern American life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not ready for prime time!","review":"I bought this printer 2 weeks ago.I though it would be nice to print on my cds.While it does a great job printing,it is more trouble to keep running than any printer I have owned(50+).I have to run a head cleaning each day,since without doing so I have NO black!...

The printer leaves ink blobs on 2 out of 5 prints. I have to run the Clean Heads utility every other time I print and that doesn't always solve the problem. This makes printing expensive when one considers the wasted ink and paper. Also in addition to the ink blobs on pictures I am unable to buy replacement ink cartridges locally or on-line. I'm at my wits end, it really takes the fun out of printing photos.......... When I do get a clean picture, it is beautiful, but not worth the effort. This printer is also incrediably slow, much slower than I expected, but I could live with that if the finished product was blob-free. I have tried to contact Epson without any luck, they don't respond to my e-mails to their tec-support address."},{"rating":"1","title":"Print Good Ink Problems","review":"This printer prints very well.Thats the good news.Bad news is the ink cartridges,which are very expensive, seem todry out on their own as well as reportback falsely that they are empty.I am looking at two cartidges here which youcan see ink inside but are reportingthat they are empty.

I had to fix a couple of minor leaks prior to use, nothing serious, and for the price I should not expect more......but I did, from porter cable.That aside, the guns are great, no jams and they drive very consistantly.I looked at the other three gun combo's, all offer about the same value, but the porter cable name carries some weight with it.Very happy so far"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than expected!","review":"I bought this product to build a fence, using composite lumber (very dense, multiple times harder than wood). I used my trusty electrical nailer and it could not penetrate the word planks. Using the brad nailer and the finish nailer, I turned the depth to the middle position, still not sure it would penetrate. Well, it worked beautifully. I could have penetrated two or even three boards with one shot if I wanted (and did two thicknesses often). I built the 55 foot fence with absolutely no problems. Of course, I wanted to nail all day. Set-up was a breeze. I have now bought other tools to use with it. The feedback I read before buying said not to use it for sustained uses (painting), but using a cut saw is not problem at all.

It's got pockets for everything: shoes, clothes, heart rate monitor, jewelry, water bottle. It comes with a water bottle, but my water bottle still fits in the slot (that was one of my concerns). It's just so much more accommodating than my previous (free) bag. I definitely recommend it and am very pleased with the purchase.

There are enough pockets, but would like some separate pockets too.Overall, I would defiantly recommend this bag.

Although there are many interesting clips [from the author's magazine interviews over the years], the book does not hang together.

I grew up reading all the Nancy Drew books but, true to stereotype, never read any of The Hardy Boys. As the mother of two little boys (first and third grade) I began exploring these in our read-aloud time every evening. The boys LOVE them but the whole series (50+ books) is a bit more than I want read as an adult and a daunting quantity of material even for very advanced readers so I was delighted to come across these audio tapes. Bill Irwin does an excellent job of reading the books, treating their slightly dated language and manners with complete respect. The tapes are unabridged although still only two tapes long.

My first obvious choice was Dell but I found their comparable models to be overprized. I was also concerned with overall Dell's build quality, which seems to have been sliding down lately. The only concern I had about this model was 4500 RPM HD. If that is a real big issue for you, go with 5205-S507 model, which has 60 Gb HD. That 60 Gb HD is still 5400 RPM but higher HD disks density makes for a bit faster HD. The 5205-S507 model also comes with nicer screen but I couldn't justify the price difference.I've had this notebook for about two months now and I am extremely happy with it. It runs fast all applications, handles latest games nicely, and looks great. As another reviewer pointed out, this is not a small laptop so finding a case for it is a challenge.

The cover is ugly and has nothing to do with the story. The layout of the pages is ugly and hard to read - and comes with word processing typos such as fractions and question marks within words.

Fans of the show will appreciate Petherbridge's ability to mimic his co-stars voices with unobtrusive smoothness.

The Leaders are elected to the Congress by the people, and are installed in these particular positions by their colleagues. To make the claim he makes is misleading and false. He also provides no substantiation for other claims he makes. He says that there are party workers on the federal payroll.

If you've ever played any of the old games, you know that there's a bit of thinking involved in winning the game.Cum Laude, on the other hand, pathetically attempts to pose itself as an adventure game. Realistically, the producers/dorks behind the game obviously have little to no imagination or creative talent.The absolute worst part of the game takes place during the dialogue sequenses between Larry and other characters. Every time you have a conversation with someone, Larry talks while you navigate a sperm through an obstacle course of dookie (metaphorically speaking). In order to have a positive interaction with the other character, you have to navigate the sperm smoothly & not hit items along the way. It's funny at first, but then it's like, man, this is so dumb!

The entire game is nothing but a bunch of poorly done mini games, which compreses of pressing buttons in a certian order.What makes it worse, is its a direct game port from system to PC, which makes it even worse. The game support is very slim. My pc more then meets the MAX system requirments of the game, and it still ran poorly. Why? Because I didnt have a very specific video card.Unless your PC has the system requirements down to a letter, dont buy this game, there is no way to tweek the game performance, and unless you have the perfectly designed system for this game, it will run like crap.A horrible game, if your looking for digital T&A; just download a Hentai Game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game.....not so great controllers","review":"This is one of the funniest games I haver played and would recomend it to anyone with a sense of humor and open minded about sex issues because that is what the game is about, teen sex.....But they really blew it with the controlo designs.

Most of the fun of the game is being able to control the little Sims, build their houses, have them interact with others, etc.The fun of the online version is completely dependent on other players. The money your Sim (and only one Sim) makes gets sucked up immediately. The \\"spend money to earn money\\" philosophy of the single-player version is abandoned. You can't build much of anything, much less furnish a place, and the buildings you find resemble HP -- party after party with no home life interaction like sitting down to dinner with spouse and kids.As the others say, it is a glorified chatroom. The majority of relationships in TSO were formed early in beta-testing and to get in on a relationship, a house, etc. at this point will be very difficult. In other words, there's no fun to be had.If you want a new Sims adventure, the only way to go is Sims2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor direction...","review":"It is just an add on for the great game to generate some more money for the company.

However, recently, I found chewable Cat's multi-vitamins on Amazon that contains not just taurine but also other essential vitamins and minerals.

They can be useful when you're yanking cables through the spaghetti under many people's desks, but for daily use where I'd want to plug and unplug, they're just awkward and sometimes get in the way, or in places where it's a tight fit, can really be difficult to get out of the back of a computer that's designed poorly for the location of the network jack.Got another for one of the IP based security cameras I had, that used power injectors so the unit needs a network cable.

It is too bad that so many people seem to avoid his work due to Dianetics and Scientology.Final Blackout was written nearly 40 years before Battlefield Earth. His growth as an author during those years was painfully apparant after reading Final Blackout.

Sadly Hubbard spends many pages reinforcing these thin characterizations.Yes this book was written when he was young and it wasn't meant to endure. Maybe it can be read as a hokey 1940 pulp and a testament to the paranoia of perpetual war. It almost belongs more to the Vietnam era than WWII since all the generals and upper level military guys are selfish fools ready to sacrifice a million lives for their own glory (there's even the American Imperialists at the end) but I doubt the unadulterated praise for the Lieutenant would fly any better in Vietnam War America.Either way it's a dull book full of cliches that would have been long out of print without Scientology."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Sci-Fi books I've ever read","review":"A brilliant story about a nameless Lieutenant who is amongst the last survivors on the planet and who leads a band of good guys against the bad guys with an uncanny skill that makes for a very exciting saga"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's Be Glad L. Ron Hubbard Isn't Running Things","review":"\\"Final Blackout\\" was written in the 1930's, and it is an adventure story written for fascists, by a fascist. Here's the set-up: a world war, started by weak, democratically elected elitists, has been dragging on for decades. A courageous soldier known simply as \\"The Lieutenant\\" overthrows the corrupt military power structure and takes matters into his own hands. He defeats all challengers and installs himself as a military dictator, bringing peace and prosperity to war-ravaged Britain. This new regime's torture and execution of dissidents is mentioned only in passing -- but I guess you can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs. \\"Final Blackout\\" is sneeringly contemptuous of democracy, and the character of \\"The Senator\\" is one of the most ridiculous straw men you will ever find within the pages of a book. This is an interesting relic, but not much more. I don't think Hubbard's defenders ought to be crowing about this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"In my unbiased opinion, I rather liked it....","review":"I am not a Scientologist, but I do like pulp fiction. FINAL BLACKOUT was an innovative tale for its time, and does a fairly good job standing on its own today. The story's general cynicism towards governments seems rather atypical of the patriotism in pre-WW II America. The characters are interesting, but a little stiff. There is a fair amount of action; the main character's strategies make for interesting reading (although some of the Lieutenant's tactics are a bit of a stretch). Final Blackout's main strength is its \\"post-apocalyptic\\" scenario, written well before that genre was synonimous with apes and Mel Gibson. Not the greatest pulp novel ever written, but a good, solid read. Even if you disagree with Hubbard's \\"religion\\", the man could spin a decent yarn."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book gave me great life-like dreams.","review":"This book was something I picked out at a bookstore when I was given a gift certificate. Reading it each night before I went to sleep gave me such realistic dreams, that I could actually picture the battlegrounds, massive destruction, and faces of the Lieutenant and his crew. I am not an avid reader, but this book opened the way for me to start the Mission Earth decology which is of an even higher quality. I am presently on book number 4, and loving it. The only book I liked even better than these was \\"The Contender\\", the story of a young, black boxer living in the tri-state area, something I can relate to."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite post-apocalyptic stories","review":"The \\"Lieutenant\\" is one of my favorite characters of all time, as a great example of leadership before and during combat. When you read biographies of the great generals of modern times I am always struck by how much of their work is done before the battle ever starts. Patton's biography is just full of that. The battle of the bulge was a miracle of the leadership in pre-planning, not frantic mid-battle decisions.A great leader inspires confidence by his calm handling under stress, while still being fully aware and responding correctly to each change in circumstances.The book also has some great combat sequences- you can really see the strategy and troop movement. Great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Do We Keep That Old Junk?","review":"Read this book to find out how the impulse to fill our closets with old textiles and oddments fulfills a cultural tradition so deeply imbedded that it may as well be a genetic imperative. Ulrich's sensitive descriptions of the nuances of colonial society explain how bits of fabric evoke class distinctions, wealth, and a sense of self worth. Perhaps even more interestingly, the interpretations that the decendants give to these items tell us more about their contemporary society than genuine colonial history -- something to muse over as we wish for the \\"good old days\\" (My goodness, who would EVER have thought the 1970's would be something to remember fondly?!?)This is a scholarly book, and the earlier review that suggests readers may be tempted to give up halfway through is correct. Stick with it though -- there are rewarding insights in the final chapters. Throughout, the early colonial history is fascinating and the personal details are tantalizing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satified with purchase","review":"My husband had been looking everywhere for this after shave lotion and couldn't find it anywhere.

The narratives tend to drag in many of the stories, in others the author has trouble getting the suspension of belief she seems to be looking for.

Silence was better than this.Maybe it is just me, but when I read a book, I do not imagine different voices for the various characters in a novel. So it annoys me no end when I listen to a book where the narrator plays different parts. To me, this is kind of creepy, epecially when a female narrator *plays* male roles or vice-versa. And it is really bad when the narrator/performer is not very good.Perhaps it would be helpful if the cover said \\"performed by\\" instead of \\"narrated by\\".I just want someone to read the darn book to me.

This book shares guidelines--simple guidelines--that followed faithfully will help! It is an old resource, and some of the situations are not contemporary for our tech society. At the same time, some of the stories may seem too general or too good to be true. However, to learn to believe that I have the ability to change my situation, and to be the best I can be is worth following the path outlined.

The early chapters focus on Baius and Jansen. de Lubac, to my surprise, argues that Jansen misunderstood Augustine although the latter had read Augustine in his entirety ten times and his anti-Pelagian works thirty times. The basis of Jansen's misunderstanding of Augustine according to de Lubac lies in his misunderstanding of the supernatural. de Lubac was positively brilliant but his detailed discussions of the supernatural and its relation to nature and grace appears to go beyond the original thought and intent of Augustine himself. Perhaps this work tells us more about de Lubac than Augustine. If, however, you are interested in understanding the thought of one of the most brilliant Roman Catholic theologians of the 20th century, then this is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking Your Business to the Next Level is Indeed a Success","review":"This incredible book takes the reader on a journey through the many faceted world of business.

It still works but seems to be less springy. Also the wheel scroll is really sensitive and the magnifier button gets accidentally pressed frequently sometimes resulting in awkward screen display, this is easy to fix but can be annoying.I have the Wireless Notebook 5000 mouse as well and I've had it for much longer and although it has less features it still works magnificently."},{"rating":"1","title":"An engineering mess","review":"I have used this product for quite a long time.

It lasts about 3-6 weeks and those weeks come up quick when you only use the mouse occasionally.- The bluetooth connection range is very poor which is very frustrating during presentations.- The presentation buttons are slow to respond or often unresponsive depending on the application.- The surface tracking is very poor.

Ironic that the only friend she ever trusted ruined her career (Salka Viertel). I did not like Greta Garbo's treatment of her loyal friend/lover Mercedes. Greta Garbo is depicted as a young woman who developed some strange coping mechanisms in order to survive in Hollywood. Some things that the author wrote about seem fictional or conjecture, for example, Greta stripped down to nothing in front of Georges Schlee for a fitting by his designer wife. How could the writer know such things unless she interviewed Mr or Mrs. Schlee themselves?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely essential reading for fans of Garbo/Dietrich lore","review":"I have been through many of the sources used for this book, and I really appreciated the way the author ties so many loose ends together, and fills in so very many gaps in the various sagas. Plus the considerable socio/political backround info through the decades. Its interesting to see just how much politics played a heavy role in these lives, one way or another; an aspect I had not considered. For example, Garbo's career being torpedoed in the end mainly by her total reliance on Schlee and Salka Viertel, who was essentially blacklisted beginning in the mid-1940s -- something you definitely won't pick up from Salka's bio!The character who comes through as paradoxically the most warm and human is Tallulah Bankhead, and who would have thought it?

The whole thing was close to shocking because I had no idea that life was so free and easy in the 20's, 30's and 40's. The book did keep me interested. I wondered about some of the facts which I'm sure no one will ever know the absolute truth about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, But Too Many Flaws","review":"Sure, I had fun reading this book. But the Amazon reviewer who termed it \\"highly speculative\\" is understating the case. Opinion, conjecture, hearsay, and speculation too often take the place of thorough, solid documentation. And unlike many other Amazon reviewers, I found McLellan's tone off-putting. She alternates between patronizing her subjects (the very notion of calling them \\"my girls,\\" for instance) and setting them up primarily as sources of voyeuristic thrills for the herself and the reader. Is the book dishy and intriguing and flamboyant? You bet. But is the topic of lesbianism in Hollywood well-served here? I don't think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too fantastic to be believable","review":"This book is virtually ALL speculation, and a frustrating read. NO hardcore facts, timelines are all off.

But it just never had an upbeat to it. Just rambling along as if there was no end. Cluck Ole hen kinda livened things up for a short time and two versions no less. John Hardy was so slow you could hardly recognize it. I like jazz a little more upbeat, well alot more upbeat to be honest so this wasn't the cd for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I bought several of the tracks individually.

That one never opened an egg. In addition, I had been looking for extra eggs for weeks prior to Christmas to go along with the set and very hard to find. So, great concept, but poorly made. And, once your kid goes through the 'hatching' process a couple times, they can cheat the system by just pressing the buttons quickly and works just as well to hatch the egg. At $5.00 plus and egg, your kid hatching them in less than five minutes for a small plastic animal is not very exciting for us parents! The play value afterward is very minimal.

The various sections of the DVD are hosted by Shirley Jones, Rita Moreno,Charmian Carr, and Nancy Kwan. The documentary covers classic movie productions of State Fair, Oklahoma!, Carousel, The King and I, The Sound of Music, etc. With interesting tidbits about casting, production, missing scenes and/or songs, this documentary has something both people who love the musicals and those who have never seen them before. By the end of the documentary, you actually will want to see the movies themselves.

This amazon page says that customers who bought this also bought Funeral by Arcade Fire, as well as Bright Eyes, so I expected something in that general area. What I found was something totally different.On some songs, Sufjan sounds a little like a male version of Frou Frou. There are yet those songs that sound like Broadway musicals. On some songs, there are choruses where women sing; that was the only annoying thing I found about this CD.The music sounds pretty original and folksy, yet a little on the safe side.Overall, this is a great listen, and you will surely enjoy a lot of it, just don't expect it to be the greatest album ever, which the hype seems to suggest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmm...what else would you expect from a dude named Sufjan?","review":"Well...let me just say, that I've only had this album for one day...but, yes I do like it.

I did know that I am from Illinois, I have an odd fascination of UFO's, and this album jumped out at me solely based on the title of the album and first track.My my how lucky I was. It took me months of listening to even find my favorite moments (The baseline of \\"Zombies\\", seeing the predatory wasp for the first time, Carl Sandberg's query, the great emancipator... I could keep going).Very few people are able to write songs with such instrumental, thematic, and lyrical complexity and still end up with songs that are melodic and listenable. This work is extremely impressive across the board.I highly doubt he can re-create this effect for more than one or two more states, but if they are New York and California I would be thrilled."},{"rating":"2","title":"scary","review":"This album builds on the best parts of Sufjan's earlier Michigan album as well as Seven Swans. It has the lyrics and the great storytelling that make him a standout from so many dime-a-dozen 'singer-songwriters' out there. There is some intelligent social commentary packed in without being heavy handed or overtly political.The music itself is beautiful. He somehow retains his folk feel but goes all out with the strings and female backup vocals in several songs.The song \\"John Wayne Gacy\\" is probably the ultimate juxtaposition: lyrics that cover incredibly dark subject matter set to beautiful instrumentation and light vocals.Definitely worth owning. Fans of Wilco, Stephen Malkmus, the Shins, Damien Jurado, or Elliott Smith should give Sufjan a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rad","review":"Sufjan is extrmely talented.

Great artwork too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make a joyful sound","review":"Wow, I'm so glad I discovered this CD. It's one of those goodies that just gets better and better upon repeated listens. I'd never heard of Stevens before hearing \\"Chicago\\" on a satellite radio station. On the strength of that song, I purchased the CD. The music reminds me a bit of Polyphonic Spree in that Stevens seems to use whatever is available with his rudimentary skill at playing same to make this gorgeous music. What he might lack in musical skill or sophistication of recording equipment, he makes up in his storytelling ability, his expressive and sweet voice and his obvious passion for the stories. It's no surprise to read that he earned a Masters in creative writing. As corny as it sounds, all the reviews in which the strains of his Christian faith in his music are mentioned, has brought to mind the Biblical admonition to \\"make a joyful noise (sound?)\\". To the delight of his listeners, Stevens obviously takes this to heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spared From Being Perfect","review":"Excellent album that is spared from being perfect by the singer's almost forced sounding breathy voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Join the Cult of Sufie","review":"This, I believe the 2nd in Sufjan's promised series of albums about states (we're gonna hold you to it, Mr. Stevens!), is a stunner.

Everybody fawns over him like he was the second comming or something. All I hear is some guy singing wispily over hushed atmospheric accompaniment. Okay, there are some fairly standard wispy pop horns here too. But I dunno - mixing Americana, over-erudite lyricism and early 90's twee just doesn't seem that groundbreaking to me. This record is pleasant in it's own dull little way, but these reviews seem like a sort of collective psychosis. I will admit that this is one of the greatest album TITLES in years, but the music just isn't.I don't see what Sufjan does here that's any better than stuff groups like Belle and Sebastian, Willard Grant Conspiracy, and Trembling Blue Stars were putting out 10 years ago. Enough mopey singer-songwriters already. I'm calling for a moratorium on anyone who sounds even a little bit like Nick Drake. Who's with me??Paging Merle Haggard.

But this album topped so many critics lists for 2005 that I feel compelled to comment: It's just not that good. It's not that I don't get it. Yes there are a lot of clever things going on, and I've really tried to like it. But what does it all add up to? What's the point? Try as I might, I find it boring and tedious. For me it completely lacks any true soul of what music should be about and be trying to say. I realize that is a personal observation, so you may still really like this. For me, I'll stick with my own favorite of 2005, \\"You Could Have It So Much Better\\" by Franz Ferdinand. I guess I like to get my fill of clever lyrics with rocking guitars and cool dance beats rather than flute recorders and choirs."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Sometimes is Less","review":"I must admit I am a big fan of Sufjan's Seven Swans. Since then, he has expanded his music, and I can definitely accept that fact. However, this CD is as overproduced and overwritten as any I have heard in a long time. I too can hear some Pet Sounds, or maybe a little Sgt Pepper influence, but it seems like he is trying too hard to make an epic-sounding album, and ends up turning out a lot of clutter. I know that Sufjan may not completely turn back to his \\"folkier ways\\", and I am not stubborn enough to hold that against him. I sense that a lot of people will buy this album thinking that, because the titles are long, and the work is \\"complicated\\", they are buying something only understood by the enlightened few. The bottom line, to me, is that Sufjan is trying way too hard on this CD. I wish he knew that he doesn't have to try to be the offspring of Phil Spector and Brian Wilson to be seen as a wonderful songwriter."},{"rating":"1","title":"See all the other 2 star reviews...","review":"Pretty much agree with the others who gave it two stars. Overrated, forced and bit too dull.

Poet laureate or troubadour, I don't know [and neither does he], but I want to run with him in the garden and find out. But first I need to stop in Chicago and visit my sister. Religiosity is scarce, and while that's a good thing here, he is so beautiful in his inherent glory that he could take me to church and marry me. If it were legal. My grade: A"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"I believe this album is excellent. I can see how other people would not appreciate Steven's style, because it is quite unusual; but, I believe, that is why is it so excellent. It is different, each song has its own rhythm, flow, and beat. It does not follow the standard (and boring!) method of a song that we are all, unfortunately, so used to: verse A, chorus, verse B, chorus, bridge, chorus, chorus. It is difficult to pinpoint one favorite song because they are all great, and they each sound slightly different than the rest. The songs really are poems that are set to music and sung. Strongly recommend this if you are looking for something that will broaden your horizon and are looking for something outside of the top 40 on the radio!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Audacious and Spacious (yet down to earth)","review":"Stevens' bold plan to concoct an album of songs inspired by each of the 50 U.S. states might be unattainable, but \\"Illinois,\\" the second installment in the series, is strong enough to represent the border regions of Indiana and Iowa, too. Airy vocals, exquisite orchestration, eclectic instrumentation and the unlikely pairing of schizophrenic arrangements with catchy hooks helped to make it the top-rated 2005 release on online review aggregator MetaCritic. The sparse accordion, banjo and electric guitar ode to Decatur is one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great album","review":"I was driving the other day listening to the song \\"Chicago,\\" and through my rear-view mirror I saw two girls riding a vespa were behind me zooming through the frosty streets. The morning light poured onto their faces as they pointed and laughed as they held each other to keep warm. It was a perfect moment with a perfect song, and reminded me why I like music so much in the first place. This is one of those albums that will quickly become a classic.With that said, sometimes this album feels a bit overlong, and you'd really have to be in a Sufjan Stevens mood to listen to it all the way through. Part of me wishes that it had 10 or 12 songs rather than 17, but I'll give it the benefit of the doubt because they're really great songs.

But Illinois blows his previous work way out of the water. He manages to combine the sound of impressively sophisticated fully orchestral scores with the non-pretentious and soft folksy sound we love so much about our dear Sufjan.Buy the dang Cd you know you want to."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Illinoisian's Verdict: Dull, Vapid, Gimmicky","review":"I'm completely astonished by the rave reviews for this album. Singer-songwriter stuff works best when the artist makes you feel he's singing about experiences or events that have greatly affected him. These dilettantish songs, on the other hand, sound totally forced, like they're based on encyclopedia entries (Or am I to believe that Stevens has strong personal feelings about Casimir Pulaski, Mary Todd Lincoln, Carl Sandburg, and the Columbian Exposition?).The lame lyrics could be somewhat forgiven if the music had a pulse, but this album is totally D.O.A -- no energy whatsoever, melodies that are completely innocuous and instantly forgettable.As for the song about John Wayne Gacy, Stevens is seemingly trying to be profound but in the end has nothing remotely insightful to say (Serial killers are people too? Wow, how heavy!!!!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow. Completely Original!","review":"Just from hearing the first song on this album, you know that Stevens is incredibly original. I do like this album, but I must say that there doesn't seem to be much emotion. This is a great album, but not for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm underwhelmed","review":"I listen to a lot of music, a lot, and when I started seeing this on DJ lists and reviews I took the leap of faith and checked it out. For the life of me I can't figure out why this is on the #1 slot of so many people. This put me to sleep after ten minutes. It just did absolutely nothing for me.Maybe I'm too particular about the type of music I like but there are so many better things to spend your money on than weak music like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Not A Fan","review":"This album is rated too high for what it is. There are indeed a few cool instrumental melodies, but like a few of the reviewers mentioned already is just has no soul to it. I would give it 2 or 3 stars but the overall rating is so undeservingly high I have to do my part to keep things in balance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recycled goods","review":"Having listened to Steven's previous albums, Greetings from Michigan and Seven Swans countless times, I cannot help but to notice the amount of regurgitation on this album. Stevens blatantly rips off his own music. I consider Michigan to be Sufjan's masterpiece. Do yourself a favor and start there."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars for cleverness","review":"but you get the feeling he wrote the songs as an afterthought to clever titles.maybe clever the first time through, but I can't imagine why you'd listen again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but not the music....","review":"Some clever stuff...but as far as music goes, I just can't bring myself to enjoy it (with the possible exception of Night Zombies). It escapes me why this has shown up on so many best of 2005 lists."},{"rating":"2","title":"How does he do it?","review":"It seems like an impossible feat. That one person could produce work of such consistent genius. Surfjan seems to have a supernatural songwriting gift. When I first listened to this album I sat in shock as the John Wayne Gasey Jr. track started playing (I hadn't looked at the track listing). Here is a song about a serial killer that, far from leaving the listener wallowing in hatred or revulsion leaves us with a new and completely astounding insight. I won't give it away. If the album consisted of just that one song I would recommend it. But, of course, it has many songs, and it is a wonderful achievement. Some of the material seems to take an odd direction, but it works into the whole. I also have a suspicion that there are many musical references that I'm not catching.Highly recommended. (If you have a record player, get the vinyl. It's stunning.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully pretentious","review":"The government could replace waterboarding with forced listening of this CD. Sufjan Stevens is the John Tesh of college radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everyone you know is wrong about this album","review":"Astoundingly overrated, Stevens is a weak singer-songwriter who sounds here like a pastiche of James Taylor and Brian Wilson at their very worst. Lyrical conceits fall flat, and the overtones of born-again-ness are teeth-grating. The tunes are lackadaisical, half-composed at best. Nothing here has any energy, and I can't detect any real emotion or commitment here.I am at a loss to explain why this collection of mediocre-to-bad songs, performed and sung with a half-a$$ed attitude and no energy, has gotten so many good reviews from so many people. There is absolutely nothing here. Buying this is like buying a blank CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't make me want to visit Illinois.","review":"Slightly more \\"umph\\" than the Michigan CD, but still redundant and boring. A few clever and artistic moments, but not quite an entire album's worth. Playing a diverse array of instruments doesn't really make the songs any more musical. Overall, it's still a pleasant sounding and well-produced CD. Just too many 'da,da,da's, 'oh's, and repetitive chime sounds for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is over rated fluff","review":"I think that the creativity and uniqueness of these wispy songs (all focused on Illinois issues) overshadows the basic premise of popular music which is that it must be listenable.This is a novelty work rather than a cd you can listen to repeatedly.It is not as good as depicted by the critics. There are some nice melodies, instrumental passages and ideas but this seems more like an experiment rather than a focused work.I respect the taking of chances but this doesn't warrant repeated listenings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries way too hard","review":"I wanted to like this album. I tried. But I have an idea that in 5 years, no one will remember this record. It reaks of Sufjan Stevens trying to be different. Like the guy at the coffee shop who wears the wool cap and army coat, when it is 100 degrees outside. Like his bio on his web site about being found in a milk crate. Like the horrible long titles of the songs. But most importantly, like the music that just does not grab you. You won't be humming any of these tunes at work.It is not horrible. Just not that great. Don't believe the hype surrounding this album. I would say sample some of the songs. They all sound pretty much alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brah?","review":"What in tarnation is this?

It's pronounced IlliNOY. Not IlliNOISE. I'd give this album -5 stars if I could. I bet if I tried to give it 1 star, Amazon wouldn't post it, because they want to inflate their big pockets with money from consumers who read their favorable reviews and then get in line to add more money to the pockets of the Amazon superheavy moneybags guys.This album is awesome. I really like the guitars. I think every record album should have more guitars. And not those little Hawaiian guitars, but those big pointy ones like in hair metal videos. Double the fun if there are two guitars in one. Sextuple the fun if the guitars are neon green. Sufjan Stevens reminds me of my friend, Patrick. He goes to Illinois for college.

The latest game I've purchased (after telling myself not to buy another) is Crusader Kings Complete. Unfortunately, it crashes every 15-30 minutes, rendering the game unusable. There is a patch for Snow Leopard but it crashes as well. (In fact, the notes on their website say if the Snow Leopard patch crashes you should downgrade to the other version that also crashes.)I hope they can figure out the crashes. The games themselves are excellent and have so much promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"One of the first purchases I've ever had to return (...) but this album is of little value. It is comprised primarily of plastic pages that hold 2x2 coin folders into which the coins must be inserted before mounting. They don't mention that these are required but (conveniently!) include an order blank for them. While these are commonly used by coin collectors the beginning collector, who is among the most likely to buy this product, will not likely have them and will be unable to use the album until they are acquired at an additional cost. Not very thoughtful if purchased as a gift! There are several others on the market and any one of them would be a better selection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice album","review":"I think the album is very nice and more than worth the price. It works very well for the 50 state quarters including basic facts about each state. If coin holders were included, it would be perfect.

Figure 6.1 Defined Ordered Sets for Frame delimiters on page 95 is incorrect and violates the Fibre Channel Physical and Signaling Interface (FC-PH) revision 4.3. The figures are sloppily drawn. For example, Figure 16.3 Loop Port State Machine state diagram, simplified has graphic which covers text. Personally, I find the diagram difficult to follow; others may not.

As for the more sensational material concerning Leopold and Loeb, the author gets nearly everything wrong--the nature of the relationship of the disturbed teenagers, their personalities, their motivations. I gave it two stars because I actually enjoyed the view of Elizabeth's life (the \\"upstairs maid\\"), and her experiences as a recent immigrant in America. Otherwise, I'd give it one star. It's as if Neilson did little research into the lives and characters of the two young murderers, and just imposed his own characterizations and ideas.

I took the light to a stained glass studio and they told me that the light was poorly constructed, that not enough materials were used when saudering the light. I gave the estimate for repairs to RAM gameroom and told them what I was told at the stained glass studio. They were unwilling to pay for the repairs or even a portion of the repairs. It cost me one hundred dollars to get the light fixed.

I confess to being particularly drawn to this book as, well, an example of WWI-era pulp. It is sufficiently plot-driven, and entertaining enough to while happily away a few hours. Decidedly fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic spy story in Yates mode!","review":"This was the second time I read this story and must admit that it seemed longer, somehow, the second time around. It's good to see Richard Hannay pitted against the 'Hun', once more. This time with a band of faithful followers to upset the Germans' plans of set the Middle East aflame with a 'Jehad'. Parts of the book bog down in technicalities of the Great War effort, but then, the story is being told by a soldier fighting said war! Hannay's storytelling betrays his jingoistic belief in the British Empire and British fairness and holds himself proudly as the pre-Apartheid South African that he is! In all, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and recommend anyone else to read it, the prequel and the 3 sequels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Spy Novel","review":"Greenmantle is a dramatic and suspenseful story of 4 men journeying through enemy lines to stop an evil menace that may crush Britain during WW1.As you read you will be able to tell that John Buchan knew what he was writing about! The characters and the plot are very well developed and sometimes rather confusing but if you just keep reading it will clear up. Buchan sometimes gets technical and you may have to look up some phrases/words in the back but this book is worth it. I would recommend it for 11th grade +. Once you start it you may not be able to put it down so enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent view of espionage and world affair in WWI","review":"I can't speak highly enough of this book, it's certainly among the best I've ever read in my 58 years and I read a LOT.John Buchan introduced his character John Hannay in The Thirty-Nine Steps, but this book really puts him through his paces along with his colleagues. The description of scenes from Egypt to Germany are rich and full and draw the reader in - as a well written book is meant to - and the suspense toward the end of the story is riveting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story but spoiled by promulgation of racism","review":"A classic tale of espionage and intrigue in the days of WWI. Unfortunately, John Buchan inbues his work with the Eurocentric racist views of the time. With the dehumanization of Muslims and Africans to \\"savages\\" and disdain for different religious beliefs this work typifies Apartheid doctrines. A good read if you are inclined to enjoy racism couched in the embrace of Catholicism and the \\"superiority\\" of the Aryan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly, misleading, and offensive trash.","review":"The number of absurd coincidences, cliffhangers, and deus ex machinas required to sustain the plot of this boy scout daydream would challenge anyone's ability to suspend disbelief. I would rate it as slightly less credible than the Wizard of Oz. This silliness spoiled it for me, though I might have loved it if I had run across it at the age of 12. This book does not give any kind of reliable view of World War I. It is a fairytale. Also despite what other reviewers have said, I found the South African apartheid-style racism pervasive and offensive. This kind of thought was no more acceptable in 1916 than it is today, as Gandhi made so eloquently clear at the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"SPY SCIENCE BOOK","review":"MY 10 year old grandson loves this book.

While the film didn't hold my interest for most of the first two thirds, I stuck with it out of curiosity. The payoff in the final act was actually fairly engaging, as the characters get what's coming to them or fight their way past their own misdeeds.

He liked it because of the grossness, but then he's a man. The \\"actors\\" were all second-rate; the screenplay was ill-written; the lighting was too dark, and the so-called action was too fast.

This is a religious film, it may as well have Kirk Cameron in it. The underlying message is painfully obvious. This movie was a trick devised by a religious group to get all of us blood and guts loving sinners to see the error of our ways. Predictable, terrible plot, bad acting (even for the average Horror movie) and one of the silliest, worst endings I've ever seen. Even Michael Madsen couldn't save the movie, even when he is perfect for the character and his mere glance is enough to make one nervous.I'm not going to bore you as this movie did to me.

The sheer amount of information is at times overwhelming; much like the music itself. While the set itself is amazingly put together, it's success lies in the blissful glory of Ayler's music. The recordings in the set seem unreal (Ayler playing at Coltrane's funeral, Don Ayler's band with Albert, and live recordings from basically every point in his career). Again though, this just brings us back to the music itself: A mostly joyful and highly emotional listening experience. At times I find myself questioning the very existence of this music, and this person who once channeled such music.

You don't need much of it, just a thin layer, otherwise it can taste a little chalky.

The backing band of Robert Irving III on keys, Bobby Broom and Daryl Thompson on guitar, Darryl Jones on bass, Toby Williams on drums, and Kahil El'Zabar on percussion set up a friendly, easy groove on each song. The big redeeming feature is that Murray's saxophone playing isn't always smooth -- he incorporates some free jazz squeals and harmonics into his solos. Olu Dara plays trumpet on \\"Ornette\\" and spurs Murray to his wildest soloing of the disc.

The black and white only photos and diagrams are of poor quality; the diagrams are repeated throughout the book. The only reason I rated it as one star is because you must give it at least one.

These guide included some really inaccurate information on restaurants, the maps are totally inaccurate and the information given is scarce. I really expected more seriousness in this guide -being a Lonely Planet one- that leaves me asking why is Lonely Planet guides so popular?

In my opinion the July 1998 edition of this book is too far out of date, and contains an unacceptable level of inaccuracies and inconsistencies. I would also endorse the previous reviewer's comments about the tone of the book, although I would say that a 'right on' sneering attitude seems to be written into too many Lonely Planet books and Rough Guides in general. This book is not worth buying in its July 1998 (3rd) edition. It needs to be completely rewritten and not reissued in a 4th edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"A snide, critical book for those not planning to visit.","review":"I have been a big fan of the LP guides, up to now.

A sadly deficient departure from LP's previous level of quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Guidebook","review":"I returned from Beijing last week after spending about 2 weeks in the city. I had and used the Lonely Planet Beijing guidebook extensively. It was at least partially wrong about almost everything. Museums, resteraunts, and other things it recommended were closed. Every phone number was wrong. The guidebook lacked useful information about how to get places, how to orient self, and hours of an establishment. Also, the guidebook was judgmental.

True, the tone of the book is somewhat cynical, but I found it nonetheless to be invaluable in a solo two-week trip to China in June. Robert Storey is very knowledgeable on China, Beijing in particular, and I found most of what was written to be quite accurate. I had two problems with the book. First, the book (at least the version I received) was outdated. It's hard to blame the publisher though, given the rate of change in the city. Second, the maps in the book are pretty bad. Make sure you get a better map to supplement what's in the middle of the book.

It seems like the person who wrote this book has been living in China for a while and is not particularly interested in seeing the sites around town. There were plenty of places to eat, stay and party, but not a lot about the amazing things to see in Beijing.For examply it had good instructions on how to get to the summer palace, but no info on what you were looking at once you were there, compared to Egypt guide (for example) where you could happily wander around a temple and happily feel that you don't need a tour guide to tell you anything, the Beijing guide had a paragraph or two saying this building and that building are nice.Also very dissapointing was the history section, As the capital city of a coutry with so much history, old and new, I think that it deserved more than 3 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pile of Junk with a Mind of it's Own","review":"This might be the biggest pile of electronic junk I have ever bought, and I have bought a LOT of electronics.

But it's way out of my price range, unfortunately. The size, coupled with the brightness, contrast and color density add up to a very convincing watching experience. It gives the illusion of depth that you just don't come close to achieving out of a conventional TV and in the process, tends to pull you into the program. It's almost like information overload.

He, perhaps, was looking for an explanatory work with chapters on doctors, nurse, hospitals, etc. The present work tells a story, one might say it reads like a novel. The book describes what happens but only with information available to contemporaries. The doctor-reader can try to use his medical knowledge to make a diagnosis. But the work is not just for doctors: it tells the importance of medical care to the war efforts of North and South and tries to argue that the superior medical care of the North was partially responsible for the Union victory. The miserable diseases and horrible wounds (gangrene) show how horrible the war was for participants and balances the rosy picture of the war given by other works (glory).

The cover had a glowing review from Nora Roberts, so I thought why not? Let me tell you why not. The dialogue is trite. The plot is boring. Leigh Evans, the main character, is immature, brainless, and cold. She treats her father like dirt for, as a turns out, a very lame reason. Likewise, she takes her anti-men stance too far with her love interest, Michael St. Claire. If she were a real person, I would feel sorry for her family and friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something?!","review":"Was there a deadline that needed to be met? The ending was so abrupt that it left me totally dissatified. It started out pretty good as a relationship-character story. All of a sudden all the little subcharacters (Shamus/Barbara; Jake/Sheila, etc.) had to be tied into nice little endings except for Leigh and Michael. For all of Leigh's independence, her mere acceptance of Michael's influence on her growing client list was unacceptable. Sure they love each other, but there were still unresolved issues. To be honest, when I got to the end of this book, I threw in on the floor in disgust. How unfilling it turned out to be.

However he doesn't appear much since, for the middle half of the film, he is absent apart from two spliced in close-ups. Almost atmospheric chiller set in the Louisiana swamp on a painfully small budget (the ferry goes about 20 yards and almost all of the action is confined to one set) with a lot of religious symbolism. Most of the footage is taken up with Blake Edwards (future Pink Panther film director) romancing Rosemary La Planche who somehow loves the horrible swamp and has taken to running the ferry. This has a cult reputation but is really not all that good since the horror element is missing from too much of the film and the climax has La Planche running everywhere only for Middleton to pop up at all corners (yet he still can't find Edwards)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but could Be Better","review":"I really don't have much to say about this movie other than the fact that it is extremely well put together and I think that the director really captured the futility of the first World War and the terrible mistakes made by the ANZAC forces and the British.

It is also historically inaccurate on many counts.Well it has Mel Gibson in it, what do you expect? 1. he's handsome 2. the movie is gory, and 3. the ending will suck after a mostly plotless story line.Full of cursing, smoking, carousing, nudity and trash, and then they all die in 10 mins, and the film ends, with literally no ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still haunted by this one. Not for the faint hearted.","review":"I saw this movie almost 20 years ago and can recall many points as if I'd seen it last night. It was a multiplex theater and I won the flip of a coin to choose the movie. I can say safely say that my life was changed by the fall of that coin.The movie takes you from the Australian outback, through Egypt, to the beach-head in Turkey where the Australian nation came of age. It is worth seeing just for this historical portrial.The movie's ultimate insanity of war/pro humanity message is the one that will last for a life-time. My wife can still loose a night's sleep at the mere mention of it's name.So the next time you ask yourself, \\"What are your legs?\\" and the answer comes back from 20 years, \\"Steel springs.\\", I'll know that you have seen this movie as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"What about Mark Lee?","review":"After reading all the reviews I'm amazed That nobody mentioned Mark Lee's performance.He \\"is\\" the movie.

Gallipoli drives home the same point that youth is wasted on war and older men make the decisions to send the young to their death.

Speilberg could never attain that with the amount of gory violence in his movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-made, interesting war film worth seeing!","review":"They don't make many films about World War I, partly because it was such a poorly-fought conflict consisting almost entirely of soldiers being machine-gunned down in no-man's land. And the Gallipoli campaign was one of the most brutal, as well-illustrated in this movie. Still, I really liked this film, if only for the historical insights as to what would make an Australian travel half-way around the world to die fighting the Turks? A great film, with a great cast!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gallipoli - Over The Top Cannon Fodder","review":"I just added this one to my collection. A great film. Mel Gibson at his best. A bit over the top with the attitude towards the British Officers. None the less, the fact remains that volunteering for a comabat unit, with all the idealistic notions that war is a glorious affair will get one killed. Throughtout history soldiers have been sent charging forward to meet certain death, as an acceptable loss. This is one of the films I would recommend to a parent trying to discourage a son wanting to volunteer to go off to war. Born On The Fourth of July, Platoon, and Article 99 and also serve as a warning that sometimes even surviving doesn't end the horror. These people will get you killed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I love the movie. I can watch them over and over again without being bored!

The story of his friendship with another runner (Mark Lee) and the idealistic dreams both men have of glory and adventure in the war develops into a ghastly look at the horror of a suicide mission and the waste that Australians experienced, as hundreds of their young men were slaughtered. Gibson was just another working actor at this point, not yet the megastar he is today, and he blends in with the fine ensemble cast and delivers a poignant performance, while Mark Lee steals the show as the naive boy who dreams of adventure and winds up in the horrific experience of trench warfare. A strong, emotionally wrenching war film, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, Bad Soundtrack","review":"Wonfully crafted film, with fine performances.

Two young men, both runners, become friends who go off to war with the idea of defeating the Germans in WWI, but end up in the trenches fighting the Turks with virtually no way to win or even to stay alive.

Since these usually last more than 30 minutes, and since my trips around town are usually less than 30 minutes, I never get to the end of one of these messages. This machine will not permit fast forwarding (or backwarding) of MP3 tracks. It will also not remember where the playback stopped (when I kill the power), so that it may start up again at this point. These two functions will work with CD tracks, however.

Thank you and thanks to USPS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mckenna's Ultimate Theory","review":"First of all I must say Kirkus's review of the book was only \\"okay\\", in fact it misleads potential customers when it says Mckenna is all for \\"legalization of all drugs\\". HA! Any avid fan of Mckenna knows from his speeches that he is not for a populace of drug-users. In fact he feels only a select few should experience mind altering drugs, as most aren't responsible enough. I reiterate... VERY misleading on Kirkus's behalf.But onward.. McKenna, more or less sums up all his beliefs on humanity in this one book. It's his thesis on history more or less. He gives good examples of what the scientific community has shoved under the rug, and what these examples could do for liberating our theological minds. At times though, McKenna has the tendency to lose his audience with phrases like \\"Trancendent Other\\". He assumes a lot in such cases, but in the end he does provoke one's mind. Into considering the vast possibilities that remain untouched in Man's early history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic thesis on consciousness & more","review":"Regardless of your views on drug use, this book is a must read for anyone with an open mind. It will challenge fundamental beliefs, and force you to make new ones. This is one of the best books I've ever read. Note, you can skip the middle half (e.g. the history of drug use among various societies) of this book and still come away with the essence of what McKenna is proposing.Where does consciousness come from? What spurred it's evolution? Can it evolve beyond it's present day status? Is there really a difference between \\"drug users\\" and supposed \\"non-drug users\\"? What could all these possible implications mean for humanity?Read Food of the Gods. It will change you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revolutionary!!..well, sort of.","review":"Mckenna definetly has some thoughts to share. Thoughts awakened in the midst of a psilocybin-induced state of euphoria and terror. I think Hunter S. Thompson said it best--you can't buy enlightenment. You can't pick it in the forest either... The idea that a mushroom (or any other psycedelic) is some kind of extraordinary gateway to another dimension or key to the underlying nature of the universe violates the nature of what we see around us everyday. Its just not that simple, and its apparent that those who buy this book still wishes it were. but I must say in its defense that the stories are fascinating, mystical and nearly-convincing to the uninitiated. its an interesting idea that most of us would like to beleive. But insight comes from struggle."},{"rating":"2","title":"McKenna has a brilliant explanation for consciousness.","review":"This man is a genius! In Food of the Gods, McKenna postulates that monkeys on a diet of mushrooms, or dipping for insects in mushrooms, ate psychoactive chemicals that eventually played a major part in the evolution of human consciousness.He then goes on to examine mushroom spores and there ability to leave the planet and travel intergalacticly in deep space frozen hibernation before landing on another planet. He describes the mushroom as the perfect vehicle for intergalactic travel and the spreading of consciousness.SPACE MUSHROOMS!The rest of the book is all about mankind's evolution with psychoactive plants by his side. Although he did get some things wrong in this book it was still cutting edge for its time and remains one of the most important thoughts on the topic to date. The world will also miss the man after his recently passing into that higher realm of consciousness.Take this trip with Terence McKenna and expand your IQ."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author sounds like a confused teenager.","review":"I am all about free thinking and going against established norms etc. and praising shamanism and womens' rights etc., and don't get me wrong McKenna has had some great quotes, but I just didn't enjoy reading this book at all. I think that he makes a good point that primates ate mushrooms and developed consciousness and language etc which is what we became, but I think instead of really making a convincing argument he just kind of rambles and jumps around from subject to subject, making the reader feel like he assumes they already agree with him and don't need to be convinced. Basically I just think his reasoning presentation was severly lacking and that he sounds like a teenager on acid."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love his thesis as it shows respect for the feminine.","review":"As a 39 year old lifelong feminist, I was impressed by the true respect McKenna shows for the feminine (aka Mother Nature, Gaia). Plus I am enormously impressed by the elegance,lucidity and poetry of his natural science-based thinking. Of most importance for 1999, I believe, is his outlining of the lost partnership model of society as opposed the the inevitable burn-out of the dominator model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kieran Kane","review":"I first saw Kieran Kane and Kevin Walsh playing a lunch time gig in Basement Discs store in Melbourne.

I agree that it seems as if it is for trading system vendors to sell their product. However, if one reads carefully there are trading systems revealed that are currenty in use that work! The C.V. chapter lists one. \\"Market Wizards\\" does not list any specific trading systems. Also, the interview with Sid Kaz tells how the floor trades and what they look for from the off-floor traders. Learning this can save the reader many times the price of the book. There are valuable gems in this book that are well worth the effort to go and purchase it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing effort.","review":"If you are looking for a book with useful trading insights, look elsewhere. The book consists of brief and shallow interviews with traders, which while interesting, don't provide much in the way of novel trading ideas; most all of this has appeared elsewhere. Several of the interviews are nothing more than trading system vendors touting their own systems. The author even interviews himself! The book could also use some more careful editing; for example, the author recommends a book, but gives the wrong title and misspells the authors name. If you want to read about traders in their own words, stick to the \\"Market Wizards\\" books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of print and time","review":"It's amazing what this guy attempts to pass off as value. First of all he represents he is a trader of reknown. This is total rubbish. Being from Chicago myself I knwo that this guy is a total charlatan and he never made a dime trading. He was a part time trader on the 'baby' mid america exchange. It is equivalent to playing the penny slot machines. The interviews he conducts are made with traders who are of higher stature than the writer--I use that term lightly--but that is like calling a midget a giant since everything is relative. I would like to write that I axquired one morsel of information from this book but all I got was worthless words. I cannot recommend any less this book. Instead of even reading it, I recommend you pound your head against the wall since that would be more gratifying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overcompensating coming-out","review":"Clearly a \\"display piece\\" by youthful, indefatigable brilliance, this album is meant to dazzle and impress rather than express or communicate. Carter takes on each of his major progenitors on their own territory--Trane and Sanders, Hawk and Hodges, Rollins and Carney. His opening marathon solo on \\"A Train\\" is in itself a reprise of the history of the saxophone, from Boots Randolph to Albert Ayler. Give Carter credit. Even though these tracks are impersonations rather than assimilations of the tradition, it's doubtful any other player could have brought them off so convincingly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased & Satisfied","review":"I am not very computer literate, so bear with me.

I purchased two since I really like the idea and have seen an example of them in use, holding the contents of a 20 lbs bag of Nutromax. When the collapable bins arrived, they were half the size of the one I had seen earlier and would in no way have held the bulk of 20 lbs of dog food, maybe 20 lbs of some liquid or sand, something much more dense that the food my dogs eat. Unfortunatly the 40 lbs versions are no longer listed or sold, have they been discontinued? The good news is that I was able to return them and have settled for a reclosable tin, like the old potato chip tins I grew up with.

The tires perform very well on gravel and reasonably smooth hiking trails. At 70 psi, there is only a small penalty in rolling resistance on paved roads compared to higher pressure road tires. The size runs a little small; they actually measure just barely 1 1/4 inch wide and nowhere near the 37 mm metric equivalent on the sidewall.

Jesus gave fish to the crowds and to his disciples (John 6 and John 21), so it is hard to see how God's ideal diet is vegan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pat Martiono in Top Form","review":"\\"We'll be together again\\" and \\"Footprints\\" are my two favorite Pat Martino cd's.

Unfortunately, many books on the market may contain only 1 or 2 chapters of useful information; the remaining chapters essetially pap. Not too much different from musical CD's. On rare occasion I come across book that is well-crafted, coherent, and actually contains a lot of useful information. Excel 2000 Formulas is one of those books.I am quite competent in Excel but I still get stumped from time to time. This book has already provided me with new apporaches to old problems.

I have closely observed the MiG 27 of the Indian AirForce at Nasik and at an Air show in Mumbai. I wish i had more information on the Mig-23/27 with photographs and 5 view colour drawings / markings.After searching the Net i decided to buy the Book by Yefim Gordon on Mig-23/27.The author has described the aircrafts in detail with rare black and white photos of the MiG-23. The author has also covered the deployment part well. At the end 5 view line drawings ,colour drawings of Mig-23 BN, Mig-23 UM ,Mig-23 ML and Mig-27 M have been included which is useful for an aeromodeller. However 3 views have been restricted to aircraft of Russian Air Force markings. A few more coloured 3 views would have made an aeromodeller happy.Cutaway drawings have not been included. I wish cutaway drawings with details should have been included in the book.Overall the reading is interesting.

Pure junk. I sent them back and I decided to get a new pair from Koss for my upstairs studio. No regrets.The earpads are thck and comfortable, the sound quality is beyond reproach.If you need headphones, you can't go wrong with these.

Good choice even for the professional listener."},{"rating":"2","title":"not for iPod, great with decent amp","review":"standard portable devices just don't have the power to run these headphones properly. Tried with iPod, terrible, a bit better with Droid II on tight base eq. They did sound good but generally lacked base and the power in powerful music like the new alice in chains and tool. They were fantastic for Shostakovich symphonies though, I think because the power of these are only resonant in the low range and not reliant on it. When I plugged the phones into myGemini PA-7000 Professional Preamplifier(which is awesome and on sale now fyi), these problems were completely fixed and the sound was fantastic and very powerful (with flat eq)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Reference for Everyday Switch Administrators","review":"I am a network engineer and use the Catalyst 2900, 2950, 3500 and the 4000's on a daily basis. We do a lot of VLAN configurations, trunking using 801.q, static port access, along with other various switch configs. This book has been indispensable for my daily routines. There has not once been an instant where I couldn't find the answer to what I was trying to accomplish when configuring a Cisco Catalyst Switch. This also gives you the commands for COS and IOS and also tells you which switch supports what and which switch doesn't (example: the Catalyst 2950 supports 801.q by default, where others support ISL by default). I highly recommend this book for all your switching administrative needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Ordinary Time by Doris Kearns Goodwin","review":"I have always enjoyed listening to Doris Kearns Goodwin on the History Channel and her insights into our past.

Doris Kearns Goodwin in her Pulitzer Prize winning book, creates a visualization of the people and the times quite well. Never knew FDR was such a ladies man, or that Eleanor overcame such a disfunctional early family life to become a leading example of feminism well ahead of her time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read - and very educational.","review":"I learned not only about Eleanor and Franklin, but about WWII and other events and issues of the day. This is a compassionate book, one which takes context carefully into account as it details the controversies and issues with which Eleanor and Franklin dealt. I highly recommend it! even if you are not usually a Biography reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"My wife and I really enjoyed this CD. We heard Doris Kearns Goodwin speak at the Paramount theater in Oakland. Wonderful writer and speaker. One minor nit-picking complaint - the speaker mentioned FDR was able to keep several balls afloat.

No Ordinary Time is a fair and balanced account of the Roosevelts during WW II and honors both Franklin and Eleanor for their remarkable contributions to the country during those years."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Ordinary Biography","review":"Doris Kearns Goodwin has given us a treasure in \\"No Ordinary Time,\\" a vivid, intimate, informative, and readable biography of FDR and Eleanor during the WWII years, as well as a history of the time itself. This book is doubly relevant now, because since 9/11/01, we too are living in anything but an \\"ordinary time.\\" We don't know what is going to happen next, and neither does anyone else...including the White House. In their time, neither Franklin nor Eleanor knew what was coming next. The anxiety and weight of responsibility certainly took a toll on both of them. Kearns is unabashedly a fan of both FDR and Eleanor, but this does not prevent her from revealing their weaknesses as well as their strengths. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"I needed to live back then","review":"Another great one here, fills in a lot of blanks with some good new stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"suprisingly good!","review":"First off, let me say that this book was required reading for my AP US History class. I didn't expect much out of it, but it was really good. The story was told unlike any other history book that I have ever read. I shy away from giving it 5 stars because it is a history book and it is not critical enough. Goodwin presented the story without enough criticisms. She should realize that FDR wasn't perfect. But otherwise, a great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You are There!","review":"This book is another example of Doris Kearns Goodwin's masterful writing. Her research and details are impeccable.

Very annoying while reading. I tried contacting support, and they replaced the book, but lots of problems still and a few typo's. Book itself was wonderful, 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Ordinary Time","review":"Doris Kearns Goodwin writes with a relaxed yet authoritative style. The reader truly feels a connection with the characters. Ms. Goodwin reveals frailties, strengths, rationale, and frames all within various anecdotes that elicits laughter and at times, tears.She is not judgemental, but does interpret events in an acceptably objective framework. FDR may rise above his peers, and Ms. Goodwin does not change that perspective, but the gap between FDR and his peers existed largely due to his strength of belief and a wife whose infidelity by her husband, launched contributions by a First Lady that have not been paralleled since.Truly a fine work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read and history lesson","review":"If you enjoy history, this book is a must read. Doris Kearns Goodwin makes history interesting. Many of the programs that were instituted during the depression are still in effect today. The Roosevelt's were an amazing team, Eleanor paved the way for many women in politics and business. It's the perfect book to read in our current economic situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"FDR during WW2","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book.

This is a must read to study the Second World War. It is a valuable insight to the problems that even the rich and powerful have in life.

Wartime conversations, weapons production, historic meetings, the leaders, their families, and personal anecdotes are all here. You learn that Stalin was an enigma to FDR. That Churchill and FDR were truly kindred spirits. On the homefront numerous changes happened that transformed the USA permanently. Ex: The large scale moving from rural communities to urban manufacturing areas. Women {Rosy the riveter} moved in huge numbers into the work force. The service sector of the economy grew to help them. As in day care, take out food, and laundries. The reader may truly be stunned at just how unprepared the USA was beforethe start of the war. When the readers are done, they will realize that very title is a huge \\"understatement.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning!","review":"Best book I've read in a couple of years, and I read alot. I was hesitant to purchase this book as I know absolutely nothing about politics. Do not let that daunt you. Not only did I learn alot but it has sparked quite an interest for me in a subject I always felt was out of my grasp. I do like autobiographies which is why I bought the book. That and thousands of 4-5 star reviews had to mean something,plus a Pulitzer prize. World war 2 from U.S perspective is also something not written about often, usually staying within European side of things. This book is a perfect blend of the personal and political lives of the Roosevelts. Utterly fascinating, never boring, highly readable. I did not want it to end. Normally know what I'm reading next before I finish a book(I can't be without a book!) I was lost for a week after this.

Mistake, wow this book was such a nice read. Gave me a deeper understanding of the social and political dynamics of The Greatest Generation..

It's so well-written that it is like reading a story by a friend. Besides the history lesson, I gained so much admiration for Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. It was such a trying time in our history and I felt like I was there by reading this book. It is also scary how similar the events in this book are to the current events in the world. This is a great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing account of a wonderful partnership","review":"Doris Kearns Goodwin is masterful in her book on the dynamic relationship between FDR and Eleanor Roosevelt. A complete history of FDR's presidency it is not, but this book gives you insight into one of our country's most fascinating public relationships. I was completely engrossed in this beautifully written story. It gave me a better understanding for how Eleanor Roosevelt and FDR negotiated with and influenced each other, and how she impacted his presidency. FDR used her to extend an olive branch to feminists and minorities; she used her influence to lobby him on behalf of the poor and other groups needing help. An enthralling read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Edited This Book?","review":"When she discusses the Japanese losses at the battle of Midway she states the Japanese lost 4 aircraft carriers (true), 1 heavy cruiser (true), 3 battleships (completely, totally false).

It was a great disappointment. The author clearly adored Eleanor, and she gets a very thorough treatment in the book. The President, though, remained a total mystery. What made him think? What did he really think? What made him such a great leader? Don't read this book for answers to those questions because they are not there. At bottom, the book was a lengthy and ponderous treatment of Eleanor Roosevelt and her influence on the President and policy. That story could have been told in about 300 fewer pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius","review":"Rinde (pronounced RIN-dee) Eckert is one of the most phenomenal artists of our time, in several media. Dramatic writer, poet, actor, singer, composer, lyricist, narrator, operatic tenor, dancer... It was gratifying to see him as a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for \\"Oedipus X.\\" In person he is charismatic and compelling. His few uncategorizable recordings are probably unlike anything you have heard. Retailers don't know what to call these performances, but \\"avant garde,\\" as commonly understood, is misleading.

I always thought the opera lacked a back story, but Leontyne Price (a great Aida) provides one for us. Something that she needed as an actress as well as a singer to create her character in this piece by Verdi. We are lucky to have her insight into this opera so we can appreciate not just the music but the deep conflicting emotions behind the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too impressed...","review":"WARNING WARNING...do not expect too much from this book if you are a fan of Elton John's Broadway musical and not the actual opera. I found this book in the library shortly after seeing the traveling version of the new \\"Aida\\" (it was AWESOME) and, while the book does have gorgeous pictures and the story is told from the point of view of someone who practically lives in Aida's shoes, I was disappointed with the overall story. It was completely unlike the show I saw. I realize that the opera and the Broadway show are totally different. However, I found this book to be confusing and was unimpressed by the sloppy style of the writing...loved the musical, though!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Aida - A wonderful literture tie-in with Egyptian history!","review":"Leontyne Price's retelling of Aida is concise and beautifully illustrated. My three sixth grade classes loved the story, but my voice gave out in the repeated readings! I found the CD-Rom of Aida, which features Ms. Price's rich voice reading the text, along with musical excerpts from the opera. (Ms. Price sings Aida, Placido Domingo sings Radames.) Total playing time on the CD is 67:22. I expect this combination of beautiful story, music, illustrations, and singing will serve my students well as an introduction/exposure to opera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Book","review":"I was not able to get this book in hardcover. My parents bought it for my youngest sister when we were younger and it first came out.In the softcover, the pictures are still of great quality and the lettering is easy to see, and beautiful as well.The story is timeless and if you play AIDA the opera behind it, or possibly some Habesha or Egyptian caberet music, you can really set a mood for your kid.I get the music from the library even and it is nice to do.The pictures capture a young one's interest alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripoff City!","review":"Do not buy this set, unless your willing to settle for what Cheezy Distribution sends you!Several of the movies listed in the set, aren't even in there.So if you're ordering this set for a specific movie, forget it.

The positive points are:1 - They do not jam, bend or otherwise get messed up during the printing cycle.2 - They peel easily from the sheet, but stick VERY firmly to glass.3 - They are thick enough so that they can be applied to bottles smoothly with no wrinkles. This is a HUGE advantage over some other types of labels we have tried.4 - The 5264 template is built in to most major software packages. Setting up the labels for printing was a breeze.The negatives are: Haven't found any yet!I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud and Fast","review":"Somehow I stumbled onto this item while searching for \\"quiet\\" and \\"fan\\". Now that I review the item description I don't see any mention of \\"quiet\\". Oops.The fan's primary flaw is that it only has two speeds, both of which are insanely high. I don't need such a mighty wind to just take the edge off of my over-heated workspace. A gentle breeze would be great. Instead I have a choice between either a hurricane or a tornado.On the bright side, perhaps this product will bring about a resurgence of interest in the paper weight. And then, one day, frustrated over my choices between a sweltering office or a deafeningly loud fan, I can grab my largest paper weight and use it to break a window, thereby cooling the office naturally.

The ambiance as i am sure we all could imagine was quite amazing to inspire the musicians it did as it did. But the fact of the matter remains that the recording acoustics of the venue were not as good as the actual place itself. Consequently some of the recordings didn't turn out as good that are from there. Anyone truly interested in music will just glance at this fact briefly and move along to buying the album. That is exatly what I did! Thanks to the insight however on Mal Waldron's accompanyment. That was very useful information.also: I own and have heard several Five Spot albums, and some of them are of lesser quality, but the music sreams for attention! One of these is John Coltrane Live at the Five Spot, a tricky one to find and the recording quality is awful but is worth it in every way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Knife, BUT...","review":"I had this knife for over 2 years--loved it!

I really, really tried, but I simply could NOT get into this book.I usually give a novel one chapter to draw me in, but because of all the good reviews this book received, I read five. It was no good. I was bored. I just didn't care about the characters or the plot.I love thrillers, but this one left me cold. It's not that Seymour is a bad writer, he just isn't a very good one. There was nothing wrong with his writing, aside from leaving the reader bored and wondering when the action would start.There are too many good books out there to waste your time on a boring one. This is strictly my opinion. Several other reviewers loved this book, so to each his own.This was my first Gerald Seymour book and will probably be my last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise, Poignant & Almost Academic","review":"Duncan's presentation is fast paced and to the point. It mixes academic research with some clearly identified personal opinions. The main thrust of the book is that St. Augustine is responsible for forcing the Romanization of the Church in Celtic lands. His influence carried over into the reformation -- Luther was an Augustinian monk. Duncan claims that Augustine's renounciation of human sexuality was the result of his attempts to deal with his personal demons, including the putting away of his concubine. Duncan, an Anglican priest, is understanding of Augustine and tries not to portray the 'Doctor of the Church' as a villian, but as a human.Personally, I found this book answered many of my questions about the Celtic Church. It presents the issues and history of the Celtic Church in a context that is, in my opinion, fair and not idealistic or 'a romantic faery tale'. It is for the serious reader and has a theological tone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like it ..............................","review":"I liked Judy Collins for years before I got around to buying this album. And now I know why I waited years. She is a good singer when she is concentrating, but only ordinary when she's not. I am still in awe of what she achieved on the first verse of \\"Amazing Grace\\", but not nearly as happy with the other verses, to the point where I would rather find a better version.Just like I did with my other favorite recording of hers - \\"Someday Soon\\". The version by Suzy Bogguss is vastly superior. And I think Joni Mitchell's version of \\"Both Sides Now\\" is wearing much better than Judy's. And I would rather hear Leonard Cohen singing \\"Suzanne\\". Judy did these artists an immense favor by popularizing their music, but I don't think she is standing the test of time. Maybe some of today's great voices could be convinced to do a \\"Songs Of Judy Collins\\" album and give a brighter shine to some of her better originals."},{"rating":"1","title":"I gave her a try, but I wasn't impressed.","review":"I am a huge fan of both Joni Mitchell and Joan Baez, so I figured I'd love Judy Collins, as their musical styles are related. I bought this CD with great hopes, unfortunately these hopes quickly faded. I could not get past her voice! The songs could have been much better if it weren't for her out of tune voice. I don't quite understand why she is as popular as she is; she doesn't write her own music, and her voice is mediocre at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"This girl sux!","review":"My dad listens to Judy Collins every day in the car and no words can describe how much she unbelievably sux!

Two years ago I bought the Elektra CD, and was astonished at how bad it was. It made me wonder if I misremembered how good the album was. This Gold version is the answer -- the difference is like night and day. Whatever was done wrong when making that Elektra stinker, has been set right on the Gold CD. If you REALLY want to hear Judy Collin's voice in all its glory, this is the CD to buy. If I hadn't compared the two CDs myself, I would never have believed there could be so much difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Judy is great but the Elektra CD is awful","review":"I was stunned by how bad this CD sounds. I'm no expert, so I can't give you a precise description with proper terminology. Suffice it to say it's a bad job of transferring the recordings to CD. I later bought the Gold version, and the difference is like night and day. Judy Collin's voice is too wonderful to let this awful CD prevent you from really hearing her. The Gold version is worth the extra money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great album, worthless audio","review":"Buyer beware: this Elektra version of the wonderful Judy Collins \\"Colors of the day\\" has bad mastering.

Though he overdoes the scenery descriptions by today's standards, I found both books entertaining and a reminder of the cowboy and Indian movies I watched as a kid.

In this case, this is one to get. First off, this one sounds unique in the Murray catalog (unlike a number of quite similar quartet recordings): there is a great band here of players not typically associated with Murray, including Ray Anderson (Trombone) and Anthony Davis (piano). Davis appeared on the great early Octet recordings by Murray, and contributes a couple of great songs. Anderson also contributes the one infectious track as well.

Especially for when I shop with others who usually end up not where they're supposed to be. Though promised shipment in 2 or 3 days it took more than two weeks for them to be shipped. This could have been because I used the free shipping. Otherwise, the radios have a nice distance to them. I walked more than a mile away from my house while another person sat inside. We had no problems understanding each other. The radios also are easy to figure out how to set up and use. I also like the different call sounds that can be selected. They clip nicely to ones belt or can be put into ones pocket. All in all, I should have bought a pair of these a long time ago.

The story is immediately engaging; as for its cast, I found myself imagining the later lives of a number of the characters, a full day after I had finished the book. (I always take this to be a good sign.) Every once in a while the very oddities of the book weighed it down, and my suspension of disbelief faltered; but these very oddities make the book charming, and provide very good entertainment indeed.

With too many issues and none of them fully explored, the author seemed to forget his basic focus: the link his mother provided between the narrator's father and his future father-in-law. The Romeo/Juliet comparison some reviewers have made fall flat for me simply because I never believed in the supposed love between the two teens; the pairing struck me as more of a convenience than undying passion. Despite these flaws, the ending--both of a family and an era--moved me to tears."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful look into the past.","review":"I thought this book was a wonderful look into past and what things were like four or five decades ago. There was such a diverse cast of characters and the author made them all beliveable.

What a surprise! The graphics are a little cartoonish and dated, but there are lots of weapons and the episodes are really challenging. Basically it's a 3rd-person shooter with some strategy elements built in, but with a twist. The first part is a straightforward shooter in which you play a cute little space alien, and your team must take on the planet's bad guys. In the second part, the focus shifts and you play one of the planet's residents, a stunning \\"sea reaper\\" with magic as her weapons.

Also, it has started skipping although the ink cartridge is not empty yet.I'm really disappointed in this product.

Beginning with prayer to discern God's purpose and vision for the church, the author provides an appendix filled with suggested processes for becoming a blessed church. This refreshing book is not about church membership growth. Rather, it leads the church to become a deeper, broader, spirit-filled community of Christ.

At over a thousand pages of Elizabethan poetry, it took me almost two years to get through, and I am not a particularly slow reader. However, I don't want to completely scare away potential readers because it has also been one of the most rewarding books I have ever read. The story is always interesting and imaginative (and in such a long work that's saying something), most of the heroes and heroines are very sympathetic, and the imagery of poetry itself is breathtakingly beautiful. Though it was definitely a commitment to read, I have no regrets in taking the time to do so, and only hope that others will give it a try.

It does say 'Selection' in the subtitle, I now realize, although it was not made clear in the original description. The volume is doing me little to no good for its intended purpose.

It closely follows the James Michener novel of the same title; the relationships of the main characters and the overall plot are applicable to all of the United States foreign wars since WWII. The Bridges at Toko-Ri closely emphasizes the lives of the pilots and crew in the context of a war that seems remote to all except those who fight in it. It is a wonderful movie with strong actors and good character devllopment. You will not be disappointed purchasing a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reveals the inner thoughts of Korean War Naval Aviator","review":"In this excellent adaptation of Michener's book of the same name, William Holden delivers a terrific look at the thoughts and worries of a man flying off \\"the boat\\". The flying scenes are excellent, and the ramp strike footage has been reused many times in hollywood, most notably in \\"The Hunt for Red October\\". One of the best plotlines is that between Holden's character and the flying chief, played by Mickey Rooney. The way each man looks out for one another, across the lines of fraternization, says a great deal about the actual comraderie found in both the military and in combat. If you like Naval Aviation, this \\"Top Gun-Korea edition\\" is a must have in your aviation library.

The authors did a great job of bringing events of nearly 150 years ago to life - the characters all \\"came alive\\" for me, and seemed like real people in whom I became emotionally invested, rather than just dry statistics from the 1800s.

This is a story you won't forget. As a S.A.N.E., the message I most want to bring to the survivors of abuse and assault who I tend to is one of the great human ability to overcome terrible things.

So i pointed, clicked and oredered it up. I was horrified the instant the menu came up on screen and the option to start the movie was spelled wrong, it read \\"STRAT MOVIE\\". This should give you some idea as to the level of care and attention that went into the production of this inferior product.The picture quality was unforgivable. Usually a bad transfer doesnt bother me that much as long as I can see whats going on, but this movie transfer is pathetic. I am not kidding when I say that you are better off ordering a clean VHS copy than wasting your time and money on this DVD. It was absolutely unwatchable on my widescreen TV, I eventually had to put it in my computer to watch it as the \\"pixelization\\" was so bad ... consider youself warned....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie, with an unusual twist.","review":"The Philadelphia experiment is a classic in the Sci-Fi genre. What makes this movie really interesting though, is not the action, plot, or special effects. It is the fact that this movie is based on an actual military experiment. During an experiment to make a ship invisible to radar, the ship did just that, but it also became invisible to the naked eye as well. This may or may not be true, but it does make the story more interesting when this is considered. Even without it, it is a thought provoking story, with good visual effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's just plain fun!","review":"Okay, by today's standards, the special effects are a little on the hokey side, but, considering its age, the movie does just fine.

IMO this film is ridiculous. But it starts with the writing,Ultimately, when there is any type of confusion evident in the movie, the story does not seem right, dialogue is amateurishly contructed, the storyline is either in part not good or - as in this film - a total mess, a hodgepodge of confusion - you can lay the blame on the writer(s). Nothing in this film makes any sense at all. There's nothing in reality anyone can relate to concerning it. It is total fantasy, & of exceeding poor quality at that. A total waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Flick","review":"A good flick. Reminds me of Final Countdown, but in reverse (forward in time, as appose to back in time). Special effects could be a little better, but I guess adequate for the times. If your into time travel, then it is worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Philadelphia Experiment","review":"A little disappointing when compared with my memory of first seeing it on its original release, but this is only because the special effects and concept are now somewhat dated. However, it was still good to see Michael Pare oozing wartime sex appeal in a modern day society, one of the attractions of the plot. The warship-trapped-in-time concept was less thrilling than the original, but has stood the test of time for younger viewers without the sophisticated taste of higher tech expectations. A good watch for say a 10 year old but not that intriguing for adults. Worth a look though, for old times sake, after giving it to your nephew for christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT FOR FATHERS & SONS","review":"Beautiful documentary that both my sons and grandsons enjoyed watching TOGETHER!!!

I soon concluded that the sentences are totally unreadable, full of vague terms, run on constructions and, perhaps, paradoxical comparsions that are not readily apparent. Take these two sentences selected at random:In both cases they were outsiders to the collectivity, thus exacerbating their opprobrium. Even a plurality of opinions had no effect on this second accusation, which followed from the first, since the bourgeois were no less detested on the left than on the right.Now maybe this makes more sense in the original French.

I hope I can do him credit. This book was originally published in 1998. when I first read it. Then when Amazon offered it at a very low price as an ebook, I ordered it and reread it. Mr. Parker writes in a such a flowing, descriptive style that the scenes unfold before like you like watching a movie. The reader becomes so engaged in the characters; their motives, emotions, circumstances, that it becomes very difficult to to stop reading. The antagonist is a vile monster who kidnaps children from their beds as they sleep. The protagonist works with a sheriffs department in the Crimes Against Youth and has his personal reasons to pursue the villain. It is a compelling often brutal novel but is so skillfully written that is difficult to put down. A really terrific read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for all suspense/thriller buffs!","review":"Parker captures the attention of the reader from page one and does not release you until the end of the book--which ends all too soon for the entralled reader.

Naughton is a true crime noir treat, and Parker's personalization of him evokes the same dread as the main character feels.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A winner","review":"I gotta agree with the people who said un-put-downable. This one took me a little over 24 hours. I was fascinated by the pure evil of the Horridus, and the Terry Naughton character seemed real to me. This book held my interest all the way through. And who cares how he moved the snake.Part of the fun of reading fiction is that it is make-believe and you can suspend your dis-belief and just enjoy a rousing good yarn!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"This was my first experience with this author, and I would recommend this book to everyone. It took me a full 2 weeks to finish, because I found myself not so engrossed in the story through the middle of the book. The final chapters of the book though kept me wanting to find out more. There were plot twists that were unforseeable, to me anyway. I was stupified a couple of times. The characters in this story were believable, although not memorable. Donna Mason, the main character's \\"mistress\\" was too supportive, it made me wonder if there was something she was hiding.

I am writing this review so I can \\"move on,\\" get out of its grip...The end made me weep as though it happened to me. A truly incredible work.Read the book.

I would give 3.5 stars for the rest of the book that had some police procedural/politics in it and the 'scary' parts.Buy a different book by Parker and you'll probably find something you'll want to re-read.

As for the children, I've never heard such old sounding children in my life. Vernon Dursley for such a big beefy man has an absurdly whiny & screechy voice. I got through the first three tapes & gave it up. Hagrid sounds as if he should have a parrot on his shoulder saying, \\"Thar she blows matey! Har Har Har\\".

I completed the first 2 volumes in the series within two days and am breathlessly emersed in the third. Miss Rowling has created something both wonderful and mysterious with Harry Potter. Wonderful because of her works ability to transend generational barriers and capture the imagination of every age group existing seperately within several cultures. The mysterious being that there is something within the works that hits me as not quite right. I wish I could put a finger on it, but alas it alludes me as does Harry from \\"You-Know-Who.\\" Do yourself a favor and become part of history by picking up a copy of this timeless classic, this...work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plunge into the enchanting world of Harry Potter!","review":"This is by far the most outstanding novel I have ever read. Why, you may ask, has this Harry Potter tale (along with the others) become such a huge success? First of all, the characters are skillfully crafted. The struggles and triumphs of Harry, Hermione, Ron, etc. are easily related to the struggles and triumphs of today's generation. Then, there's the exciting plot. Let's face it: most, if not all of us, hate boring books with pedestrian plots. This novel grabs the reader's curiosity, due to the thrilling events in the story. Next, there is the despicable villian (essential in every good book!), Lord Voldemort. Finally, there is a suspenseful ending and an important lesson to be learned (of course, I will not disclose either one)! As you can easily see, these factors all contribute to the success of these stories. These days, I see many people devouring all three of the current Harry Potter tales, and I don't blame them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AN EXCELLENT BOOK!","review":"This book is so good, that I've read it I don't know how many times. J.K Rowling sure knows how to keep you engrossed. The readin level says that it's for 9-12 yr olds, but I don't pay any attention. I mean GRANDPARENTS all over the world, are totally hooked! I'm sure ALL of you out there would have read this book, so I'm not writing an outline. But I'll just write about the parts which I liked best. In this book, I liked the part when Harry imagines that when the sorting hat is put over his head, it won't sort him in any house & he'll be sent back home. I also liked the part where Dumbledore says \\"I know all of you must be tires, so I'll just say a few words. Here they are...\\" and he mumbles a few words. I started laughing. All the 3 books in these series are very well written & I recommend it to everybody. (Though i hardly need to say that.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I have ever read!!!!!!","review":"Harry Potter is the best book I have ever read!! It makes other books look like nothing.

There is so much mystery you never know what is going to happen next! The only thing I don't like is that they say it's only for 9-12. I would say 9-adult. I'm 13 and I loved it. My mom even wants to read it! I can't wait until the 4th comes out! If you haven't read this book then your missing a lot!

I enjoyed reading this and plan on buying the rest of Mrs Rowling's books to read for myself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"I work in the Children's Department of a large bookstore.

I remember my mom giving me this book when i was seven and I didn't want to read it at all. Then she started reading it to me and i was enchanted by it. Not only the storyline is fantastic, but the way its written just mesmerizes me.A few years have past from then but I still read this book and its sequels over and over again and its become my favorite series off all time.also, it opened up the world of reading for me and if it weren't for this book, I would probably be stuck playing videogames all day instead of reading beautiful pieces of literacy.Thank you JK Rowling."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great start to a great new series!","review":"What a great series! At a very young age, the famouz wizard Harry Potter narrowly escaped death. When You-Know-Who turned to evil, he started to kill the greatest wizards in the land. But for some reason he couldn't kill this boy. And as a result, Harry now has a scar on his forehead in the shape of a lightning bolt. About 12 years later, Harry is living with his muggle parents, Aunt Petunia, Uncle Dursley, and Dudley. One day he receives a letter addressed to him, but Uncle Dursley won't let him read it. Some time later the letters are pouring in by the thousands. What he doesn't know is that these letters are from a place unlike he ever imagined. A place called Hogwarts, a school for wizards. But Uncle Dursley won't pay for him to go, but eventually he sees the light and allows Harry to go, beginning the adventure of his lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter is filled with magic, wizards, and witches.","review":"If you are looking for an adventure filled book with magic, wizards, and witches, then Harry Potter and the Sorercers Stone is just for you.

Our family loves fiction and that is what this is. A well written FICTION! Many of Harry's \\"issues\\" are difficult to swallow but like all children he discovers a coping mechanism. It is filled with excitment and challenges to overcome. Harry finds strength of character. I will continue to read these sories in during our Family time and encourage others to do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter","review":"Harry Potter is a novel based on fantasy and variety. The simple structure of the book makes for a easy read but the complex content is stimulating and very enjoyable. Everyone, children, adults, elders, everyone, can relate to the fantasy. Harry Potter brings this mysticle fantasy to each person that each of us tend to grow out of, yet we a capable of connecting with the fantasy and believing it. Honestly, i think that there is noone in in the country who cannot enjoy Harry Potter. With the play on words and mysticle themes Harry Potter can touch even the most conservative adults. Therefore i strongly believe that everyone should take the time to atleast read one of the collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most imaginative and entertaining books......","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is one of the most imaginative and entertainiing books I've ever read...J.K.

I wish that there was such thing as magic so that we could fly and really cast spells. I'm going to reccomend all the books to all of my friends no matter if they have it or not!

I saw how to enter the Magical Candy Contest at school in the library, so I did because I love Harry Potter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read!","review":"I think this is one of the most monumental and one of the best books of the 20th century. This book tells you about children who become witches and wizards in one of the greatest peices of fiction around.

It is the incentive I use for everything in my classroom - 15 minutes of 'Harry Potter' - they all crave it (and this it when given a choice between 15 minutes of computer time or a no-homework night or 15 minutes of reading 'Harry Potter'!!!) We have just finished the first book and are starting the second. They are all hoping that there are more books on the way. I will be encouraging them to send their own reviews in very soon.

My mother gave me a first edition copy of SS when I was 16 or 17. I set it aside, thinking-eh, easy children's chapter book. I didn't know that this little \\"children's book\\" would cause me to become a serious Harry Potter addict/fan. A story about good VS evil, true friendship and bravery, Harry Potter is more than just a children's book. It is an adventure, a world you have to experience and people you have to know! Now, at 28, I read this to my child and even on my own. I cannot tell you how many times I have read the series...too many to count.

I liked it because it was a mix of sorcery and basketball. I was really lucky becauses my mom got a hold of the second book which is only out in England, but soon will be in America.

He raved about it, couldn't put it down, annoyed his parents (and grandparents!) by reading passages aloud and insisting on recounting plot points, and refused to go outside to play until he had finished it. (Since he lives in a remote part of upstate N.Y., the later may have been prudence rather than fascination.) I, meanwhile, had somehow managed to end up with an extra copy of the book. Bored with my book club's selection for the January meeting, I picked up Harry Potter and began to read. I, too, couldn't put it down and stayed up until 2:00 a.m. to finish it.

I am not finished with the book yet, and I will finish it, but I am not too sure I will finish the series.To be fair, my 10 year old did tell me it was kinda boring, but he has read it 3 times... maybe I need to introduce him to the rest of my library!

I have read and enjoyed Dostoyevsky and Solzhenitzin, but also love The Lord of the Rings, and other fantasy works by the likes of Stephen R. Donaldson and Philip Jose Farmer, for example.When my wife became an avid \\"Potter fan\\" I decided to give this book a try, but I found the prose style so dreadful that I was unable to continue beyond the first chapter. Whatever this series has to recommend it as far as the story goes (I watch the movies to keep up with that, and they are pretty entertaining), the writing itself is unforgivably poor. Most creative writing students that I spoke with about it at Fresno State agree with me, as well. This makes me think that Harry Potter is mostly read by people with limited experience with literature, as is the case with my wife, for example. If you never listen to Beethoven, Vivaldi, or Mahler, you won't recognize good from bad attempts at \\"classical\\" music."},{"rating":"1","title":"All I can say is disappointed","review":"This book does not live up to the hype.

All the hype made me wary, but I finally picked it up so I could see what all the fuss was about. I'm 19 years old and absolutely love this book. I won't say that the idea behind the book is a new one - I've read several books where the main character is a kid who's discovered that there's something special about him/her and is going to a school where that specialness can be nutured (Arrows of the Queen by Mercedes Lackey comes to mind; it's also an excellent book, and I recommend it if you like this one). However, I like that kind of story, and J. K. Rowling's writing style is enjoyable to read.

Yes, for those of you out there ready to have an exorcism, there is magic in this book. But it is no where even close to what I was hearing about. This is a great book! High quality, and well written. J.K. Rowling has a true gift, and can truly make her characters come alive.

I was so interested in it. I like how it tell's you about Harry Potter's life when he was little and when he lived with his uncles the owl's would get there and send him alot of letters so that he could go to Hagwarts to make some magic but since his uncle would take them away they started to send alot of owls with cards so that he can at least get to read one, until finally his going to be friend takes him from were they were at the middle of the sea and takes him to the bank to get all his money so that he can buy all the supplies that he needs.

Yay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kudos to the promoter, not the author","review":"I can quickly name five to ten other far superior children's fantasy series. Credit should go to the publisher and publicist for selling this book. The language is flat. The characters very predictable. Where's the tension, emotion? I was relieved to see the abridged version of this and the two sequels for sale on CD. Clearly this shows that people really don't enjoy reading these books and are too afraid to speak up. If they listen to the CD's they will know enough about the characters, plot,etc to converse with others so they don't seem so of the loop. Has Ms. Rowling ever developed a paragraph longer than 6 sentences? Perfect for today's short attention span."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Boy Who Lived","review":"Harry Potter is one of the main characters who always gets in trouble with his uncle and aunt. Harry had to live in a cupboard below the staircase. Harry has to live with his aunt, uncle, and the spoiled brat Dudley. The only reason he has to live with his aunt and uncle is because his mom and dad died in a car accident. Then Harry goes to this magic school. Harry had to deal with the absents of his mom and dad, he also had to deal with his aunt, uncle, and the spoiled brat Dudley. The reason I like this book is because its adventurous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic for anyone!","review":"Wow, It took me just a week to read a first book.

But as soon I started reading it prooved to be a masterpiece of imagination. Rowling gets to describe characters, artifacts, situations and creatures that go beyond our wildest dreams, with the geniality that at the end of the book we get to know this objects and people in a way we think they are real. Last time I was watching ESPN I hoped someday they would televise the Quidditch World Cup!, as weird as that sounds!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I found it hard to put this book down","review":"I'm in 5 grade and this is the best book I've ever read!

I think this book would be great for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read.","review":"If you want to escape reality for a while and delve into the literary version of a comic book, this is a good read.

Time for fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spanking good book","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this first installment of the Harry Potter series. While written for children, I was enchanted by the book. I really enjoyed the Wheel of Time series, the Belgariad and Mallorean and Lord of the Rings, and while Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone wasn't the same reading level, the story and lessons were very similar to all of those epic series. I recommend it for anyone and everyone, all muggles should be aware and alert from now on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book I've Ever Read","review":"I enjoyed reading this book.

My mom was not happy about that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely magical... for all ages","review":"Harry Potter and his friends at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry weave a captivating tale of mischief and mystery. Since this is the first in a series, it is dialogue-driven and the story really progresses fast. However, Ms. Rowling is such a great author that there are surprises around every corner. This book is full of nothing but good. It is a quality book and teaches children the basic good versus evil conflict. This is a must read for every American who has ever dreamed to reach above the ordinary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soccerer's Review","review":"I thought this book was very good. It was just about everything you could possibly want in a book. It was funny, suspensful, adventurous, and exciting. It also taught you about being a good friend and a good person. It is not at all bad to read if you're scared of magic, or your parents don't want you reading about magic. It has hardly none of that. My mom doesn't let me read about magic either, and I read all 4 books at least 12 times!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun fast read","review":"Love Christian books.

Tons of great characters are in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Beginning and Exciting","review":"J.K. Rowling does a great job in this book by beginning the story perfectly and ending perfectly. Also she left Harry wide open for more adventure at the end of the story. This book is one the most exciting books I've ever read. In that J.K. Rowling keeps the reader on their toes because when you're sure something will happen it will be the exact opposite. I recommend this book to anyone who loves adventure and suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"better and better.","review":"I started reading this book when I came home from school one day.

Then he starts getting mystery letters, is visited by a huge giant named Hagrid, and before ya know it, he's enrolled in a school of wizardy and witchcraft called Hogwarts.

READ IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter the sorceres stone","review":"I like this book because it is fun and exciting. You can read this book no matter how old you are.

When I first heard of Harry Potter I thought to myself, \\"Eh, it's probably just a children's book!\\" Then, I started hearing it was good. I believe I got them for Christmas or something, actually for both my sister and me. I read the first one (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone) and fell in love with the series. I was completely caught up with it. I couldn't put down the book. I used to read the whole page until I found one that ended the sentence or else I would lose my place. I know, but I didn't feel like using bookmarks! I couldn't stop reading because it was so interesting. I love mystery and adventure books such as Harry Potter and EverWorld. I like being kept in suspense. I think that Harry Potter is a great and magical book not only for young ones to enjoy, but for everyone to experience the magic Harry Potter is experiencing in J.K. Rowling's mysterious and fun series. I do hope they keep the books coming!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter CD OK","review":"Delivery time was good, condition as advertised except the sound quality does not seem as good as other audio books I have purchased in this series.

At Hogwarts he also finds out many secrets about his past that you'll never believe. I really liked when Harry began at Hogwarts and learned to play Quidditch and how to fly on a broomstick, the way he felt when he first to flight, I think I'd feel the same way and love to be able to fly on a broomstick and feel like its the best thing to do other than anything else in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"a pleasant surprise","review":"I'd heard of the Harry Potter phenomenon for a while before I decided to read this book.

I must say that the author impresses me quite a bit. JK Rowling really knows how to write a good story. It kept me interested and turning the pages. I admire and respect Rowling as an author, even if I don't respect her as a person for her careless and irresponsible marketing strategies. Anyway, I highly recommend this novel for its literary value. And, it's fun, for kids and adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"STUPID!","review":"The storyline is pretty good. I do like the idea of a boy who knows nothing of what he is to become and how he will affect many people's lives just by living. But that has been overplayed too much. (Dune, Star Wars, both of which were ten times better.) He has friends with stupid names, teachers with stupid names and a lightning bolt on his forehead. (LOL)I don't understand the big deal about this book. by people who are for it or against it. No, I don't beleive that Harry is Satan, but I do beleive that this book is average and there should not be a big hype over it.I did like the ending. Harry, Ron, and Hermione had to use everything that they had learned to face VOLDAMORT! VOLDAMORT! VOLDAMART!

So Order, Divide (the pages), and Conquer the dark side! I loved this book because it took more than one night to read and actually understand it, and it kept me guessing and i was wrong!Not like other mystrey books where you figure it out half way through.

Every word that is read is hung on to as if it may be the last. The children love the adventures of Harry Potter and his friends' and once the book was completed, it was as if the world had ended. The magic that Joanne Rowling's writing has, is something very special and I would recommend any child or adult to read this spellbinding adventure story. As the saying goes, \\"Miss It - Miss Out.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"What's good for the kids...","review":"Having not only read this book, but the other three, I have to say this is one series I'm keeping aside to read to my future kids. It's as wonderful a read for adults as it is for kids and I imagine that it would be a wonderful set of books to read aloud as bedtime stories (one or two chapters a nite). I was sucked in by the very first paragraph and couldn't set it down until I'd read all four books! With the morals lessons and the everyday childhood dramas mixed in with heavy dose of pixie dust, this was an excellent series to share with the kids in my family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Believe the hype!","review":"Wow! That was my reaction once I finished this book. I couldn't believe how much I enjoyed it. I had haphazardly starting reading it as someone gave it to me as a gift. Now I could kick myself for waiting so long to jump on the bandwagon!I am simply amazed that someone has such an imagination as this book reveals. It's most impressive. And believe me, I am not one for \\"magic\\" and/or children's books as I thought this was.This book is beautifully written and really makes you care about the characters. Definitely worthy of the hype and attention that it has received!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book.","review":"Wow! For a book half written in a coffe shop I have only great things to say. The basic storyline is great. It is entrticately detailed but not that hard to follow. Also, Rowling has the great skill of leading the reader in one direction, then switching all of a sudden. This is something that after reading three of her books, I cannot predict. Rowling also does a great job of leaving the scene open for the sequel.P.S. I don't whether or not this is only rumor, but there are going to be only seven books, one for each year at Hogwarts (his school of magic)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST-READ for children and adults alike","review":"A month ago I saw people crowding around a table in a bookstore, grabbing for Harry Potter books.

I thought, \\"What do I have to lose?

What's more, I finished all three in as many days. Anyone and everyone (kids, parents and kids-at-heart) will thoroughly enjoy reading these books.

Keep 'em comin, J.K.Rowling!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure magic","review":"This unforgettable novel penetrates every corner of the imagination. The characters brilliantly come to life, and the plot is as original as anything I've ever read. The element of magic is introduced slowly, giving the reader time to become familar with it and therefore focus on more important components of this incredible story. There is an absolutely thrilling climax where Harry and his friends face a frightening villan. Quite a few moral lessons are given, but not in a preachy way. This is a must read, even for the poor people who don't enjoy children's fantasy. It is already a true classic, and hopefully will be remembered as one of the greatest children's books of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reasons to read Harry Potter and the Socerer's Stone","review":"I think Harry Potter and the socerer's stone is a excellent imaginative book about a boy who goes to a school to teach him magic.

Rowling is a very good author"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great First Act","review":"I may be the last person to have read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I have seen the first two movies, but have decided to read all of the books before watching any other movies. I am upset that I have seen the first two movies now because the first book seemed a lot better. I spent too much time comparing the book to the movie, but liked that the story had more characters and I felt Rowling did a nice job of connecting them all. I feel I will like all the books as good as or better than this one. I definitely recommend Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where we meet are good friends","review":"The start of the long series is great.

Well, Im glad a friend gave me a copy thinking I might enjoy it. I definitely did.While this isnt my usual reading material, it reminded me a lot of a series I enjoyed as a child by Piers Anthony. Those books also revolved around a land ruled by magic. In the Potter series the land is replaced by a school, Hogwarts, but it's otherwise similar in style.Rawlings did a wonderful job of describing the terrible living conditions Harry had while living with his aunt and uncle and the thrill he experienced while first exploring his new life at Hogwarts.While it was fun reading this, people older than 14 might find some of it a little childish but, hey, the target for this series were children in the first place. Approach it in the right spirit and you'll have as much fun as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Narnia for the next generation","review":"I love this book, it's been so long since we had a book out that kids couldn't wait to read. I can't wait to read this book to my kids one day. If you want to read a book that will make you hope that there is a school that teaches magic out there this is it. If you want to see good fight evil this is the book for you and if you just want to escape grab this book and read it!! Also I'm really big on reading this book with your kids you'll both love it and the myths and history that you can talk to the kids about is a great subject to expand learning"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who says it's just a \\"children's\\" story? :-)","review":"I haven't been classified as a teen for about 10 years now, and am just amazed by how much I have enojoyed this series!

You'll be awfully glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unusual boy.","review":"Harry Potter was an average boy, so he thought. Harry had been living with his aunt, uncle, and his pudgy annoying cousin, Dudly. Harry was told that his father and mother were killed in a car accident. But all that is about to change when Harry discovers that he is one of the most powerful wizards of all time. The author, J.K. Rowling, truly has written a classic tale of good versus evil. This is Rowlings first book. If this book sounds interesting to you, try it. But even if it doesn't, or even if you don't like good versus evil themes, try it. Harry Potter is a must for all ages. I don't like to read, but this is the best book I've ever read. \\" Harry Potter should run for president.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"An AWESOME read for any age","review":"I have heard the book was out-of-this world.

Nesitt books, etc. It was a nice enough story but I found it disjointed and full of distracting cliches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not revolutionary, not award-winning, but cute...","review":"I wonder if the big fanfare about the Harry Potter books is due to us Americans having little experience with the light/humorous fantasy books more prevalent in the UK, both adult and juvenile. I can't help but feel Rowling was influenced greatly by other authors, possibly even the hilariously clever Terry Pratchett. I like the books, but they are not, as some have decided, revolutionary in juvenile literature. I would hope this might encourage readers to expand their vision to those like C.S. Lewis, Douglas Adams, and other British writers of fantasy. Additionally, it's a downer that Harry is repeatedly placed in bad situations where the numerous authority figures to which he's entrusted at school either don't care, can't be trusted, are unbelievably unfair. Adults love these book, yes, but are actual kids comfortable with them?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fabulous adventure!","review":"The three Harry Potter books I have just read are AWESOME! I read the entire first book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerers, in one day, the next book in two days, and the last in three. I mean it when I say: I couldn't put it down! I wait for more books. Hopefully more will be published soon enough. The story of Harry Potter is addictive, and I recommend it to everyone who appreciates magic. It is a very enjoyable tale-Go read it! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Candy, but more expensive and less unhealthy","review":"If you are the type who enjoys reading fluff for fun, you should almost certainly get _Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone_. Even if you are not generally a fluff reader, be aware that this is particularly good fluff. The characters are quite flat, the hero unlikely and his choices frustrating, but the book itself is quite enjoyable. The imagery is excellent and the plot, while simple, interesting. There is just enough of a twist at the end to catch the reader off guard. Rowling does not spend much time on the specifics of spell casting or explain much of the structure in her magical world, but for some people this would be unwanted background material. This also gives a more lighthearted tone, so if you like the comprehensiveness and gravity of the _Dragonlance_ saga, you might be a bit dissappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very fun read","review":"This book is a fun, easy read for all ages.

It was definitely up to expectation ,and made me realize why it is so popular . Also , the style of writing and the build-up of the story reminds me of an author ( in Bengali ) , whose writings have a similar flavor . For Bengali readers , who have read and liked Shirshendu Mukhopadhdhay : This reminds me of 'Monoj'der adbhut bari ' , 'Gonsai baganer bhut' , and a few more .

I thought the book was indeed fast-paced and had a balanced plot with all of the facets coming together in a satisfying way.However, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone didn't blow my mind. I thought it was good, but not unbelievably good. The books I read by Lois Lenski, Cynthia Voigt, and Judy Blume were as fresh, vigorous, and funny as this Harry Potter book, and in my opinion, more so.With the remainder of the series to read, I hope I do fall in love with the series like many adults and children have.Incidentally, I would love to see Ms. Rowling feature a female protagonist in her next series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book ever","review":"This is the kind of book that anyone can read, regardless of age or personality.

Always a great read and always highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry, but I didn't like it.","review":"I tried to like this book, I really did. I thought to myself \\"Billions of people can't be wrong.\\". But well, as it comes to me, I didn't like it. The plot is boring, and the first 100 pages are so boring that I can't really understand how someone can get through them. I personaly believe that a big part of its sucsses, at least from what I saw in Israel, is publicity and commercials. Half a year before it arrived to Israel there were commercials to it anywhere. If you bought a book, it said on the bag: \\"Have you read Harry Potter yet?\\", and there were signs about it anywhere. I even saw an interview with a critisizer that praised the book, and then mistakebly admitted that she didn't read it.I can't really understand what is all the excitment around this book. It is, in my opinion, after I forced myself to end it, an average book, if not worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost good","review":"A word of warning should be given by those who recommend this book to grown-ups. It's a book for children and should be read a such. The book is written in a clear and simple style using numerous cliches of fantasy. Ideal for kids, but too obvious for my taste. I gave it to stars instead of three as it kept me hoping that the fun would start on the next page, which never happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fat kids getting picked on because of this book","review":"I am a girl in high school, and my little brother told me a story about what happened in his sixth grade, where everyone is totally hooked on this series. There are a few fat kids in his class, and he says that everyone mocks them and calls them \\"Dudleys\\" because the fat character in Harry Potter, who is really mean, is named Dudley. I think the author should have showed more sensitivity. Does anyone else agree? What if the mean kid was black or Jewish or Mexican? Everyone would have gotten really mad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as Star Wars...","review":"This book is cute and funny. At the end of the book you end up cheering for Harry, Neville, Ron, and Hermione. The characters are witty and very much alive to the imagination.

She's an amazing writer with such depth and a remarkable ability to see the world in the eyes of the children who will read and love this book just as I have. You don't even realize it but as you are reading this book there is this certain love you begin to have for each of the main characters (Harry, Ron, Hermione) and a certain loathing for the bad guys (Professor Snape, Draco Malfoy).

When I started reading it my mind changed immedeatly! I couldn't put it down! I loved how the author used big words I couldn't understand that led to big adventures that would get you so absorbed that you thought you were actually in thet book.

This is the first book of the series, and one of the best. It's a great story with the appropriate amounts of humor, mysticism, and adventure to awaken the spirits of a mature man or woman and perhaps even put some wonder back into our lives. It was a great break from the overly serious stuff that I usually read. I was not too happy about making J.K. Rowling even richer when I purchased the book (used), but she did create a great series. There are plenty of used copies around these days and I am sure the book is also readily available in the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Note to the Christian Reader","review":"I started reading this book to my daughter book before it became controversial in Christian circles and I was drawn into the story. I have now read every book in the series. This book is well worth the acclaim it has received. I know that many Christians have heard terrible things about this book, but they are untrue. I found this book to he a touching story about a little boy to whom I greatly relate. I understand that there is magic and wizardry in the book, but I personally found it no more objectionable than what I found in Tolkein or C.S. Lewis. Although the book does not have the Christian symbolism of \\"Lord of The Rings\\" or \\"Chronicles of Narnia,\\" it still is a great story of a boy who is shunned for being different and overcomes adversity. A good lesson for anyone.

Harry is kind, considerate to others, humble, and genuinely cares for the underdog (he knows how it feels), and never tries to save his own skin by turning his back on a friend. My kids begged \\"just one more chapter\\" till the book was over. Finally, my 17 yr old was too anxious to wait for me to read, so read the next two books in the series in 3 days! This book is a non-stop page turner for kids and adults alike. Our Family LOVES Harry Potter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful wonderful...","review":"Harry Potter is a fantastic book. Full of story, imagination and it keeps you turning the page. I was hooked within the first chapter. The book brought me back to being a child...with an open mind and saying out loud 'wow' simply by getting lost in the Hogwarts and magic, wizardry world. When one grows up, I think one losses the simpleness of imagination and where it can take us.This is a book for children AND adults and I recommend the book for all. J.K. Rowling did wonderful job with well written books. And these books will be made for history for generations to come...I cannot wait until I get into book #2, 3 &4 and then when books #5, 6, & 7 comes out. I look forward to other books from Rowling as well..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very imaginative and creative book, great for all ages.","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the most unbelievable and phenomenal book I have ever read. Once you start it, you won't be able to put it down. This is one great ride great for kids and adults alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was great!","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcers Stone has a great setting, problem and events. You go through awesome parts like when Harry had to help take care of an dragon without anyone knowing! When I read the book there was so many parts that lead me to keep reading. I recomend it to anyone! The other book called Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is also a great book! I bought it and I loved it. READ THE BOOKS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Storytelling!","review":"Jim Dale does a fun and incredible job as narrator of the Harry Potter books. After listening to Sorcerer's Stone I immediately picked up the rest of the series. I admire how he comes up with different accents for the many characters. I even ordered the UK version from ..., and nice as those are, I think Jim Dale's version takes the cake - or pumpkin pasties!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece","review":"I've often prided myself on being on top of trends...however, I was so far behind the times on the whole Harry Potter \\"thing\\" that I'm alost ashamed to admit it. Oh well. I saw the incredible film version and realized...wait...the book is always better than the movie (and this case it was). I had to see what the excitement was all about. I can't possibly say anything new or original about this book, except to say when you fall for the Harry Potter gang, you fall forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"What else it there to say?","review":"This is a fantastic book. I resisted purchasing it because it was a childrens book, but I am glad I finally broke down. I was sitting in the airport waiting for my next flight and found it in one of the little book stores. It absolutly blew me away. Sometimes I wonder where people come up with their subject matter. This story is creative, imaginative, and leaves you wanting more. Lucky for me the next three books were already out when I finished this one, so I purchased them right away. I think everyone should read these stories, it brings you back to being a kid again and what could be better than that?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as fun and thrilling as the movies","review":"I saw the movie series before reading any of the books. I look forward to reading more adventures of Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Great fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, entertaining, and loads of fun","review":"I know I'm late to arrive on the Harry Potter bandwagon, but I couldn't find platform 9 3/4. In all seriousness though, I was hesitant to begin reading this series when it first came out, as I enjoy carrying my books in my purse and the Harry Potter books were too cumbersome to do as such. However, my recent purchase of a Kindle and the availability of the series in e-reader format gave the perfect opportunity. After finishing book one in less than two days, I can see that I will be continuing and finishing the entire series in no time. More than anything, I am excited to watch each film after finishing the book to compare and find similarities. I already see in this first novel where the movie stated relatively true to the text, rather than adding or indulging the author's truth. Can't wait to read more! Book two, here I come."},{"rating":"1","title":"too long and boring","review":"I found the Harry Potter series to be ok, but for me it went on too long, and the series could have been pared down a little. The first book was fairly entertaining, with all the magical scenes taking place at Hogwarts, and there was some nice humor and interesting characters, but it all became a little bland after awhile. For a much better read, I recommend Roderick Blackwood and the Demon Stone by Ralph Rathbone. It's very entertaining and basically has all the boring bits taken out, so it's an exciting read from start to finish. You get the sense sometimes that Rowling knew she had to fill up numerous books, so things drag on a bit. In Roderick Blackwood and the Demon Stone, things don't drag at all, and it's non-stop magical action which keeps you wanting to turn the page and find out what happens next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought","review":"Front cover was extremely creased and wrinkled. I expected it to be in better condition for the rating it was given."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of surprises, but a slow beginning.","review":"This book was entertaining because many of the plot events took me by surprise. However, the beginning really dragged and it took a long time for me to get into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent! READ THIS BOOK!","review":"I am a 26-year old college student (elem. education), and I must say that the Harry Potter books are great. They are exciting, hard to put down and very easy to read - yet they are also extremely appealing to people of all ages. These books are destined to become classics and Harry Potter will always remain in a special place in my heart reserved for special storybook characters. If you enjoyed these books and are aching for more, I recommend The Neverending Story by Michael Ende, the Wizard of Oz books by L. Frank Baum, The Narnia Chronicles by CS Lewis, Ella Enchanted by Gail Carson Levine, or anything by Roald Dahl. Beverly Cleary and Judy Blume books are also great, although they are a different style than Harry Potter."},{"rating":"2","title":"harry potter & the sorcerer's stone - book 1","review":"i truely enjoyed this book i too could not put it down - i was wondering what all the fuss was all about when i first heard about this book now i know - i put myself in the book as someone standing out of view every where harry and he friend - i really enjoyed the description of the school harry attended - i said this book would be a great movie and that i would be in line with all the kids to see it if ever became a movie - which i just heard it will - i am currently reading book 2 with book 3 waiting in the wings - best to belive book 3 won't be waiting long hurray for harry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely good!","review":"J.K. Rowling is always at her best. Every book has been amazing. This one is more of an introduction to the wizarding world, and the characters as well. I think it was very smart on Rowling's part to do somewhat of an introduction but still have an intriguing story to follow. No, the story was not as good as the other books have, but its absolutely fine in my opinion. An intro is an awesome idea to let your readers get to know the world and characters personally, and also to get them yearning for the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book ever","review":"This book is encredble don't listen to the punks who hated it . I loved it, it is my favorite book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book and you will love to read it.","review":"I strongly sugest this book the book of a boy who is sent to live with his aunt and uncle And their spoiled brat dudley. He never knows that he is a wizard and he never knew his parents were wizards until one day he is sent to a special place. For what that place is and how he gets there is right in the book he also meets some friends and goes on exciting adventures. and allways watch out for voldemort. He might kill you like he killed Harrys parents!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wizards & Witches are weird.","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcere's Stone by J.K. Rowling was a good book. It was the longest book I've ever read. The whole wizard and witch thing was very fascinating. In this book there were many exiting adventures. Because Harry and his friends were always being nosey, they got into a lot of trouble. Hagrid, Harry's gamekeeper, was sort of watching over him. There are many lessons I've learned by reading this book. One of them is, not to play with magic because if you do you might find yourself in trouble. Reading it may take a while but it's worth it. All of the characters are very unique and weird. Some of them have names I couldn't pronounce. This book kept me on the edge of my seat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"so-so","review":"I have honestly seen better books. I love fantasy, but the old classics really reign supreme over today's stuff.

Whatever."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book of the century!","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is great for all ages! It is truly the best book of the century!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for anyone who's still a kid at heart","review":"I received this book as a present for my 30th birthday, and completely and utterly enjoyed it. Most days, I spend my time reading about the law, which tends to grind thoughts of wizards, dragons, and flying broomsticks out of the imagination. This book served as a wonderful diversion from an otherwise awful week at work, and I am grateful to its author. I'll be reading the lot of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb but why did they change the title?","review":"This is a wonderful book for children and adults alike. Anyone who has been through the English Public (i.e. private) School System will identify with many of the jokes. BUT WHY was the title changed for the American market? The book's UK title is \\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\\". Is the US public too stupid to be able to handle that title? In any event there is no such item in mythology/alchemy as a \\"Sorcerer's Stone.\\" We are insulted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for kids!","review":"We started reading this book as \\"Family Time\\" but I was soon hooked. This is a book for all ages. It revived the imagination I had lost"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical and Comical (KH #3)","review":"Harry Potter and the Socerer's Stone was, I must say, one of the best books that I have ever read. This was defineately a page turner. There was never a dull moment. I would stay up have the night just to see what was going to happen next. If a book that was written for kids can keep an adults interest, it is definately a winner. JK Rowling has a brilliant imagination to be able to write such amazing literature. She is writing seven of these books, so far I have read the four she has released. These books get better and better as you go on. From the first chapter of book #1 I was enchanted with the way Mrs. Rowling's mind worked. Although I have read many books, I would be willing to read this one over and over again. Everytime I read it, a new message or interesting secret is dicovered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, but listen to samples by Stephen Fry before going with Jim Dale","review":"Well, This book and the whole Harry Potter Series is excelent, I love them. I'm currently thinking if I want to get the last Audio Books before the movies. I love the movies but books will always be better (although the first three movies I think are almost as good as the books). I did not give this 5 stars because I've heard the Audio Books by Stephen Fry (not sure if the spelling is right ;-P ). I have to say, in my humble opinion, Fry's voice is more grown up as a narrator and his character voices are excellent. His voice sounds over all more respectfull and apropiate. Jim Dale has done his version for the american audience which doesn't mean it's bad, but I like things in their original state. If a movie is made in the US, England, Mexico, or Spain, I usualy prefer it as it came out first. But that is my opinion. Listen to a sample of the Audio Book by each of the readers before you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Wizard Book","review":"I loved reading Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone because of all the drama and suspense. Also, it gives kids a chance to see a story from a wizard's point of view.Harry at first doesn't even know that he's a wizard, a very famous one at that. Hagrid, the keeper of keys at Hogwarts, comes and gets Harry and takes him to Gringotts to get some of his money, get supplies for school like robes and such, and then Harry is off to Hogwarts on the train on Platform Nine and Three Quarters.Even though what happens in the book could never happen in the real world, it's fun to pretend. You get tangled in the pages of the book and never want to put the book down. I recommend this book to kids with BIG imaginations!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review for Miss O","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a book about an 11 year old wizard named Harry. The only thing is Harry doesn't know he is a wizard until the Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Hagrid, tells Harry that he was accepted into Hogwarts. While at Hogwarts, Harry discovers that the Sorcerer's Stone is being kept there and someone is after it. Harry and his two friends, Ron and Hermione, must work together to try to stop who ever is after the Stone. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a book full of magic and fantasy. It is the kind of book that can keep you on the edge of your seat and you never want it to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter Explodes","review":"When Harry hit the American market, the U.S. fell in love. Everyone from age 8 to 100 will enjoy these books. Each and every age group can delight in the books on a different level. They are phenomenal! I can't wait for #5. I plan to reread this series many many times. Each excursion results in more fun and more interesting ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book in the Dahl tradition","review":"This is a wonderful story, for kids or adults. Wonderful story and characters. I read this after my 10 year old daughter insisted and she was right. This weekend, I plan to read the Chamber of Secrets!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter is a must-read for ANY AGE!!!!!","review":"Okay, so I'm not in the age group that these books are targeted to, but as a teacher, I thought I'd better pick up the book that so many students were talking about. This book was truly one of the most interesting and funny books that I've ever read. As Harry goes through his daily life, the reader becomes involved to the point where one does not want to put the book down. It is thrilling and will keep you reading until the very end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful - Except for ...........","review":"This was a very delightful book even for an adult. It caught my interest right away and once I started it I had to hurry and finish it. However, I do have one issue that struck me and I must say I was not very pleased. Being basically a \\"children's\\" book, she used the word \\"damn\\". Now, I know that it was NOT necessary to have this type of language in this book. If I were to let a child that I know read it, I would have to scratch through that word or any of those type of words she may use in future books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone","review":"Although the last two books were good, the best out of them all, the best one is the sorcerer's Stone.

Every time i left i came back and read Thanks for making this book i can't wait to read the other six!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for adults too","review":"I found this book utterly charming. J.K. Rowling is a creative storyteller that kept this adult interested all the way through. A good, quick read for a long flight (which is what I bought it for). I'd forgotten what fun a child's adventure story can be. I was enchanted from the moment Harry Potter selected his magic wand and was on his way to Hogswarts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cleverly written book","review":"J.K. Rowlings has written a clever mix of all my favourite school girl stories ( The St.Clare's/Mallory Towers series of Enid Blyton), hints of Tolkien, C.S.Lewis, and even Roald Dahl. It's a pity that not many kids seem to read these authors in these days, but better that they fall for Harry Potter than not live in a book-induced haze of sorts at all.( What a wonderful feeling, at any age!) She has effectively replaced some of the more dated concepts with a veneer of modern references and even political correctness ( boy with dreadlocks, Parvati Patil(! ) etc., etc.) But the basic appeal of the story remains the same as many great stories -- The triumph of the under-dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who cares how old you are...Harry Rocks!","review":"As a 21 year old cynic, I couldn't believe my friends when they started babbling on about some childrens book.

I broke down and bought it, expecting a very 'basic' read.What a suprise! The visual imagery is wonderful and our protaganist is a very identifiable character.If a parent is looking for a book to interest their young child in the joy of reading, I would direct you to this book.(Am I the only one that thinks there's more to Hagrid than's being let on?)Oh by the way. . .I'm 'over 40' and a banker.Read this book/Read this book to your child!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter Books","review":"This one got me hooked on the series with my god daughters.

I am a James Patterson (mystery novelist) fan, mostly his Alex Cross books. I have never read a fantasy book but love science fiction movies and most fantasy movies, esp Lord of the Rings. But I just cannot read a fantasy book. I have trouble remembering all of the weird names and become confused and never get beyond the first chapter usually. I did purchase Lord of the Rings and never read it, I sold it on Amazon.com as a matter of fact.But the Harry Potter books have me totally excited and I have my neighbor hooked on them, as well - both of us grown women! And I really, really think J.K. Rowling is a classy woman who knows how to relate to kids....kids of all ages.....even 48 y/o kids.I feel there are many people who may be missing out on great reads who continue to think these are \\"kids books\\" - their loss!

The Villians are awesome,( name one reader who dosen't get a prickel of fear every time Voldemort's name is mentioned), it's got magic,adventure,mystery,bravery,charecter,and loylaty.It leaves you longing for more.

If you are gettingsick and tired of seeing your kids wasting their time in front of the telivision, Nintendo 64, or the computer, then you will LOVE this book. The characters are original and amusing, the plot uplifting and intresting, and the book in general is GREAT! In fact my 17 year old daughter actually read it and admited that even she liked it! And please do not believe those shameful rumors that the book is Satanic and that children who read it will start worshiping the devil. That's rubish!

Rowling brings back memories of C.S. Lewis, Roald Dahl, & also those old-fashioned but brilliant books about life & adventures in english boarding houses. A \\"struggling single mother\\" (as the book cover mentions) turns out to be a great talent, & the Harry Potter books are destined to become children classics. The first book in the series was not only exciting & extremely imaginative. It was, most importantly, very very funny, & all in all, a rare treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"When I first read this book 12 years ago, I was all of 12 years old. I'd never really been into books at that point in my life, but apparently my mom thought that that ought to change. One night, a copy of this book showed up on my nightstand, with a note saying that this book was apparently quite popular with boys my age. Reluctantly, I began to read it, and was unexpectedly sucked in to a world of magic the likes of which I'd never quite imagined. I churned through it quickly, and read it several times over, eagerly anticipating the release of the next book.As much as I enjoyed it, when I learned that my girlfriend hadn't yet shared the experience, I decided to buy her a copy for Christmas. She recently finished it, and now I'm rereading it. Gotta say, the book's just as good as I remember it being all those years ago.. I would recommend it to anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is something that I would have loved to have read as a kid, and something that I love reading now. I just finished this first book and look forward to reading the later books in the series.The story and characters are quirky and interesting. I found the plot of this first book very reminiscent of one of my favorite movies, Star Wars. Think of Harry Potter as Luke Skywalker, raised by his aunt and uncle, unaware of his true potential until the right circumstances invite him to take a step into a larger world.This desire to make more of ourselves and to come in full contact with the magic that we intuitively sense around us is universal to all human beings. It's no wonder that this book and these characters have become so immensely popular. This is a book that can be enjoyed by readers of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a sad world","review":"I think that it is a sad sad thing that people are trying to censor this book. I have heard that it contains evil things such as witchcraft and that it was violent and awful book. It was said to teach children witchcraft and sorcery and I find that to be pure BS (bullsnot). The Harry Potter books teach a child only one thing and that is to use his or her imagination, and when that becomes something to be censored I will be ready to move to Antartica. I believe that the Harry Potter book is something to be treasured for the fact that it challenges a child to look at things from their point of view, something that they need to do more often. I believe that these are wonderful books. And if they are to be pulled from the shelves you best keep pulling because I have seen plenty of books that are better candidates for cenorship than these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the sorcerer's stone","review":"Well it really gets exciting when the main character, Harry Potter, gets many letters to hogwarts school of witch craft and wizardry. He lives with his aunt and uncle because his parents were killed.I can't tell you how because that will kill the story. he does end up going to school and he makes new friends.Then the three of them meet a man named hadgrid. Hadgrid then tells Harry how he got the scare on his forhead and how his parents died but you have to read to find out. Then Harry makes the school quidditch team and he is the seeker.Then the kids find out about a sorcerer's stone in the school and... find out if you read this book.My opion on this book is that it has the best descriptions.I would also recommend this book to anyone who likes action,excitment,and drama. Read this book today!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome read!","review":"I think that the first Harry Potter book is a blast. It is a great begining to a wonderful story about a small boy losing his parents to a dark wizard and his mishappenings at his Aunt and Uncle's house and at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

We ended up buying the cassette, and reading the book a long with the audio tape. This made it much more pleasant to read, but it is not the most economical way to enjoy the story. Next time we may just go for the tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderul Mystical Excitement","review":"This is a terrific book. My six year old didn't want me to put the book down and to be honest I didn't want to put it down. Very enjoyable and never boring. Why anyone wants to ban this book is beyond me.

The book was easy to read, but that detail didn't stop me from staying up until the wee hours of morning satiating my hunger to unravel the mystery. I love the book because it mixes wizardry and adventures with some reality of school life. Even my big sister, who doesn't even read school novels for class just because they're boring and doesn't read that much of fantasy books, loved this book. The series is worth a read for anyone creative who wants to experience a whole new world of reality and make-believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTE MUST READ!","review":"Just as my heading indicates, this book is one of the best fantasy novels I read in my life. Even though some might consider this novel as immature and childish, you will have to check that again!...this book is made to enjoy from children to adults, and all would definitely enjoy it. J.K. Rowling is a marvelous and creative author for sure. He reminds me of Roald Dahl's type of writing in which the words try to create imaginary shapes through one's minds.I was able to read all four of the series, and each one is good as the other. So, if you started reading Part I, you can be sure to continue on with the next three books. Again, a book definitely worth to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!!!","review":"harry potter's books are the best! i had never been interested in reading a book before! i used to hate reading until this book came to my hands. it is awesome. at the beggining, i was not interested because i used to say that by watching the movie was enough, but i was wrong!! i started by reading the first pages thinking that i was not going to be able of finishing it, but byu the contrary, i read it really fast. at nights, i could not stop reading. it was like a sort of magic that pulled me to keep on reading until i finished it! then, i had to run to get the second book, and the thierd and then the fourth! and i am so impatient to read the fifth book!, i cannot wait anymore! thinking that i am going to have to wait until this coming june to read the fifth it's killing me! i really apreciate the imagination of this excellent woman that entartain not only kids but adults by writing these books and hope she can continue doing it!!

She said she can't stop reading i,t because it is a great book. We just finished the second book and we are now reading the 3rd. I think the author is very creative, beacause she has a good imaganation.

From trying to struggle with school that he didn't even know of till lately to trying to find out what is hidden on the third floor of the Hogwart's school, Harry Potter goes on unbelievabe journeys through magic.

It is the best book I have ever read, even over the other Harry Potter books. The plot in this book is wild and crazy...what seems like the impossible comes true, and this book has the coolest characters, like Harry, Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, Professor Dumbeldore, and Lord Voldemort. And it's great how even outside of the main plot, there seems to be many small plots the characters engage in, which is very good so you are not stuck with the same old plot during the whole book. It's also neat how nearly everything in the book is totally different than anything we know, like wands, cauldrons, spells, even stones that can give you life forever. I love this book and recommend it to absolutely anybody! Thank you for reading my review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Kids","review":"I bought this book for my 12 year old and he loves it (of course not as much as my 5 year old likes The Wild Cookie, but that's not really fair).For kids learning to read and avid readers alike, this is a great book.

He also has all sorts of adventures at the school in which he was accepted to. There is never a dull moment in this story, there is always someone causing trouble or amusing magic that the children have to try to perform in thier class. For example, the kids have to turn one thing into something else for an exam. Almost around every turn there are other mythical animals around that get involved in the plot like centaurs, dragons and unicorns. This book is entertaining and easy reading, to which makes the book almost impossible to put down. For those who love fantasy and science fiction books, this would be a good book for them to read at any age."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a magical read","review":"I loved this book and I am an adult!

I see no reason at all to ban these books from shelves. You can identify with the characters in many ways. The situations are very real. It deals with real problems such as school and friendships,courage and knowing who you are. To ban these books is denying our children,our future, a wonderful work of litearature.

I read it to find out if the \\"witchcraft\\" would be a problem for my kids (we are Christians). This book falls under the genre of The Lord of the Rings; although it is much more simplistic. Rowling keeps the characters simple and the plot simple, but she provides a few twists and turns that are not expected. I'd recommend it for kids - and us old folks as well - who enjoy fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another adult breaks down....","review":"and buys this book!! I'd resisted for several years, & didn't go to the movie when it was in theaters. Then, during a long hot weekend of a business trip, I ordered this movie up on the hotel tv... and if the movie was that good (with some of my favorite Brit actors), I just HAD to go find the book!This excellent series is very engaging for all readers who like a good adventure that also gently reminds us how one should behave towards others. I hope to share these volumes with my children as they grow in hopes they will appreciate them as well.Well-written, just scary enough for the kids, and with fun for all!

But Stephen Fry's reading is 1000x better!","review":"The HP books are a great deal of fun, and it's hard to imagine anything else I could say about them that hasn't been said ten thousand times already.I do however want to say something about the *Audiobooks.* For reasons beyond my ken, Amazon.com does not let you know that there is an infinitely better version than this available, read by the delightful Stephen Fry. According to J.K. Rowling, her daughter listens to the (Fry) audiobooks constantly. Stephen Fry's gorgeous voice is a pleasure any time, but these books give him grand scope for mimicry and vocal characterization.Choosing to record a new version of these books for an American audience when Stephen Fry has already so brilliantly done them is perverse in its idiocy. Don't bother with this version; go over to Amazon.co.uk and buy the real thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pottermore is a SCAM","review":"So I decide to buy this book for my kindle because I enjoyed the series and I'm directed to the \\"Pottermore\\" site and they force you to accept cookies into your computer, which is essentially a virus, before you can purchase.

Potential wasted.","review":"If the alleged hero of the story acted even =remotely= heroic, instead of reacting to things happening to him with an \\"okay, sure\\" tone, it might have saved this book. Accent on the might, there. Picked it up purely because the the hype, and only forced myself to finish the thing just to see if the author ever figured out how to write a lead character that did something other than react to everything going on around him. Rowling didn't. The fish-out-of-water concept backfires, in that the only time Harry's actually out of his element is in the opening chapters with his Muggle family. He's perfectly at home and pretty comfortable at Hogwart's, which is a true waste of story potential. The supporting cast are far more interesting and well-developed as characters than Harry, and I'd actually seek out a book with Hermione or Hagrid. Unfortunately, they're not lead characters. I can't find myself caring enough about Harry to read book 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and Sorcerer's Stone was a terrific book .","review":"I thought Harry Potter and Sorcerer's Stone was a terrific book because every page was a new adveture.

Think about it: the only exception is Professor Snape, the Potions teacher Harry has prejudice against.And it also leaves some questions. Why would perfect Albus Dumbledore let \\"bad\\" kids join the school when they might commit crimes there (i.e., students like Voldemort)? And why would snakes side with Voldemort in symbolism and literalism (you find this out in the later books), simply because he's evil!?!In fact, I don't see what's to like about the book (in terms of things that I like): Snake prejudice (HOW COULD anyone!?!?!), witchcraft, geeks like Ron Weasley as perfect brats!?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sent me wrong book","review":"they sent me the wrong book. though order has correct title. from reading other reviews, i see this has happened to other customers also"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool","review":"Really great book. great vocabulary used in the text. good plot line. ron weasley was very funny in several ways. over all,great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"damaged book","review":"i bought Harry potter, and about 30 pages in the middle of the book is binding poorly. even some sentences are missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Horrible","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone was the worst book ever, or one of the worst.

Hagrid brings Harry to Hogwarts, a famous witchcraft and wizardry school. While there, Harry meets two of his new best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. Together, they go on a quest to find the sorcerer's stone, locked in the midst of Hogwarts...This is one of my most favorite book series. It has everything I like. Such as magic, mystery, fear and adventure! This is a famous book series, and it is also made it to theaters. I have watched all the movies, too.

For example, at least three times in this book, malevolent characters sneer at Harry Potter that his parents died violent deaths and that they deserved it. This in my mind is not fare for eight years olds. It is fairly violent and scary reading for youngsters.

With Harry's limited wizarding skills, can he do it? It is a test of courage, and the support of his newly found friends.

This book was excellent and I applaud the author for writing such a fantastic novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the movie","review":"There aren't many things the movie left out, but those things add depth. It's amazing what a little back story on the Dursleys can add to the overall story. Also, a few words on Hermione realizing an important life lesson changes her character for me, and I like her better for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry potter and the sorcerers stone","review":"Harry potter and the sorcerers stone very good again loved it like I read it for the first time great"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really, REALLY good book!","review":"I loved this book.

He did an incredible job, keeping all the characters quite individual and recognizable. We look forward to hearing all the books. I want to own the books in the print version, but I've heard so much about differences in the British and American versions that I don't know if it changes the content. I might want the originals - but I don't know enough to make a decision."},{"rating":"2","title":"!!!!","review":"I choose this rating because it is .

Highly recommended to fantasy readers and for people who love those \\"magical\\" books :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful children's book, but......","review":"I enjoyed reading this book, but I fail to see how it can quite reach #4 (or thereabouts) in the Millennium pole. JK Rowling's writing reminds me of Enid Blyton's (a favourite of mine when I was a child). Older readers should look elsewhere for more meaty reading satisfaction (any of the SF classics should do the trick).Having said that, am happy that children are turning to books because of Mr. Potter!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not deeply imaginative","review":"I had hoped, given the reviews I read, that this would be a book great for bedtime reading to my two sons. I bought the book and started to read at night. I had a hard time keeping interested. And my sons lost interest shortly into the book. Just not a lot of new characters or story line to speak of. Seems to be a lot of rehashing of other better written books. Dialog of characters very elementary. And I know this is a kids book, but not too much stimulating converstation. I am sorry that I seem to be an outsider in my opinion of this book, but I think my standard for \\"great book\\" might be a tad bit different than prior reviewers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry potter and the sorcerers stone","review":"This book is good because it shows fantastic friendship and lots of courage it shows how much friendship can grow in a person"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written book","review":"I was curious to see how much the movie differed from the book and was surprised to see that it didn't by too much.

Once you started you can not stop reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic fun to read","review":"This book was great fun to read, and is one of those rarities that can appeal to young and old. I have read the entire series to date and have enjoyed each one. I hope that Ms. Rowling will continue the series and give us more Harry Potter to enjoy long after he has left Hogwart's School.I recently saw a news item on TV regarding a town in New Mexico where some of the citizens were protesting and burning Harry Potter books because they felt promoted the devil. I feel so sorry that these people aren't able to separate fantasy from reality. And if they were able to understand that concept, can't they see that Harry Potter tales embody the classic story of the triumph of good over evil?This series of books is a must for anyone that wants to experience a simple, wonderful, fantasy world with unforgetable characters and imaginative stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll read it to my children","review":"The Harry Potter books are the best books I've read in my life. Last year, I was feeling ill and had stayed home from school all week and was getting bored. My mother, fed up with my whining, went out and bought me the first Harry Potter book. That certainly stopped my boredom. I read it twice that day and since then I have bought the next two book and read them all at least ten times. The first chapter or two were quite confusing, and at first I thought it wouldn't be that good. But once Harry got to Hogwarts, the story improved immensly and I couldn't put it down. The books all have excellent plots, you never know what is going to happen next. There are secret meanings everywhere which adds to the charm. The books, especiallly the third one, are so fantastic that I wonder if Rowling can go even better. This is a great book and I'll read it to my children."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Review of the Book Harry Potter by John Bostaph","review":"The book Harry Potter was one of the best books I have ever read.This book had action,comedy,and magic.The characters in the book came alive to me.The book described a boy ,how went to a magic school and learned about magic.This book was so good that they are now making a movie on it.I would recommend this book to everyone how likes magic,adventure,and action. Some people said this book is witch craft. This book is perfact for everyage in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly great!","review":"This book surprised me as to how it got my attention and kept it.

Perhaps one of the greatest of all time! Long live Harry potter."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Adventure to lighten the heart","review":"I picked up this book because of the title. Magic is the food that sustains the young at heart. After coming across the article about J. K. Rowling in a recent issue of \\"People\\" magazine, I doubly wanted to read the book. This book is both adventurous and humorous. The characters of Harry Potter, and his friends at Hogworts are lively and enjoyable. The Dursley family are so terrible that they are likeable. I highly recommend this book for evryone from young to old. It's a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry potter and the sorcerer's stone","review":"Fantastic, again. I haven't read the book in years. It was fun to compare against the movie. So many small details I've forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry potter and the sorcerers stone by J.K Rowling","review":"I choose this because it is an awesome book. I like how it is very adventurous and involves magic too. I give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"No, I was going to put 0 stars.","review":"This was one of the best books I ever read. I was so into itthat I finished it in less than a day. I always have found thatHarry's friends are as exciting as he is ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative, but less intriguing than Roald Dahl's books","review":"I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone because I wanted to know why people made a lot of fuss about it. After the first chapter, I understood. It was because the \\"newness\\" and genuine ideas created by J.K. Rowling. Although I was impressed, I don't think it's a \\"must-read\\" book, let alone being the very best seller. Perhaps I'm too old for Harry. The second and third in this series were boring for me as they dwelled on the same theme. The creations (words, scenes, and plots) were no longer catchy. I have to say Ms. Rowling has to prove herself after Harry Potter series end. Anyway, I can't say her books are not great, but my heart is still occupied by the prolific and creative Roald Dahl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\\"s Stone","review":"Very engaging. It was hard to put down. The characters are so well developed. I would recommend this book to anyone that wants to escape into a strange new world were any thing is possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book was ruined.","review":"I received this product and every page was absolutely inundated in unintellegible ink stains. There were no pictures and the kid on the cover looks like an idiot. WHAT DO THE MARKINGS MEAN? I will never purchase any book like this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Potpourri","review":"The book's strength is putting characters from Germanic, Scandinavian, and other European fairy tales into one story and making it readable, and accessible to non-European readers. JKR gets 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT DOES UNABRIDGED MEAN REALLY MEAN?","review":"I ordered this book for a Japanese learner of English who found the finer print of the original edition too daunting. Although the front matter of the large print edition says the original work is unabridged in this edition, it is certainly not the entire original material. I found that to be a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably shouldn't have waited","review":"I'm probably the last person on earth to read the Harry Potter books or watch the movies (or maybe it just seems liked it). Since my kids were excited about the seventh one coming I decided to give it a try. I would have stopped with the first one if these books weren't so hyped. To tell the truth, I'm three books in to the set and struggling.What a disappointment from what I was expecting do to all the raves. I'm thinking I probably shouldn't have waited so long to start these, and also wondering how such poorly written work can be proclaimed as great literature? Give me Roald Dahl or C. S. Lewis anyday and I'll read happily for hours. The same is not true for Harry Potter."},{"rating":"1","title":"false advertising","review":"I had to give one star because there is no such catagory as zero starts, which is what this quack deserves. This product was supposedly a first edition, first print of Harry Potter and the Philospher's Stone. Firstly, it is not a first edition or first print of the book, and secondly, it was large print, which was not advertised. We are very disturbed by the false advertising and plan on returning the book for a full refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"And so it begins...","review":"Harry Potter begins his quest, more or less \\"rescued\\" from his tyrannical and dysfunctional relatives by the good wizards of Hogwart School for Witchcraft/Wizardy, and finds that in the world of wizards he's not just Harry - he's a hero. Along the way, he makes his first real friends, sardonic slacker from a poor family Ron Weasley and studious bookworm Hermione Granger from the Muggle world, and makes enemies with potions teacher Severus Snape and Slytherin creep Draco Malfoy. Oh and it's up to Harry and his friends to save the Philosopher's Stone from the ghostly remnants of Voldemort.Rowling's first tale of Harry Potter and his merry band of miscreants is loaded with humor, action, and suspense. A great introduction followed by the crappy COS which was followed by the superior POA and so on and so forth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent fantasy...?","review":"I had mixed fellings while reading \\"Harry Potter\\".On one hand I felt that this is decent fantasy book with exciting action and shallow meaning. On the other hand it felt like some kind of unhealthy mix of C.S. Lewis' \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\" and Le Guin's \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\". If you are familiar with those books i would not recomend \\"Harry Potter\\" to you, it will feel all too familiar. If you are unfamiliar with the genre of fantasy -- \\"Harry Potter\\" books will give you a nice intoduction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Children's Book I've read lately","review":"I've heard of the Harry Potter mania sweeping across the nation. So I bought this book. I was so amazed at how well written and how well crafted the story was. It's been a long time since I've read a good children's novel , probably since \\"Bridge to Terebithia\\" or the \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\". I don't think that there is anything too violent or bad about the book at all. Evil versus good will always be in any good story. I think it's a great story for children to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The stuff of my childhood..","review":"There is nothing like the Harry Potter series. These books shaped my imagination and ignited my passion for reading. I could identify with Harry as an outsider and Hermione as a bookworm. I could read these books a million times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine fantasy, waiting for more","review":"This is a terrific book deserving at least the four stars I've given it. It kept me reading, particularly because I liked the characters. Some of the situations--the school bully, the Dickensian abusive foster family, the mean teacher--are stock. There is enough good stuff that is a lot of fun--an owl mail system, for instance--to recommend it. I teach fourth grade and I think my students will love it. I plan to read it to them. This just might become a classic, along with Charlotte's Web and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I went right from this book into the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"I still love reading these books! I only wish there were more.....I would highly recommend it to anyone that hasn't read them yet"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!","review":"My mom got this book for my brother to read, but instead I picked it up. It isn't the type of book I would usually read, but I started it, and couldn't put it down! These series of books are very intresting. J.K. Rowling has and exciting imagination, and puts whatever she imagined into the right words. I strongley recommended these series of books for everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love the book!","review":"I'm 11 years old and I'm very picky about my books. I've read a lot of books, all differn't types. From Little Women to Sweet Valley High. But I have never liked fantasy. Then a few monthes ago my mother bought Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I reconized it as a fantasy book and steered clear of it until one rainy day. I was so bored that I picked up the book, I started skimming through it and soon I read the whole book. I loved it! I think I can easily say it is THE best book I have ever read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rowling takes you through Harry Potter's adventures.","review":"I am 10 years old and love to read.

This is a wonderful book with great dialouge that J.K. Rowling wrote very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evil? Pshaw!","review":"While I was reading this book, the thought that it might be evil never entered my mind. It's a wonderful children's story about a young man named Harry Potter who, after being treated horribly by his muggle family, finds happiness and adventure at a school for wizardry. It was an amazing read and I recommend it to anyone. This book will be placed among the classics such as the Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Peter Pan, Alice in Wonderland, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe and the Secret Garden. Evil? Pshaw! This book is as evil as the Wizard of Oz or Glenda the Good Witch."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great story about fantasy and adventure!","review":"I think this is a great book! I am 8 years old and my mom bought this book for me to read. I have been reading chapter books since I was 6 years old. This is far the best I have ever read! I can't wait until she buys me the rest of the Harry Potter series."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! HARRY POTTER TRUIMPHS OVER EVIL AND A ROTTEN FAMILY!","review":"My 7 year-old daughter and I just finished reading HARRY POTTER. We loved it so much we were sad when we finished it. Today, Rosie O'Donnell highly recommended HARRY on her show (for kids and ADULTS--WE AGREE!!!)! EVERYONE'S TALKING ABOUT HARRY. The way Rowling describes Harry and his friends, the reader really gets drawn in and connected to them. Good vs. Evil--and a pig's tail for mean ol' Dudley too--WE LOVED IT!!(Too bad we can't get some broomsticks to fly so we can organize our own Quidditch league!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable","review":"The Harry Potter books are one of my all-time favorite series' for both children and adults. This book, the first one, is no exception. Highly enjoyable. It has a slow start, but a beginning that many in this world can relate too. It opens the minds of the readers and lets them consider possibilities that they'd never thought of before.I won't reveal the plot of this story, but it's good. I will say, though, that it is nothing compared to the books that follow. I honestly think that the Harry Potter books get better and better as they go. In this there were times that it got a bit boring, but not enough to put it down.I would strongly recommend buying this book. I did...you should too. There's a reason it stayed on the New York Times Best Sellers list for so long.Not the best by J.K. Rowling, but still very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the other 3","review":"I really truly enjoyed this book.But i also found some problems with it. it was slow moving, unexciting and not enough focused on the magic as the others. the book is only bad if compared to the other 3, otherwise it is amazing. i have one more bone to pick, i have always liked the inside designs of the books, but until the fourth one the covers made harry look nothing like i imagined him, it made him look to cartoony. keep up with designs like the fourth one."},{"rating":"2","title":"oh, so funnn....","review":"Such a stupid story, BUT so interesting! ... I just cannot put it down. So many neat ideas, the gateway in the station, the wand choose it's master, the all-flavor snacks, the Quiddith contest. I found myself fell into a dreamworld named Hogwarts. It's an imaginary and dream world where good and evil fights, dazzling, flashing, with knighthood."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Harry Potter books are great . I read them 3 times each.","review":"I loved the Harry Potter books. I read them 3 times each. I think these books are good for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"It may not be the Wheel of Time, but it's GREAT!","review":"Harry Potter. Normal enough, no? If it was the title, one might think that it's a boring book, about boring things. Can you say \\"NO?!\\"? This, the first Harry Potter book, is great. Unlike other books of it's type, such as Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, it is worded simply, without the huge descriptions. It has a wonderful storyline, that doesn't need the many character in other fictional worlds. It, simply put, is one of the best fantasy novels I've been reading for quite a bit! I'm very pleased to say that Harry Potter has a place on my bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"waa'sHP&SC","review":"great adventure - book in excellent condition - timely delivery - story itself makes you want more"},{"rating":"2","title":"stop being a muggle and read this book.","review":"This series is the best, I can't wait for the 4th book. enough said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"As Harry Potter is brought into the world with its first book of the series, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is entitled as great, awesome, and fantastic to all readers!

Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth it.","review":"I hesitated about buying this copy of this book seeing as I already have a couple copies of it here. I'm very glad I did. I loved the little hand-drawn picture of Snape by JKR and the full-page color picture of the adventure across the Black Lake. Those features aside, I reread the story and forgot just how magical and wonderful it is. In comparison to the later books, it is a quick read and I forgot how much I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter Book 1","review":"I love this book! Ever since I was a young child I've been enthralled with mysticism, mythology and magic. I heard the controvery and decided to check it out for myself. What a wonderful thing! How lucky for children to be able to attend a school of magic and have adventures. Not only is it about magic but this book teaches about loyalty to self and to friends. It teaches right and wrong, good and evil - oh my gosh, are we talking morals here? I do believe so! If I had a magic wand I would wave it and predict that Ms. Rowling indeed has a success on her hands. I'm in my 40s and I can hardly wait to buy the next book. And by the way, I'm saving my books for my grandchildren!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why older than most muggles, yet intriguided by it!","review":"I just might be the oldest to enjoy this recently yet I just couldn't seem to put it down considering I had to see what all the hype was about.

Great book and I now understand the HP addiction and can't wait untit 6/20th!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All these religious complaints are silly!","review":"Harry, the main character, teaches children many positive lessons: that life cannot be expected to follow an exclusively positive course, that hardships can be overcome, and that people are often not what initial indications would predict they would be. Not only that, but this is an excellent, page turning, exciting read about a boy coming of age!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A charming book even for.... teens?","review":"Harry Potter is Charming, magical, full of dark secrets, and learning the wretched truth. I'm 15 and I must admit that when I first got Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone from my grandma, I judged a book by its cover. Now I know better. \\"Ha, it looks like a childrens book!\\" I said to myself. But then I started reading it (Since I was bored) and really enjoyed it! Not all teenagers will like these books unfortunatly, but im proud to say im into mythical and magical books and things, witchcraft and wizardry! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Despite the Hype, I enjoyed being a kid again!","review":"This book is not for scholars. It is a easy, fast read. You could even say that it was a little predictable. But, that is cynicism talking.To those adults that are reading this book and being disappointed because it isnt realistic, try and remember when you were a child.

Enjoy this book, it may help you get in touch with an aspect of your personality that you forgot existed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reading","review":"Harry Potter and the Phlosllophers Stone(folks, that's the English title, the PROPER title), is a great book. As you know, the fourth book, Harry Potter and the Doomspell Tournament, will be coming out soon, so, you should catch up quickly by reading the first novel. It is about Harry Potter, a normal 11 year old who lives with his evil \\"Muggle\\" aunt and uncle:Petunia and Vernon. Potter finds out that he has magical powers and is send to Hogwarts, your unusual school for becoming a wizard(a boy), and a witch(a girl, but they are good;remember, this isn't The Wonderful Wizard of Oz). He has to defeat Lord Voldemort, a former wizard who became a sorcerer and, with his cult of ex-wizards and spies, killed Lilly and James, Harry's mom and dad. If you want the end of this book, read this book, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, and Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban(if you want to find out about an alleged member of Voldemort's sect who wants Harry.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is just the begining","review":"I was hesitent on reading this book but one I got started I was hooked on Harry Potter. I know people think it is considered a fantasy because of the magic, but to me that was just the baseis.

But then he gets this letter from a school called Hogwarts this is when he finds out he is a wizard, but he is not only a wizard, but he is a VERY famous wizard, he is famous for defeting the dark lord Voldemort.

The movie did change a few thigns, but it's still fun to watch.If you have ever considered reading anything with the slight'est bit of magic in it, check this out.Some people said it's a long introduction to the other books in the series, but i found it very action packed and funny. Not many books can be called funny.If you like this i highly recommend you read the other potter books.Note: This book is not just for kids.~hope this helps"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I ever read! =-D","review":"I loved and love this book!

It was! I read aloud to her, but found I had to finish it when she had gone to bed. I don't know how Rowling made a story so fantastic so believable, but she did. Maybe it isn't fantasy????? Loved the British boarding school references.

Once you finish reading this book, you simply can't wait to read the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book since Wizard of Oz","review":"I have had enough birthdays to have fond memories of the Wizard of Oz.

Every time ai finish a book in the series i want to read the next book. The socerers stone is probaly one of the best books. It is very decriptive and gives you the oputunity to see the book on your mind. Once you start this book you better make sure you have nothing to do with in a few hours because you will never ben able to put this book down. so final statement is this ios a must-read!(i reccomand to get next book in series because series just keeps getting better!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sinyee, college student","review":"I agree that it is a great book. And it is definitely over-rated. I also admit that the charaters are flat and their actions predictable. However, the magic and imagination of Rowling are good enough for me. How can you beat the flying broomsticks, the snitch, and the unexpected plot twists. Even if you know what the characters will do, the scenarios are so unpredictable that you couldn't help reading until the last page to uncover the mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic Boy","review":"This is a super book about a boy. But he's no regular boy he's a magic boy. The thing is he dosent know that. He thinks he is a normal boy. I think you should read this book to find out what happens to him[Harry Poter being the boy]. I like this book because it has everthing a book needs. You should really read this book. It also paints a picture in your head. I recomend this book to 4th grade and up."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books written","review":"When our library at the middle school got this I was the first one on the reserve list.

This book strikes the perfect balance for humor, adventure, suspense, and even budding romance (Hermonie and Ron). If you're the one of the last two people who haven't read this book, don't cheat yourself another day. Give in, read it. This book's hype is well deserved."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK!!!","review":"The book Harry Potter and the Sorcerors Stone is about a boy named Harry.

Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Midnight Magic","review":"The book Midnight Magic is a really good book if you like,tarot card readings, magic, secrets, romance,and thrills. The Old magician in this book was almost prosecuted for doing \\"magic\\", as the king would say. He tried to tell the king that the so called \\"magic\\" that he did was nothing mearly tricks and something to make a living out of. The kings most trusted advisor let him be in the debt of the king. The king later found out that he needed a favor from the old magician. mangus ( the magician) is faced with a problem that he cant solve because he really isen't a magician, just a entertainer. The king won't beleive him and if the problem isen't solved, than he will be excecuted at once. These are just alittle of what happenes in the book. As you can see there are always problems that occur and its not boring at all. You always are woundering what is goin to happen next and you dont want to put down the book untill you see. This why i like, \\"Midnight Magic.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Genious book, poor narrative","review":"What can I say? I loved the book! It is easily the best one I have read in a long, long time.The audio version, however, disapointed me. I thought Jim Dale simply wasn't all that great. Being a Brit living in the United States, I told the folks back home this and they immediately sent me the Brit version of the audio tape (the Philosopher's stone, read by Stephen Fry) -- it was absolutely fantastic.Stephen Fry really did capture my imagination and really make me believe that Harry could be captured outside the pages of the novel.I beg you, if you can, to get hold of the Brit version (perhaps amazon.co.uk sell it?) and listen to that rather than the inferior US one (still read by a Brit). You won't be sorry you did.Anyway, let's all raise glasses to one of the greatest childrens books of all time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the sorcerer's stone","review":"Harry potter and the soecerer's stone is a grate book with alot of twists and turns,It will get you hooked . This book is filled with lingering chapters and pages turning the characters and places to life. There's at least ten or twelve exciting parts in this wonderful tale of a magical boy and his friends.This delightful tale is about a boy who has suvived an awful catastrophe,killing his parents when he was just a baby. But we shall not speak of his name. Some say the person who killed Harry Potter's parents was an evil wizard who was after Harry. For if Harry was to grow up he would be more powerful then him and would someday kill him.Harry Potter and the socerer's stone is a grate book. I think R.L.

Rowling restored my faith in the joys of reading aloud. Not since \\"The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\" has the supernatural world of children's imagination been so enchantingly captured. This is a story that adults will have a delicious time with, even if they have no young ones to beg for \\"just one more chapter, please....\\" And Scholastic has given the world a winner from a design and production standpoint; graceful typography, proper leading, exquisite illustrations. Thanks, Amazon, for your blurb - it led me to a great personal Christmas gift - now if I can ever get it back from the neighbor kids, I'll be able to read it for the third time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I suggest this book to every kid and adult.","review":"Harry Potter is a interesting kid who is living whith his cruel aunt,uncle and Dudley a spoiled, fat brat who gets everything he wants at the snap of his fingers.

His uncle says no but is scared out of his pants by the huge giant. Harry had found out that he was accepted to Hogwarts a magic and wizardry school. Soon Harry is off to Hogwarts to become a wizard. Read the book to find out the amazing adventures Harry has at Hogwarts"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is exquisitely written with an amazing plot.","review":"This book is simply amazing. The author shows her writing prowess through crystal clear details, and wonderfully complicated plot. It is very much a rags to riches type of story in which the main chracter goes from living with his horrible aunt and uncle to living the life of a wizard at Hogwarts School of Wizirdry. This is the type of book which anyone of any age would deeply enjoy reading. When I read it I had trouble putting it down ended reading it through in about six hours. I strongly recommend this book to parents with children ages 6 to 100 as well as for themselves. I would not like to sound to much as a billboard advertisement, however, I would also like to recommend that you order it straight from Amazon.com simply because the security is very good and all you need is something plastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"to say it was good is an understatement!","review":"the world of harry potter is lighter than narnia (all of thosebooks, although strongly connected to the Bible, made me cry) but justas adventurous. hogwarts acadamy is like the school that so many of us young people would dream of going to, the magical sport of quidditch one we all wish we could play. the twists in this plot are spectacular. although the original intent of ms rowling may have been for readers 8-12, it has certainly caught enough of my attention. i am not an avid reader, but this book kept me up all night.and i am not, contrary to the beliefs of many paranoid parents, in love with witchcraft. i can seperate fiction from reality in a way that i can enjoy a movie or a book without becoming trapped inside of it. and maybe that is what you \\"parents standing up for religion\\" should look at...isn't this all just make-believe?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A boy with magical powers is stuck in the wrong place","review":"This book was an exciting book about a young boy that was put in the hands of the wrong parents.

I approached this book from the standpoint that it is essentially written for younger folk. I am 34, but so many adults swore that this was a great work of fantasy that I decided to give it a try. I have a rule. If, after the first 100 pages, Im not interested enough to go on, I just stop right then and there. This book sadly falls into that category. I am very surprised that so many adults feel that this is a major work of fantasy. It pales in comparison to most writers. The writing is not all that good. The story is comical to an extent and has moments of imagination, but not nearly enough to recommend. From the youth standpoint, I can somewhat see that an interesting and comical story is developing and I am always for youth reading more and more books. It will lead to reading better and more thought provoking books eventually. For adults, however, this book has nothing to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter, a wizard, meets many problems and many friends","review":"Harry goes through main gates and a weird train gates while meeting Herimone and Ron. Teacher gives him trouble too. Quiddish matches make him better known than the scar on his head. Harry and the students make words about his trouble with you-know-who and that is what makes it so suspenseful. The best age to read this book is 8-11 in my opinion. Also I would give it 5 stars because I adore it. You will have to read this book to find out what happens with Harry and you-know-who!"},{"rating":"2","title":"In 16 years of teaching this is the best read aloud book.","review":"I have been teaching for sixteen years, and I can honestly say this is the book that not only I, but my students, have enjoyed the most. They begged me to keep reading - that hasn't happened in a long time. When they found out there was a sequel, not only I, but several of my students ordered the book from England, and as soon as it came in, I had to start reading it. We have all become Harry Potter fans. We are all awaiting each subsequent book (and are heartbroken that there are only seven books planned at present!) My students are eagerly trying to find a way to write to J. K. Rowling to express their love for her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hagrid and Muggles and Magic...oh my!","review":"Although it's probably already been said, this masterpiece perfectly captures the magic, mystery, and uncertainty of a child's world. Harry is the champion of underdogs who becomes a hero. He is loyal, humble, and honest although his early life was one of cruelty and indifference. His friends plot, scheme, and feast upon Every Flavour Beans while using their wits and magical powers to narrowly escape danger and disaster.Rowling cleverly depicts the boorish father and mother who dote upon their rather unintelligent and spiteful son Dudley but who basically deny the existence of Harry.A magical read for all ages. Although the book is currently banned in some places, at least children are putting down the controllers for their Nintendos or Segas or computers and picking up a real book--nothing virtual about that. Along with Harry children are rediscovering the magic in their everyday lives. A modern masterpiece reminiscent of Roald Dahl. 10 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Story","review":"This book is really awesome. I can't stop reading it!

My gifted teacher told us to read this book and figure out why it had been on the New York Times Best Sellers list for so long. I can totally see why now, it is charming, mystical, and takes you to a place that you dream about going to.

All i can say in two words is READ IT!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"I enjoyed this book almost as much as my children did. Undersized,bullied and generally downtrodden Harry Potter is actually a wizard and a famous one too! His first year at wizard school, especially the breath-taking quidditch matches make for edge-of-the-seat reading. All this said, if you grew up reading Diana Wynne Jones (Charmed Life, Eight Days of Luke, Magicians of Caprona and others),as I did, you'd say a lot of it's been done before and done a bit better.

It is a good book without the hyberbole, unnessecary descriptions, poetry, or rabbit mating that makes wd so famous. (I need to shut up about wd and talk about harry potter) it is constant fun to read and don't be threatened by its lengthiness, it is fun all the way through and you won't put it down until you're through reading it. read Robert C.

Harry Potter reminds the reader of James, from James and the Giant Peach, because of his living conditions and lifestyle. I found that the adventure and suspense... and just the thought of waht Harry was going to do next, just captivated and held me throughout the story. In the short time after I read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, I was craving to read more and more of Harry's adventures.

It has everything a book needs and more , it has a very involving storyline ,the characters are brilliantly described,it has a very large amount of tension and keeps you thrilled right to the end . One of the great things about it is that you cannot put it down , it is as if your hands are glued on to it which caused me many sleepless nights reading chapter after chapter .What you need is a parent or a school teacher who has a little more self control as to when they stop reading ( I bet that they will still want to read on though) This was most definetily No.1 on my best book list , No.2 is Harry potter and the chamber of secrets , the sequel to this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"harry potter rocks","review":"harry potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the best book have ever read.

Don't let the reading age level stop you from sharing this book with a younger child. My 7 year old son and I would read several chapters nightly.

Harry has a bad life,living with his aunt,uncle and cousin. On Harry's 11th birthday he gets a letter from someone. Harry never gets to read the letter, but finally a huge man comes to tell Harry that he is being invited to wizarding school. Harry makes two friends at wizard school. Their names are Ron and Hermoine. As the story goes on, Harry learns more about magic and is selected to play on the house's Quidditch team(the students are divided up into houses. They sleep and eat in that house.) Quidditch is a sport that involves 3 flying balls and people flying on broomsticks. Towards the end of the story Harry has to battle a mean and powerful wirzard. You will have to read the book to find out if he wins. This book is a very good book for people to read because it is very interesting.

I simply put it in the back of my bookshelf when I got it in the mail and didn't look at it for several months. Then, on a snow day while school was closed I had nothing to do. I looked through my room and found Harry Potter. I read the first few chapters and became HOOKED! Just as I finished the first one I went out and bought the second. Two years later, I had read the third and second books at least two times. Sonething about leaving your troubles behind by going on a train far away and meeting new friends was a universal dream that most people have wished for.

While these books are entertaining (and, as a teacher, of course I'm thrilled kids want to read these books or any others) J.K. Rowling is no C.S. Lewis, Susan Cooper, Lloyd Alexander, e. Nesbitt, Edgar Eager or Jane Langton -- all talented writers who have written fabulous books which take their readers to different worlds (all of them far more magical than Harry Potter's). The Harry Potter books are a good hook to get kids reading and interested but I would recommend any of the above-mentioned authors over Rowling. If you like the Harry Potter books, please don't just sit waiting for the Rowling publication. Instead, try these writers -- you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"Fantastic book. Loved every minute of it.

The books have so much more detail than the movies, that for such a great price I couldn't pass this deal up. My son is now wanting ALL of the Harry Potter books.This is a great book to get those kids who aren't that interested in reading, REALLY interested. The son who I purchased this book for almost NEVER likes to read, but this is one book he LOVES to read.As an aside, reading Harrp Potter, or Fantasy books will not give your son or daughter \\"demon issues\\".

LOL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Potter","review":"I liked the Harry Potter books, and the writing, I'm glad to say, DOES get better as the series goes on. But seriously, these books are ntohing to go crazy over. They're your basic, Not origanal fantasy.The people, which I suppose JK Rowling tried to make realistic, are completely unbelievable. The Dursleys, Dumbledore, Snape, Harry Potter himself, the list goes on and on. The first book, like the fifth, is a big disappointment, and I don't see what the big deal is about these books in the first place. If you want good books, go to the Warriors series by Erin Hunter. Now those are books worth getting excited over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"The book is much better than the movie.

Mrs.J.K Rowling had made a great job, and has create the most favorite book of almost all kids around the world. I really don't believe that magic excist but this book, make you feel in an other world, where everything is posible!!! Although I'm a girl, I like this books and I don't care a boy is the principal character"},{"rating":"2","title":"My two Knuts","review":"I wanted to see what the fuss was about so I finally grabbed a copy of this book. I was pleasantly surprised. Rowling seems to have the knack for making believable characters young readers will care about. Although Harry probably should be a bit more dysfunctional considering his upbringing, (Don't they have child welfare in his world?) he is a welcome hero, one filled with flaws but also possessing the courage that makes a hero. Any book that promotes reading in today's world has value but it's nice to see Rowling is a true story teller. Not with the epic reach of Lewis' Narnia tales or Tolkien's Ring saga but maybe a better style for today's children, focussing on the power of friendship and the importance of the little things. She has made me curious to see how this all turns out in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"gripping, funny, surprises to the very end","review":"A very well written book by J K Rowling.

Well-done Joanne Rowling..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry's spell didn't work for me","review":"I finally read this book, and what I found out was this book was one of the most overrated books I've ever read. The story was mediocre, I have no idea why most of the reviewers love this book. Furthermore, the main characters were dull. You find no one who is attractive, as you do when you're reading \\"Gone with the wind\\" by Margaret Michell. So I figured out this book must be for children. If I were 9, I might like this book. But I am 23, and I prefer books which are more profound. Try \\"The Satanic Mill\\" by Otfried Preussler. This masterpiece has got a ridiculous English title (the original title is 'Krabat'), but \\"The Satanic Mill\\" is the best fantasy I've ever read so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible and overated","review":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is boring. It has no point. It's only about magic and wands and secret passages. Also the characters are all stupid. I think some of the characters are put in just to make it longer. The book is also very long. Everything is described very well, but the description isn't needed. You might like Harry Potter if you believe in ghosts, goblins, magic, and bag guys that kill people with magic. You should not read this book. It will be a waste of the month it takes you to read it. Thank you for taking your time to read my review.

This book is a pure knock off of other, REAL CLASSICS like The Lord of The Rings. Some people were right, Gandalf was just changed do Dumbldoor or whatever, the faithful Sam into Ron, Frodo, the one that needs to destroy the Ring (in this case Voldomort or however you spell his name) as Harry, Solomon as Voldomort (spelling?), and so on. Don't waste your money on this, matter of fact, don't waste your time reading it if you get it from the library.

Judy Blume books are my favorite because the books take you through life as a teenager and it is easier to rlate to a self-concious teenager than a genius wizard who likes to ride a broom and defeat evil wizards for fun.

The new on comeing out is going to be so long its just dumb to read. Even the moves were having a hard time making the story exiting. I am not even going to borther with the new one.

It is a SHAME that this has received the popularity that it so vehemently does not deserve. J.K. Rowling \\"borrows\\" many of her plots and characters from other children's writers of the past and defiles them into convoluted obscurity. She rarely creates, such is the talent of a true artist, and in those rare moments when her individual expression shines, it seems as strange and random as a nine year olds day dreams. If you indeed do decide to read Harry Potter, I recommend you read the first few chapters and the conclusion. The content in the middle of the book can be disregarded. In my opinion there are three options. Stay away from the Potter series. Buy the book and burn it. Or lastly read it and ponder suicide. Its that bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Potter should just disappear","review":"Hype is like a Tsunami, it's a massive relentless wave that swallows everyone whole. I tried reading the first book and couldn't get through it; the writing is so bad, so unoriginal. I didn't care about any of the charecters. How is it that these books are so popular? Even the movies are slow and were it not for the special effects there would be nothing to look at. And the house names: Slitheren? I'm glad J.K. Rowling is out of poverty, good for her.

Ron Weasley was the youngest in his family. He had a massive family, not including the ones that have left Hogwarts. Ron always got Harry,Hermoine and Neville into trouble.

I highly recommend it to readers of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"refreshing","review":"I would say I'm a muggle and the the story is very mugglish, in the sense that is pretty ordinary escapism. Exactly what one needs after an abysmal day at work. The prose is crystal clear and the story is devoid of complicated plot intricacies. The rare twists are rather twist-friendly and I understand the need for linearity (kids and all). I loved the book. I recommend Jonathan Carroll if you can find it and you'll know what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Facinating, Imaginative and Fun!","review":"I loved this book so much that I devoured it in 5 hours! The imagery was outstanding. I felt as though I was watching a movie unfold in my mind.

It is exciting and twisted and kept me on my toes the whole time. This is defently the BEST book I have read in awhile! It has led me back to reading for fun...happy reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyment for anyone","review":"No matter what age you are or where you are from, this is a book that you can enjoy. It is excellent reading: I couldn't put it down once I started it. There are enough characters that you could relate to at least one of them. If you can't afford to stay up all night to finish the book, then don't worry, because the chapters are not too long, so you always have the choice to read it a little at a time. This is also a book to read over and over again, because you will notice different aspects of the characters and the story each time you read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"Imagine that a children's book could captivate the attention of an adult. The author's choice of vocabulary allows the adult reader to be completely captivated without feeling a loss of intelligence. I enjoyed this book so much, I ordered the next 3 books in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally awesome!!!!!","review":"i thought that this book was so good and my favorite character was harry. because he was just so cool and i loved all of the cool and weird names like hagrid, hermione, diagon alley, and dumbledore. i just finished the first one and can't wait to read the rest!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry lives in a regular family and finds out he is a wizard","review":"I loved this book.

RowlingI recently read Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone.It drives you to keep reading.Harry's adventures in Hogwarts School of Wizardry are crazy. he attempts things not physically possible in the real world. A great quote that describes Harry is \\"Harry then did something very brave and very stupid.\\" The basic Children book rival makes this book even better, his greatest rival Draco Malfoy is always trying to get harry in trouble. It usually happens when Harry's least favorite teacher is, Severus Snape. The potions teacher. Harry's adventures on broomsticks, talking to snakes, and dealing with mangy ghosts are compelling not to love.This book is great for children of all ages and even for adults. I can't give it away but if you want to know more read harry potter and the Sorcerers Stone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Perspective on Witchcraft.","review":"\\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" is a book that can appeal to people of all ages. With its simple language, it almost becomes an esacpe from reality. The book is about a boy who finds out he is a wizard and his adventure in his first year in magic school. The most interesting thing in \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" is that the book defies the stereotype of witchcraft. Instead of witchcraft being thought of as a curse, as thought in the stereotype, in this book, witchcraft is considered to be gift and if you have the gift you are lucky to possese such a gift. Therefore reading this book will not be a waste of time, but an enjoyable experience that will you keep you on the edge of the seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've read in a while!","review":"Aside from Ella Enchanted and any book by Lloyd Alexander, this is my favorite book. It's full of twists and turns as Harry and his two friends unravel a mystery about Hogwart's Academy. It had everything I like in a book, even a surprise ending. It's a great book for anyone who has an imagination (and I'm certain that that's a lot of people). It was so suspenseful, I finished it in a day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter is a verrrrrrrrrry good book!","review":"I think Harry Potter is the greatest book in the whole world.

He grabbed Book 1 on Sunday and read it all the same day. He was captivated and said it is his favorite book he has ever read.I was afraid the book would be to difficult for him to read, he reads at a 3-4th grade comprehention level but apparently he did not have issues with the book.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read-aloud for teachers!","review":"I have just finished reading the book to my second grade class, and they were spell-bound!

I LOVED IT! I read the entire book in one afternoon and didn't want the book to end. I felt so sorry for Harry while he was living with his hateful aunt and her family but he has a courage that enabled him to overcome the danger he faced in Hogwarth school. I felt I was with him when he went through many adventures in the school; wearing invisible cloak, being in the forest at night... on and on. I am an avid reader of all books and now that I have read this one, I ordered all of them and can't wait to get them so I can read them in a couple of days. The only problem after reading all three books, I'll be waiting for more of them to come out. J.K. Rowling, please hurry with more of them.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, despite a few flaws.","review":"Overall, I really enjoyed this book.

Rowling's outstanding novel, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, is the best book I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Her increadable style and miraculasly realistic charecter development, along with an awsome and spellbinding plot stirred together in a Magic Cauldron create one heck of a spell: Harry Potter. Harry will undoubtably be a classic along with the Winnie The Pooh stories and The Hobbit."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that makes you jealous of the characters it's so good","review":"When I first read this book I was drawn into it by the fact that it seemed so real and I could see it hapening every day of my life. My thoughts are occupied soley by the plot and outcomings of this book. At first I thought that I'd be able to get a letter from Hogwarts too but then realised that I was already too old. This disappointed me so much that I thought I'd find every scrap of information I could regarding Harry Potter. I've read the first 3 books and am starved for more material. I'm not quite sure how sex is going to be fed into the book and am really scared that Ron or Hermione might die in the next book. SARAH GILL"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It","review":"Ok, If you need to read a review to buy this book then you're not a Harry Potter fan for one, and those that want this book aren't likely to read a review to influence this decision.

For kids my eye!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great adventure","review":"This is a story about a boy whose name were Harry Potter and his adventures.

He was told that his parents were very normal people who died in a car crash, but one day he discovered all those was a lie, he was actually a wizard that came from a wizard family and the wizard world. In that world he found his real self and what he was good at.

It is so creative and charming and fun to read. Everyone, children to adults, should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing, Imaginative & Exceptional","review":"Imaginative and bright; creative and encouraging, this cleverly written story is pure magic for all ages. Mamalinda, her 15 year old progeny and 92 year old Auntique Bea, all agree that an adventure with Harry has a new twist around every Hogwarts' corridor. The focus on logic, problem solving and learning is refreshing; while the Mundane Muggles are the truly terrifying forces. The writing is inspired, and hopefully Harry Potter won't be reduced to some imagination draining set of movie sequels!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Remembering a love for reading","review":"This book reminded me why, as a child, I loved to read.

He could not wait to hear more, even coming to the bedroom book in hand at 6am begging me to read the next chapter. IT is intrguing, suspenseful,attention grabbing.A book to be enjoyed by adults and their kids.Reading this stretches the imagination to the limit and beyond.We are now Avid H.P. fans and can't wait to see how Harry's third year at Hogwarts turns out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jim Dale rocks.","review":"Harry Potter is the best series I have ever read and reread.

People of all ages should be introduced into the world of Harry Potter, it's a book that you don't want to miss! J.K Rowling has a amazingly creative mind. The sequels are just as great.

It totally brought me inside the book. When I finished it, I was so upset because I wanted to find out what happened next, but I didn't have any of the other books. I couldn't stop thinking about it, and I sort of felt like I was Harry and that school the next day was going to be at Hogwarts. You can't put it down; it catches you with it's suspense, makes you laugh with its humor, and makes you wonder how it's going to end. I think my favorite part was the twisted ending, which is totally different than what you think. I recommend this book to anybody. no matter how old you are, or how much you like reading, I am sure you will like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"I adored this book! The best thing is that the characters are about as realistic as you can get in a fantasy book. The next best thing is that no one character is perfect. They all have their quirks and problems. The third best thing is that not everything is what it seems, with this, and the perfect amount of mystery, you get the Harry Potter books. Once I read it, I couldn't put it down. Except for when I went to get ice cream, but even while eating that, Harry Potter was the first thing on my mind. What would happen next? The best part is, you suspect someone who's right in front of your nose, and you say, \\"Oh, it HAS to be him!\\" Then all of a sudden, it's someone else and you go, \\"Oh yeah! I should have seen it!\\" EVERYbody is going to like this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what's the big deal?","review":"From the review this book got, you would think it was the first children's fantasy book ever written. Sure, the author of the Harry Potter books has some inventive additions to the typical fantasy story (Quidditch is one of my favorites, and has enjoyable, if somewhat stereotypical, characters and plots. Nothing, however, that justifies the reviews that this book has been getting. And as for appealing to adults, I can think of several children's fantasy books that would be equally, if not more, appreciated by more mature readers. In summary, read the book, call it excellent and original if you must, but please stop treating it like the best thing that ever happened to children's literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is great for all ages!","review":"It was the best book.

I read this book, then immediately ordered the next two in the series. Book four will be out soon and I can barely wait! The story flows smoothly, is well written and is occasionally laugh out loud funny. It's an easy, fast-paced read with interesting places and characters. Come on!

Every time you pick up the book you cannot put it down. The amazing author J.K. Rowling details every aspect that you read.

That obviously holds true for most books. What I didn't like we're the things that weren't elaborated on in the book that were extensively shown in the movie.

In the great media hype that is Harry Potter and the much anticipated movie I decdied to pick up a copy for my self. pHarry Potter is one of thoses great books that sucks you in right away. Even though it is written for a younger audience it does not lack any excitment that an less amture writer would emit in writting a childrens book. If you are a parent that strugles with geting your children to read like i know I often do i would suggest trying this book. The little brats wont be able to put it down. I was a little disapointed by the lack of sceenes in which quditch, the game played on brooms. I have yet to read any other books in the sereies but hopefully the will be packed with this exciting wizards sport."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delight for the Imagination","review":"This is one of those rare books that adults will enjoy just as much as children!

This is a \\"must read\\" for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ages 9-12? Nonsense!","review":"Some stuffy Muggles must have decided the age range for these books. Maybe a bit too much of the world (people die) for the very young, but there is no upper age limit. My all-time favorite book remains Norton Juster's The Phantom Tollbooth; and I've also been a fan of Tolkein, Roald Dahl, the Lloyd Alexander books, etc. But Rowling's books have captured my imagination such as none have done in years! She has created characters, a place, a tale of magic and mystery and everything that anyone of any age could want in a terrific read. Escape into Harry's world and just have fun! THIS is what reading is all about! Bravo, J.K.! Keep 'em coming!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book to let Your Imagination Run Free","review":"I found all three of the Harry Potter books to be entertaining.

I was wondering why the series was such a big hit and I found out. The books put you in a made up world you do not want to stop reading about.When I did pick up the first book to read I could not put it down. There are not too many characters which would confuse children (and adults who try to read real fast like I do), there are interesting twists in the story, and JK Rowlings Harry Potter world is just a nice escape from reality. A very enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"My project for Harry Potter","review":"Amazon Critique I thought Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was an excellent, well written book.

He meets friends and enemies in his school,Hogwarts, for witchcraft and wizardry. But one enemy stands above the croud. His name, his name is VOLDEMORT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Adventures at Hogwarts","review":"Adventures at HogwartsWant to read a good book? Read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. It is about a boy who doesn't even know that he is a wizard. He finds out that he is a wizard and goes to a wizarding school called Hogwarts. He has two friends named Ron and Hermione. One day he finds out that Snape is to steal the sorcerer's stone; he tries to save it. When he gets there Quil's the one who's trying to get it! And he's going to kill Harry!

It has been a long time since I have picked up a book and been pulled into it as quickly as I have this one. I can't wait until my children are old enough to enjoy this book.

If you like this try the Wrinkle In Time series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I am 11 years old. I LOVED this amazing and great book. I have all three books in the series.

LEWIS'S CHRONICALS OF NARNIA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spazzer's Comments","review":"There have been many great books written in our time---but Harry Potter is certainly not one of them.For one, Rowling has made the characters superficial and cheap, and there is no character development. Harry is always the same, Voldemort is always gonna be evil, you get the point.Good is not a pure good, and evil is usually a fallen good. Rowling doesn't make any blend in that; good is good, and bad is definitely bad. No one changes.Plus, the whole thing about his scar at birth is ridiculous. Harry doesn't deserve that; he didn't do anything. The plot is overused. Voldemort keeps on showing up every book...when is there going to be a new plot? I appreciate her creativity, but there are authors that can write much better than this.*ANIME ROCKS!*"},{"rating":"1","title":"ANNOYING","review":"Too bad the lowest rating was 1!!

I am mainly writing this for two reasons. One I do not want Amazon to recommend these books or any like them to me. Two I genuinely dislike these books. The premise is tired and unoriginal. This writer has creatively blended all of the greatest mythology stories and essentially given it a 20th century make over. With the exception of Quiddich. By and large I think these books were written for people who don't want to be challenged anymore and simply want to mentally check out while reading instead of watching TV.

As you see, I bought the book a week ago b/c and only b/c it's on sale and I would like to get sth to read. The story is a little bit disapointed. Why there are always evil aunt and uncle??? Why the little victim is always the \\"super special boy\\"? It's a okay book for little kids to have fantasy about magic, spells, etc. But the depth ideas are not as heathly as the surface - a little special boy learnt magic. When you read the book to your kids, please pay attention to the negative ideas regarding the aunt and uncle issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather boring with less than original plot","review":"I found this book kinda boring and not that original. It's not that I don't like fantasies, but this book is just a cute children's book. It's storyline repeats itself and stuff doesn't really come as a shock. It can't stir emotions and the characters don't develop. They just keep getting in trouble. I know a lot of books that have better plots that make magic seem fun and amazing. This book muddles it and makes it confusing. If you want a good fantasy book I suggest the Lord of the Rings series and The Golden Compass.I am not a person who hates books I just find this one dull and unoriginal. Same line, Same verse, A little more popular, and a whole lot worse!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New member of the club","review":"I'm an adult who ordered this book to find out what all the fuss was about. Five minutes into it I ordered the next three. This is the most enjoyable, absorbing book I've read in years - and yes I read a lot. It reminds me of everything I loved when I was a kid.

A question has popped into my head on many occassions, What's so different and wonderful about this series? I don't quite see how it has anything creative or original to offer. Sure the characters are likeable and friendly, but on a younger child's level, not at all for kids older than 12. J.K. Rowling's writing style is nondescriptive and I feel as if there are wide gaps between the words where descriptive adjectives should go. Unlike other fantasy novels, there is also no sense of history or background to Rowling's story. No rich tapestry of magical and mythological history that makes fantasy books seem so real and developed. After reading the books, I still fail to see how these novels have become such an international phenomenon."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring book","review":"that book is the most boring i have ever read in my life.i regret that i read it and i suggest everybody not reading it.reading that book is absolutely waste of time !!!(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"i just didn't like this book ,December 13,2001","review":"Call me crazy,but I just didn't like this book.I thought it moved rather slowly. The book just plays on that hackneyed boy-wizardmagical theme that's been done time again. Chilren's books that have some kind of underlying protent are the best kinds of childrens' books, and Harry Potter just doesn't fit that mold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hedwig's role is the best","review":"I don't know what to rate this book. It's not the best, and the best character, i believe, is actually HEDWIG!!!! I really do love hedwig, and i'm glad that JK Rowling made her up because the book would be NOTHING. They use the word \\"muggle\\" in a lot of books, and i'm not sure if it's her stealing OTHER people's ideas, or if it's other people stealing HER ideas. Anyway, i resent this book except for the parts with hedwig because a mail-carrying owl is so much more magical than the beginning of the book, even though the beginning IS magical. (I was even hedwig for halloween)!Well, I just saved you. I despise this book, and i only recommend it if you enjoy leafing through the book and finding lovely parts about hedwig. I still think HEDWIG is the best character, and all the humans are just...mostly fake. The movies have done a good job transforming this book into something that everyone is crazy about.(Hedwig fanatic, signing off!!!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, derivative, unimaginative","review":"Well, you can't please everyone. I decided to try this book because of its phenomenal success and popularity. I can now say that I have read it and I found it a dull affair. Rowling is not a good writer. The book is episodic and the narrative doesn't really move along. While everyone else praises the book for its display of imagination, I didn't find one novel idea or incident in it. The wit was weak, the characters one dimensional, the plot uninteresting. Rowling has taken fictional bits and pieces from dozens of other children's books and whipped up a stew out of them which lacks originality and force. More grievously, there is an emptiness behind it all. A book for very, very easily entertained (and not very literate) children."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book that has ever been written!!!","review":"This book, from an 11 year old is the most incredible book written of all time. It is filled with suspence and mystery, filled with cliff-hangers and everything that makes an awesome book awesome. It is filled with magic (duh!) and thrilling suprises.

I'm 15 years old and I'm supposed to be reading Jane Erye for Honors English next year, but I honestly COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN! I sat up past midnight to read it! I first heard about it on Rosie O'Donnell and I must say- Rosie, thanks for suggesting it! This is an instant classic! Harry's life is so un-ordinary but everybody can relate to him! And did anybody else want to punch those Slytherin snobs in the teeth as much as I did? This book has it all- the plot is spectacular, the characters are vibrant, and Quidditch sounds like so much fun! I haven't read such a fun book since \\"Redwall\\" (another excellent choice)! If I could I would give this book a zillion stars! I can't wait to get the sequel! Jane Erye will just have to wait! PS- GO GRYFFINDOR! WHOO HOO!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new classic","review":"I read the first three books a couple of years ago, but read them again after seeing the movie. Since there are already many reviews outlining the plot, I will just say how much I enjoyed it. Definitely a Childrens classic that adult's will enjoy as well. I do have a couple of quibbles though. Harry's treatment at the hands of the Dursley's seems very far-fetched. I know that this is a common theme in children's fantasy, but it's a little overdone. Secondly, Quidditch makes no sense at all, neither the concept(why just have one seeker, when you could have six?) or the fact that an assembly line broomstick (the nimbus 2000) should give one an advantage(shouldn't it be magical and athletic skill?)But, all on all an excellent book (and the movie was good too!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!!","review":"I was so impressed with this book! My only complaint is that I'll never get to read it again for the first time. My mother introduced me to this book on friday night, it's now monday morning and I have read the second book already!

I'm 18 now and I started reading the books in grade school, and I still love them. Harry Potter really is what led me to start loving to read when I was young. With that being said, it is more than just a children book because people of all ages can get something out of this story.

No really... it's very evil, what with the children having fun, and learning the value of friendship. The main character is especially demonic. Harry has some audacity to willingly leave a home and situation where he is regularly starved, confined, and beaten for a place where he finds friends, love, family, and a past he never knew he had. Seriously, it just reeks of Satan.Honestly, the Harry Potter books are wonderful entertainment for children and adults. I found myself shutting off my inner-cynic while reading, and being carried into a world that is as well-realized as it is fun. Rowling's style is funny, witty, and emotionally moving. I can't wait for book 5, guess I just have to read the first four again.

It was amazing, simply amazing! I couldn't put it down. The story was so unpredictable that I just had to keep reading it. I finished the book the very same day I bought it. The characters are so spectacularly described that I could almost SEE the story taking place.We now have the four book collection. My son(8yrs old)is just finishing the second book.

I loved this book, and the characters were extremelly engrossing! Harry, Hermoine, and Ron, they all had very seperate personalities. As soon as I finished this book, I immedently started the second and then the third and finally the fourth. They all are completly wonderful, and mus be read in sequence to make sense.In a world where childrens' books are often too childish for adults and teens, and adult books are snubbed by teens and completely not understandable by most children, Harry Potter is a rare find!

I thought it began well - with the horrible adoptive parents and their child - but then I felt the book was sooo predictable. And when it wasn't predictable, it was because a new deus ex machine was introduced into the story. The writing is pedestrian for the most part.

It continued to drag on and on. I've got to admit even though it was pretty boring it was very detailed.

I have no religious problems with these books, but I find it pretty sad how much of the world is caught up in the notion that these are great books. They are boring and run of the mill. Rowling should try to be a little more original and exciting. The books are no better than the \\"Babysitter's club\\" or \\"Nancy Drew Files\\".

A lot of people my age are going to read it and say \\"WOW!This book was great!\\" and buy a copy for a friend or keep it as a collecters, but more of \\"Harry Potter\\" books are going to come out on the market and soon enough I will probably change my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"In night dark","review":"I did not not some of the part because it had kill in it but I really enjoyed this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I think this book is the best of all.

Ron won 50, Hermione won 50, Harry got 60 and Nevile won 10. Gryffindor's total of the house points was 482 points. This is a good book because Harry shows courage by fighting for what he thought was right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely amazing!","review":"I started reading these books thinking that they would probably suck but boy was I wrong.

Rowling and promptly handed the book over to my 12 year old daughter, the real reader in the family.I first heard about this book on National Public Radio - Ms. Rowling was on doing an interview. I was making the commute home from work. She read the passage about the trip to the zoo and the snake and the disappearing glass and she chortled on about muggles and such.

It's an excellent book, with believable characters and a very fresh, imaginative plot. However, there is a lot of old ideas simply rewritten and compiled together. In fact, the whole series is like that. Sorcerer's Stone? Basilisk? Veela? A lot of these have been used and reused but not presented to a child audience. How clever. Also, the books seem to fall apart very easily. Not very well-made.In conclusion, a good read but not worthy of the Newberry Award, not only because of the unimaginative writing but also because the book was written and published in Britain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Story","review":"The first installment of Harry Potter has lived up to all the hype.

It's not just for kids or adults....it's for everyone! I found myself holding my breath before Harry got in trouble or cheering when he and his freinds prevailed! It was a great escape book.

Is it just because this book is popular? Why aren't the other good books?I gave this book 1 star for effort and another for a, well, amusing story.About the sequels, take books like \\"Goosebumps.\\" Way too many sequels, BAD BOOKS.

It wouldn't take a fantasy fan long to come up with a list of the sources of most of the ideas in the book. How anyone can call it original is beyond me. Maybe I've just read too much of the much superior source stuff (like Roald Dahl and Terry Pratchett).

After the HP series (which was about 4 deep at the time), I reread both the \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\" series and the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" series (including \\"The Hobbit\\") and then just kept reading (and not just fantasy stuff, either!).

In the book, eleven year old Harry Potter learns that he is a wizard and is accepted to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. There he begins to unlock the secrets of his past-learning of his parents death and that the dark lord, Voldemort, had tried to kill him as a baby-while learning all about magic through friendship, new enemies, the sport of Quidditch, a caring headmaster, and a malicious potions master with a grudge against Harry's father. The plot of the story is well-developed yet easy to follow and makes for a great read. Trust me, once you pick the book up, you don't want to stop reading because it is so good, yet you want to stop reading so that you don't finish the whole book in two hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why We Like Harry","review":"I just finished rereading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. I must have first read it when I was the same age as Harry in this book, and while I didn't love it then, I find it charming now. I've read the books as they have grown increasingly darker, and it is refreshing to return to when Harry was an eager young wizard, not an angry teenager.The world of Hogwarts comes to life vividly, with all the fantastic creatures and people Harry meets. The story is simple, but original. I don't think the Harry Potter books are classics, but they are entertaining. And really, what more are we looking for in a book like this?These books are popular, I know, but don't expect to be bowled over by glorious, poetic prose. The writing in this book is solid, but not brilliant, and sometimes even clunky.Read, and be entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"I had to hide this book from my child!","review":"I had to hide this book from my 11.5 year old child, so he WOULDN'T READ AHEAD!!!!!

He must be a muggle :-)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look before you leap!","review":"This is a good story. Period. The characters are colorful, and the author has a great imagination. The only problem I have with this book is that there is SO much hype that comes with it. It IS an excellent story, but it's not worth all attention it's getting. It's meant to be read by children and young adults, (young being the key word here) not adults. Many adults have read it and enjoyed it, but there are a lot of kids books that adults would like. I just don't see why everyone thinks this is a work of a genius. If you're looking for a TRUE fantasy read that would actually deserve the attention that Harry Potter gets, try HIS DARK MATERIALS by Philip Pullman and anything by JRR Tolkein. The younger set will enjoy Gail Carson Levine and the Dinotopia novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was SOOOO GOOD!!!","review":"I never really liked reading books about witches until now. I read this book and ever since I started reading until the very end, I was kept in suspense, trying to the best of my ability to guess who would end up being the villain.

If you've never read these books before, you need to! Harry Potter is amazing. Also, for all the parents that are worried about whether it's suitable for children, dealing with witchcraft and so on, don't worry anymore. It's fine. In fact, they are against the \\"Dark Arts.\\" Some other parents are worried that it's too violent- personally, I didn't think it was too violent at all, especially considering how many parents allow their children to watch X-Men or Batman or Spiderman, and how many parents don't mind that they have some... apalling romance novels or science fiction books and magazines in their house, and have no problem with their children reading, or in some cases, seeing that.

When Harry is trying finds out that someone is trying to get a secreted treasure in the school he sets out to find them. I really liked this book because it is filled with suspence and the unknown.

I recomend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone","review":"I believe that this book was very interesting and adventerous, it is also a creative book.

I can find no fault with it what-so-ever! I loved it. The only reason I rate the 3rd and 2nd books higher is that we already know the characters by then so the story comes along faster and easier because we don't have to explain so many things. But that is no fault of this book. Unique fiction for older children that adults can fully enjoy and look forward too?!?

Still this is a great video and very fun to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wierd. Cool, but wierd.","review":"I just recently saw this video for my first time. To be perfectly honest, I really enjoyed it! I like the way that the first episode (\\"Hell Hath no Fury Like Kasumi Scorned!\\") seemed to pay attention to the more neglected charactors in the series, such as the loveably oblivious housewife Kasumi. The first episode deals with an \\"evil\\" demon wandering around people's bodies. Ironically, it freeloads in tranquil Kasumi for the longest time. There is a hilarious scene in which Ryouga is possessed. The second episode (\\"The Two Akanes. Ranma, Look at Me!\\") takes a more sinister approach to demonic possession. Ranma desturbs an eerie-looking porcelain doll who holds vendettas. She retalliates by possessing Akane and using her body to get Ranma into a compromising position. This contains haunting images which stayed with me for a while, and is quite scary for a Ranma video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"In theory this is a great product - sunglasses that you can work out in.

The format is bit wanting. The introduction is fine. It explains all the movements and how to advance levels.

After using the introduction for a while, I just dropped the DVD and followed the booklet. If you like Pilates and are suffering from prolapse (which means many Pilates moves are now out), you might like this very much. I am not sorry I bought it.

His path to uncovering the mystery takes him to some very interesting places that are all at once frightening and engrossing! Well worth checking out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishing Tale of Obsession","review":"RESURRECT DEAD is one of those rare documentaries that explores a fascinating mystery as it unfolds in real time. Because the footage is shot during the actual investigation, we get to experience the excitement alongside the characters/subjects as they uncover the origins of strange tile displays discovered in streets around the United States and South America.RESURRECT falls into the category of docs where the creativity of presentation adds as much to the experience as the footage itself. The swift editing and visual display of information throughout creates the feeling of watching a thriller. So if you're not necessarily a fan of documentaries where raw footage is just cobbled together, don't worry, you'll feel like you're watching a movie. Plus, RESURRECT features the best ominous score in a doc since Metallica did the music for PARADISE LOST."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful but disappointing","review":"This book provides a useful description of the entire process of writing manuscripts, from information acquisition and literature searches to a very lengthy description of the editing process.

The recording was terrible ...static, undiscernable. And to get there, we deciphered the documentaton -- User booklet. Try to find \\"On\\" reading the book. Try to follow other directions.

Don't believe that all the units out there now are the latest version! There's no way to tell without opening the box and Pogo doesn't seem to care unless you bought it from them.They felt they were doing me a favor by telling me about the updated firmware -- hey, they could have kept a secret.

Get yourself four rechargeables.You can record almost five hours without adding memory.The ear buds are fine for listening to talk.Programming is a bit tedious.One drawback is, when you stop playback, you can't resume from the same spot. It starts at the begining again. So use a bunch of small files, instead of one big one.Overall it has worked out perfectly for me.

I felt completely different reading it, while acknowledging that it is telling the same story. The same, and yet the tone is different, the details emphasized are different. And the character of the attorney has the same experiences as the one in the movie, but feels like a different person to me.I recommend both very highly.

Beautifully written and constructed, Banks accomplishes a rare feet in narrating the events from four seperate viewpoints--each of which comes across authentic.Many reviews have called this novel depressing, a reading I dispute. Like any good tragedy the novel employs extreme cirumstances--events which violently disrupt the lives of those involved. But as the novel progresses, so to do the characters. Perseverance in the face of tragedy is, in my view, a triumph of human nature and it is rarely expressed so eloquently.As beautiful as the novel is, it sometimes leaves the reader feeling cold and analytical. The prose has a tendency to lull the reader, rendering him or her placid and unfeeling. At times you wish Banks would break out with some raw emoting, but it rarely happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely A Good Read","review":"The Sweet Hereafter is a definate must read. The plot gets you interested and keeps you there, it flows extremely well, and it is very easy to relate to. The different viewpoints of the book work well together to show you an all-around view of what happens to a small, poor town when the unthinkable happens. Russel Banks portrays every sort of stand, from guilt, to mourning, to anger, to helplessness, by looking at the tragedy from the viewpoints of the driver who blames herself, the mourning father, the anger-filled lawyer, and a survivor of the wreck who will be crippled for life. The reader feels a certain connection to the characters in the novel, likes them, dislikes them, feels their pain and their sorrow. But all around it is a lesson in viewing with an open mind a situation and the way people react to not only this tragedy, but everyday life."},{"rating":"1","title":"A quick read, but a lackluster ending","review":"This book is a quick read and keeps your attention throughout, but at the end I found it unsatisfying.

Russell Banks gives us, with his sparkling narration, a brilliant array of moral questions and human emotions. After reading this book I felt enriched, saddened, and thrilled by his art. The overall themes of this work are terrible loss and riveting transformation. Read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTHING SWEET AND NO HEREAFTER","review":"I have no idea where they came up with this title. There is nothing sweet about this book. It's hard to read because you have kids dying, it's excruciatingly slow and the end leaves you annoyed. It was well written and I'm sure it has an audience that likes these extremely sad types of books, but it's not me. OH! And what the heck's up with the picture on the front?? Did I read a different book because there is nothing even CLOSE to what would bring about this picture!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and Sparse","review":"This book is beautiful. The different narratives help enhance the telling of the story. Each character is so unique and true to form. The writing is sparse yet vast. I really felt transported to the cold winter woods of the Adirondacks, like in a Dreiser novel. I didn't want the book to end, but I felt compelled to read until the very end. The novel poses many questions about relationships and perceptions. Read it if you want to find the answers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teen Power and Integrity","review":"As a high school teacher, I think our kids seek authentic stories and issues above all--yet so much of what is out there is cynical and discourages their own sense of power in the world. This book offers an accessible, engaging story about a perfectly ordinary tragedy (if such a thing exists), around which characters familiar to any modern teen converge in the hope of establishing responsibility, or perhaps more of assigning guilt. At the center of the tale is a young girl whose life has been changed, for better as well as for worse, who slowly realizes that she holds the power to perpetuate the pain or to begin the healing. Her choice angers some powerful adults, but affirms our better instincts and validates the notion that young people can change the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sweet Hereafter","review":"How does Russell Banks do it? His book THE SWEET HEREAFTER blew my mind. After reading RULE OF THE BONE I was immersed in his style. The Sweet Hereafter is a book about a school bus accident that flips a small tight-knit community in upstate New York, upside down. The tragic event affects the entire town. The story is told from the perspective of four very differnt people. One of them is an over the hill bus driver, the next is a Vietnam vet/towns most liked person in his 30's, the third is a hotshot NYC lawyer and the last is a crippled fourteen year old who used to be the town princess. The book is honest and gritty. It really lets you into the town of Sam Dent. You become a different eye in the commmunity at the turn of every chapter.The characters are realistic and are vividlt portrayed. You get a clear vision of the town, the people in it, and the on-goings. It is simple yet gripping, quiet yet screaming.It posseses you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Enjoyed","review":"Wasn't as depressing as I thought it would be- very insightful story- Makes you think"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lowest Common Denominator - And DO SOME RESEARCH","review":"Why is this author so reverred? As an attorney, I was totally turned off, and could no longer suspend my disbelief in this syruppy nonsense of a novel, especially when he got to the lawyer's story which was so unbelievable as to make me angry enough to throw this book against the wall. First, so a bus went over a cliff killing some kids. That's original fodder for a novel? No one else thought that was emotional enough of a subject to write about? And then the lawyer comes and commits all kind of ethical violations (in person solitication is unethical) and is going to pursue a \\"class action\\" lawsuit? Huh? No, he would represent each kid's estate and try and get something. Only thing is, these cases are not normally million dollar cases. Kids just don't generate much money in lost wages. The writing was decent and so I gave it two stars. But that was being generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're Most Likely Going To Need To Aquire A Taste For This One","review":"I'm into this type of music, and I'm familiar with a lot of the artists on this compilation, but the compilation itself isn't as good as it could be. The songs are all songs that really, REALLY take some getting used to. I gave it two stars because it's okay to play the CD as background noise every now and again (and I mean background...like you need to be totally busy and not really paying attention to the music), but other than that, I don't really suggest you spend the money unless you know for sure you are really into these artists and more so...these songs in particular."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOOKED ON HOOKER!!!!!","review":"According to Ms Williams this cd was recorded in the late 50's and the liner notes confirm this, UNFORTUNATELY thats the only information we have on this offering!!! The musicians are not credited, although one reviewer says it is Eddie Kirkland on second guitar: it sure sounds like it could be him! In any case, as Ms Williams notes, this is a great set of predominately slow blues, except for the opening track I BOUGHT YOU A BRAND NEW HOME which is up-tempo. All in all, The set is a very satisfying listen, the backing trio being tight and providing plenty of solid accompaniment. The stand out is the second guitar, whoever it is! Well worth a place in any Hooker catalog! 'Nuf said!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent choice for blues guitar and John Lee fans!","review":"When I first saw this CD in my local store, I thought, well, here's another compilation of songs I already have on a half-dozen other CDs. Au contraire! This is an excellent disc of material I had not heard. The low price is just another bonus that I haven't figured out. Recorded in the early 50's with second guitarist Eddie Kirkland (who is not credited), this is a great example of John Lee, who does not adhere to a strict twelve-bar format, being followed pretty well by a second guitar (who shares a lot of lead duties), bass, and drums. Buy it right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Prophet Tales of Alvin Maker","review":"The second in a series of the story of Alvin Maker.. how he developed as he did with the spectacular talent he had, but didn't know how to use..

I expect this from freebies but not products this expensive.The story itself I like although I expect there to be varying opinion on the work. My rating is for the flaw in the kindle product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much Scott Card","review":"Orson Scott Card is definitively a great story teller. But from my point of view he has three kind of books:1 - When he writes as his characters. He is great when he does it. \\"Ender's Game\\" and \\"Songmaster\\" are the best Scott Card I've read.2 - When he is inspired by other books. \\"The Worthing Saga\\" is the main example of this situation. It's a great story, it's well told but yet when you read it, you may feel like you already knew it.3 - When he is too much of himself. \\"Homecoming\\" series are the main exponent of this. It's like he is trying to convince you about something instead of telling a story.Red Prophet is an example of type 3. The first book is quite better and between types 1 and 3.It is worth the money you pay for it, but is not gonna change you. You may agree or you may not, but won't change your life what is what you really expect from reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious bilge","review":"Wooden Characters. Chaotic plot which feels hastily scribbled together. Politically correct ( noble Reds and evil Whites) rigmarole is nauseatingly trite.

Card may have come up with some clever and complex science fiction, but he has also accomplished some terribly turgid fantasy. A suggestion and loaned from a friend, the stinking rotter. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inventive, Unorthodox and a Little Dark","review":"This book was a great read - and as usual, Card is inventive and unorthodox. What appears to be an anti-religious tirade settles into a more considered point of view. Meanwhile there are some interesting diversions into things that actually make a society strong and meaningful, and into issues surrounding native Americans, whilst all the time taking the overall story of a seventh son of a seventh son forward.Not Card's best work, but certainly not his worst either - and well worth reading"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Just what I needed for my report. This book has truly great information. A great source for Vergil's importance in the Middle Ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not read this book.

From Billy Joel to Fats Waller, Morgana King gives the listener some of the most versatile, erudite and individual jazz performances that have ever been captured on vinyl on this one album. If you haven't heard this lady before, then make the change today and track down this disc (or any others by her)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Shelter in the Storm - A Must Read","review":"Having already read books 1 and 2 of Debra White Smith's Seven Sister series and loved them, I came to A Shelter in the Storm with high expectations and wasn't disappointed. As she has done with the first two books of the series, Debra has shown how imperfect Christians deal with the uncertainties of life and how their faith helps them to become overcomers. Sonsee struggles with her growing feelings of love for her life-long friend, Taylor, because he cannot allow himself to love her. The story is not only a romance, but also a tale of suspense that leaves the reader hanging on every word, not knowing who done it until the very end. God's redeeming love is shown as both Sonsee and Taylor comes to terms with their faith and the misconceptions about it that threaten to keep them apart.The Seven Sisters series is wonderful...each a unique story unto itself. I find myself wishing it were more than seven sisters. There are only two left :-)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"I did not like this book as much as I did the first in the series for a couple of different reasons. The author repeatedly used a style of dramatic writing that subsequently became distracting. For example: \\"[she felt]...agony. Agony and anxiety. Anxiety and accusation. Accusation and acrimony.\\" In addition, the inner spiritual conflicts the main characters experienced I found hard to understand. Even though the main plot was good, with a romance intertwined with a 'whodunnit', I struggled to finish this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not such a hot C++ textbook. Poor index.","review":"This book just doesn't do the job. It has a poor index, which cripples any textbook. Many facets of C++ are not covered well or not covered at all in the book. The layout and presentation are poor. There are far better C++ books available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly incomplete","review":"I bought this dictionary to have handy while reading Willy Voet's book that alleges performance-enhancing drug use in European professional cycling. Voet's book, \\"Massacre à la chane,\\" presents two notable challenges. First, it contains some ten-dollar words. Second, it contains a variety of idioms and slang.Unfortunately, this dictionary proved virtually useless. When I didn't know a word or an expression, I rarely found it in the dictionary either. That proved true both for the unusual and the idiomatic or slang language.The dictionary is suitable for casual use by tourists who need a quick reference, or for beginning and intermediate students of French.Random House publishes an excellent Portuguese-English dictionary in the same series. It should be able to improve this one in the next edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient and versatile but not perfect","review":"I was excited to get this lens and have the capability of zooming in close without having to switch lenses for wide angle shots. It does a good job, is very easy to operate, but I am a bit dissappointed with its ability to focus up close. It can not take pictures of objects closer than 6-8 feet. So I will still keep my 35-80 lens in my camera bag for those shots that I just can't back away from."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting...........","review":"I admire how this band goes from one extreme to another. They have songs that could almost pass for death metal, and in the same song, have a jazz bridge (like the first song). They have all elements. Alternative, rap, metal, death, jazz, blues. Very unique in some aspects, however maybe this is there down fall, only song 4 stands out in my mind at the moment, amazing double bass drum, but some will say some of these songs tend to have that sound alike quality to them, even though they are diverse in the types of music they play. Maybe its the format that sounds the same, or the timing... but this is why I gave it 4 instead of 5. I like it because it is angry enough though"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best CD ever.","review":"This is definitely my favorite CD, I listen to it all the time, and it's gonna be that way for a loooong time. As incredible as their other CD's are, this one tops 'em. Whether you're big into hardcore or just slightly into it, you have to buy this. If you're more of a Limp Bizkit type person...believe me, them guys ain't $hit compared to E-Town. If you like Limp, you'd love ETC, no doubt. The vocals go back and forth a lot...really pi$$ed yelling one second, then rapping the next. They pull it off great and they're very talented and know what they're doing. If every one of the songs came on a seperate CD, I'd buy all of them. That's how good they are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"After owning Time 2 Shine, and a few 7\\"s, I didnt think E-Town could top themselves... but they somehow managed to do it with Second Coming. As the name implies, this is a rebirth, with the band coming completely out of left field, bringing new elements to their sound, while at the same time doing all the things that made them so great to begin with. A perfect example is the first track, \\"Soldier\\". The song begins with some of the most brutal hardcore you could ever imagine, but just as soon as you get used to that, the song breaks into a straight ahead rapped chorus. The song ends with an amazing improvised jazz part, showing the musicianship possessed by this band. I heavily recommend this album to anyone, regardless of their musical tastes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good offering","review":"I purchased this for the song \\"Something About the Name Jesus\\" and it songs great each time I listen to it.

It is visual sound, the artist's expression through music. In stark contrast to the earthy \\"tell it like it is\\" style of country roots from which she came, her music transports us to the worlds beyond and to our own voice within. Each time I listen, I am immediately taken to that place where time ceases to limit the human perspective and where all possibilities exist. As a listener, I am drawn into a world of sacred magic and mysticism. As a musician, I am awed by her artistry and soulful expression."},{"rating":"1","title":"It shouldn't be the book for the beginnner","review":"Unfortunately, I have class using this text book.

I am a student and don't want to invest in a serious iron until I \\"settle.\\" I saw positive reviews for this iron on both Amazon and the Kmart website and bought it at a Kmart store. So far, it works great for my needs. It's fairly light-weight, but it's definitely clearing the wrinkles. Both the steam and spray functions work well. I agree, the dial underneath the handle is rather awkward. An auto shut-off function would be nice, but I guess I'd have to pay more than $10 for that! Instead, it has a red indicator light so you know if the iron is still plugged in. I am happy with this iron."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed it a lot","review":"I'm a big fan of the Sharon McCone series and this one was a very good read. Fast-moving, credible.

Perfect for camping, especially when you see flashes of light in the distance (turns out where we were camping had a severe thunderstorm watch, which turned to a warning while we were leaving at 2 AM). Possibly saved our lives, because the next day it was reported that someone else who was camping nearby got struck by lightning. However, there are other things available for that purpose.

The information presented about bison, zebras, apes and monkeys, giraffes, and a couple of others is presented in a way that youngsters can understand, but I found the narrator, Billy Blue Hair, to be completely annoying. His voice and manner of speaking is way too similar to the ultimate brat, Bart Simpson. The animation is very much in the cartoon style, and the exclamations Billy uses include \\"holy guacamole\\", not an expression I'd like to hear my child repeat.Overall, this program was difficult for me to watch, and my 3 year old began fidgeting before the 30 minute show ended.

Lyrics (not hers) are banal enough any college creative writing program could better them in an hour seminar. Music is horrible synth-pop. And though Jensen is singing, it's often passed through dimestore filters and has none of the expressivity that makes her albums good listening. Not only is Blue completely different from anything she's done later, it's pitiful on its own merits. Very sophormoric, and that's being kind. Unlistenable is closer to the truth.

It handled getting splashed for a little while, but when it got slightly submerged it fogged up, (meaning water got inside). The fogging seemed confined to the eyepiece, and when I gently pried up the rubber around the eyepiece to find the source of the leak the entire eyepiece snapped off in my hand, and the lense dropped out! It looks like it was superglued on, and obviously that's where the water got in. I realize kayaks are a rough environment, and these weren't meant to be submerged, BUT anything advertised as water resistant should be able to handle a dunk or two in my opinion.In summation, this will work great for you..... if you don't ever drop it or get it wet.Edited to add: It appears Brunton will repair or replace this monocular for me!

Looks like the inside of the hose is 3/16 inch in diameter.

It goes back today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic printing","review":"The content of this edition may be wonderful, but the printing quality is like a bad xerox. what a pity that the publisher didn't purchase a quality job. I'm sending back the copy I received today. Ex-printer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great translation","review":"Looking at translation alone, this Bible is one of the best to be done in the 20th century. It is much easier to read than the older Douay-Rheims Catholic Bible, but its translation (particularly of the Psalms) is more flowing and beautiful than the New American Bible. The original Jerusalem Bible also does not contain the inclusive language added in the New Jerusalem Bible.Unfortunately, as several others have pointed out, the printing job is poor, and my copy (as well as the others I have seen) is bound extremely poorly, looking as though it could fall apart at any moment even in the store. I only wish the publisher would add some more introductions and footnotes, bind it better, and republish it as something better than this \\"Reader's Edition.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a Love Letter","review":"This Bible is written from a very close and patient study of ancient texts, and shows just how much the Creator loves His children.

I was glad to see a version available that was true to the original text, although missing the reference notes that were so helpful.I was horrified however, at the printing quality. The publisher, Doubleday, should be ashamed. This is worse than a bad Xerox job, some places in the text blurring from the ink running! The paper is shamefully inadequate for a text as important as this.Be prepared, you will love the original text, but be sorely disappointed by the quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for learning","review":"Great translation, easy to understand.

They really do exist, even if the idea sounds wild at first. Read the book.First, you should read \\"The Work of Invisible Helpers,\\" by Amber Tuttle, as it's a bigger book and explains a lot more. But C.W. Leadbeater's book is good too, just a lot shorter.Leadbeater, a famous theosophist/psychic who lived 90 years ago, talks about who Invisible Helpers are and what they do. It gives a different point of view.

It is being used to store wax paper, plastic wrap (the perfect height, by the way, to store these vertically), plastic baggie boxes, trash bag boxes and then some of our silicone bakeware in the \\"extra\\" space.It is big and spacious.If you purchase this in conjunction with the 3-shelf Configurations unit (the pine colored), it will stick out in relation to the 3-shelf unit. It is fine for us, as our pantry doors won't interfere with it, but it's close. The price you pay for the capacity, I guess.Could look better underneath that 3-shelf piece, but it's fine considering how much space it has.Anyhow, just wanted to tell you all that this thing is nice for kitchen pantry applications, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"One major flaw","review":"These are priced right and look very good. They appear to hold up well but have one major flaw. If you don't have at least one side attached to a shelf then it is wobbly and unstable making it hard to open or close. The larger one is more stable than the smaller one. I will have to put a piece of wood on the bracket to stabilize it against the wall. If you only have one or two of them and they are connected to a shelf on either side then I would give it a 5 rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Territory=Universe","review":"This is one of the best CD's I have ever heard!

The service from Filters-Now was very good with fast delivery. I won't hesitate to order from them again, either directly or through Amazon. The price seems high for a simple paper and metal filter, but it's clearly a profit center for the manufacturer.

I suppose it might have been more amusing in the mid \`80s when it first came out, but even back then I'm afraid I would have found its treatment of those with physical disabilities (\\"cappies\\", from \\"handicapped\\") just as offensive, even if intended as some further indictment of American society (to go along with the anti-consumerist slant throughout).Make no mistake: this is not science fiction. It's heavy-handed farce with some nifty neato gismos and a spaceship or two; a series of episodes from \\"The Jetsons\\" retold through a bad hangover.Read this one only if you want to see what Brian Herbert's style was like when he was only influenced by his father and had not yet fallen under the shadow of Kevin J.

It's probably more those most of us will need in a lifetime but it's always better to have more than you need.This roll has good adhesive and the hook and loop grip tight until you pull it apart.

If you are looking for more beginner patterns, try \\"Simple Glass Beading\\" by Dorothy Wood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of instruction, sloppy projects-----waste of money","review":"This is the most disappointing book I have ever read. The projects are ugly, with absolutely no design or loading of beads for a specific pattern or effect. All projects use 'bead soup' so there is nothing attractive. It's a very strange book.

I think the variety of ideas presented in terms of the supplies you can use makes for a good basis for one's creativity, therefore making this book worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thankfully, I didn't buy it","review":"Luckily, my small library has an interlibrary loan system. I've been searching for a good book about crocheting with beads. I must agree with another reviewer that the best part was the pictures of the antique pieces.How totally dissapointing! The author tells us how to make things in her style and her style only, which is what I call a \\"funky mess\\".I don't care whether I like the style or not. I had figured since it was called \\"A Beadwork How-To Book\\" that we'd learn basic techniques, but they are lost in the author's \\"creativity\\".Unless you love the look of messy, funky stuff and want to COPY this, I cannot recommend this book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Price is too high compare to other place","review":"This product was over priced!I was inform that the same item was able to be purchased for $30.I had to pay 38 something plus the shipping.Ridiculously over priced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Illuminati uses a movie about them to pretend to be a thing of the past","review":"This movie produced by those who brainwash us out in Hollywood, directed by the loser Ron Howard, starring the no talent Tomy Hanks, both involved with the globalist movement of the Illuminati.. telling people that the Illuminati is a thing of the ancient past as it NOW works to destroy humanity by way of collapsing economies..

Sometimes these scenes are redundant or unimportant to the main plot but bring more depth to the characters, or are just interesting if you are a big fan of the original work (as I am).The extent of the \\"extra footage\\" for \\"more movie\\" are a few shots of gore during the burning church scene.

Although I was reminded of a macabre scavanger hunt has the search for the clues and the cardinals raced through Rome, it was a good movie and entertaining. Hanks and the rest of the cast were good. I did have one question, and perhaps I missed the explanation in the movie. How did a priest, though born in Ireland, raised in Italy, adopted by an Italian, who served in the Italian military still speak with a strong Irish accent? Perhaps I will have to it watch again. I look forward to the next installment of this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hanks and Howard at their worst.","review":"Initially I came away from the film thinking this is perhaps an apology for the concern the Church had over the first film. However, in my contemplation, I became awkwardly curious why all of this star power tainted themselves in a Porky's II attempt at duplicating a movie that had conclusion.

I have not read the book Angels & Demons and am not sure I want to after this movie. I have read others reviews and it seems like I would enjoy it but this movie was SO HORRIBLE I'm not going to. First of all Ewan Mcgregor must think he's still Obi-Wan Kenobi or something because his whole character was just stupid. I enjoy Tom Hanks as an actor but his portrayal of Langdon in this movie seemed way to forced and rushed compared to the da Vinci code. The bits of \\"comic relief and irony\\" seemed so unrealistic and improbable all I could do was shake my head. If you value 2 1/2 hours do not watch this movie. Even Ron Howard's cinematography (which I am a fan of!)did not do Vatican City any justice of it's history and beauty.

Ron Howard should have started with \\"Angels\\" and then done \\"DaVinci\\". There's a progression where the main character is introduced in the first book and more things would've made sense had Howard made the movies in order. I will say that Howard learned a lot in the time between making the two movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exciting, fast-paced mystery thriller with plenty of plot twists","review":"This movie is an exciting mystery thriller, with plenty of action and plot twists. A pope dies and a new one must be chosen. A crime is committed and Tom Hanks is called in by the Vatican to help save the church itself. Ancient clues hidden in banished documents kept secret for decades in the Vatican archive vault may hold the key.

Saving Private Ryan, Apollo 13, Castaway, Joe vs the Volcano - now those are movies where Tom Hanks belongs and shines. But this is foolishness. I guess what with having done DaVinci Code (ridiculous, true, but a much better movie) and that they must have paid him 50bazillion dollars it shouldn't be a surprise, but I am disappointed.

It's incredible that with 40 GB of capacity in blu-ray discs the studios won't consider the spanish spoken customers and give them at least spanish subtitles. This Blu-ray disc, along with The Da Vinci Code (Extended Cut) and District 9 have the same problem.Every customer that buys a Blu-ray disc should receive ALL the possible information, extras, interviews, documentaries, trailers, EVERYTHING!!! about the movie that is buying (and that includes subtitles .... that's my opinion)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most painful book to movie conversion ever!","review":"I am an avid reader, and have thus seen many movies that were based on novels. I understand quite well that the story must be changed in order to make the movie work within its time limit. For the first time in my life, however, I was ready to cry when I left the movie theater. I would like to believe that it is probably a perfectly lovely movie if you have not read the book. Unfortunately for me, I felt betrayed that afternoon. It seems that the screenwriters missed the entire point of the book or perhaps failed to read it at all.The short of the matter is this - don't buy this book for someone just because you know they read and enjoyed the book.

A huge team working on the antimatter project?? It was supposed to be a secret between Vittoria and her father. Oh wait, he's not her father, just her partner? Wow. It just got worse from there... Leaving out the director of CERN completely, having the fourth cardinal survive and become pope, making the hassassin out to be nothing more than a hitman, the list goes on and on. And what I thought was a main part of the storyline... The media aspect was also left out. It seemed like the whole point in the book was that the camerlengo was trying to get the word out about God, and he was using the media to do so. Anyway, all of that said, I suppose this could have been a good movie if you didn't read the book. I myself wish I had never bothered seeing the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad at all","review":"The movie is a departure from the book but all the highlights get addressed. Fast moving entertainment and very enjoyable. It seems a little fractured at times but the story line continues pretty well. Am glad I read/listened (Audible) to the book first - made things come together better during the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts slow, and the pace is even slower","review":"This is a very overrated movie that starts off slowly and continues with a slow pace throughout the movie. In fact, nothing happens for two hours, then it gets interesting in the last 15 minutes of the movie. Luckily, I didn't pay for the movie ticket when I saw the movie because it was a complete waste of 2 hours and some change, with the exception of the last 15 minutes. Perhaps its because this movie isn't my cup of tea.Keep in mind that a lot of people liked this movie, but I sure didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Very entertaining film. Acting was good, the plot gripping. An improvement over the last one. A very nice mysterious thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture Quality Was Atrocious","review":"This is a review focusing not on the \\"Angels and Demons\\" movie as an artistic work, but on the quality of the transfer to Blu-ray.We watched this film with a number of friend and I was simply aghast with the quality of the image. The day time scenes were decent enough, but the night scenes were murky and muddy. What was worse was the fact that there was ghosting of the image on my screen as if the compression had been done at a low quality setting. The delightful crispness I've grown accustomed to with most Blu-ray transfers was completely absent here... to the point that I double checked the disc to make sure that it was, in fact, a Blu-ray disc.Whoever was in charge of the transfer of this film should be ashamed. It simply is not up to the Blu-ray standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK Movie","review":"Just being about the vibe of the movie - I expected more after all the great reviews and the hype. It was just an ok movie. Not too boring, but not enough action and suspense. I just didn't get a feel of excitement from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster sequel to THE DA VINCI CODE.","review":"Not that the first film was a classic or anything, but it was still mildly interesting. This film begins well, but then devolves into a ridiculous pseudo-mystery and becomes tedious as it goes on.This is Ron Howard and Tom Hanks in need of a hefty paycheck, and nothing more. Hanks' Langdon is a bore, devoid of any detectable human emotion.This franchise needs to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Embarrassing! I did like the Davinci Code movie actually. It was not great but kind of OK and did its job. This movie is totally embarrassing: it is a mix of science and religion with a completely hysterical wild plot that you cannot follow if you do not stop the movie all the time to check out facts. Who has the time if to look up these facts and to interconnect them to make a book or a movie? They should get a job where they are needed! Also it is at moments too dark (the way it is filmed) and gruesome in the way the murders are depicted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't watch it if you expect it to mirror the book...","review":"I liked the movie. However, I was unable to appreciate it as it left the book too far behind. Too many missing characters and plot deviations."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like fiction, this is for you.","review":"Brown has time and again attempted to pass the historical references in his stories as fact; however, once again we have a story from Brown that is full of historical inaccuracies. All you have to do is just a tiny bit of research to pick most of them out. So, if you like fictional stories that claim historical accuracy when they are not accurate at all, then this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buller? Buller? Buller?","review":"This is a bunch of BULL! How can you explain leaving out THE MAIN VILLIAN OF THE BOOK!? That's like leaving out Lex Luthor of a Superman comic, Joker from Batman etc, how do you leave out the villian of the novel when it's the villian that has a vendetta with the church that's displayed in the movie!? The \\"hashassin\\" of the movie was just a sideshow character no where near the importance that's giving to him in the book, this movie was made strickly to please hollywood and the church."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I purchased this video as a \\"USED - LIKE NEW\\" video. To my surprise, when it arrived it was nothing but a copy of the original. If I wanted to buy an illegal copy I would have talked to my IT man at work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in good condition","review":"Though the DVD plays fine, the inside of the case had what looks like pop spilled and dried in it and the outside of the case (and paper description) is damaged (paper torn, wrinkled and maybe rerolled flat to put back in plastic). I didn't even want to touch the case with a bare hand until I wiped it off with a clorox wipe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not that into it","review":"The blu ray played great. I'm not a blu ray fan. Have a lot of bad experiences with them not playing right. The movie is good. It has a good story to it. I'm sure a lot of people enjoy it. Special because it keeps your brain working.But it's not for me. I'm not a bright person and this movie puts me to sleep. I have this movie added to my collection because my husband likes it."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 hours I'll never get back.","review":"A real waste of time. The book was excellant and I could hardly put it down. I could hardly tell this was supposed to be based on the book. The worst movie I've seen since Showgirls way back when. If you would like a free copy of this movie look in my garbage can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book","review":"If you've ever read the book. Please don't waste your time or money on this DVD. They changed the story dramatically it was not very good at all. I was very disappointed by the movie. I understand things need to be changed for film but they changed some very strange things that just ruined it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I've seen lately","review":"This movie does a good job of following the book. As usual,with Hanks and Euwan and Ron Howard, it couldn't miss. The acting was great, the suspense terrific.One of the best movies I've seen in quite a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoy the movie without comparing to the book","review":"Many of the negative reviews go on and on about differences between the book and the movie. I find this ridiculous - a book is NOT a screenplay or vice-versa.Watch and enjoy the movie for its own merits. Simply put, the movie is good entertainment.If you insist on comparing the movie to the book, perhaps the book should be rated poorly because it's not in full color, 1080p with surround sound like the movie is. Sound silly? I agree...just as silly as rating a movie poorly because it's not the book.Do yourself a favor and ignore the reviews that rate the movie based only on how it compares to the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...]","review":"Angels & Demons is the sequel to the Da Vinci Code, and while it's generally said that Da Vinci Code was better, I disagree. When Da Vinci Code came out, I had just seen National Treasure, and there were so many similarities, that I didn't enjoy it as much as I should have. Angels & Demons does what every sequel aspires to do. It takes the characters we like and puts them in a similar but different story. Tom Hanks is once again terrific, bringing an intensity that few others can match. Following the clues lost in time and the twists and turns thrown in by writer, Dan Brown, Angels & Demons is most defiantly a sequel that lives up to the first one and also gives you something to talk about. What else could you ask for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite movie","review":"VERY well done, faithfull to the book. Put it in (make sure you don't have any interruptions - you won't WANT them) and HANG ON."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paint by numbers/cookie cutter - blow the main plot loser","review":"Not a complete disaster, but loses the dynamic feel of the book. Many of the details are changed including some major plot points and for no apparent reason other than to shorten the movie. The progression of the clues moves in a paint-by-numbers fashion. I was looking forward to the movie and had high expectations given the director and actors. Very dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"It is not that often I feel my IQ level goes down after watching a movie, but I think we are talking at least 3 points here. This movie is utter crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Secret Path of Illumination","review":"First of all I have not read the book, but this is one tense thriller. Essentially a pursuit film as you follow Langdon and company as they race against the clock of five hours to rescue four Cardinals in different locations and prevent the destruction of Rome. Symbologist Langdon is able to figure out that the secret path of illumination and its symbols are at historical landmarks throughout the city. Langdon also gets himself in to some of the most dangerous situations in this film. The screenplay also has numerous clues and history references for solving this mystery hunt. this is a great film for your collection if you like action mysteries and highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to be Missed","review":"I'm not usually a fan of this type of film, but I am an avid Tom Hanks fan. I started watching this fairly late last night, and it had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish with nary a yawn. I liked it much better than \\"da vinci code\\". I reserve my 5 star ratings for my over the top favorite movies i.e., \\"Out of Africa\\", \\"Fried Green Tomatoes\\", \\"Dr. Zhivago\\", etc., so a 4 rating is an excellent on \\"my chart\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"lcd television","review":"satisfied with product and shipping was right on time even earlier than expected. product was new in original box and all items included."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used tv","review":"I ordered this tv new.

There are times I push the buttons on the remote and the TV doesn't respond.

Customer service phone customer service said it's not covered. After escalating to Executive Customer Service (800) 522-7341 they said we will send out a repair person for a free one-time fix for capacitors -- IF that is the problem, Samsung will cover it.

I have had the tv for 2 years the quality of picture is good, sounds OK. The only complaint me and thousands of other people are having is that the conductors on the board go bad. Basically at some point can b a week after you buy it or 3 years the TV will stop turning on right away, it will take about 5 min, then a few weeks later 10 min then a week later 20min till it does not turn on its at all.. Now you can at this point pay Samsung 300+ dollars to fix it more then half the price of the tv, or you can fix it yourself if you do not mind pulling the board out of it and soldering a few new conductors on.. Any way its and epic fail on Samsung part, guess i should spend the extra money and get a Sony.."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 years and it won't turn on anymore","review":"Like some other posters, the common Samsung problem started occuring recently where it took longer and longer to turn on. Yesterday this TV finally died and just makes clicking noises. Obviously warranty is out of the question, and having it fixed by a professional would almost cost as much as a new tv.

The last promise from Samsung is someone will call us to schedule an appointment to replace it. If it weren't for the slow customer service, I would give the TV 5 stars.

There's nothing groundbreaking about it; rather, it's a throwback to the action films of the 80's. Once again, Bruce Willis as John McClane pulls off stunts that would do Captain America proud but with plenty of bruises and blood stains to show for it. The plot concerns a computer terrorist who has seized control of the United States infrastructure and once it gets going, it's non-stop action from start to finish. I'm not sure what sets this film apart from so many other action films that just become tiresome before the final explosions detonate, but I found it to be a hugely entertaining adrenaline rush and a more fitting send-off to this character than the tepid \\"Die Hard with a Vengeance.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not getteing older, I'm getting better (from an old commercial)","review":"Bruce proves once again, old guys can still rock and roll.

Not only is every scene in this movie impossible and the premise absurd, it isn't even made well. If you don't believe me, check how many injuries Bruce Willis sustains in any given scene and see how many of them even carry over to the next scene. Cuts magically heal and stop bleeding, head wounds just disappear, limps go away, his hands stop bleeding...it just goes on and on. Even his co- star gets shot in the knee and is fine seconds later. The absurdity never ends. This movie insults anyone with a brain."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"Mel Gibson really outdoes himself in this flick. Fantastic effects!

Since it is number 4 in the series, I was expecting it to be a little ho hum, been there, done that.

Put a gun to his head...I liked the villain until the time he robs Social Security.(already the government and corporates are busy trying to rob social security from us, and now this...)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best movie this summer!","review":"Okay I know many people have said this already but this show just goes back to basics. I'm sick of all the far out big budget super hero movies that have been spewing out in cinemas. Yes this show is predictable but hey... nothing beats good ol' Bruce getting his revenge on the bad guys who kidnapped his daughter.The best part of the whole show is just watching how he makes them regret their actions because you know he'll never die and that he's going win win win.The only down side is the exaggerated aeroplance scene (don't want to reveal too much), but overall, the traditional action and butt kicking makes up for it.Buy it as a good brainless thought free movie night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timothy Olyphant is a great villain","review":"I loved how they brought the Die Hard franchise into the 21st century.

I tried watching the movie on three separate occasions and just could never get into it. The Mac TV Ad guy Justin Long as a computer hacker was less than original casting and made it feel like one long computer advertisement. Bruce Willis does his best with a forgettable script. For pure entertainment, I recommend the first two Die Hard films over this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"#4 is a hit","review":"This Die Hard compares to the original and is better than the 2nd or 3rd!

It's incredibly far fetched, but thats the nature of many action movies, and it's great to see Bruce back in the Die Hard saddle.However, like another reviewer, I was shocked to find the movie was the theatrical PG-13 version. No unrated version, which is a serious omission, so I'm going try and return mine. I'll stick with my unrated DVD, which looks good enough to ignore the 'edited' blu ray version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wheeeeeee!!!!!! What A Ride!!!!!","review":"Live Free, Die Hard had me grinning from ear to ear. Because of the overblown trailers, I feared the movie would contain only explosions and car crashes, with no plot. Thankfully, this movie is well done, with a good story, good enough acting, fantastic lighting, and good sets. And how refreshing to see a movie not reliant on computer-generated special effects. This film is a testosterone feast a la 300. Highly recommended for old school action movie buffs. This is a classic.Through the whole movie, one thing drove me crazy. For the life of me, I could not recall where I had seen the actor who played the young hacker. He looked so familiar. My husband came down to watch the last part with me. He pointed the actor out as the Mac in the Mac & PC ads!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not like the others","review":"Kind of like the latest Bond movie, okay, but not really a movie you can watch over and over. Rent dont buy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too over the top.","review":"I have liked some of the previous Die Hard films, but this one was just way way over the top. The plot was beyond preposterous and some of the action scenes were just ridiculous. I think the Transformers was more realistic than this. I don't mind suspending logic, but when it gets to the \\"silly\\" level I lose interest. The thing that gets me with these films is the same old re-hashed formula they use over and over again. They make the cops/feds have zero IQ's and the bad guys are geniuses. That is, until McClane shows up. Then the bad guys all of a sudden have zero IQ's and he's the genius. One of these days Hollywood is going to shock me and come up with something new and original. Well, maybe not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Die Hard Movie","review":"Live Free or Die Hard is a crowning jewel in the Die Hard series. It can be argued that it is the best Die Hard movie in many ways. The plot is grander, scarier and the stakes significantly higher. Cyber terrorism's nightmarish consequences make the audience stay on the edge of their seats for the better part of the movie.Bruce Willis as the NYPD detective John McLane is as much an action star in Live Free or Die Hard as he was in the original act of 1988. All that has changed is the scope. Indeed the grandeur of the action sequences including his bringing down a helicopter with a car and an F35 with a truck leave you gasping for more.Overall, a must see action movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decline Hard!","review":"After a 12-year absence, Bruce Willis returns as New York detective John McClane in this disappointing \\"Die Hard\\" sequel. Willis delivers the \\"yippee ki yay\\" goods, but the film lacks a strong cast, coherent scripting and the firm hand of director John McTiernan. The cyber-terrorist plot is a letdown after McClane's cat-and-mouse games with the Gruber brothers - further hindered by cartoonish action sequences and a ludicrous climax. Though slightly better than \\"Die Hard 2,\\" this fourth installment doesn't measure up to the Willis-McTiernan collaborations."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOULD'VE KILLED FOR THE UNRATED VERSION ON BLURAY","review":"SPOILER:Don't get me wrong, this was an excellent action film. It has everything: Guns, Helicopters, car-chases, car-chases down elevators, French Ninjas, and one bald man. But the unrated version is simply the way the film was supposed to be. For anyone who has watched ANY of the Die Hard's, you know that the film needs to be rife with M*****F*****'s (which have been editted out, EVEN AT THE CLIMAX! I almost yelled at my TV)I am hoping for an Unrated Blu-Ray version of this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dying Hardest","review":"Live Free or Die Hard is the flashiest and most outrageous of the Die Hard series but it has not lost the original candor and humor which makes the older three classic action films. Bruce Willis delivers a great performance that makes you forget his age and he's in terrific shape (if I'm in that good of shape at 50, I'll be perfectly content).Everything in this film is slick and clean, though it requires a healthy suspension of disbelief to enjoy. It is the action film of the nerd, but the old-school cop delivering old-school justice to the villain wins out in the end, like all good Die Hard movies.This movie falls slightly below Die Hard with a Vengeance, but only because Samuel Jackson is not present. The villains are great, and the femme fatale is stunning in every respect.Buy it. Watch it. You won't regret it. If you know and love the old Die Hards, this one will be right up your alley. It's different in tone, less gritty, but still Die Hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is this a comedy??","review":"Impossible stunts (check)....outlandish action sequences (check)....profanity filled tirades (check)....everything you love about the Die Hard films is back bigger and louder than ever! This movie is a riot, I laughed almost non-stop until the end. The stunts are jaw dropping and way way way over the top to the point of being ridiculous, but I still had fun watching it. It is even more entertaining if you are drunk or high.This addition to the Die Hard franchise will be hard to top. But does Bruce Willis have it in him for a fith Die Hard movie? I dont know, he was looking kinda old in this movie, but you never know. Even better, maybe Lucy McClain can take the helm!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Non stop action + Big explosions + Outrageously illogical = worth renting","review":"This movie has non-stop action and big explosions. Yet it's so outrageously illogical that it's funny in many scenes. For example the scene on the brigde where Bruce did a lot of dangerous jumping and fighting. However, he got no serious injuries! No broken bones! There's no suspense at all.I found the first installment is more suspenseful.It's still worth renting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull book- full of other people's information","review":"Of all the books on self injury, this is one of the least informative.

It's strictly for the novice student. Some of the major personna are glossed over, or in some cases, not even mentioned.(Dr. Samuel Mudd for one) A good portion of the tape covers the monuments to Lincoln, which doesn't add to the story of the murder. I was pleased to see some of the goofy conspiracy theories de-bunked, including the one claiming that the Vatican wanted Lincoln dead. Or that Stanton hatched the whole thing and had to scramble to cover it all up. Sounds like some of that mindless dribble on \\"Coast to Coast\\" with George Norri.

The topic is too wide and I was wondering how much time did Michael Porter spend on studying the field before transposing his competition oriented theory onto healthcare.I was bit disappointed because when I saw the content I knew he didn't study is well enough. Take this for example on page 48- 'Most patients are actively discouraged from seeking and securing the best value care.'Reality is most patients do not seek best value. This coming from a third pary insurer who put up wbesite to compare prices. Insured members just don't use it. Most patients wouldn't be able to distuingish valuable care from punctuality of doctor or courtesy of office staff.Dr.Porter assumed that consumers and supplier behavior is similar as in other fields and has really erred over there.

I have used Illy espresso pods before with great results, but these pods were a huge dissapointment. I tried six pods out of the bag when I first got the pod pack(since there is a random mix of all different types). Each cup was really poor. The pods themselves are packed very loosley, so that the espresso ends up super weak and tastes like a bad bitter cup of coffee.

I thought I would give some a try and Pod Merchant seems to carry them all (I lived in Italy for several years and Pod Merchant has some Italian coffee brands that even I've never heard of).The sampler packs are a fun way to try different brands. Some are better than others, but trying them out will keep you from later ordering 100 of something you don't like.The order was processed quickly and they were delivered no problem via UPS. There were also a couple of \\"freebie\\" pods and a coupon as a thank you for the order which I thought was a nice touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great selection, find your favorites!","review":"The best sampling of pods I've run across. Price works out to be about 58.3 cents per pod. What's really nice is that I didn't know that you could get single-origin pods, and at least two of the brands in this sampler offer them, so it's great to taste the differences in the single-origin coffees as well as the differences in roasts between manufacturers. Find what you like, and then you can get larger quantities of the pods you really like. No joke about taking notes, either. It helps to keep track of which ones you like and dislike... There is definitely variation in the flow through the different pod brands too- so find what works well with your machine too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice selection","review":"If you are just starting out w/ espresso, or looking for a new brand-THIS IS FOR YOU!

They had a \\"what's the problem\\" response when I expressed disappointment with the lack of variety and the expired goods, and they were always traveling, so communication was slow.

I sing in opera choruses so I am not dancing in them, but I am really glad that I do not have to. Do not waste your money on these shoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for.","review":"First of all they were too small and I am having to buy a whole new pair, a different shoe altogether because I was not thrilled with these.They have a smooth rubber sole instead of the hard leather you normally find in character shoes.The upper material does not give very well which makes breaking them in next to impossible."},{"rating":"1","title":"mine didn't run small","review":"After reading all of the reviews, I decided to order these shoes for my daughter. They DID NOT run small, so the size larger that I ordered was too big. Now I have to return them, and there isn't time to wait for a new pair before her show opens. Other than the size and inconvenience, they seem to be nice shoes. She didn't wear them, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"These shoes run very small","review":"These shoes run about 1 full size too small. I ended up paying about twice as much for the pair I now have. I purchased them from a local dance shop in town. They are much more comfortable than these.When returning these, you have to pay the shipping both ways (when you originally purchased them and when you return them). I was out just as much money in shipping fees, as it would have cost me to go ahead and purchase the more expensive, more comfortable shoes locally. I don't recommend these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design","review":"These clippers cut very well but the curved design of the base and the lever make holding them very uncomfortable. Your fingers want to keep sliding toward the cutting edge. Basically, it's a poor design and I would not recommend them. Instead, spend less money and get those without the curved based and lever."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am very Disappointed","review":"I bought the collection of dvd's just for some episodes about raptors. Guess what? You can find all the most fascinating episodes with velociraptors and ortodones only on the VHS. I was like WTF? Can't they publish those series on dvd? HELLOO! I am the fan of the ''PALEOWORLD''. BUT we don't use VHS's anymore. Publish those series on DVD or blue-ray! PLEEEEEEEEEEEEEASE!Update:I bought this NOT EVEN of the collection, on August 31, 2008.

I have yet to expose him to this album for fear of him disowning me. Ether Bunny, the side project of Daniel Vahnke of the industrial band Vampire Rodents, is a bouillabaisse of jazz samples assembled over programmed drum beats. The results are surprising. The music is kind of difficult to put into words. It has some of the basic concepts of jazz, but it lacks the improvisational aspects, replacing them with the structure of industrial, hip hop, and other forms of dance music. The artwork and song titles are indicative of the demented children's music idiom that Daniel Vahnke also brings into a lot of Vampire Rodents' music. Ether Bunny is highly entertaining in a weird fashion and probably not for everyone. This may appeal to fans of industrial or acid jazz music...or not. Let's just say that if you like the samples provided, then you would probably enjoy the whole album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating woman!","review":"I think Lana Turner wrote a wonderful autobiography.Her life was very complicated, interesting and glamorous.She covers everything in this book.She starts with her childhood, and talks about how she really was discovered.

She openly discusses the scandals and questions people have about events in her life.She also goes into the difference between her real self and \\"Lana Turner\\" the movie star.I think this is an in-depth, interesting autobiography by a beautiful, smart and talented movie star that is absolutley worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hypnotist's Stooge","review":"Self-serving predictability is to be expected from this kind of thing but I was surprised to find it so completely, almost improbably, dull considering the life it purports to recount. Synopsis: A frigid romantic stumbles blindly into cinema, seven (or eight) marriages, two abortions, and a homocidal daughter. Reading the love letters Turner sent her murdered gigolo will tell you more than anything you'll find in this publicist's dream account of a battered spouse, either about the murder or the woman herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lot of Fun","review":"This was a great product for the grandkids during their visit.

Transliteration of the original Sanskrit text provides scholarly readers a chance to understand the technique and direction of the translation. Drawing on the commentaries of Shankara, Ramanuja and Madhva, Zaehner helps the student and interested reader come to an understanding of the great work by interconnecting the major verses of the Gita. With help from some Upanisads, the author illumines the theistic intent of the Speaker, Sri Krishna, through references to numerous ancient theistic commentaries. Refuting the monism of Shankara, Zaehner establishes the clear meaning of the Gita, placing it as a the greatest Monotheistic work of India and, perhaps, of the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I have seen better examples of witch- and mage-craft in movies like The Craft, and shows like Charmed.

It reminds me of what Ken Burns has done in some of his documentaries, where you learn as much about life in the times as you do about the specific topic. The book is a wonderful and easy way to learn about the wife in different times, cultures and religions, and also the possibilities of what it might mean to be a wife in the future. Excellent reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what \\"blues rock\\" is meant to be","review":"A previous reviewer lamented that this release was not in Moore's class blues realm. This is blues rock as the term should be defined. It certainly bears no resemblance to grunge rock. He borrows from Hendrix (\\"World Of Confusion\\" starts out almost note for note just like \\"Manic Depression\\"), and SRV, and maybe even a little Kenny Wayne Shepherd. This is not a rock release, although it is being billed as that. The first 2 songs on the cd are outstanding and grab you right by the throat. Gary Moore is constantly changing styles, as evidenced by the aptly titled \\"Different Beat\\", and if you want to hear nothing but straight blues by this too often overlooked guitarist, then don't buy this. This is a blues rock cd, pure and simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Scars\\"? Another step back!","review":"Gary Moore has become one of the great rock/electric blues guitarists of all time. The man can play that Les Paul!! But, with the release of \\"Scars\\" it seems that Gary is trying to please the grunge generation or whatever \\"weird rock\\" is called today! Gary can really sing, but on this album he's pretending again? His singing sounds pathetic! The guitar work is almost great, but not 100% up to par. This cd makes one to believe that Gary Moore has run out of ideas? I'd be in favor of an instrumental album next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST OF THE BEST","review":"Gary has out done himself again. The first 4 songs are hard rock songs with a blues twist, the Guitar on \\"Rectify\\" is Godly and then the album mellows a little with song 5. After that he plays with your mind on 6 & 7 playing a tasteful tribute to Stevie Ray and Jimi. \\"My baby\\" for Stevie Ray and \\"World on Confusion\\" for Jimi which will remind you of \\"Manic Depression\\" Song 8 \\"Ball&Chain;\\" is just a great 12 minute jam session. 9 and 10 are cool also. It's just to bad the U.S. does not know how great Gary is. I wish I could give it ten stars. Just as great is John Sykes Just proving that Thin Lizzy will always remain the greatest Guitar Band ever.BUY IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GARY SOUNDS REAL Mad!!","review":"Gary new cd Scars,my first reaction was , this guy sounds pissed off!!< It sounds like someone kicked Gary in the shins before every take ... amazing energy.

Rarely a day goes by that I don't have a GM CD playing in the car, the stereo, and/or the PC.HOWEVER, I've got no idea what this CD's all about. It sounds like a hybrid of Howlin' Wolf, King Crimson, the White Stripes, and Barry Manilow. In a word: awful! Gary, my friend, you're breaking my heart!

I am a very open minded listener,(See Son Volt,I have several Gary Moore CDs).This CD has no redeeming qualities.

Themes of civilzation vs. savagery and the untouched beauty of the tropics vs. development are found throughout Green Mansions, but these issues are encased in a love story that holds notes of mystery, fantasy, and romanticism.While the novel provides a good introduction to the naturalist writings of this period (and a much easier read than most of the more scientific prose being written at the time), I thought that the ending was not as developed as the rest of the book, in addition to being highly unsatisfying. The novel does, however, offer wonderful descriptions of the wild forests of the region, and develops fantastical characters, particularly in the case of Rima, the primary female character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time, love or money.","review":"I took a UCLA extension class in the early '80s called \\"Sneak Previews\\" which was self explanatory: it was essentially viewing movies before they were released to the general public. This was one of them, and it turned out to be one of the biggest pieces of cinematic crap I have ever had the dishonor of sitting through. Ornella Muti is gorgeous as all-get-out, but she cannot act to save her life, at least in this stinker. The fact that this person is the only thing I can remember about this movie says it all.

In only a few hundred pages an epic tale of conquest, brief (oh so brief) insurrection, and triumph unfolds. Sturgeon is one of those precious few science fiction writers that elevates the genre above the social stigma hoisted upon it, and he does it with style. This work is not just good science fiction, its great fiction period. His writing style is fluent and dignified. To Marry Medusa is science fiction condensed into its purest, most moving form, and trust me, I know my science fiction. Please, please pick up this book and give it a chance.

Containing a bit of \\"connected\\" living tissue, consumption of a spore by a local life form would intantly convert the planet's population to Medusa's way of thinking.When a spore falling to Earth is consumed by a alienated, raging derelict, he alone is converted. The book follows his/its efforts to find out why humanity is resistant to Medusa's sway.Meanwhile, we peek into the lives of others, leading typical human (and therefore, for many, unhappy) lives, who will soon play a part in a remarkable drama._To Marry Medusa_ is a sort of defiant, humanist reply to Arthur C.

It's a perfect carrying around case. Because if its compactness, I also carry it together with my small camera bag whenever I need the space of my bag for extra lens, in particular the Panasonic 100-300mm.

After page 200 or so he frequently lapses into what can best be described as listing, in no particular order, strings of otherwise unrelated facts.

Every song on this album has tension, buildup, and a connection between a band and an audience that is rarely seen.

If you like rock n roll then definitely check out this cd. I am stupefied that James never soared into the stratosphere of rock superstardom.

Before getting this, I read reviews on a number of other similar products on Amazon, and some of the other products were said to have a foul odor - not so with this mat, perhaps because it's made in the U.S.A.

In other word: even the much critized Tamron 28-200 is better. Very likely a 28-300 even with reasonable compromise would unreasonably stretch the budget and perhaps the OEM of Vivitar (Vivitar does not have his lens factory) did the best they could for that money. I am curious, how good or bad is the 28-300 offering from Tamron. The Vivitar Series 1 IMHO does not deserve the \\"Series 1\\" name.

It has a cheap one-piece plastic case that is hard to open, and the hinge is just folded-over plastic. This does not inspire confidence in either its accuracy or durability. Additionally, the hinge does not stay at the angle you need. It just flops around, requiring one more thing to manage when navigating. The angle of the mirror needs to be between 50 and 70 degrees to prevent parallax error. Silva says as much as 5 degrees of error can be introduced by an incorrect angle. A loose, floppy hinge is a deal breaker for me.The base plate is black, not clear, compromising its utility when laying it on a map.It has a clinometer, but it hangs up, requiring tapping to read.Its compactness can be a drawback if your eyes are less than perfect or light is low.It has a viewing slot in the lower part of the mirror, which I really like, being ex-Army.

Obviously inspired by the director's days playing with his plastic Vikings and Indians on the living room carpet rather than historical research, Pathfinder isn't even enjoyably brain-dead. The cinematography is murky, the action scenes lack rhythm, and the blood and guts (not to mention nudity) quotient is disappointingly low for an R-rated film. Although this film apparently got bad press before it was even released, the critical dogpiling it received was justified, unlike the extremely underrated 13th Warrior.

The Cinematography, the clever script, that sometimes is very cliche, yet very unique in others. The acting by both vikings and indians alike. But in the end, most will like it as a fun sword movie. I don't know why we get so few sword movies that aren't huge epics, maybe people don't want to put in the money for only a limited gain, or because of laziness in coming up with unique ways to make a sword movie. This one stands above most others, belonging with conan, highlander, etc. as excellent sword flicks that are tons of fun.

Having wasted two hours of my life and nearly ten bucks, I will hopefully save everyone reading this your time and money. I left the movie with not one good thing to say about it. Say what you will about 300, at least it entertained me. Pathfinder makes 300 look like the best epic action film to ever be made. The dialogue is beyond the worst I ever heard in a feature film and the acting is good for more than a few laughs. The action scenes are the main reason I wanted to see the film, but they weren't inventive and it was hard to tell what was going on. If you must see this movie, catch it on TV for free.

This Hermit Crab doesn't feel like its supposed to be based on fact, as it says at the beginning that it's a legend. That's why a lot of what Ghost does is improbable. Also, the trailers were misleading because the movie wasn't about vengence. It was about a person trying to come to terms with their inner demons that stop everyone from understanding their true self and their true path. Like the Pathfinder, who is not who you think it is, says: \\"A wolf lives in every man's heart, fighting between love and hate.\\"\\"Which one wins?\\" Ghost asks.\\"Whichever one you feed the most,\\" Pathfinder answers.This is the true message of the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"This is what film-making is about!

Hey, lets see if scary, overblown Viking costumes emotes something in the audience... no?... how about a few slow-motion weapon strikes with spewing blood... no?... maybe some senseless torture of characters you don't know the names of or would even care about if you did?

It also excels at making the Vikings uber bad-guys. I would NOT want to be a Viking.The DVD also includes some interesting featurettes and a commentary track (I think the director sees more artisitc flair in the film than I was getting).

The story is simple enough. Unlike 10,000BC, it doesn't make the mistake of not really giving us enough action. The problem here is the directing of the action. Darkness is fine, but I still like seeing what I'm.. seeing. The armor the vikings was so convoluted and generic looking, they were like the old timey equivalent of the convoluted Transformers from the live action movie. Take a camera. Put it in a burlap sack filled with bones, pots, pans, dirt, and some blood. Now give the sack a good shake and splice the footage into this movie in place of the action scenes.

He cant carry a movie yet.The native americans all looked hispanic, they had a strong anglo accent, and they all had teeth that made them look like the chic from the orbit commercials (anyone heard of make-up).Im not going to write any spoilers but this movie had some serious plot holes.

All I wanted was a paperback set of Jane Austen books. Seems simple enough. Apparently not, the first set brought up says paperback in the title but way later the actual description claims it is an audio book???The customer reviews, supposedly for this book, were a mix of reviews from 6 different Jane Austen products. Hardback, paperback, video, etc.The actual description of the title was so buried in screen after screen of add ons, reviews, additional suggestions, etc it took awhile to find and then it was not a review of the product but an overall review of Jane Austen books. Most of the Jane Austen sets and compilations did not even list what titles were included. Come on folks! You would think that would be common sense information.Amazon Management - Please Read This.

Not listed as a compendium.","review":"I was searching for the collected works in separate volumes. This failed to mention that it was a compendium and therefore I was stuck buying this and also the books I really wanted somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to read paperback","review":"After watching the Jane Austin Book Club, my wife and I decided to read the complete Jane Austin books to better understand the first movie. I purchased a paperback edition from Amazon.com, which arrived in a few days. The book, published by Penguin Paperbacks, has an uneven cut in the binding. The pages stick out like it had come apart and been re-glued. The paper, since it is a paperback, is an off white that with the small print is too hard for my aging eyes to read, although younger readers may not have a problem. In order to read the books, I went online and found the entire series for free since it is in the public domain. I am reading the book on my laptop instead where I can increase the font size for easier reading.The stories, of course, are worthwhile reading. More is understood than just what the videos on PBS and BBC shows, as is always the case when comparing books to film. But, for $[...], it is nice to have a hard copy of the books."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can you live without it??","review":"This is the most lovely book ever. How did I ever get along before I started reading Jane Austen?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautifully presented volume","review":"Jane Austen is Jane Austen--no surprises here :)What I do wish to say, is this: this is a beautifully bound and presented book.It's a good quality paperback (nice thick cover), with beautiful rough-cut/uneven edges to the pages, a very pretty cover, and it looks lovely on the shelf and in the hand. It opens nicely (without the stiffness you sometimes find in very large books).Although not overly bulky for such a large collection, it achieves this by having long pages with a lot of text. This is my only reservation (albeit slight): if you have difficulty with very full/long pages, perhaps this edition is not for you. There is still enough space to leave it readable, but it's a consideration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Editing","review":"I love Jane Austen. But this edition is full of spelling and text errors.

Having done this I then treated myself to a purchased book (Danish detective thriller).Its worked well, I had a glitch with the on-line facilities, but this resolved itself within 48 hours. So Kindle works well and I feel in control of my budget.Jane Austin is a blast! It's a real eye opener about social protocol in the 18th century."},{"rating":"1","title":"No menu? Really?","review":"It may just be me but I cannot get anything but Sense and Sensibility to come up on my kindle. There is no menu, no way to flip to the next book.

Better to just buy the books separately."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I was looking for.","review":"It was a good value and it's easy to read, with its margins and I love the texture of the paper.

What a great idea! Beautifully bound, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete Edition from Bloomsbury as pictured above","review":"This book is certainly not as advertised. The dust jacket AND cover clearly state that it contains the complete novels of Jane Austen. It enumerates all seven in both locations. It never gives any indication whatsoever that this might be the first volume of two. Indeed the first printed page declares that it is in one volume.Despite all this, the table of contents only lists the first four books from the cover. That is all that is contained within. No 'Persuasion.' No 'Lady Susan.' And most important to me, no 'Northanger Abbey' -- the book I was planning to read immediately. Amazing.Please be aware that the Bloomsbury Books edition (Under license from Penguin dated 1994) with the cover as shown on this page (with the customer image from Dilli) has these substantial defects.

I can't lose it this way :)It truly is wonderful to be able to access jane Austen's novels without having to search through the whole house.Besides, I saved money by buying this compilation. Maybe I could have gotten the individual novels on-line for a cheaper price, but how much more would I have paid for shipping?What condition would they have arrived in?Would they have looked as good on my Coffee table?Could they have doubled as a night stand for my aero bed when I went camping?It really is a good deal.

They both went out quick, I thought my amp went into protection so I stopped at a gas station, amp was on and functioning. I come home and hook up an old 12, it thumps. Hook them back up, one is producing zero sound and the other one is producing an extremely low faint of sound. It's blown. Figured when one failed the power to the other probably shot up killing it completely in a fraction of a second. These subs suck.

I thought this would get back to the heart of kickboxing, but I was very disappointed. I knew bands were needed, but I thought it would still be a great workout without them. There was only one person on the DVD that didn't use bands, and there is no point in doing this DVD without bands. I did the whole 55 minute workout and wasn't even out of breath. Even with the bands, this workout is not kickboxing... not what Taebo should be!

However, it will come at the cost to irreparably damaging your shoulders and knees. His shoulder exercises require lifting bands above the shoulders --something every orthopedist says you should NEVER DO; his leg exercises require constant squatting --another exercise that, if done too often and with repetition, will cause great damage to your knees. After a year doing these tapes, I required cortisone shots to remedy the bursitis to my shoulders and arthroscopic surgery on my knee.USE THESE TAPES AT YOUR OWN RISK. My advice: good old fashion swimming, running, hiking and SAFE weightlifting will do the trick and cause minimal damage. These tapes will help you lose weight but cause a great deal of damage to your body in the process. Your choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Gift","review":"This was a Christmas gift so I'm not sure about the rating and so on. I do know I received it in a timely manner and my daughter loved the gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Muscle Workout","review":"I read the other review where the person complained about the production and I can understand his points. Billy does alot of \\"are you ready?\\" and then doesn't switch the exercise....also he gets a little confusing with the counts at times. This is definitely not as smooth as other tapes.That said....I have never been this sore after finishing a tape. The cardio pace is definitely slower than on the get ripped series which meant that I got through the whole 55 mins on the first try.... however....the muscle work is MUCH harder on this one.I think this is a great compliment for the get ripped advanced workouts....just don't get too annoyed with the inconsistencies in Billy's Bootcamp camera talk."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good workout. not as good as other tae bo dvds","review":"I have been doing tae bo DVDs for over a year now and really love the series. They keep you in great shape. This DVD was a bit disappointing because he takes more of the bootcamp style than many other Tae Bo DVDs. If I wanted to do push-ups I would just do them on my own. Otherwise it's a pretty solid workout, and a bit different. That's why I gave it 4 stars. Also there's a pretty good ab portion at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I enjoy this workout. I am not a huge fan of cardio but this has different exercises to keep me motivated and engaged. This is the only Billy Blanks DVD I own but I plan to purchase more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout","review":"I really love Billy Blanks and Tae bo, is an excellent work out. Love this video, is a little bit harder than \\"Basic Boot camp\\", with some different movements. Totally recommended it, but if you have not tried Basic Boot camp or any other Tae bo Video.. you should think about it twice. The video is about 50 minutes, and you work arms, legs and abs."},{"rating":"2","title":"great workout","review":"This was a great and challenging workout. I don't have the resistance bands but still you work up a sweat. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite workout DVD of all time","review":"I have purchased and done nearly all the advanced workout DVD's out there, including p90x and Insanity. This is probably my favorite one of all time. It always kicks my butt, but in a sustainable way that gives me a great workout, and doesn't just trash my body. Very hard. I almost always need to take a couple breaks because I can't keep up with him."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite!!","review":"My favorite Billy workout of all time. Great for every body part but you have to do your own counting because he tends to lose count and do an uneven number of reps on both sides"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout!","review":"I love this workout. I do it all the time. It is really difficult to do all the way through when you first start, but it definitely gets easier the more you do it. I can never do all the 48 push-ups in a row but I try every time (hopefully one day I can). Also, his counting is way off. He'll say 1 more set, but it will end up being more like 3 or 4 more sets. That can be frustrating when your first starting out, but once you do it a few times you know when he's going to do it and you can be prepared. He also doesn't do both sides equally a lot. Once you do it a few times you will need to adjust the routine a bit to make sure you're doing the right a left side of your body equally. All in all though, it is a great workout!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Always good to see bands crap on their fans","review":"This doesnt deserve 1 star. I spent 20 bucks on this and the schism cd.

Neat.\\"But then you get to listen to the remix...which sounds like somthing a highschool student could have put together.Tool has been my favorite band for quite some time now, and I'd just like to thank them for crapping all over their fanbase by releasing this garbage. Download 2 of their music videos and you'll have more than this dvd can offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Amazing Video..","review":"...yet Highly overpriced. Parabola is probably TOOL's best music video in my opinion , and no doubt it probably took weeks to film and edit the video , but there is no way that one music video is worth 10 dollars. Not to mention that the special features..if you can call them that..are extremely lacking. The commentary is horribly boring..and the remix is completely awful. It would have served them better to release a DVD with all of their music videos on one disc...or even if they included a live video of Parabola on the DVD in addition to the music video. Overall , an amazing video..but not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tool should be ashamed of themselves!","review":"Go online and watch the Parabola video for free because that is all you are getting here.

I for one won't support this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take It For What It Is","review":"This DVD was not meant to introduce new music, it was not meant to show a new video but what it was meant for was to show an OLD video with commentary and a remix of an OLD song so why is everyone getting so bent out of shape. No one is forcing you to buy it but if you do decide to buy it and know what it is going into the purchase you will be happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remix of what...","review":"Moaning and more moaning. One long remix that drags on and you're like \\"ok, it has to get better.\\" It's terrible and I do mean horrible! Video is cool like always and the new graphics are cool for the 2 seconds they last. This will not wet anyone's appetite for their new album. This is not Tool people! This is Lustmord! Do not buy this for the remix as it is unbearable."},{"rating":"1","title":"wtf???????","review":"you have to buy two seperate dvd's to get everything?? what a bitch! and some places are selling them for 10 bucks a pop. what a rip off! for the combined cost of both of these dvd's you should be getting a hell of a lot more than this.

First, if you are a fair weather fan, don't waist the money. This is only one track and not worth it. This is a good song off an album that is loosing it's zip. The video is a standard tool video, claymation and bizarre images. However, other than the first track, the rest is just a waste of time and money. The audio comentary is not funny, and makes tool look like fools (but with a some of my money, and me feeling used.) The bonus remix is nothing but an extension 8 minutes of ambient noise before the same song. If you want real trance like meditation like music, listen to Neurosis, they have been doing this for 15 years and are a lot better at it. Tool better have a heck of a next album to dig themselves out of this embarassment. The only reason I do not give this a 1 is that this video is nice to have near salival in my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"$10.00 \\"Tool \\" coaster?","review":"Allthough the paper sleeve did start a fire... the DVD Disc does serve well as a \\"coaster\\" on my coffie table.

The recommended age range is far too narrow, for adults have enjoyed it as a coffee table book as much as six year old visitors who find the transformation of years magical. My own children were impressed that civilizations do not always progress forward -- \\"The Invaders\\" and \\"The Plague Strikes\\" gave them a more dynamic sense of history.

Bad writing (Kerr again), bad acting, obnoxious characters. Nothing about this one is good. I suppose we're supposed to feel for this guy and the pain he puts himself through, but who cares?

It has all been done before and is cliched in parts.Like most gay films ,it has been written by someone with little experience in writing - there is almost no feeling in the film. Nothing original at all. Does anyone care about the characters? I think not.There are plenty of far better gay films around ( especially in Hong Kong and Europe)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preaches a bad message","review":"For an obviously very low budget film I thought it was Ok. Many of the scenes were quite good and the relationship between the two leads was quite believable. It tackles a sensitive subject quite well - but as other reviewers have mentioned I too must agree that the ending was quite disappointing. I think everyone deserves to have their standards and the film seems to suggest that \\"give in\\". Love is NEVER enough to maintain a relationship. Two people MUST have common ideas, values and goals in order for it to last. The film says that Love is what is left after you stop judging. This is TRUE, but it does not mean that you should let go of your personal standards in a relationship, as it seems to suggest."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's alright","review":"I typically watch a lot of movies having see most of the gay ones, I picked this one although it had some negative reviews.

Secondly, they incorrectly state on the copyright page that the original edition was published by Knopf in 1895(!), not 1920. Third, and this is what really pisses me off, is that they simply reproduced the See Sharp Press edition type, while omitting the footnotes and the introductory publisher's note (the layout matches exactly, and there's even the same typo -- misplaced quotation mark -- in the second line of the first page of the text (p. 21).It's sad when a publisher tries to rip off another publisher, and poorly.

Certainly a peurile stone-chucking review is easier to materialize than a meaningful analysis. It's becoming quite common these days to write off Nietzsche's thought as a satiating appetizer for rebellious teenagers, psuedo-intellectuals and the like and in fact i would agree that there is a whole plethora of idiots running around clutching \\"The Anti-Christ\\" against their bosom because of its appealing title but alas it's much easier to claim to have read and understood a book than to actually have read it. I'm surprised you didn't also dismiss Nietzsche because of his influence on the Nazi's; after all, Hitler reading the will to power exposes the shame that is Nietzsche.

But of course it's impossible to say how much an influence that had no what he wrote here about Christianity.The book is useful mainly as a study in how one can fuss and fume at Christianity all one wants, but in the very forms of our debate we tend to invite in Christian assumptions that have informed our culture for two millennia. Nietzsche, who was a pastor's son, might have given his own assumptions a look or two before writing this, keeping what he liked and discarding what didn't nourish him. Needless to say, stereotyping, blaming, and attacking an entire belief system does no one good, least of all the attacker.\\"When one hunts monsters, one must be careful not to become a monster oneself--for when you look deeply into an abyss, the abyss looks deeply into you.\\" -- Nietzsche"},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-Affected Animus","review":"Nietzsche's universal appeal to pseudo-rebellious, pseudo-jaded poseurs of all sorts has earned him a certain sacrosanctity in artsy-fartsy circles.

Poorly written in comic book style, there is no lack of action...except none of it is believable. The characters are shallow, the plot is so silly as to almost be amusing, and the exploits of the characters makes the good guys able to dodge bullets and other assorted nasties while the bad guys clumsily get themselves eliminated. If you can understand the rationale for the plot you get to go to the \\"head of the class\\".

And it is ludicrous. And some of the action sequences are so ludicrous that you will literally roll your eyes when they happen.

However, I noticed a lot of similarities between Area 7 and Ice Station which likely therefore didn't make for much excitement for me. Like Ice Station, the setting takes place in a secret underground multi-story facility. There is a bunch of gun battles and fighting between the good guys and the mercenaries. And, everyone is out to obtain or protect a secret prized possession hidden within the depths of the facility.

If Reilly set out to write a really bad book, which would eventually be made into a really bad movie, he succeeded admirably with \\"Area 7\\". I recently read the book at an island holiday resort, and the only reason I didn't throw it in the rubbish (as I eventually did when I returned to the mainland) was that I had nothing else to read on the beach. Reilly develops his characters such that you frankly don't care who lives or dies. His plots are inane, and considering the research he claims to have done, they contain numerous technical impossibilities. Frankly, the book reads like it was written by a 12 year old. Someone should also disable the italics function on Reilly's word processor. Not only are italics grossly overused, they often just don't make sense.

Every few pages some wholly unbelievable action takes place *just as* something else equally unlikely *almost* kills, maims, or somehow incapacitates our hero. Reilly sees fit to italicize how close they are to danger, as indicated by my asterisks above, not just once, not just twice, but repeatedly and far beyond any level of acceptability.Reilly gives the reader a lackluster plot incorporating all the worst elements of a Seagal or van Damme ego-booster. Far from a page-turner, I found no trouble setting Reilly's work down to listen to the flight attendant \\"go over the safety features of this Airbus A320.\\" It was far more interesting than the book -- a shame it only lasted a couple of minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a comic book without the pictures","review":"This is the third book I've read by this author and probably the best of the bunch, which isn't really saying much.

The story ends up being somewhat confusing (who's the bad guy in THIS chapter?). If you're just in it for the action and have time to kill, this book serves its purpose. But if you're looking for something half way plausible, with more than just a dash of character development, you might want to look elsewhere (like anything by Vince Flynn)."},{"rating":"1","title":"give me a break","review":"I enjoyed \\"Temple\\" but this book was just awful. Reilly's books are full of amazing, improbable but fun action scenes. You spend a few hours suspending common sense but having a good time.

To my belief, Anphibena is something of a concept album, celebrating the long lost hereditary and folk craft of old, the eventual silent triumph of the celtic pagan societies over christian intruders.

My two cats took to using the boxes very easily, including my large 16 1/2 pound plus kitty. I find litter scattering at a minimum with this litter box and the boxes are easy to clean, since if you keep one end against the wall (indicated on the box) the lid will stay up against the wall so you can easily pick up the waste to clean the box. Previously, I used litter boxes with swinging doors, but the doors would come out of the holes all the time and fall either into the litter or the floor. Or else, the doors would stop working properly and get stuck inside the box, so my cats would be locked in the box for a while. Clevercat is a clever invention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Litter Box","review":"I was a little sceptical about this box. But it is amazing.

Other than the fact that I think it is slightly overpriced...I LOVE this litter box!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job, perfectly","review":"I bought this to reduce the amount of litter being kicked out of the previous litter box and it has done just that.

Would recommend this to anyone that has an indoor only cat, especially in an apartment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"We have 3 big cats, this litter works better than any other ones we have tried (plenty!). So far, no more little rocks to sweep away every day (well a little but WAY much less work and we do not even use an extra carpet). Odors are less present since the cover keeps it and helps and the fact it is so deep allows to put more litter, less odor and less daily cleaning. So far we clean once a day (for 3 cats!) and it's plenty enough. We are not using the liner as to me it is more work since the cats are damaging the liner with their claws and you end up anyway having to clean the litter itself and you save money not using them. Bottom line: high 5, cannot be more satisfied and within 3 hours the cats were already using it, no problem with this new idea in anyway. Hope this helps in your searches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for picky cats, but otherwise great!","review":"I have two cats, and loved the Clevercat while I had it. Unfortunately, one of them would scratch at the top to \\"cover\\" instead of actually covering down in the box (regardless of how much litter was in there).

My older cat is a litter flinger, and my Siamese girl is a bolter, spraying litter everywhere.My Siamese girl LOVED the Top Entry style box, and used it obsessively. However, my older cat is around 15 lbs, and found it difficult to maneuver in. Additionally, my Siamese girl thought that my older cat's usage of the box turned the contraption into a giant version of a whack-a-mole game, and would ambush him as my older cat used it. This finally resulted in my older cat refusing to poo in the new box, even when I removed the lid and left the box open. That was the last straw for me. It's back to my old box for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"my cat doesn't like it","review":"For whatever reason, my 11 year old cat who has never made a mess anywhere outside his litterbox, did not like the introduction of this box. Although he'll use it for solid waste, he won't urinate inside it. SO, after trying out this box and replacing his old standard littler box with the trashcan style, he started urinating on the floor. I brought back his older standard litter box, and he stopped. I don't know if he's the only cat to have this reaction, but know that at least one did not want to jump down into a box to urinate in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for my purpose","review":"For the most part, my cat used the box but he didn't like it. Eventually, he decided the floor was better than going through the hole in the top.But, the reason I got this box was for my dog-to keep him out of the litter box. Well, he just learned to stick his head through the hole. When he pulled his head out, the lid would just hang around his neck.It didn't work for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clevercat Top Entry Litterbox","review":"I ordered this product after seeing a top entry litter box my son had purchased from another company. This box is much plainer than the box they purchased, which was a glossy orange color, but for the difference in price (this was $34, the box they purchased $100), I think I got the better deal. The box is basically a storage box with a hole on top, but what makes it work is there are grooves on the lid to catch the litter. It came with one liner, and additional liners are available. I ended up removing the liner, which was basically a garbage bag. It works much better without the liner, which would not stay put and kind of scared my cats. I am a fanatic about keeping the box clean, so no liner does not bother me. I am quite pleased with box, though I think the price could still be much less. That is my only complaint, but I would recommend this box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Combine this with Dr. Elsey's","review":"Wow, wish I had found this sooner.

Before this litterbox, my cat tracked litter all over my hardwood floors. The tracking has been virtually eliminated. I would recommend leaving the lid off for a few weeks until your cat gets used to it. I believe the directions recommended letting the cat use it a few times before putting the lid on but that wasn't enough time for my cat to transition.

I have kept it clean, although it is a pain to take the top off because she gets litter all over it, yet she has pee-peed on top of the box on more than on occasion. My cat has gotten pee and poop on herself using this box because she doesn't have room to maneuver inside the box. She has knocked it around as well, not quite tipping it over, but it has been pushed around when she gets out of it. It is just not a practical item, especially for larger cats. Also- you will feel a little foolish for purchasing this item at the price of $32 when all you are getting is a plastic bin that you could have bought from office depot for $5.00 and cut a hole in the top.

I was really skeptical that my 10yr old cat would use this design, but he took right to it and actually seems to prefer this to a regular box. The amount of litter on the floor has drastically decreased (not completely, but at least it doesn't feel like I am constantly sweeping it up) and the dog can't get to what is inside! Just follow the directions to help your cat adjust and enjoy the benefits. I cannot speak to the liners, as our cat has always destroyed them with his claws and I decided not to use them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stops the mess","review":"This litter box is great. It stops the mess of litter all over the place because the kitten goes in the top hole..The lid has some groves that pick up any litter from the cat's feet.

No problems cleaning it and it is easier realy than the other kind where I used to have to take the whole top off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for older or larger cats","review":"I have two cats, the older one is 16 and weighs 16 pounds and the younger one is 10 and weighs 8 pounds. My larger cat was able to use the box but with some difficulty. Because of the amount of effort needed to get in and out of the box, he decided that he would no longer use it after about 2 weeks. Instead, he used a decorative rattan basket in my living room one Sunday morning.On another note, this box was recommended to me in a large chain pet store and I was told that the ribbed lid would catch litter but this just wasn't the case. There was litter all over the floor around the box.This might work with a young and/or skinny cat but is not a good idea for an older cat who is set in his ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah 5 stars for a LITTER BOX!","review":"Let's face it. I'm lazy. I could have made my own version, for much less. I didn't want to fuss with it, and why re-invent the wheel? I'm perfectly happy to pay somebody else to do the trial-and-error for me. The sides are high enough that even an enthusiastic 7 year old can't flip out too much litter when he's scooping it out, and there's so little litter tracked on the lid that it's just knocking it back into the box. The area around the litter box is almost entirely litter-free, now. I don't hesitate to recommend this box to anyone with a cat."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"I've had this litter box for about a week now and I am LOVING it! I was having a big problem with litter being tracked everywhere and kicked out of the litter box all over the place before I got the Clevercat. I even had a litter box with high sides and it was still a problem. The amount of litter tracked out of this box is so much less now. I only have to sweep once a day and even then, there isn't much to sweep. My two cats took to it right away so no problems there. I am taking off 1 star because for $35, I would expect a bigger box. It's certainly tall enough, but the length/width could definitely be bigger. $35 is pretty ridiculous in my opinion. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great litterbox -- minimal tracking of litter","review":"We love this litterbox and wish we got one years ago. It really cuts down on the tracking of litter throughout the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"A neat product","review":"Clever Cat keeps dust and detritus from flying out of the box when Kitty digs vigorously in the litter. If you can train your cat to use it, I highly recommend Clever Cat for its labor-saving design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea in theory","review":"I have one cat, and my roommates have a kitten, so between the two of them, there is a lot of litter box ambushing. The kitten plays in the litter box, so I wanted something that would eliminate the need to sweep 1-2 times a day around the litter box (especially because roommates won't do it).I did a lot of homework on this, and I decided to give it a shot. I wasn't sure if it'd work because my cat is picky about where he \\"goes\\" (after failed toilet training), so I lined it in plastic (before I realized it comes with a complementary liner)in a test run.The cats refused to use it. They both sniffed it out but decided the floor right in front of it was a better place. Unused, I returned it. In theory, it looks like a good idea, but it didn't work for my kitties."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Ever!","review":"I'm way too impatient to follow instructions - LOL. I just added litter, put the lid on and left it next to the regular catbox for one day. After that I took away the old one and acted very \\"loving\\" towards the new litter box. My 4 month old kitten didn't have any problems at all. But I have one - how the heck do you get all the AIR out of the liner once you put in on and dump the gravel? I ended up dumping the liner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clevercat Litterbox","review":"Sorry, this was a clever idea but it's a 'no' from me. The cats (I have 3) all got used to it very quickly with no problems, but my problem was that because of how it is made (depth-wise) and with only the round hold for ventilation on one side, that the urine smell was overpowering in a very short period of time. Again, the concept is great in preventing litter tracked all over your floors, but it needs a better system of ventilation. I'll take the sweeping over the ammonia smell anyday!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! I'm loving this litter box","review":"Not only is my cat a clever cat for using this box, but I'm a clever cat mom for buying it! It's worth every penny! My not-so-clever kitty was in the habit of walking into her old fashioned covered litter box, and not turning around before she would tinkle. Needless to say, sometimes the tinkle came out the door and went on the floor. Now with this new box, there are no more messes. It has also cut way down on the litter tracking. She adjusted to the new box very quickly, with no problems. Thank you to the person who invented this box!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great litter box! Why didn't they think of it sooner?","review":"We have tried all the litter boxes out there, from the grocery store disposable one up to the LitterMaid deluxe. We hadn't found anything easy to clean and satisfactory for our \\"fat\\" cat (17 pounds lean). Lately, Tiger has taken to urinating standing up (a true man, I guess). With our old litter box, that would result in urine getting through the mid-way crack in the litter box (where the top met the bottom). This would result in urine leaking onto the floor and leaving a terrible musty urine odor.The top entry litter box has only a seam at the very top, thus Tiger can urinate all over the place without any getting out! Very useful product. We don't use the liners as they just get messy...instead washing out the box once a month and cleaning the clumped litter daily.I give it 4 out of 5 stars because I still have to empty the litter waste daily..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy one already!","review":"I LOVE this thing. I combined it with the Precious Cat Ultra Premium Clumping Cat Litter and a mat under the box, and the combination of the three is nothing short of a miracle. I'm still only a week or two in, but the difference in litter tracking and smell is hard to believe. My cats seem to like the privacy too. Seriously though, GO GET YOU SOME."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Cat Does Not Like It","review":"If my cat would like this box, so would I. I read all the positive reviews here. But my Siamese cat screams whenever he has to go. I thought he must have urinary tract infection. But no, he just hates jumping down into this thing. And he is in such a hurry to get out, he doesn't cover his stinky poop. (He does with a regular box.) Too bad. It's a great design. It's my temperamental cat that is the problem, but I can't take him back! (And I wouldn't want to.)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great box for many reasons","review":"I have 13 cats. All of them use these boxes. We find them MUCH neater as the cats don't bring half of the litter with them when they exit and for those cats who really love to throw the litter....they can't throw it up and out..so they can dig and bury without traching the floor. They are large enough even for our 20 pounder and they keep my dogs out. A large dog, of course can just stick their head right in, but for people with smaller dogs...it's super. Love this box....wouldn't use anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"They are right. This works very well, but you dont need to pay $24 for it. My dogs never managed to eat cat poo again after I simply cut a whole in the top of any rubber tub with a lid. Six bucks and youre set!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's been \\"retired\\"","review":"My 20 lb cat kept knocking it over.... not stable from the side at all. Also the grooves in the lid kept getting litter stuck in them.... I know having litter in the grooves is part of what it's supposed to do... but that it would get STUCK there and I had to go after it with a scrub brush almost daily was really not helpful. Between having to right it on a regular basis (and clean up the litter that spilled out when it tipped to the side), and having to scrub the top of it... it was a hassle. Also scooping it was a pain for me and scooping down to that depth actually bothered my elbow quite a bit..... so it was literally a pain. I can see where it might work great for some, but a base to stabilize it side-to-side and either an open grid at the top so that the litter could fall through, or a different design on top so the litter didn't stick in the grooves would have made a world of difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible for cats, way too small. Returned mine. :(","review":"Terrible for cats, they need room to move & this box is way too small. Returned mine. It needs a much larger hole in the top, then it might not be so constrictive for kitty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save yourself some money!","review":"I have a cat who is incapable of keeping his pee inside a normal litter box. So I set out to find an extra deep litter box. This box works fine but one of my cats can't figure out how to go in through the hole on the top, so I had to take the lid off.Then I found a Sterilite 18-Gallon Tote Box at Walmart for around $10. It comes with a lid, so you can just cut a whole in it yourself and save yourself $25! I bought it just to have another litter box in the house (I have 3 cats) and it works great! I wish I didn't spend the $35 on the first one!This product has a good concept but is a complete rip off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, but not for big cats.","review":"This box literally changed my life! Very little litter is tracked out and the bathroom is so much cleaner. I just wish that they made a slightly bigger one. My three girls love it! They are 6 lbs, 10 lbs and 12 lbs.Unfortunately, I watched a friend's cat who was a big, fat 21 lb male. He wouldn't use it. He had to squish through the hole and then, once inside, couldn't turn around very well. I love this box, but I think the manufacture should consider making it in two sizes. It's perfect for cats under 15lbs, but the big guys need more room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Might just be worth it","review":"My sister had mentioned the idea of a \\"top loading\\" litter box on a visit after she listened to me lament tripping over the gate to my laundry room designed to keep my dogs from exploring the litter box. I hesitated spending so much (3x what I have paid on covered boxes) but I have to say, I am quite pleased with this item.1) It does the job of keeping the dogs out2) There noticeably less litter tracked out of the box3) Unlike two piece covered boxes if my cat sprays the side of the box it does not leak between the two pieces making cleaning up after my cats much easierThe box is about the same size as the covered litter box I had previously. I was afraid my cats might not use it as it is so different from the other models but both took to it without issue. The only reason I did not rate as 5 stars is due to the high cost. In the end I found it was worth not having to trip over a gate."},{"rating":"1","title":"My cats hated it.","review":"My cats would not go in the box.

If your cat has any persnickety litter box habits then I would not recommend it.My one cat decided that she hated the litter box and started peeing all over the house. I had to purchase a new litter box to rectify the peeing situation. Not after much damage was wreaked upon the house though.So buyer beware....it could lead to upset cats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost NO litter outside of the box!","review":"Bought this to use in my small condo with my new cat, hoping to curb the amount of litter that gets tracked everywhere. Sometimes my cat jumps right out of the hole, over the lid, but still - there is almost NO litter on the carpet around this box! He can go wild in there, flinging litter around as much as he wants, and it all stays in. I'm not sure if this box helps with smell, but it doesn't smell too bad. I scoop daily and take the goodies outside to the trash right away. It's very solid and the lid is very strong. My 2-year-old, 10.5-lb cat fits just great and took to it immediately. It is his only litterbox. My parents tried to introduce their two cats to a Clevercat with traditional litterboxes still around, and those cats still choose the old-style ones over the Clevercat. So, it's a fantastic litterbox, if your cat will use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best pet product I've ever purchased!","review":"I purchased mine at Petsmart, but the review remains the same:These are really great.

Cats used them with very little adjustment, and are tracking less litter out of the box, and I am pleased to say the dogs large (lab), medium (beagles) and small (little mutt) are all very frustrated! Easy to clean and maintain. I will never buy another kind of lifter box!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want to train your cat to use the floor instead-buy this","review":"My cat hated this. In fact, she hated it so much she decided to use the floor instead. MAJOR FAIL. The reason why I tried this is because my cat would go into a standard litter box, but would sometimes miss. I guess she missed because she's 20 pounds. I however solved my problem without this product - I just used a giant tupperware. On ONE of the width side, with a saw, I cut an opening about 7\\" from the bottom-this way my cat just walks in the tupperware litter box and walks out, but the rest of the sides of the tupperware is untouched. So there is no need to jump in. So the REST of the tupperware's sides are extra high - the cat never missed the box ever again-problem solved, and cost me less than $6."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Designed Product","review":"This is a well designed, simple and sturdy product -- mostly importantly it works great for our cats!

I went down to walmart and got a rubbermaid tub the right size for my kitten and it was on sale for $3.50! I cut a 7in diameter hole in the lid and then hot glued a towel round it. The kitten took to it right away and I put the lid on after one day. She is very happy with her litter house! The dog can't disturb her while shes in there OR eat her droppings after she gets out.Thanks Clevercat for the concept! Maybe if you take about $20 off the price it would be worth it for the convenience of not having to make your own"},{"rating":"1","title":"No for my cat...too small!","review":"It was a great idea, but my adult cat is long/tall and was bigger than the litter box. He could not turn around and barely fit through the opening. I think for kittens it would work well because it seems to keep the dog out and track less litter than the Booda which I currently use. I had no problems returning the product thankfully. Did not like the liner it didn't fit well.

The result is that litter was track all around the bathroom and even into the hallway sometimes. This is every day occurances and I clean his litter and the floor everyday. I have tried getting litter box with a deeper well but it didn't seem to matter. Finally, I saw the review here about this box and give it a try. Robyn-the kitty JUMPED right in almost before I finish filling up the new litter box. I leave the top lid off a day for adjustment. After I saw that he had \\"try-out\\" the new box, I put the lid on the next day. The tracking now is almost nothing. I will find a few traces on the tracks in the top lid and that's it! Awesome!!!

It's usually not a problem, but after I spent three evenings in a row cleaning pee off the bathroom floor, I knew we needed something with higher sides. I looked at other boxes, but they all still had the one \\"entrance\\" side where the lip was lower -- prime pee-over-the-edge area. I found this one and was worried about how well they would take to it, but decided to try it anyway. They alternated sniffing and ignoring for the first half of the first day until, lo and behold, the problem-peer jumped right in and I could tell from peeking in later that the other two had followed suit! I put the lid on the second day and crossed my fingers that that wouldn't discourage them from using it... no problems! :D I'm so happy that there's no litter on the floor and better yet no pee! I'm planning on buying another one to replace our other box. Definitely would recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Adjustments for kittens","review":"Trying to keep our dog out of our new kitten's old litter box was a hassle. The Clevercat box has done the trick. The only problem has been our eight week old kitten is so small she couldn't easily get in or out of the box.

The combination of my old litter box and the mat kept cat litter off the bathroom floor and carpet. This litter box does nothing for keeping SMELL down or CAT LITTER off the floor.
