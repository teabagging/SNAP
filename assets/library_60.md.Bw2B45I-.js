I especially loved the song \\"No Pares.\\" I hadn't heard it before but it was a nice extra song and Dulce did a good job with this song. Overall I would recommend this cd to any RBD fans.

Dan Zanes and friends have taken Carl Sandburg's collection of traditional North American songs from the 1927 Songbag and created an album which we all love. The arrangements are not all strictly traditional and have a rollicking, ragtag quality which makes it feel as if we can make the music ourselves, which is a concept Zanes promotes. This is in constant rotation in our player. My 3 year old son belts out \\"Son of a Gambolier\\" with zest, and we know all the words to every song. The liner notes have excerpts from the Sandburg Songbag which provide some interesting insights into American history, and easy guiter tab guides, which my husband (who just started playing guiter) uses to play to our children. We just love this CD, as well as the entire Dan Zanes collection. Save the Lauri Berkner for someone else--we'll take Dan anytime!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great kid's stuff...

This is an awesome CD. I have every MxPx CD, and although it's not perfect, but one of the best CDs ever, and the second best MxPx CD. (Life In General will always be my fave) Since they signed on the same record label as the bloodhound gang, Dr. Dre, and some other popular mtv bands, expect to see them on MTV. you really should get this album. i recommend it to anyone who likes blink 182 (musically, not lyrically), Green Day, the Ataris, dogwood, arthur (duh), sick shoes, noggin toboggan, ghoti hook, Felix tx, dropkick murphys, lagwagon, and Craig's brother.Also, this is MxPx's deepest album. every song on this album is great and is meaningful in some way. heck, even the \\"only wanna be with you\\" chick songs are great. :) they have awasome guitar riffs and beautiful melodic punk b/g vocals, harmonies and melodies. MxPx, ROCK ON! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, But It's Not Punk","review":"I really like MxPx's early stuff, but this one isn't as good. Like other reviewers, I thought this CD was too glazed over, and some of the songs sound almost...cheesy. I mean, c'mon! This is probably the first MxPx CD with any bit of cheesines in it. Pokinatcha and Teenage Politics are their best; they were made back when MxPx was really a punk band. This album lacks almost all of the energy of those first two albums. This album also lacks the statement-making, sometimes political lyrics of the first two, which I also miss. If you like Lit and Blink 182, you will like this, but if you like real punk rock, get Pokinatcha. Or, if you like a mix between hard, fast punk and pop, get Life in General, not this. This CD sounds like Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo with most of the energy and speed removed, which is not a good thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"I have to admit, this CD was disappointing. After a great album like \\"Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo\\", \\"The Ever Passing Moment\\" wasn't very good. There were a few good songs (\\"My Life Story\\", \\"Responsibility\\", \\"The Next Big Thing\\") but overall, most of the songs were nothing special. My friends all told me that this CD had deep lyrics, but what everyone else calls 'deep', I call 'cheesey'. In \\"Buildings Tumble\\" the chorus goes:\\"Let the weak say I am strong. Let yourself say I was wrong. Let your heart move on. Let your heart move on.\\"Blech! 'Let your heart move on'? Green Day managed to write a slow, thoughtful song with \\"Good Riddance\\" because it was SUBTLE. This chorus would be fine if it was for a Celine Dion song, but the result of those lyrics mixed with a punk-pop melody and a plugged-up nose is just sickening. MxPx is a really good band, and if you're looking for a CD that shows their true talent, don't buy \\"The Ever Passing Moment\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Epitome of pop-punk","review":"I liked Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo, but it seems that Mxpx is running out of music, and also lyrics. they never had very deep vocals, which is very apparent on this cd.

Just turning into another Blink 182 with the warped tour going on. Playing soft core slow punk that my parents would like. I'm sorry! Go back to your old ways...

However, I say this after much thought. The band MxPx has left behind some of the pure punk heard on \\"Pokinatcha\\" or \\"Teenage Politics\\" and went more the way of the buffalo. Instead of the fuzzy guitar riffs, and hyperactive drums, we have polished pop-punk and hyperactive drums. A great tradeoff.Most of the songs on this album have the catchiness of \\"I'm Okay, You're Okay\\" or \\"The Downfall of Western Civilization\\". The best cuts on this album are \\"Responsibility\\" and \\"The Next Best Thing\\".If you are a fan of MxPx, or even of Blink 182, Gob, Less than Jake, or other similar bands, pick up this album: you won't regret it.PxPx!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb CD","review":"This CD is great!

They were in between an underground and mainstream band for a little while. I mean they're on a major label but their songs dont get played that much on the radio and they don't sell millions of albums. They probably sell almost as much as Nofx, pennywise, no use for a name bands like that. This album is better than the new piece of crap they put out a year ago but man not by much, this is actually going away from their punk roots and into more just straight up rock n roll like foo fighters. there are some good songs on here but there are alot of songs that sound the same and are startinig to sound kinda whiny. Mxpx is on a hunt to sell out so buy as many of their records as possible so they can start putting out better albums even though i don't think that's gonna happen anytime soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"ever passing moment","review":"Who added the softener?

MxPx has a couple of my all time favorite songs (Life in General, Swing Set Girl), but this is just bad. It sounds like Green Day losing all of thier origionality and song writing skills(thank god I can still count on Green Day!).Songs like Responsibility have totally mislead people about how great of a band they are. Check out \\"Slowly Going The Way of the Buffalow\\", \\"Teenage Politics\\" or \\"Life in General\\", but please do not rate the band by this album. MxPx is to great of a band to let up.

Its sleep time is very small and when you do the regular yoyo it sometimes flips around and spins around. the good thing is that you can wind it up easily. After a little bit, it stops working and apparently you have to use this oil to put on the axle and then replace the srting soon after... So not worth the money of it plus the amount of oil and new string.For some people, this is the right yoyo for them, but this yoyo just did not work out well for me. For all those people out there who have never tried yoyoing before and this is your first time with a trick yoyo, AND you want a high performing one that you can learn to do real big and awesome tricks on, this is not the yoyo for you.

There are two CD's in the box, a blue and a red, so you get loads for your hard-earned. The 'blue' is more accessible of the two, and basically grooving and funky. The 'red' is heavier and not so melodic, but has the most fantastic groovin' track called 'airto' - you just have to hear it. Charlie Watts is not 'Mr. Awesome Technique Drum Man', but if is responsible for putting this stuff together, then all power to him - he sure sets a nice groove going, and he obviously loves what he does. Don't worry, this music bears absolutely no resemblence to anything by the Stones (luckily). Great piano playing, some drum & base, some ethnic sounds, woodwind.

The majority of tracks are purely instrumental but are far from boring. They are extremely exciting numbers. A Dingo Stole My Baby and A Way to Die are my two favourites. You've also got Joy to the World (the song with the lyrics Jeramiah was a Bullfrog) and some humorous tracks such as The Drinking Song. I never noticed the great songs while watching the actual movie but when I borrowed this CD I discovered music magic. The cover booklet also has a few black and white photographs on the inside from the movie and colour ones of Sandra and scenes from the movie on the outside as well as on the backing cover for the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"A better order would make this a better CD","review":"I ordered this soundtrack for the Loudon Wainwright tunes, particularly White Whinos, and am disappointed that the instrumental tracks from the movie are mixed in with the vocal tracks.

Abuse of children by females and female on female violence is something this nation and the churches which have monastic orders should face.

Don't buy the small size or tube, just buy the big size and you can put some in a small travel sized container to take with you or in the diaper bag. I find it's also for grown-ups -- softens rough spots on heels and elbows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to prevent/treat diaper rash","review":"My son is 11 months old. We slather his little bum in Aquaphor every night before bed. The few times he's had a diaper rash, one round of Aquaphor on it has cleared it up. Compared to what happened the one time we applied a zinc oxide type cream, which just turned the rash redder and uglier until we relented, applied Aquaphor and the rash disappeared in a few hours. A single tub this size has lasted us 11 months.Aquaphor is not vaseline. It has several other ingredients which make it more smooth textured. It is expensive, I agree, but honestly worth it, given it has a myriad of uses and such a small amount goes such a long way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best!","review":"I tried many different products for diaper rash and many of them worked ok but my daughter ended up with a severe diaper rash beacause of some medication she was taking. Her pediatrician recommended I get Baby Aquaphor. This product is just amazing! Ever since we started using it, she has not even had a hint of a diaper rash. Also she use to have dry skin around the top of the diaper and she would scratch. That has also been gone since we started using this product. I can't say enough good about it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Multi purpose ointment","review":"I have been using Aquaphor on both of my children's skin for the last 3 1/2 years and have found nothing that compares.

I read somewhere about a children's hospital that mixes Aquaphor with Maalox - they call it \\"Aqualox\\" - for diaper rash. It is a miracle cream...so much better than any other balms I've bought.

There is no benefit to buying this over petroleum jelly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isn't petrolatum 100% better?","review":"After having read all the reviews, I had high hopes for Aquaphor for baby's eczema. It turned out to be a gooey, sticky mess that rubbed off on everything and was hard to remove: me, bedsheets, clothes, toys... I agree with the previous reviewer: isn't 100% petrolatum (aka, Vaseline) better than Aquaphor's 41% petrolatum? Also generic petroleum jelly is $2. Aquaphor is 8x more at a whopping $16. I do use the remaining Aquaphor for baby's diaper area, and it seems to be working as well as petroleum jelly. For baby's eczema, turns out Eucerin Cream worked better. If you're dealing with eczema, perhaps you can try Eucerin Cream to moisturize and then lock it in (like another reviewer wrote) with Aquaphor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aquaphor Healing Ointment, aka vaseline","review":"I am someone who has taken Accutane, and because of the medication I now have pretty dry skin. The skin can crack and slough off, and it can be pretty painful. I read recommendations for Aquaphor, and more specifically this healing ointment, so I decided to give it a shot.The ointment is a sticky, greasy, tar-like substance. I grimaced as I rubbed the goo onto my dry skin, where it stayed for the next 10 hours. My clothing and my bed linens all have residue on them from this ointment. I had tried vaseline (the substance, not the brand) months before this, but disliked it because it was... sticky, greasy, and tar-like. However, the vaseline did help my skin. This is the exact same.If you can put up with the heavy feeling of it on your skin for hours, as well as how it soils your clothes, then I would recommend regular old generic vaseline.

I no longer have that dry patch. Also, my chest was feeling dry, even though I mosturize with my face mosturizer. I started using Aquaphor on it and it is much smoother.

He, unlike his many peers, didn't have a trademark style, but could write any music to fit any film.Patch Of Blue is a film from 1965, about an African American man (Sidney Potier) who befriends a young girl who is blind (Liz Heartman). Peoples treatment of race and disability are the themes: make Patch Of Blue today and you'd make a different film.Luckily this is a 1965 film, made when film scores worked as albums. Goldsmith choose tender, gossamer melody lines, based on spare uses of strings and piano, jazz flute, and pinches of vibraphone.What works so well about Goldsmiths score is the melodies he uses are simple but extremely distinct, cut like the best jewels, crystal clear.This score does not date a bit, its compositions and arrangements being so tasteful.

The movie, when Ii first watched it, was touching, but there was something missing. On the second viewing, I realized what this film lacks is a convincing ending, the thing that makes the book so believable and heartbreaking. The shattering, tearful cliff-hanger of the novel was replaced by a simply, almost predictable, feel-good ending that makes the film flop miserably for someone who knows the original intent of the author. Also, the many scenes which were thought up by the film-makers, while convincing and poignant in their own way, don't compare with the warm, yet darkly sinister, tone of the book. I love the music though. And one question: is that Elizabeth Heartman's real voice?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why remake it?????","review":"I really like this movie, it touched on an issue that for it's day was very controversial.

I go with others who have reviewed this as a poor production - buy the 20th Century one, it's a helluva lot better than this double set."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Collection of Disappointment","review":"This two-CD set contains most of Neil Diamond's famous hits. However, this collection features many music selections from live performances--and, this is NOT a good thing. For example, in \\"Cracklin' Rosie,\\" a truly great \\"sing along\\" tune, Neil shouts the lyrics rather than sings them. When he does sing, he can't hit the notes he used to. Save your money, and stick with the original recordings and you'll be much happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE! LIVE RECORDINGS!","review":"I was totally misled by the song line-up and the \\"greatest hits\\" claim on this dog. If you buy it you are going to be asking yourself, later, \\"why didn't I read the reviews.\\" Almost every good song he ever did is represented by a live recording done with the pathetic audience singing along. Dear God! He isn't even in good voice on these tracks! and his vocals growl, and crack amidst the shoddy band strains which accompany him! Save yourself from the grief of having to return this stinker. I hope you read this before you make the same mistake I did. Otherwise, hey, there's one born every minute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bill Murray Covers Neil Diamond","review":"Having just seen the most wonderful Neil Diamond concert in Nashville the night before, I was anxious to relive the wonderful sound he created on stage so I rushed to purchase a CD. Wanting to get the max for my $'s, I purchased this CD. Big mistake.There are about 35 songs on the 2 CD's,13 of which are live performances, but very dated. All live recordings are poor, thin mixes and the words stray as you could imagen. They reminded me of Bill Murray's character on SNL, the lounge singer, covering Neil Diamond. For my money, stay with the original production quality recordings even if you have to purchase more than one cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"not deceived, just not thinking.....","review":"I agree with some of the other reviews. I too didn't care for the live versions. Then again, I assumed I was getting the original recordings, without doing myself a favor and reading the reviews by those listed here on Amazon. Shame on me. I've given this one away, and now am hunting for a compilation of the original studio stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many tracks live, but cd still worth buying","review":"Although most of the fist cd consists of live performances, this compilation still has plenty of original recordings to make the Neil Diamond fan happy. Actually, the live version of \\"I am, I said\\" on disc two is very moving, as is \\"All I really need is you\\" which is another live track at the end. I think (although I don't know for sure) that the reason most of the songs on disc one are live is because the original recordings belong to MCA (this is a Columbia release.) Great cds though.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"While I love Diamond's early work, I was very disappointed to find that almost all of the early songs were live versions that don't hold up as well as the original studio versions. What's worse, this fact wasn't clearly marked on the CD, and I didn't find out until long after I bought it and was finally able to play it (I was traveling at the time). A couple of other reviewers have hit the nail on the head--these aren't the songs that we came to know and love as they played on the radio. Diamond is a great performer, but recordings of his performances aren't as strong as the performances themselves. And when we're talking about extremely strong studio recordings that stuck in your head--every note--the live versions sound like poor copies by some Neil Diamond wannabe. This album is a travesty, and it's NOT a greatest hits album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful entertainment","review":"This is a must for all Neil Diamond fans. He simply shines through as one of the most talented songwriters and performers of our time. Some songs are recorded'live', and some are not, but the atmosphere is electric."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the real thing.","review":"If you're a fan of Neil Diamond and want to hear his songs as you remember them, this is a very poor choice. Splurge a few extra bucks and get the real thing. This sounds more like a rehearsal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neil Diamond--One poetic voice of the 60s","review":"Neil Diamond, for better or for worse, sang his collection of ballads, love songs, etc. for those who would listen and for those who could listen. In some sense his music is soothing to the soul, speaking in weak poetry but potent prose the language of the heart, the mind and the soul. His music is sometimes almost trivial. At other times profound. I recommend listening, moving past the weak poetry and letting the mind and the heart hear his subtle but wondrous use of words to span the range of human emotion. I must admit that a certain amount of my attraction to Neil Diamond songs is sentimental and I owe the recent burst of sentimentality to the fact that I have awakened to the clock radio twice this past week playing Neil Diamond."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes!","review":"Rip-off! Some of the later songd like \\"If You KNow What I Mean\\" are reproduced in thir graceful studio versions, but many iof the classics, like \\"Sweet Caroline\\" are mauled beyond recogition in \\"sing with me\\" 1990's state fair type live renditions. Flee from this vomitorium."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neil Diamond's Wayne Newton impression","review":"I love Neil Diamond's classic songs, but this collection of tired Vegas show style remakes is not worth the time or the money.

I prefer just him singing 1966-1992"},{"rating":"1","title":"Live performances of favorites dissapointing","review":"I bought this collection thinking it has most of my favorites. Good deal. But, not so. Unfortunately, the best, most classic ones, such as \\"Sweet Caroline\\" are not the original studio recordings. They are live recordings, not what I expected. Not great ones at that, even though the CD cover of \\"13 previously unreleased\\" seems to tout this a a great benefit. Overall the collection is not bad otherwise, but for these live recordings, which is unfortunately 13 out of the collection, including many of the classics, one of which is mentioned above."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"It's no longer possible to purchase Diamond's earlier albums in any format, although lengthy haunting of online auctions has netted lots of leads for vinyl (no thanks, already own them all) and a very few for CDs. I had hoped that this CD might get me the wonderful original versions of those great songs that I recall from the 70s, but there are only a couple of original recordings here: a few were later versions, and most were not particularly good live versions. Don't waste your money on this CD unless you really can't stand going the online auction route."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this CD unless you LIKE LIVE recordings!","review":"I bought this CD because I wanted one CD with all Neil Diamonds best hits.When I got it - It had a sticker on the jewel case saying that it contains 13 (I think?) LIVE RECORDING.That was my 'red flag'. I immediately returned it to Amazon.Unfortunatelly Amazon do not include that info in the CD title.If you like NOISY LIVE RECORDINGS - this CD is for you.If not: I then purchased: 1) Neil Diamond 12 Greatest Hit Vol. II and 2) The Neil Diamond Collection (Original recording remastered) - The one where he looks like 25 on the cover.Which is good CLEAN music, and both CD's cost the same price as this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money !","review":"Thumbs down to Columbia for this misleading collection of old BANG records mono tracks and really inferior live versions of the songs of his UNI-MCA era of 1968 - 1972 !

Minus 3 Stars !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on bad live recordings.","review":"I just got this from BMG and I plan on sending it right back. The over half of disc 1 is *live* recordings, not the original studio recordings. The live recordings are HORRIBLE. From the booklet... \\"Some of these songs particularly lend themselves to the infectious nature of a performance in front of an audience, so we've included some live cuts, too.\\" That is a flat out LIE. The reason that there is live cuts on this cd is that they couldn't buy the rights to those songs to put them on this cd, so they just put these horrible live cuts on there. DON'T WASTE YOUR $$$ on this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"While I love Neil Diamond's music, there was nothing that I saw, to indicate that most of the songs on this album were recorded live. Now that is not necessarily bad, but in this instance he yelled the songs rather than singing them and there is LOTS of croud noise! What I was looking for were the original studio recordings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neil Diamond's greatest Hits","review":"Don't get this record if you really liked Neil Diamond.

It's great getting aquainted with his fantastic tunes all over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Song List Speaks for Itself (or it should)","review":"I can't really say that there is a bad song on there (and I'm not a Neil Diamond fan, this is my only album). Check the description (I didn't) there are a number of live songs on there (I think about 13 of them) and if you weren't expecting them then you might be let down. They're very good, just different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatest Hits...NOT!!","review":"Very misleading. Most are not the \\"Hit\\" but a bad live recording. I can't believe Neil Diamond would have approved this compilation. I definitely feel ripped off!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Live versions of his great music are poor","review":"Neil is a great writer and a good singer, but he apparently needs the help of a studio to sound excellent. This set is nearly all live versions, and Neil, unfortunately, \\"reads\\" the lyrics. I was really disappointed with it. Gotta buy another collection to get the original versions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, no, no, no ...","review":"WARNING: DON'T BUY THIS UNLESS YOU LOVE \\"LIVE\\" VERSIONS OF THESE HITS! This should have been marked in plain English on the front of this CD. These live versions of Neil Diamond's greatest hits are driving me nuts! I'm accustomed to this great singer's subtle phrasing and nuance in every one of his songs, and for these to be so markedly different from the originals I grew up hearing on AM radio is nerve-wracking. It amazes me that this CD's producers could have assumed that Neil fans would be satisifed with these versions. I'm on the verge of returning this CD to sender."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Live Without It","review":"I had this album when it first came out but I some how lost it (I think someone who wouldn't admit they were a fan stole it). Some albums come and go, but I have been searching for this one for a long time. My mom got me hooked when I was a kid and Neil Diamond was one of the first concerts I ever went to. My mom wants this album too. I know every song by heart now and there is nothing more soothing than to listen to it when I am stressed out. This is a must have album as far as I am concerned. If you like some of his songs, this is the CD to get you hooked on the rest. As far as the live songs go, his true fans will recognize the powerful concert sounds of the older performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Go Neil!","review":"Got to be totally honest. I don't own a Neil Diamond recording of any kind and don't intend buying any in the near future but before the Moody Blues concert here last night, a lady related a story to me about how she gave birth, got dressed 20 minutes later, left baby and all at the hospital and drove herself to a Neil Diamond concert.

I'm really a fool, I didn't even see the sticker on the CD case that said 13 live versions were on these CDs. I thought I hit the jackpot with this, since it seems like with all his other collections Neil (or whoever puts his collections together for him) intentionally leaves at least one or two of everyone's faves off so you'll have to buy more than one CD. The live versions of songs like Cracklin' Rosie, I'm a Believer, Red, Red Wine, etc. are abyssmal. So colossally disappointing, a waste of $30."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get tricked like I did","review":"Buyer beware! I used to own this album -- got it through a CD club, but returned it. After purchase, I discovered, to my dismay, that some of the songs were not the original versions but live versions instead. There was no indication that these were \\"remakes\\" on the cover. Deception! Why, oh why, do the powers that be feel compelled to keep including these live versions of some songs on all of Neil's \\"greatest hits\\" type albums? If I wanted live versions of his songs, I'd buy a live album. (I'm not a big fan of live albums as a rule anyway. Give me the studio versions!)

The Buffy's were different times, so the music is going to be different. In 1992 the music on this CD is what people were listening to. The C&C Music Factory were huge around that time. The Dream Warriors were massively popular in their home country of Canada. Susanna Hoffs was trying to make a comeback. And then you've got your classic artists such as Matthew Sweet and Toad The Wet Sprocket. Great CD for it's time. Some of the songs are garbage though (the Rob Halford track sticking out the most), and some of 'em are great (hey, I hate metal, but I quite enjoy the Ozzy Osbourne track - don't ask).

The story starts our wonderfully and Frances, her fears, and her interactions with her parents ring true, but I was very disappointed with the end... when her father makes her go to bed by threatening to spank her. What is the moral of the story? For the parent it seems to be that even if your child is frightened and having a hard time sleeping you should force him/her to go to bed and stop bothering you. For the child it seems to be that your fears are not valid and you shouldn't bother your parents with them. I would recommend skipping this book in favor of \\"A Bargain for Frances,\\" \\"Bread and Jam for Frances,\\" or \\"Best Friends for Frances.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"smoking, spanking and watching TV?","review":"I loved the Frances books as a child, so I bought this one for my niece without even opening it. When we sat down to read it, I was horrified. \\"Father\\" smokes a pipe, both parents watch television, and Frances is threatened with a spanking if she doesn't go to sleep even though she's afraid of monsters in the dark. The book is supposed to help children conquer their fears of the night and sleeping alone but there must be better ways to achieve this. Try the other Frances books, they're great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated pro-spanking theme","review":"I remembered the Frances books from my childhood and regret that I bought this one in the series for my 4 year old without reading it again first. Frances is inspired to stay in her bed at night because her father threatens a spanking, and hearing a moth tap against her window reminds her of the spanking she'll get if she gets up and disturbs her parents again. Ugh. If you think spanking is a barbaric and stupid method of discipline, don't even consider buying this one!I'll look around for a book that teaches children that sleep is a good thing, that it will give them energy for their adventures the next day, rather than one that threatens violence if they \\"bother\\" mom and dad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Threat of spanking forces Frances to sleep...","review":"I too remember Bedtime for Frances as a child (I'm in my 30's) but was shocked when I read it recently. Wish I never bought it! It's definitely NOT a comforting bedtime story. It's the threat of being spanked (...or is it beaten? described in the book as \\"whacked and smacked) that forces Frances to sleep. In the book Frances' father says it's Frances job to go to sleep. And if he doesn't, \\"I will get a spanking?\\" \\"Right!\\" said Father. Frances then hears the sound of a moth at her window. \\"Whack and smack! Whack and smack made Frances think of a spanking. All of a sudden she was tired.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Introduces fear of the dark, procrastination methods and spanking, with nice pictures","review":"Frances is a sweet character, but this book is more likely to terrify than calm your child. We haven't had to deal with fear of mysterious shapes in the dark yet with our 3-year-old, so I'm certainly not going to introduce the concept, or suggest that cracks are scary because things with lots of legs might come out of them. The book also shows bedtime procrastination as normal and quite effective (would you give your child an extra piece of cake for getting out of bed?) And yes, spanking is bad. If you have an older child who already has all these fears, you have my sympathy and perhaps this book would be appropriate."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for Little Girls","review":"Frances and her bedtime routine is fabulous.

I grew up on these things, and was much like Frances going to bed, and it brings back such fun memories to read it now with my own children. I also like that this book teaches a moral lesson without forcing your mouth open and shoving it down your throat.It saddens me a bit to think that some children must be protected from the thought of a giant in the room, being afraid of the dark, or even a little loving discipline to encourage the right behavior. When Frances learned to confront her fears, she was the stronger for it, and got a good night's sleep as well. What my kids learned from it was the alphabet song, and they occasionally get to bed before midnight anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bedtime for Frances helps get little ones to bed","review":"Frances was a classic when I was little. Now I read the same stories to my son. Whenever he keeps stalling, not wanting to go to bed I pull out Bedtime For Frances and read it to him. He smiles because so many of Frances' attempts to stay up late are so similar to his own. We don't spank, but he gets the idea that going to bed is serious business. When the story is over I ask him, \\"Now, what is your job?\\" and he closes his eyes with a sweet smile on his face.

I would not want to introduce more fears (spiders, etc.) for a child sensitive on this issue. I don't think it wd/ help a child over-come them either. (I don't read any of Rosemary Well's \\"unready\\" books as I don't want to introduce issues but I think they cd/ help someone overcome them.)It's not just that this book was written years ago, it is that it seems to have been written without kids in mind.

However, this one could be all too easily misinterpreted! The story is based on the assumption that a child who cannot sleep is deliberately inventing excuses not to do so, and that genuine terror (which is a fact of life for many) that might cause such sleeplessness is imaginary and manipulative on the child's part, and can be dispelled by a fear of punishment.This would be devastating for a child to believe - but all the more dangerous were such a viewpoint held by a parent who may have a child who has genuine insomnia or night terrors. The rest of the Frances series is worthwhile, but this one is a nightmare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parent's beware!","review":"If ever there was a book which begs to be read thoroughly by a parent before presenting it to a child, it is this one. I had heard that this book is a \\"classic\\" but having read it, I for one would never allow my children to read it or have it read to them. Frances is finally persuaded to go to bed only when threatened with a spanking! What kind of message does this send to our children?

The title leads you to think you're about to read a series of funny reports about Moonie's antics but then what you really get is an awfully written and pointless essay about... yes, what is this book all about? Spare your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult Read But Worth It","review":"Alan Clayson writes in the impressionistic style that you find in the English music magazines, so you have to have a good amount of knowledge about the 60s English music scene (and Keith Moon) to make sense of some of his writing. The man has an encyclopediac knowledge of the era and obviously enjoyed himself very much in the 60s. His essays tend to go off on tangents that oftentimes have very little to do with Keith Moon but he managed to keep my interest and has some interesting points to make. The essays proceed in a roughly chronologic fashion and finish with Clayson's ruminations about the death of Keith Moon and the death of rock music in general. The vignettes at the end of each essay featuring various musicians and others who knew Moon were entertaining. On the whole, this book is a good read for those (like me) who are long time fans of the Who and the British scene of the 1960s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drummer boy","review":"This book was perfect for my husband, who has been a drummer for almost 40 years. Keith Moon is one of his favorites. Some of the stunts that are described in the book are a little disturbing, but that is who Moon was!

This video is like a tourist advertisement for Newport, not a jazz concert."},{"rating":"1","title":"*1/2 Star* Less than meets the eye","review":"Pure and utter disappointment. I don't understand why this dvd received the high rating that it did. I suspect that some of the record labels pay people to post rave reviews that upon close inspection turn out to be hype. From a purely objective viewpoint, the audio and video quality of this release isn't worth the plastic its printed on. The color is washed out, and the audio sounds like rubber bands and distortion.

As long as you have a solid surface for the spoon rest to sit upon, it would not be a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good spoon rest","review":"It is big enough to hold several utensils and puts the handles up in the air where they're easy to grab. It's pretty stable and is very easy to clean. The stainless finish is a bit crude and scratches pretty easily but it isn't something your likely to notice. I'm not a big stainless steel fan, so I'd probably prefer a pretty ceramic spoon rest, but considering how much it is used it would probably get broken.

The adaptive strategies involve rethinking how to achieve business results, reexamining how work is organized, and transforming how people are managed. The book concludes with the effects of adaptive cultures and practices on organizational performance. We at Stern's Management Review (www.FutureOrganization) find this to be an excellent grand tour of new ideas and practices in organization and human resource management.

I was, however, very disppointed in its amateur-quality writing and terrible editing and proofreading. The storyline was utterly unbelievable. The characters - cariactures would be a better word - were nothing but stick-figure drawings of the worst sort. The mechanism of making up silly names which are transparent psuedonyms for political and media personalities was especially annoying and distracting - why not just use their names, or actually create characters? The practice of capitalizing Nouns at random was also distracting.

Only buy this if your are jumping on a padded or very smooth surface. It wasn't good for crossovers or any kind of fancy jumping either...just speed.First off, this is not a trick rope. It's designed to slice through the air with speed and little drag and that's what it does very well. My Nike speed rope is fine but this thing is much faster and feels great in my hands. I love this jump rope and finally have found the rope that can keep up with my natural speed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost too fast!","review":"Let me start out by saying that this rope outperforms every other rope (yes, including Buddy Lee's rope) I have used to date. There is no more to be said; the quality is unsurpassed. The one and only negative (if you can call it that) is that it's too damn fast! Yes, a rope can be too fast if you're used to other ropes which take significantly more effort to skip. After weeks of ownership, I'm still getting used to it. It's just so damn fast. Almost too fast. And no, I'm not complaining either. Let me put it this way: double-unders are a walk in the park.

I wanted to get a long rope for my Crossfit workouts because I'm tall and it's difficult to get one at my gym. I bought this one and at first loved it - high quality, fast, etc. However, because of the material, the rope is EXTREMELY painful when you mess up. I created several abrasions on my forearms and butt when I messed up using this rope. I will probably not use it again because it is simply too painful. Maybe I'm just being ignorant of normal jumpropes but I have used \\"lighter\\" jumpropes before with no problems of this kind.

With Witness UK, I was surprised there was an English band that I'd actually never heard of who'd managed to score a release on a major U.S. label. Before the Calm couldn't have been a bigger surprise (I can't even remember the other thing I bought). 13 tracks, all of them good to great, stylistically varied, no rock star bull, solid. More a throwback to great old English rock like early Faces than the current crop. That's all I'll tell you, because you might want your own little thrill of discovery (and because I still don't know anything about this band!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great companion to the ghost tour!","review":"Although the ghost stories in this book won't keep you up nights, it's still a nice introduction to the ghost stories of Key West.I suggest reading the book before a trip to Key West.

If you're not passionate about what you're talking about, don't even worry yourself, you're no poet. (Clear themes, clarity of verbal delivery, a message that is deep and useful to the whole of the world. As a dub poet, your goal is definitely not money or girls, on the contrary, its to make the world a better place for every one. To become a dub poet you need to have thought deeply about life, and the human story. If you cannot do this and you stil want to record your stuff on CD, you bette find someone to help you compose some useful lyrics. However the verbal delivery will still be flat, because the message won't be yours!So I'd say on my list of REAL dub poets I have1. Mutabaruka (the topmost universal revolutionary poet)2.

I didn't make it through chapter 3 and I loaned this book to a friend of mine who said she didn't get past the first.

When there is a very simple algebraic method to evaluate an expression, the text will actually use a less accurate approximation which is in fact more difficult to compute.

Maybe it would be fine if there was a resolution, or he at least seemed happy. And it would have been nice to address foster/adoptive situations, not just group home to new parents.

The picture freezes then suddenly the audio continues normally but the picture is still frozen. I've checked my player and the copy and can't find anything wrong with the player. Unfortunately I held onto the copy too long to get a refund or exchange. My dvd of \\"Father of the Bride\\" which I bought as a package deal cost less but is a great copy.

The very first release by him circa 1980, \\"You and Me\\", on A&M, was enchanting R&B at its best.

This album is slept on.","review":"There's some fantastic moments here when Rockie's at his most soulful. From uptempo tracks like 'I can hardly wait' or the funky 'Miss Dynamite' on par with the two-steppin' 'If I ever lose you' to his soul-searching ballards 'Be ever wonderful'. Robbins' fabulous voice is backed by enchanting female vocals and there's not really a weak track. The change in tempo from song to song ensures this stands out from the standard ballard or uptempo heavy offerings by many of his male comtempories available at the time of this original release. Funny that this is a problem he hinself had with the mainly uptempo second self-titled 'Rockie Robbins' set he released under MCA 6 years later. Anyway this 1979 'Rockie Robbins' album is definitely a push play classic.

Kymlicka is obviously a socially orientated liberal, and supports arguments to this effect, but is always balanced and considerate in his approach of a wide variety of thinkers. This book is best used in conjunction with other texts and journal articles to gain more incisive insight.I used it in my undergraduate political theory studies to good effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lotte Lenya and Gisela May sing Kurt Weill's Theater Music","review":"It is a rare opportunity to have a record of these two wonderful artists and I feel most fortunate to posess this DVD. Lotte Lenya is the widow of the composer Kurt Weill and the most authentic protagonist of his music of great individuality. The composer, when disapproved for for composing only for his own generation replied, \\"to hell with posterity, my music is for today\\". His and Bertold Brecht's songs live on and the very best interpretations come from Lotte Lenya and Gisela May, who is an outstanding actress and deliveres on this DVD also highly dramatic songs by Paul Dessau, who composed them for Brect's monumental play \\"Mother Courage\\".Some of the songs are sung in German while others are in Englis. For anyone who is acquinted with this era and music this is an irrepacible doccument and for those who were not fortunate enough to know this special sort of Cabaret music at it's best, this is a discovery. Can't praise it enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lotte","review":"I don't know the source of these recordings. Lenya was Weill's widow and performed several of his songs very early on.

There is really no plot at all, and to top it off, Blackie Pride is not the least bit likable. His supposed alienation seems like one big whine after another. Windham's overblown, overly descriptive style does nothing but add more confusion into the mix, and the resolution is completely predictable. Other than the fact that it takes place in Atlanta, there is nothing that feels \\"Southern\\" about the story, and the positive attention it has received because of this classification mystifies me."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"thanks, came in timely manner in good condition, my daughter loves this dvd an plays it alot an sings an dances along with them"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Doodles","review":"Got this for my grand daughter.

Of course music was turned upside down in 1994, so in all the hoopla this album was dismissed too soon. Of course down here in Florida the first single to be played on the radio was \\"Cleopatra's Cat\\". To me that was a mistake to release as a single as it doesn't have the feel to be a single. I feel that \\"Beats In The Woods\\" would've been a better choice as it has that \\"Little Miss Can't Be Wrong\\" beat to it. This was a victim of circumstance I believe, and it's about time to let people know that this is a good album. It's not quite as edgy as \\"Pocket Full Of Kryptonite\\", but still packs power with songs like \\"You Let Your Heart Go Too Fast\\", and \\"Indifference\\", so it does have potential. I feel that if it was released in 1996-97 it might have been a big hit, but 1994 everyone was still into grunge, so this was pushed to the back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Microbes","review":"These are a hoot.

Mr. Bugliosi shows why he's considered one of the best (if not the best) lawyers in this country. This book is a classic case of arrogance, and, well, for lack of a better word: laziness, on both sides of this case. Mr. Bugliosi's writings should be read by anyone even considering a career in law...because if what I saw & read about this case is how law is being taught in this country, we are in for one hell of a crisis in this country for both sides!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Off the point, Abusive, Offensive...","review":"Though I am in agreement with O.J. Simpson's guilt, I found Mr. Vincent Bugliosi's book to be scattered, lacking in true directive and above all, condesending and offensive... This book appears to be more of a tome devoted to Mr. Bugliosi's individual distaste for the world that he finds himself in! Filled with inexplicable tangents on such subjects as \\"pay-telephone\\" pushbuttons, lack of hotel towels, and his repeated rantings about how unhappy he is that, in his opinion, he is the ONLY intelligent person in the world! Repeatedly referring to everyone else including the reader, as stupid, infantile, posessing the I.Q. of \\"room temperature\\"! Keeping the title \\"Outrage\\" in mind one wonders if it is really Mr. Bugliosi's outrage at the Simpson verdict or about his very own, very apparent, \\"shortcomings\\"! I do not recommend this book to anyone. Anyone would be much better served by reading the fine book by Mark Fuhrman"},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Fits, Simpson's a Twit","review":"After speaking with Mr Bugliosi via phone it is no wonder how he wrote such an incredible book. He is one impressive and amiable individual. The fact that he wrote such a book is more a testament to how disgusting that villain Simpson is. Of course, he couldn't please everyone. A smattering of mental midgets still contest his book and \\"tisk tisk\\" his ego. But who cares about them. This book is first rate and so is the man! Viva Bugliosi!"},{"rating":"2","title":"In-depth Analysis of the Case Scores High Points","review":"This is an amazing work that details every aspect of the O.J. Simpson murder trial. Bugliosi's outrage is palpable. How could O.J. walk? I'm still shaking my head in disbelief after all these years. The bungling by the prosecution is particularly well-detailed. As a former prosecutor, he is in a good position to perceive their mistakes. Also, he writes very well so there is no sense of boredom about legal matters. My only question is why he puts so little emphasis on the positives of the defense. Even if the \\"dream team\\" wasn't that great, at the very least, they made fewer mistakes than the prosecution, and should be acknowledged for their consistency.Congratulations Mr. Bugliosi! This is your second real crime classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just More Propaganda for the Conviction","review":"This book does not fairly present the facts. Instead, it tries to say that if the prosecution had been competent he would have been found guilty. But if you read the book \\"Killing Time\\" you will learn that Goldman had bruises on his hands from hitting someone (he was trained in the martial arts) and 30 or so stab wounds, and that Nicole was almost decapitated, resulting in blood all over the place. The evidence against Simpson would have been overwhelming had he done it. Also, the limo driver would have seen him drive up, but didn't. So why all the mind-control? Because the Republicans were pulling another Willie Horton. During the ridiculously long trial the Republicans unexpectedly won the House and Senate. One cannot overestimate the racism in this country."},{"rating":"1","title":"writen for the gullible","review":"In a preface to Shakespeare's \\"Othello\\", A. L.

A book for pin heads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it! Read it! Read it!","review":"Bugliosi is the man you would want representing you if your life was at stake. See how a master Attorney's mind works. If anyone writing a review of this book says that it isn't good, that person is a moron. That person is also most likely a liberal. These are the same kind of people that would vote innocent even if they saw a video of Simpson murdering Nicole and Ron. This is a must read. One of the top 10 books ever, up there with \\"Roots\\" and \\"A Walk Across America\\". Bugliosi shows you what the \\"best\\" attorney money can buy would do. Marcia Clark and Chris Darden are the reason Simpson is walking the streets. And now they are wealthy from writing books of their own. They should be disbared.

This book is for those who were able to watch TV and keep up with the Simpson trial. If you were not able to do so, you'll be lost in this book. I have tried very hard to get through it, because I do like the author, but have only gotten about half way through it. Outrage is just a critique of the attorneys who tried the case -- which you might find of interest if you're an attorney yourself. But if you're looking for the true crime story, this is not the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"In Hindsight...","review":"I read this book when it first came out, whenever that was. Vinnie's only convincing argument was that Cochran obfuscated the truth by setting up the jury against the LAPD, on a non-existent bias based on cops framing minorities. As far as I'm concerned, and I've always believed in OJ's guilt, all the rest of the evidence COULD have been planted by police.At the time of publication, there was no evidence that LA cops had ever framed suspects. Jurors were supposed to make this leap of faith based on their own experience with racial profiling. This is where Vinnie bashes the lawyers and jurors for making, in essence, a verdict that had nothing to do with the crime itself.But as it turns out, LAPD officers WERE planting evidence and conspiring to expedite convictions by lying and backing up their partners. Maybe Furman didn't do this, but the foundation of this book, years later, is sand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to force myself to finish it","review":"While Mr. Bugliosi is a highly talented attorney, his views in this book are difficult to swallow. He spends the majority of time convincing the reader how smart he is and what the outcome would have been had he been the prosecutor. Maybe, maybe not.

Simpson Case","review":"Having ready other works by Bugliosi I certainly was not disappointed by this offering.Bugliosi shows how inept, lazy and ignorant the prosecution were, and how they allowed the defence to destroy their case.Bugliosi clearly has no love for Johnny Cochrane and regularly in this book delights at taking a sideswipe at him and his Dream Team.I felt this was wrong. After all, even though most evidence points to Simpson being the killer it was Cochrane et al's job to try and get OJ off.The only Dream Team member he gives any credit to is Barry Sheck giving the impression that deep down Bugliosi was very impressed.In any case he shows that the Prosecution allowed a guilty man get away with murder something which is unforgivable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult read","review":"Bugliosi could have save hundreds of pages because his single point is made in the first few. He (Bugliosi) is a great trial lawyer and all of those involved in the Simpson case are horrible trial lawyers. He comes across as a pathetic nag. The book is nothing more than page after page of repetitious ridicule."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried to force myself to finish it.","review":"The self-congratulatory braggadocio of the author is most offensive. I do agree with his conclusions and his arguement, which could have been clearly articulated in a lengthy magazine article. In fact, I've read other opinions stating the same thing, and I've not been obsessed with the details of the OJ trials.While I might not agree with the jury's verdict, I would not stoop to calling them stupid or brain dead. Yes, the prosecution and the defense were less than ideal. However, I don't want to sit through page upon page of the author blathering about how wonderful and brilliant he thinks he is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hindsight and Insight","review":"True crime is one of my favorite genres, with Ann Rule and Vincent Bugliosi leading the list of authors I read.\\"Outrage\\" is Bugliosi's assessment of the OJ Simpson trial in LA. As he says early on, this is not a murder mystery. He goes on to prove through his examination of the evidence what could have happened.He blames the prosecuting attorneys far more than the jury itself. He contends that mistakes were made in presenting evidence and in allowing the order of the evidence to elude an important spot in the jury's mind.Although it is easy to lean on what could have been, the old Monday morning quarterback, Bugiliosi offers compelling arguments and clarifies the \\"what if\\" element of this trial."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only OJ book worth reading!","review":"If you were angry about the OJ verdict, you'll be \\"Outraged\\" after reading this. Bugliosi slams the defense, the prosecution and the jurors.

I am giving this book one star primarily because of the authors' decision to price the Kindle version of this book at $26.00. I ordered the book at Barnes and Noble (and read about half of it the day it came in) but held off buying it because I saw on my cell phone that a Kindle version was available. What I missed was the $26.00 purchase price. Shame on you. The whole idea of Kindle is that the author's costs are practically eliminated, and that this savings is shared with the purchaser. $26.00 is just plain greedy. This is one customer you will not be profiting from. I will finish reading the book at the library or book store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy duty chain lock!","review":"I purchased this chain lock for my motorcycle.

Just be careful though, because even though it comes with a protective covering, it may still scratch your bike. Not that it will, you just have to be careful with it because of its size and weight. So far I'm very happy with it and I got it for less $$ than at local stores. I'm also very happy I got the longer length, 64\\".

(It's nearly impossible to keep track of 9 fire lizards, and it's the sort of detail that my mind strays to.) This third book is the least of the series, however, as Menolly is only a supporting character, which I failed to realize until the end.While I do recommend the first two books in this series, I only suggest reading Dragondrums for some amount of closure on Menolly's life in Harper Hall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"I bought this book (used and expensive) thinking this would finally bring some powerful over-the-top magic to rolemaster.

For those who don't believe the Bible, they need to know that the creators of the Urantia book sprung forth or evolved from the Seventh day Adventist Church.

Though many of the stories in the Urantia book are partially true, The Great Cult Mystery points out how they were twisted to fill the agendas of Nazi supportes like William Kellogg, Charles Russell (of the infamous Jehovah's Witnesses, and Bill Sanders (one of the writers of the Urantia Book) into \\"cleansing the human race\\" through preferred breeding and ethnic cleansing.

It was SO easy to relate to Toni as a heroine in this book, and who could help but fall in love with Blue Cooper (and not just because he has a cool name. <g>). The book left me wanting to hang out with the characters in Toni and April's cybercafé, and it left me wanting to read more books by Robyn Amos! You rock, Robyn!"},{"rating":"2","title":"True Blue is Truly good","review":"This was the first book that I read by Robyn Amos and it was really good.

I was so moved then that--even as a poor college student--I bought their cassette tapes for myself and as gifts and was lucky enough to go to a laser show concert of theirs! It is close to two decades now since I lived in Boulder and my tape of theirs has long been missing. Yet, I often yearn for their music and have been drawn to other music that shares some of their quality. Finally, I decided to look for them on the web and am so happy to find the recording of theirs that I first fell in love with--Tears of Joy--available on CD and MP3 download. I still can feel their music and emotion flowing through my body as I watched them up close and live on Pearl St. Mall. I recall the section of the open-air mall with large stones and a 2-year-old girl dancing to their music. The beauty of their music is timeless. It fills my heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just another repackaging","review":"Where some \\"best-of, volume 2\\" collections of an artist are a chronlogical continuation of their charted hits, this disc is a second tier of hits that fell between and around the chart-toppers achieved by Ross with the various Supremes members and on into the post-Ross groups' material. Unless you're complementing the volume one disc and have no other Supremes CD's, there is little here to warrant purchase.The promotional hook about remastered stereo versions yields little satisfaction. Some of the earlier tracks (\\"My World..., for example) are even muddier here than on other compilations and are hardly an improvement over what is available elsewhere.This redundant collection serves as a mid-price, hits-only, no filler, Supremes music marathon. That in itself is fine, there's just nothing really new here if you've already got other Supremes' collections. And technically, there is no real step up here to warrant purchase if that is a consideration."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Saint For Our Times","review":"Loved this book.

I would like to add that every other faucet in my house is a Moen and, generally, am relatively happy with their products. I opened it and discovered that most of the internal parts were brass but most of the outer parts were chrome plated PLASTIC. What a piece of garbage! It felt like I would be able to bust the diverter spout right off the wall. The finish would surely get all scratched up after the first cleaning! I would expect more from Moen. I guess, what do you expect for the price ($82.00 at Lowe's). I gave it two stars only because it was made in the USA, which is great, and because of the low price. I would recommend this product to those who plan on moving soon, or if you don't ever plan on cleaning it! I plan to return mine to the store if I can find another two handle faucet of better quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"Agree with previous reviewer. It's plastic! VERY CHEAPLY MADE!

The mixer body does NOT even have mounting tabs to secure it to the framing. The stems are plastic. The realistic price on this product should be $20. Why would I install this behind my finish work??? This product should be rated as disposable. My faith in Moen is gone.

I've always enjoyed watching the sport but the lack of much TV coverage in the US has made it difficult to pick up some of the finer points of the game and its rules. Rugby for Dummies has helped to fill that gap for me, with plenty of illustrations and descriptions of the individual positions, how they fit into the overall strategy, the principal rules that govern the flow of the game and, perhaps most important, the referees hand signals that explain what is being called and why. For anyone who wants a good reference guide to the sport, this is a the book to have at hand. It not only helps build familiarity for the newcomer, but also serves as a continuing reference for the committed fan who wants to keep on learning."},{"rating":"1","title":"a completely irresponsible publication","review":"You'd expect a book that sells itself specifically as an exam prep book to present information accurately. Unfortunately, this book is so full of inaccuracies and missing information that it's hard to imagine anyone successfully passing the exam based on the information in this book. One example: chapter 2 mentions hashing, and explains that it's used on FAT partitions, but doesn't describe the hashing algorithm. In the chapter summary, they say to expect a couple of hashing questions on the exam. In the review questions, they ask you to hash five file names, and when you turn to the answers in the back of the book, ALL FIVE are done wrong! A breathtaking example of ineptitude! On and on it rambles, with useless diagrams, missing information, skipping over important concepts and emphasizing unimportant ones. On the plus side, it's well written, and easy to follow.

I am a big fan who's also seen him play live and I must say, this is his best album. All of his recordings are superb and astounding but when I first heard songs like, \\"Ultraglide\\" & \\"W.P.L.\\" I was upset because I couldn't believe how INCREDIBLE these songs are. As a struggling guitar player, Chris Whitley's alternately tuned guitars and sonic tone have shattered all my illusions about guitar playing. The album also includes the classics, \\"New Machine\\", \\"Narcotic Prayer\\" and \\"Guns & Dolls\\". One of my personal favorites has always been \\"Never\\". I can't say enough about this album, you'll just have to hear it for yourself, hopefully on a dark desert highway, lost somewhere in New Mexico. Peace Chris!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope Chris Whitley goes back to his \\"Living w/ Law\\" form","review":"\\"Living With the Law\\" was a strong combination of song writing and cutting edge guitar work, an excellent CD indeed. However, \\"Din of Ecstacy\\" is well...noise. Whitley put the emphasis on distorted guitar and feedback. He also didn't focus on the lyrics of his songs. The driving force seems to be a drug culture and I'm not sure weather he favors this culture or is trying to expose it. This music is confusing at best. I'm not surprised he lost his contract over this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kids - don't try this at home","review":"Chris disappeared for an elongated hiatus after the over-hyped debut to primarily work on his heroin consumption. Judging by this album he has overdone it a bit.I quite like the sound of the album (I have always been fond of white noise) but the songwriting and singing is comfortably the worst of this artist's career. It is remeniscent of Lou Reed's \\"Metal Machine Music\\" in the sense that one suspects the creation of the album has an unusual and specific purpose with respect to the artistic control exerted over the artist's work by the label.Having said that, there are some gems on this disc. Notably, the acoustic tracks \\"New Machine\\" and \\"Days of Obligation\\", and the Mascis-like \\"Din\\". But the white noise in Chris's head seems to cloud his vision and critical faculties. Too much talent for many more of these misses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whew...","review":"This is one of those rare instances in which the quality of the album cover art is a great indicator of the quality of the music inside.Wow. Really poor. Chock full of directionless overdistorted riffing and near-incoherent, ridiculous attempts at \\"deep\\" lyrics that would make Jim Morrison roll his eyes. I tried to unload this little treat at three different used CD stores, and none of them would touch it.I can't believe that this is the same Chris Whitley responsible for the beautiful \\"Living With the Law\\" album. I can say that this is an excellent testimony to what drugs can do to a person.I can only conclude that those listeners providing positive reviews must be either truly tormented, really stoned, or one of those music elitists that wears their affected love of the obscure and unlistenable as a badge of cool.AVOID."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheesh","review":"Here is a perfect example of why an inexperienced artist should not be allowed to produce his own recording. This sophmore effort is a bromide that catalyzed the loss of his Sony record deal and alienated his fans of \\"Living With the Law\\". Chris Whitley does a 180 and trys to record his folk songs using distorted electric guitar. The result is a fish out of water, a collection of noise and dissonance. Chris' underlying talent that was evident in 'Law' is still present, if you can stomach the horrible production."},{"rating":"1","title":"symphony suprise angel clock","review":"Beautiful clock,very nice annimation unfortunately clock itself would not work.

YES, IT WAS EASY. I can't believe some people couldn't figure out how to assemble this wine rack. This isn't rocket science! All you have to do is to put a dowel into a hole. It's that simple.

I'm sure he/she knows how to put a round peg in a round hole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Affordable Wine Storage System","review":"I bought ten of these wine racks at my local Target Store and built a 120 bottle wine rack against a wall in a closet.. They do require some work to put together (it took me approximately two hours). But for the price ($8.00 each), it is a fair trade off. I found it easiest to use a hammer to get the dowls to fit in the holes. They are not hard to put together or require any skill other than some pounding with a hammer. I decided not to use the glue that was included since I figured that I would not be able to diassemble it in case we moved. I would reccomend this product to anyone who is looking for an affordable storage option and does not mind doing a couple of hours work assembling them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and Elegant","review":"I read some of the reviews and decided to order one rather than the number I needed. That way if there was a problem I was only out $10. The people that criticized the product must be challenged. It is extremely easy to assemble. The machining was tight and accurate. The finish was adequate. Do not use a metal hammer. Do use a rubber mallet. Glue is optional but definitely not a requirement because of the tight fit. Once assembly is complete, put it on a hard non-fragile surface and make final adjustments with the rubber mallet. I am ordering five more now without reservation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"I bought one of these things too. It looked like it would be perfect for my use. But the thing was impossible to put together. The wooden dowels were much larger than the holes that they supposedly fit into, and it was so unstable that putting more than a few pegs in was near impossible. I returned it and I'm sure they had to dump it due to the damage I had to cause just trying to put it together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"I agree with the reviewer who bought 20 of these to make a very sturdy wine storage system. The essential key in assembling these racks is - follow the directions! It is very important that the smaller wood dowels are POUNDED ALL THE WAY into the holes on the larger dowels.Each small dowel needs to end up equal in length to the others after they are pounded in. To be sure you have pounded each of them all the way into the holes, MEASURE them. The rack is made of oak and does fit together very well if you follow assembly instructions. Each rack takes about an hour to assemble. I saw the same rack for twice the money on a wine web site. Target is offering a great value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tinker Toy Wine Rack","review":"While these wine racks are cheap, they are not as easy to put together as they look. The dowels don't fit well into the holes, and the racks assemble more like tinker toys than anything else. After I put one together, it still seemed very unstable. I would not recommend these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good medium duty clamp","review":"The SumoGrip line from Columbia is a good buy in my opinion.

This model has a traditional screw thread."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thorough and Honest Critique Of British tanks","review":"This book is part one of two by David Fletcher, who is the currator at the British Tank Museum in Bovington. He is an expert on British armor.The book starts in 1939 and explores all types of armored vehicles the British produced frm 1939-1942. It shows how & why their equipment was inferior to the Germans and American vehicles. A lot of B&W; photos, line drawings help illustrate what the author is saying. This is not a book for modelers, not enough details. But it really shows how the soldiers, bureaucrats, politicians, industry types all muddled things up and the tankers paid the price. Ironic since the Brits invented the tank and spearheaded many of the tactical ideas that led to Blitzkreig.Definately recommend for armor collectors/historians."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a classic","review":"One of Mulligans very best small group albums.

I am a diehard fan of Anne, and I have read 99% of her books. This was the first one that I didn't even finish. I gave it about half the book, and then gave up because of the violence and awkward writing style. In fact, the style itself was nothing like Anne's! I would venture to say that Stirling wrote the majority of this work, and I found his style to be crude at best. Although, if you are into violence, hey this is the book for you! In fact, I bet it would be really good for folks who are into that. Anyway, I found it nothing at all like Anne's books, and I wondered how much of a part she had in the writing. I love the rest of the series though, and give the series a 4 star rating. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse-than-usual McCaffrey; a very poor book.","review":"I rarely have such a severe reaction to a book as I did to this, not even to those by the redoubtable Ms McCaffrey, but this really is a lamentably bad book. Set in the same universe as the Ship Who Sang series, this falls far short of even the worst of those. The plot and characterization are about at the level I would expect from a McCaffrey book - thin to nonexistent. Unfortunately, this book also lacks the redeeming feature of most of her books - it is neither fun nor diverting. I usually read McCaffrey for mind candy, but this book possesses too many flaws (superficiality, racism, homophobia, lack of plot, lack of excitement) to commend itself even for this purpose. Don't bother to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good read from the \\"Brainship\\" series.","review":"The book was as advertised by the seller, it was shipped quickly and recieved in good order.I enjoy most of McCaffrey's books as they are easy reads and the characters can be empathised with. This one was co-authored by S.M. Sterling, another good name in the sci fi field to look for. A great combination of dramatic character building and military history/science. It has a follow up book: \\"The Ship Avenged\\". I've ordered and recieved the second book but haven't read it yet so the review is pending.

You can tell the tank seems small and the amount of different fish is defiantly lacking after watching for about 10 minutes you feel like you watching a loop and not the pure feeling of a real fish tank. The quality is great and running in full resolution it is the content that is lacking.

And I wanted this superb Wilton vise. It is everything anyone could ask for:Heavy, solid construction; the screw is covered to keep dust off (Don't forget to lube the screw occasionally. Easy to do); front jaw has an inner pivoting jaw that accepts odd-shaped items; the pivoting jaw can be removed when necessary and it can be raised to act as a bench dog when working on longer pieces.This vise is good looking, too.

The sounds are all over the place, but everything flows together at the same time. \\"Sin Aire\\" sounds like a Latin No Doubt song, awesome ballads such as \\"Tal Vez, Quiza\\" and \\"El Ultimo Adios\\" are surely run away hits. \\"Y Yo Sigo Aqui\\" is the best track on the cd, a pounding club cut that deserves international attention. \\"Vive el Verano\\" is Latin Pop at it's finest, and \\"Sexi Dance\\" is just that... sexy as hell.

The typesetting, while dated, is not much of a distraction, and the text is remarkably clear and written for the autodidact in all of us. It starts out by describing the macroscopic theory of phase transitions created by Lev Landau, and draws what conclusions it can from the theory. It then analyzes the flaws in the theory, and makes a very good intuitive and mathematical arguement for the existence of the renormalization group, and starts drawing results from it. If you're interested in phase transitions and critical phenomena, this book is a must-have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor typsetting","review":"I was very disappointed on receiving this book because of its poor quality typesetting. It uses a very old-technology typesetting program which is mostly courier with integral and summmation symbols added.

With how good his music is, it seems a shame that not many people seem to know of him. I hope that more people would listen to his music and see how good it is.

However, this final season fittingly ended at its very best, and what a wonderful legacy it was. On all points, this third season is superior to the previous two, not to say that the first two were not excellent. The direction, dialouge, acting, script, etc. is exemplary in each episode, and Carradine forever emblazons the unique character of Caine onto television history, indelibly recording his grace, wisdom, and strength into our conscioussness. Each episode is a wonderful story and experience forever encapsuled for us to revisit, and this final season reminds me with certainty why I considered this to be the finest production that ever has, and probably ever will, grace our television screens. Caine comes full circle, and does not fade away, but makes his exit in a beacon of glory, after leaving a trail of mended hearts, souls, and minds. Perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor follow-up to Greatness Grasshoper","review":"Season 1 and 2 are truly excellent representations of what television can be. Caine is rational man in an irrational world, purposeful & heroic. Sadly, the 3rd series becomes extremely mystical and delves into large amounts of superstition & pseudo-psycho babble. Gone are the profound stories dealing with racism, family, art, life, death, etc. They are replaced with ghosts, 2nd sight, an over indulgence in the past, and a general decline in the quality of the stories & themes.

It did approach this end but quickly shifted gears away from being the thriller I come to expect from Jack Higgins. I was disappoointed with the very limited roles of Jake Cazlet and Blake Johnson, yet pleased to see that General Ferguson\\"promoted\\" Billy Salter into the Service. The IRA antagonists to Dillon never reached the crescendo they did in Dark Justice and certainly Dillon and Blake Johnson rarely interacted thus leaving the reader wondering about why Blake was even involved in this story. Higgins has to keep Dillon on the edge and use Blake and Billy as foils the way he so ably used Hannah Bernstein.Higgins is still a master of the genre but I feel he wrote this one \\"Without Mercy\\" for his loyal fans and readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feels like a Rushed Job to me","review":"My sentimentals are like the others: I think Jack Higgins is ready to move on from Sean Dillon.

Now I pick up a Higgins novel hoping against hope that I will see a spark of the old Jack Higgins. Alas, his novels are getting progressively worse. As Jerry Saperstein put it in his review, Higggins has hit bottom in this latest outing.There's so much wrong with this latest Sean Dillon venture that it's hard to know where to begin. Cardboard characters, juvenile dialogue, inane plotting are just the beginning. It's time to end this Sean Dillon serial. It's become a joke. Higgins is ripping off the public by putting out this stuff milking his earlier success without putting in a honest day's work.

After reading \\"Without Mercy\\", I know I haven't missed much. This hackned effort is just plain awful--like some rank amateur's first effort in a creative writing class. The dialog is wooden, predictable,filled with cliche's. The plot, what little there is of it, is flat, difficult to follow, disjointed to the point of confusion, unbelievable, and, surprising for a Higgin's novel, without suspense or excitement. Now for the bad news: the characterization. Shallow stereotypes all, each with a particular macho preference for his own type of booze, all dead-eye marksmen, all without wit, charm, individuality, or development of any kind.

For the Mesa Verde setting. Long story short: Anna Pigeon is a lush, she left an NPS post she liked for what seems a contrived reasons, lives in a dorm with a bunch of self-centered girls (using the term on purpose). Then she solves the \\"mystery\\" and gets housing of her choice. Of course being Anna, she'll leave for another National Park right away.The story made no sense; the writing was disjointed; the characters either unsympathetic or enigmatic to a fault. What Nevada Barr doesn't know about Navajo culture would fill a few encyclopedias. For a great series set in this region, read Tony Hillerman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd","review":"I found this book in the free bin where I live and picked it up. It was a give-away from the library (I can see why) that I was cursed with picking up. Never really developed characters, characters not all that engaging and a bland non-engaging pace. 3/4ths of the way I found myself thinking of the characters as the characters from Scooby Doo cartoons I would watch when I was a kid, trying to to take the mask off the \\"monster\\" and sadly that thought never ended.The idea was not bad, the excution, awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing particularly unique or special as mysteries go..","review":"I had heard so much hoopla about Nevada Barr's books I had to read one for myself.

She gives us a sense of place making us part of the southwest she loves so much. The descriptive scenes are breathtaking.I am very fond of Anna Pigeon, her vulnerabilities balance her awesome virtues. Her very physical confrontations with evil make we wince; Anna gives new meaning to the word \\"resilliance.\\" Her alcoholism is a very real factor in her makeup; the author is deft in her understanding and descriptions.The plot is somewhat loose and scattered. There are enough characters to be confusing, though Ms. Barr is careful not to make them interchangeable. Because the physical landscape is loose and sprawling, the reader is more forgiving of a plot with the same features.Ill Wind has some wonderful humorous dialogue, very clever, wry and funny. Frederick Spalding is a delightful personality, about as far from your average FBI agent as you can get.This is a feel-good, satisfying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"DId I get a Dud Unit?","review":"Bought a used one from a marketplace seller.

After losing his parents Emmett rushed into marriage with Adell and had kidspretty soon afterwards. No one pointed out to him that maybe rushing into a marriage and a family wasn't a good idea especially after losing both his parents instead all the fault of the divorce is on his wife from what's mentioned in the book and how Emmmett tries Melody I can understand why Adell left.

AND, I kept reading hoping to get some of the life, or cleverness, or spirit of *FUN* that was in her other novels - it never showed up.Just because its Christian doesn't mean it can't be interesting...what happened?

When did that happen? While they were yelling at each other or ignoring each other?! Never mind pride, what ever happened to common sense? For this book to work I think you need to just take leave of every sense of reality you have and simply believe in puffs of blue smoke!!

After you move this back and forth a few times the plastic pole just breaks off. We keep a pen next to each one in our bedrooms to change it. Off is really required in a bedroom. Leviton doesn't have a part number for it and the only thing they suggest is for me to send the whole unit back for exchange. Given that I have 5 of these and 3 are broken in less than 12 months constantly returning these things just doesn't seem like a tenable response. I was hoping they could either give/sell me a bag of these cheap parts or maybe a metal one. This is terrible customer support. I'm going to switch them out for a better quality unit. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Product","review":"NEGATIVES:- doesn't work with modern CFL's- misnamed, should not be called an occupancy sensor. Does not sense occupancy; rather senses motion only, stop moving and the light switches off- adjusting to compensate (add time delay) improves a bit but defeats energy conservation savings by holding the light on longer when you leave the room!- wastes energy, light always comes on when entering when otherwise you may not have (quick in/out)and stays on after leaving (adjustable)- privacy, night window blinds may be open when you enter after a shower (though the neighbours may enjoy the show, or not)POSITIVES:- noneFlawed concept. Far better to design a switch with auto turn-off only. Make it look and act like a normal manual switch that must be turned on (but will turn off if left on accidently). Have a narrow sensor preset to switch off after 15 minutes of no movement. Now that would be true energy saver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad marketing for this product","review":"This was basically the only indoor light sensor at our local home depot.

I needed the functionality though and decided to install it away. The short product life cycle proved me correct. After some initial fidaling I got it to work reliably ... but for only about three weeks. The motion sensor failed and the product was obviously uselesss without it. The manual slider switch also did not function mechanically. It did not align with the internal dip switch offering \\"off\\" or \\"auto\\" but not \\"on\\" due to restricted slide travel length on the bezel case.

Mischa Barton needs to take acting lessons, because there is more to being a good actress than the ability to cry on command.

In season two, Julie had an affair with Jimmy instead of Luke. Kirsten and Sandy had marital problems...again. They both ALMOST cheated on each other...again. Ryan and Marissa were dramatic about their relationship...again. Seth's character was no longer funny, but annoying. And Summer was just stupid.

It works just fine for connecting my MP3 player to my stereo. I chose this cable over other cables because the image shows a rubber stopper piece that keeps the cable together at the Y where it splits in two. What bothers me most is that the cable they sent me doesn't have the rubber stopper. Not a big deal, but I find that over time these cables split further and further.In reality, it's not that big of a deal, so I would have given it more stars, except that other people also seem to be buying this for specific features (gold plating) and people aren't getting what they're being advertised. One customer image, as well as the actual product image, shows the rubber stopper. Mine is gold plated...unlike the customer image.Bottom line, it's a crap shoot.

If you want to ruin the films' mystery elements, this is definitely the book to have, since the author has bizarrely decided to tell the reader the identity of the killer in a wrong-headed appendix. But in all this something is missing. What could it be? The true sense of the films themselves perhaps? A degree of style? Yes, that's what I'm missing here.

The figures and equations are so tiny as to be mostly unreadable. While you can change text size, the figures and equations remain tiny.

I just want to confirm that this is an absolute masterpiece of melodic hard rock. This is Gotthard at the top of their game and the songwriting is world class throughout. In a genre where hype and exaggerated claims by zealous fans are the norm, Gotthard truly delivers with this album. There's a reason why every reviewer on Amazon sounds like a paid shill...the album is that good. Well, all Gotthard albums are worthwhile, but this one hit it out of the ballpark.These guys would be massive in the US with just a little exposure, but it's no wonder they're so successful in Europe.

There really isn't one bad song on the album. It opens with '' All We Are'' ( a great opener) number 3 ''Lift You Up'' ( a great crowd anthem) 4. ''Everything I Want''( a perfect ballad but not less than I expected as Gotthard write the perfect ballads!) and 7. ''I'm Alive'' ( my personal favorite....it rocks!)

Their fears, joys, anguish, delights, and struggles with the serious business of becoming adult are all evident in this memorable novel. Like some of his other novels, this one is set in Saint Paul in the late 1940s, and involves young people at Central High. The hero, a physically small boy with a great heart, struggles to keep his family together at a time when the county welfare people want to place his brothers and sisters in foster homes. There is much more trouble, and the young man meets these crises with courage and ingenuity, even as he wrestles with his own sorrows.

SKELETON MAN falls into # 3. With a script seemingly thrown together piecemeal, surprisingly bad performance from the usually good Michael Rooker; a typical bad performance from Casper van Dien; and special effects out of a bad Japanese movie. The killer Skeleton Man comes up with weapons apparently out of thin air; the horse changes colors throughout the film; a fisherman is shot from behind with an arrow which is in the front of his chest; and nothing is ever really depicted as to exactly who his critter is and why the climax ends up in a chemical plant?

The movie consists of a crack government group doing a search and rescue of a missing group and getting picked off one by one by Joe Cottonmouth.

It is very heavy and appears to be well made, time will be the test as it is outside with the generator. The chain cover is very nice and makes it easier to handle. I gave it 4 stars because the lock is not easy to unlock. This lock would likely deter any thief because of its appearance. However, as a bike lock it may be a bit impractical due to its weight--it's heavy. For a motorcycle it may be more practical, but it will add weight if you are storing it. This model has a smaller gauge than the 5016, which is thicker, but the manufacturer gives them the same rating. I found a review of locks on the internet and this type of lock and the similar Kryptonite brand rated the highest for security purposes.

It has blinders to blind it from people passing by in the hall but it doesn't do a good enough job (angle still is pretty wide).The reason for the 1 star though is in any other area where there was ambient light the light settings would fail. If you calibrate it at dusk for that level of light it would refuse to turn on at night, if you moved it even a notch for more light it'd turn on all day.

We've adopted a policy of switching them on and leaving the lights on, using electrical tape over the sensor when needed. We wasted a LOT of cash on these switches and they were useless.

After receiving the tool, I can confirm that it is built like a tank, but functions about as well as a one legged mule. The punches are very difficult to remove from their stations. The tool and punches were full of grit and grime. It is almost impossible to get the punches to center up on the brass base. They don't contact the base evenly when compressed.

The receiving surface is flat so cutting clean is impossible unless you place something penetrable underneath the belt while attempting to use the tool. The word professional was my deciding factor because the tool is sturdy and feels durable but at the end of the day the result or execution falls miserably short. I will be taking my tool to a machine shop to see if they can bore a hole on the receiving end.

Also faded and spotty after one washing, Smokey blue faded to a peachy color; especially on the pillow cases. Feels like a very fine sandpaper to the skin; like they are heavily starched or something. Definitely not what I expected since these are supposed to be 100% egyptian cotton with singly-ply yarns. Some reviews say they are the softest sheets ever. It's almost as if there are two different sets of sheets being sent out! On the plus side they did seem to be a good thickness and looked very nice out of the package (although they wrinkled very badly after washing)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrinkled","review":"Disappointed to say the least.

They don't stretch out like some do. They stayed soft and crisp all night. Some reviews said they wrinkle. They are cotton, which will wrinkle if you don't follow some good laundry habits. Shake them out before putting into the dryer, and don't overdry them. My dryer took about 40 minutes to dry, but yours may be different. You can always check and dry a bit longer as needed. When the dryer stops, get them out and put on the bed, or fold for storage. No wrinkles.

I'm glad I bought them.I bought a full set in chestnut which is beautiful color that is accurately represented in the picture (perhaps half a shade darker if I really dissected it). The sateen finish really makes it glow against my dark wood bed and light green duvet cover. The sheets ran big in terms of length AND width, really evident with the fitted sheet. I was a bit surprised and thought it was marketed as one of those full/queen sets. Nope, they're just big. Easy fix as I tuck the sheet underneath but it is a little more work when I change sheets. At least they don't run small.After washing/drying the sheets as directed, I have not experienced any pilling as of yet. The 400 thread count sheets still feel cool and smooth. I would definitely purchase another set in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty nice, a little rough","review":"We have been fairly pleased, but not blown away, by these sheets.

I searched through many different sets, and after reading the reviews on these Pinzon 400-thread count Egyptian cotton sheet sets, I decided to order them at this most affordable price. Wow!! They fit better than any other sheets we ever owned, even had a longer drape on the sides. No more tug of war for a little bit more of sheet to cover with.

So i then followed another reviewer's advice and soaked them in fabric softener and that softened them a bit, but nothing to actual softness. I then read online to use baking soda and vinegar to soften clothes, so i soaked them in 1cup of each in hot water for over an hour and they are still rough and not soft. Also, they tend to have this chemical odor that won't go away. I would definitely return them if i could and next time will be sure to buy organic or bamboo sheets.

The fit is generous, which is wonderful for making the bed and ... keeping the sheets from riding up etc. I just ordered another set so I can get rid of my other ill-fitting, poor quality sheets! I think that 400-count is fabulous and I'm beginning to think that higher thread count is actually a scam. Who needs anything better? The sheets advertised as 1500 thread count turn out to be microfiber/polyester! I just don't think any sheet could be more comfortable and well-made than these 400-count sheets. The colors are great, too. The pillow cases are perfect and the hemming is exceptional. I just hope that the sewers and people who make these are not in a sweat shop of some sort!

I've also read that if you wash them with baking soda, they soften up faster.The only real issue I have with these sheets is that if you put them in the dryer with a full load, they get twisted up and end up with a ton of creases, enough that it makes the sheets uncomfortable for the first few nights. These wrinkled right up on the first wash, and I ended up ironing them because it drives me so crazy. They don't iron well enough that you can't see the wrinkles anymore, but it loosens them up enough that they're comfortable to sleep in. To avoid this problem, make sure you don't load the dryer more than half full."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soft Fabric And Lovely Color","review":"I got the Smokey Blue Queen sheets and Love them. I've had the sheets for about a week so I don't know how they'd fare in the long run, but they seem very sturdy so far. The color compliments the rest of my bedroom decor which is a cherry dark brown with lots of warm beige and crisp white colors and florals. I tend to buy more breathable cotton so I don't look for a higher thread count. These sheets are just breathable enough, but the thread count lends a more luxurious almost silky feel. I didn't feel any of the itch that I read about in the other reviews. The sheets feel a bit crisp, and I'm sure with a few more washes they'll probably being to get even more soft, like cotton often does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small after 2 washings","review":"We bought the more expensive sheets, expecting higher quality but the cloth seems coarse. Washed in cool water and dried it normal. After one washing the bottom sheet was REALLY tight, but we decided to give it a try. We hate to send things back unwarranted. After the second wash (Cool and cool) it was even tighter - my husband the only one who could put it on - and it probably won't fit after another wash. We checked the mattress, which is a queen, memory foam, and it measures 79\\"x 59\\" and is well inside the normal Queen dimensions. The pillow cases also feel scratchy so we are sending the set back.Love Amazon's return policy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality.Scratchy fabric.","review":"I washed with lots of softener 3 times, but the fabric still feel very scratchy. I can't stand sleeping in this, will not purchase again."},{"rating":"1","title":"scratchy cardboard","review":"these sheets felt great when I opened the package but I washed them once and they now feel like cardboard. They are so scratchy and have instant piling from one wash I am very very unhappy about this purchase. I purchased a sheet set from Walmart a couple years ago and they are much much much much softer. Dont fall for all these great reviews. Its a risk at any price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honest to God these are Terrible","review":"I thought I'd give these a try especially because the $50 price tag for 400ct egyptian cotton and mostly decent (4star) reviews. Wow what a waste of money. These sheets don't feel like any 400ct I've ever owned and I question it's 100% egyptian claim. They are rough, with a feeling more similar to tissue paper than soft, luxurious sheets Pinzon claims to be. The other reviewers who rave about its softness have obviously never purchased quality sheets before. At the end of the day, you can get MUCH (and I can't stress enough the difference in quality) softer 400ct pima sheet sets at Macy's if you bring a 15% off coupon for the another $20. Trust me, if you actually want quality then these sheets will just be a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"stiff sheets","review":"I have never written a review because I have never really been unhappy with any of my purchases.....but these sheets suck. They were stiff when I took them out of the package, so I threw them in the wash and they did not get much better. Definitely not what I thought soft 100% egyptian cotton sheets were supposed to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sheets at a Remarkable Price","review":"These sheets are exceptionally good quality. They launder perfectly and stay soft to the touch. My only (very minor) complaint is that the white sheets aren't a true dazzling blue-white, but more of a slightly off-white. This is not a problem with the colors, only the white. Other than that, I'd order more, and I've already recommended them to family members and friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who knew they could mess up white?","review":"I read a number of reviews from people who were disappointed in the color of the sheets when they received them. Since I was ordering white, I didn't think that would be an issue. I was wrong. The photo showed a bright, clean white. When I opened the box and saw the sheets, I immediately checked the color on the label because I assumed they sent me the wrong color. They were, at best, a cream color. When I held them against actual white pillow cases, they just looked dingy. I was very disappointed and returned the sheets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best Burlap I Ever Slept On","review":"The 400-Thread Egyptian cotton sheets were the worse one I have ever used. Even after washing and drying six times, following the manufacturer's directions, they still felt like burlap. This product should be called 100-Thread burlap, use with extreme caution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad elastic","review":"I loved these sheets....at first....but now...not so much! The material of the sheet is just fine but the elastic on the fitted sheet has gradually got to the point that I had to put sheet suspenders on or it comes off in the middle of the night. I've had lots of sheets over my lifetime and the sheets always have worn thin before the elastic gave out. I was planning on buying a second pair when I first got these because I really liked them but am sooooo glad I didn't now! A Big Disappointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these sheets !!","review":"Super nice sheets for the price. Love the 400 thread count and the egyptian cotton is fantastic for the really super low price I paid. But, I would have paid much more for them because the quality is superb.

Can't go wrong with these sheets, just perfect !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some of the most uncomfortable sheets I've ever slept on","review":"I bought these sheets based on the number of good reviews. It took several months to receive them as others have said, but I'm far more disappointed in the quality. I washed them with fabric softener before using them and after sleeping on them for 2 nights, I'm taking them off the bed. The are extremely scratchy and very uncomfortable. Putting my face on the pillow is like sleeping against cheap wool. They're horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Soft","review":"From the gushing reviews of these sheets, I thought I was getting quite the deal when I bought them. However, I was extremely disappointed in their quality. While they're a gorgeous color (I got the blue), they feel like cardboard. I've washed them twice and have not felt any difference in the softness. I have a set of sheets I got on clearance at Sears that I like much better and are MUCH softer. I will think twice before ordering linens from Amazon again."},{"rating":"2","title":"luxurious comfort","review":"my concern was that these sheets might not have the \\"feel\\" I was looking for.

I researched for a couple of days prior to purchasing as I did not want sheets with a heavy sheen. When these first arrived I thought I had made a mistake as they were very shiny in the package. Once I washed and placed them on the bed, they were comfy and soft and they are very durable. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Sheets, Great Bargain","review":"These sheets are soft and the size is generous making them fit well. The fabric is sturdy but is soft to the touch.They are great sheets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreamy!","review":"I love this sheets! They feel thick and substantial compared to my other sheets. Very comfortable (and comforting). It's quite soothing to slip in between them after a tiring, stressful day. They do wrinkle quite a bit after washing which may bother some people. I don't mind that though. Comfort is all I'm after. If I had the spare cash, I'd be buying additional sets to replace my remaining sheets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product","review":"I read the reviews about these sheets and decided to take a chance. They were fine write out of the bag, Then after two weeks I washed them, cold water and light heat on the dry. They shrunk, WOW !!!! I have never had a pair of sheets shrink before. It appears that I got a pair of the bad ones. Good luck to you if you purchase these sheets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in China--persistent chemical smell","review":"These sheets are made in China.

Thank you for offering these quality sheets and you can be sure I will return to Amazon time and time again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice sheets","review":"I bought these in the Friday sale for $29.Great buy in my opinion. The top sheet is oversized, plently of over hang on the sides. The fitted sheet also a nice size. Washed them first before putting them on the bed, yes they do have a slight wrinkle coming out of the dryer nothing to that effects comfort. I would say the softness is okay, I don't think they are scratchy at all. They could be a little softer but for the price I think these sheets are well worth the money. I'm waiting for the sale again to get another set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly Sheets","review":"I ordered these sheets as a gift. They will be replaced. The \\"Sateen\\" suggested to me that these would be smooth and wrinkle resistant. Not so. I tried to iron the wrinkles out of the pillow cases and could not. The gift recipient can live with the wrinkles but the sheets are not smooth, especially for an elderly person. These sheets are a great buy if a) having Egyptian Cotton is important to you, b) you are not bothered by a lot of wrinkles no matter how soon you get the sheets out of the dryer, and, c) smoothness is not an issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for!","review":"I expected a great set of sheets for an incredibly low price. My mistake. It is true, \\"you get what you pay for.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"not really available","review":"I ordered these sheets in January. They were delayed three times and are now expected to come in September (9 months later). I expect them to be delayed again at that time.

They notified me later that it wouldn't ship until March 8th. Then they notify me on March 7 that it won't ship until April 9. And it said it was in stock when i placed the order - totally wasted my time selecting and anticipating the arrival of these new sheets. Anyway, you can get decent enough sheets at Ross or Nordstrom Rack for cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratchy - Do not buy these!","review":"After reading all of the positive reviews of these sheets, I thought for sure I was getting a great product. I just purchased a new-sized bed, and was hoping to use just this one set of sheets until my bridal shower in a few months. I was so careful to follow the instructions for washing, but it doesn't seem like it matters at this point. These sheets are SO scratchy!! Do not buy them!I find it very frustrating that this is the type of product that can't be returned, because I really feel like I wasted my money. I'm going to have to use my old pillow cases until I can get a new set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never buy Target sheets again!","review":"These are the first high thread count sheets I've ever owned, as typically they cost so much money. I got these around Christmas and they are all that's been on the bed since. I have washed them weekly without fail and they look brand new still. They are so soft, especially compared to the Target sheets I've always had in the past- and they even fit thick mattresses! It's a fantastic deal. I plan on getting 3 more sets so I can rotate through them and kave mroe variety for color. The one complaint I have is that they are ALWAYS wrinkled, but they are under a blanket, so no one can see that anyhow. Also, note that the \\"white\\" color is more of a soft or winter white- not off white or ivory, but not a brilliant white either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soft but the \\"Blush\\" color is orange","review":"After waiting over a month for the sheets they FINALLY arrived. They are very soft and comfortable but the color is NOT what it looks like online. Amazon shows the color as being a light pink when the sheets are more of an ugly light orange.

Look forward to something different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I got these sheets after reading 5 star reviews, and when I received them I was not happy.

I'm sending the link to my daughter, and I thought should write a review since I'm so happy with them. I bought the taupe which is beautiful. The sheets are very generously cut. I usually sew a 14\\" of an older sheet on the bottom so I have more fold over; however, these sheets are longer and wider than any others I have used. The fitted bottom sheet is quite deep, so I have less wrestling to do to put them on.

Stitching appears to be of quality, and I do like how nicely the fitted sheet fits. It's been a struggle finding snug fitted sheets since my mattress is of an average thickness. Hats off to Pinzon.But this is not comfortable bedding. The sheen gave the impression of a \\"sateen\\" feel, but not so. The cotton is rough, scratchy and feels like polyester. To be fair, they've only been washed once and could soften over time, but we'll have to see. Judging by how wrinkled they were coming straight out of the dryer, that may only be wishful thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"bellflower","review":"i had purshased pinzon 400 thread count 100% Egyptian cotton sheets, the sheets are wonderful to sleep on, and i recieved them quickly, i would highly recommeneded these sheets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very soft","review":"I actually returned these sheets, they do not feel soft at all and were actually pretty scratchy. I like the color, is just as described, but unfortunately the feel of these sheets was quite dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Giant splotches of color were coming out of the pillow cases after 2nd wash.The top sheet was so big, it was unusable -- a full 3 feet wider than each side of the bed, even though it was labeled as a queen.And most importantly, they were not that soft.Returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably one of the worst sheet sets ever!","review":"Perhaps the color has something to do with why I found my sheets to be horribly stiff, wrinkly and hard. I purchased the plum and they even smelled funny out of the package. I tried washing them twice to no avail. They still had a lingering odor and were thick and hard. I think I could get a better night's sleep on cardboard. Never again will I purchase sheets I can't feel first. Lesson learned. Those who are considering the plum, try your luck on another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"These sheets are NOT soft. I don't understand how they can be such a high thread count and be so stiff and rough. I sent them back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratchy!","review":"I received these sheets the first part of April hoping to get the same comfort as my Scala 100% Egyptian Cotton 400 TC sheets. These sheets have been washed at least 10 times in the hopes they would soften up.One word describes these sheets. SCRATCHY! Trust me, don't buy these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I ordered these sheets based on a review where I saw someone said these were extremely soft, and comfortable sheets; and they are the best they ever owned. They are anything but!! They are cool to the touch, which I adore, but beyond that, they are incredibly stiff and wrinkly. We've washed and rewashed with increasing fabric softener, but it doesn't change much. I'm not sure why everyone gives them such a great report... but if you're looking for soft, cool, cotton sheets checkout something else. Last time ordering sheets off Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money!","review":"These sheets are the most comfortable soft, silky,cool & luxurious sheets at first! but after a few washings they have developed rips/holes all over, like big moth holes, the fabric is sub par obviously, washed in cool water on delicate and now they look like swiss cheese!and are good for cleaning rags only, the pillow cases and sheets are covered in these 1\\" holes. they are stored with other linens that have no holes, so it is not due to a moth problem.I cannot not recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Doesn't live up to 400 count quality. After a half dozen washing of my queen size sand colored sheets they are still rough. Would not order again."},{"rating":"2","title":"fabulous value","review":"Once you've slept on high quality sheets, you never want to go back. Over the years I've paid hundreds for sets and considered them worth every penny, as they grew softer, silkier, and cooler with every wash. When I saw this set, I thought it might be too good to be true, especially given the widely contrasting reviews. Personally, I was thrilled with the sheets after the very first wash. Now, I've had them almost a year, and I love them even more. They're wonderfully indulgent and soothing to slip into at night or for a nap. They really do get better with every wash. They're very durable - I see no thin spots and have had no pilling whatsoever. Though this set is still in great condition, I'm considering buying another set to stash away just in case these stop being available on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not satisfied","review":"The sheets are not like they advertise. The only thing Egyptian cotton is the stitching and even that I doubt. They feel and look extremely cheap. I will be returning ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unexpected rough texture after washing in cold water.","review":"The color was not true to the picture.The texture of the sheets and pillow cases is extremely rough after washing in cold water twice to get the \\"new\\" smell out. Read in reviews that washing in cold water would keep them softer. Very disappointed in the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not so soft","review":"These sheets to be 400 thread count isnt soft at all, I washed them a couple times and still feel about the same as when I took them out of the box, thats bad. Maybe after a few more washing's they will get softer, if not then the next time will go for more of a thread count."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay on bed...but SCRATCHY!","review":"I have a pillow top on both sides of my mattress, so it has been difficult to find sheets that fit well. These fit my mattress beautifully, so I ordered a second set. While the first set is not the softest, it is okay, and I use them regularly. However, the second set is unbelievably scratchy, even after many washings with fabric softner. I finally threw them out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong size label","review":"I ordered \\"full.\\" The labels on both top and bottom sheets say \\"full.\\" But when I put them on the bed, they were much too large. I measured them. I checked the dimensions in the product description. They are really \\"queen\\" size.They seemed all right quality-wise. If they fit, I'd keep them, although I suspect the hemstitching will prove to be a rip waiting to happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly scratchy fabric","review":"I've washed these sheets more than 10 times and they are only now tolerably unscratchy. At first the smell of the sheets is quite overwhelming (2-3 washes to get rid of) but then trying to sleep on the sheets is a nightmare. After 10 washes and a significant amount of fabric softener, they are at least usable, though I still find myself waking up on the couch after a restless night in these sheets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrinkly sheets with chemical smell","review":"These seem to be Amazon's own brand and were just not up to my expectations. I had to wash them 4 times just to get the strong chemical smell out of the sheets. I followed the care instructions but the sheets wrinkle terribly. I had to wrestle them on our extra thick mattress (all other sheets I've bought fit fine) and still couldn't get one corner all the way on. The top sheet also is not as wide as usual. They are just a medium softness, nothing impressive, and definitely not as nice as the last set I bought for just $10 more.Would not recommend or buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratchy & wrinkly","review":"I'm hoping that if I wash these sheets to death, they will soften up. So far I've washed them twice with both fabric softener and dryer sheets and they are the scratchiest sheets I own. These are the only \\"luxury\\" sheets I own, and they are worse than all my others which are standard sheets. They are also wrinkly straight out of the dryer.... which I don't really care about but just be aware. Look elsewhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice sheets!","review":"Not sure why other reviewers mentioned \\"scratchiness\\" of the sheets being a problem. Yes, they're stiff out of the package, but one regular washing immediately solved the problem. The sheets are comfy and soft and so far no problem, but it's only been a week or so. The color is pretty much exactly like it showed on my monitor, I wouldn't quite say \\"plum\\" (I think much darker), but it's a deep lilac. I did notice that while the fitted sheet fits perfectly now, I hope that doesn't change after several more washings due to shrinkage. It does have extra room for mattresses with a thick pillow-top, but we don't have that on our full-size mattress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"I bought 600 TC 100% cotton sheets and these 400 TC Egyptian Cotton at the same time. Both arrived the same day and both were washed. I can't even use the 600 TC sheets -even after 24 hours in fabric softener and repeated washings. However, these 400 TC sheets are nice. Not as soft as I'd like but I can tell after only one washing that they will indeed reach the desired softness in very little time. I stand behind Egyptian Cotton 100% of the time. You can't go wrong. I would buy these again."},{"rating":"2","title":"No piling!","review":"I had a bad experience with sateen once and was a little reluctant to try it again. My old sateen sheets had piled after one wash. I noticed this product advertised as 1-ply which is supposed to be really good. After 5 months or so and 5 washes, there is no piling, which was selling point for me. Piling had always itched my skin and gave me problems sleeping. I have no such problems with this sheet set. It is a good buy. Especially for those who are tired of piling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fitted Sheets for queen bed, Purchased from Amazon","review":"The sheets arrived as stated. color and size was as describe, 2 sheets, 1 bottom and 1 top with pillow cases. They are thicker than our previous sheets, but should wear as well. We believe it was a good purchase. RLC"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome sheets","review":"I think they are great and I wash them in a front loading wash machine to avoid the rough handling caused by a regular top loading wash maching. Very soft and comfortable. A little large for my foam mattress but not so bad as I use a add-on pillow top for comfort (foam gets warm). Would recommend these to anyone looking for excellent sheets at a great price."},{"rating":"1","title":"not soft enough for me","review":"would not buy these again, there were not very soft like I thought they would be, would have returned them if I hadn't washed them in an attempt to soften them up."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT smooth-sleeping","review":"Although the sizing is generous and I liked the blush color, these sheets are a disappointment. Once the sizing washed out they became rough in texture; I've slept on smoother muislin. Despite the claims of being silky smooth, I did not find these sheets to be comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the faint of heart","review":"I would not buy these again. Unfortunately, they were not soft in the slightest and have remained, despite multiple washings very institutional in feel. If you are looking for soft and comfortable sheets I suggest you look further."},{"rating":"1","title":"go for the higher count","review":"I've gotten other 400 count sheet sets (Royal Velvet) and they are ot nearly as scratchy as these. Hate them. Washed them twice before using them. Used fabric softener- still like sandpaper. Color is darker than shown. And they wrinkle! sick of ironing sheets! Very disappointed...wondering if bleach will help the color and break down the fibers enough to make them soft...otherwise I'll only use them when the hubby is in the doghouse and I'm sleeping on the couch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"400-count sheets","review":"What A Waste Of Money! After two washings, these sheets come out of the dryer loooking like they were rolled up in a ball, while wet, and left to dry. I have T-shirts that come out of the dryer looking better than these sheets. Unless you iron your sheets, or have someone iron them for you, save your money. I'm embarassed to put them on my bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy with product","review":"Just used the sheets for the first time. Very happy with the look, feel and thickness of the sheets. They feel like they are of good quality. My only negative is that the sheets are wider than most and almost touch the floor on either side of our queen size bed, but not a big deal anyways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soft, very durable sheets","review":"I purchased these sheets a little over a year and a half ago and love them. The sheets have had frequent washings (due to allergies) and are maintaining their color and shape. There has been no shrinkage - the fitted sheet still fits easily over all 4 corners of my pillow-top California king. I'm very pleased with the color (Chestnut) and the value for the price. I was so pleased w/the quality that I bought another set for my guest bed!Update: After about 2 years the sheets are starting to discolor a little from body oil and washing, but still holding up very well. I wash them in hot water/dry on medium/hot and the fitted sheet is still fitting over the mattress like it did on the first day. I have not noticed any thinning of the material and the stitching is holding (great quality!). I'm still very pleased w/these sheets and will probably purchase here next time I need sheets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sheets!","review":"Awesome sheets. Washed up nice, very soft, thick, but cool, and not uncomfortable. Will wrinkle quickly if not removed from the dryer quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Sheets ever","review":"These sheets were a little stiff at first but once they were washed they softened up nicely.

I've had multiple people comment on how nice it looks and feels. Would definitely recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratchy","review":"These sheets are not soft or smooth. The pillowcase in particular felt rough and terrible against my face. My basis for comparison is sheets from Crate and Barrel.

I Think Not.","review":"These sheets are extremely stiff and rough. After numerous washings and ultimately soaking in vinegar overnight they became somewhat soft enough to use. They are unlike any Egyptian cotten sheets I have ever owned, and I am skeptical that there are what they are advertised to be . They were not worth $59. I regret my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Lasting Sheets I Have Ever Had","review":"I thought they looked good and mine felt OK. The problem I had is that they only lasted a little over a year. There were tears in the fitted sheet and the pillow cases were coming out at the seams. I have never had this problem with sheets before. Even really cheap ones. They usually last longer than I want them. These are obviously poorly made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peach?!","review":"The color is completely off from the website description. These are PEACH! The quality seems okay so far, but did I mention they are PEACH?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Rough Sheets","review":"I'm quite disappointed with this set of sheets. I washed them prior to using, and honestly, they have a very scratchy and rough feeling. I'm hoping that with time and additional washings they'll feel more like sateen. Now, they feel like poplin or light weight canvas. No exactly what I want to sleep on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as soft as I'd imagine...","review":"Received these today and am a bit disappointed. I opened the package and gave the sheets a good feel. Although the quality of the stitching and fabric is defiantly noticeably higher, they didn't feel any softer than my WalMart bought, no thread count specified, cotton-poly blend sheets. I figured, maybe they need to be washed to \\"bring out the softness\\". Nope. Still feel the same as my cheap sheets. Definatly won't be buying any more of these, but this is my first high thread-count sheet set, so I'll hold off my judgement on so called high-quality sheets until I get a more expensive (maybe a higher thread count as well) set.The size of the sheets is perfect, this is the only reason I gave it two stars instead of one. The fitted bottom sheet fits my thick (14\\") mattress with room to spare, and the non-fitted sheet is extra long and much wider than I'm used to. There's over two feet of extra sheet on the foot of the bed and plenty of tuck-in length on the sides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Color is fading","review":"Unlike some other reviews, I do think these sheets are soft and comfortable - agree about the wrinkles, though. My problem is that after the first washing with Tide with Downey, there were faded spots on one of the pillowcases -smokey blue turned to a peachy off-white. After the second washing with the same detergent, I saw the same fading on the top sheet near the hem. Anyone else have this problem? How do we let Amazon know? I don't see a customer service button and I don't want to return them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these sheets!","review":"These are soft AND silky, very comfortable. The sheets are not real thick so they are great for warmer weather. They fit the bed very nicely and there is enough to tuck in on all three sides. Will buy more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising","review":"I just got the sheets and I am not happy. These sheets are certainly not sateen and don't even feel like 200 thread count Egyptian cotton. They are rough and scratchy. I like a soft sheet and really was looking for sateen. It's hard to find quality sheets these days and I thought these were a bit pricey, but it would be worth it. Do not believe all those positive reviews. If you have ever slept on 300+ thread count Egyptian cotton sateen sheets before you will be seriously disappointed when these arrive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luxurious","review":"High Quality product luxurious look and feel...very fast shipping, can't wait to wash and make the bed so I could fully enjoy this bedding!

These are by far the best sheets I have ever owned. I have cheaper sheets on the master bed and find myself sleeping in the guest bedroom because of these sheets.

They are also cool and satiny to the touch, wonderful for summer. HOWEVER, when I washed them the first time using warm water, and low dryer setting they wrinkled unbelievably. And they don't lose the wrinkles when you put them on the bed. The pillowcases are a disaster. I am very disappointed in both of my Pinzon purchases.

These are the worst sheet I have ever bought. They are stiff and scratchy and no matter how much fabric softener I used it never helped. They also do not breathe & the top sheet for the king size was way too long and almost touched the floor at the bottom of the bed, like it was for a cali king. I had to go out and buy another set, which was cheaper and much better. I wish I would have returned these, but too late now. Never buying bedding online again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great","review":"These sheets are pretty and the price is certainly right but they are not nearly as soft and smooth as other (likely more expensive) alternatives. They have softened up some from when I first opened them but they do not have the silky feel that I usually associate with high thread count sateen sheets. Nonetheless, I am pleased with them and might even get another set."},{"rating":"1","title":"like sandpaper","review":"I bought these sheets a few years ago and loved them--softest, best quality sheets ever for the price. So when my bottom sheet wore out decided to buy the same sheets--sadly as many reviewers have noted they are NOT soft. They felt smooth when I took them out of the package but they actually got rougher after washing instead of softer! They had a terrible chemical smell --so I washed them several times before even trying them--added Bac-out odor remover, and vinegar to the rinse, and natural fabric softener. Tried them last night and felt like I was on sandpaper!There is no way these could be the same fabric as before. The good reviews must all be from before they changed(in fact I think I may have given them a good review a few years ago!) I am going to return them--I might try a few more washes but with the 30 day return limit figure I better just do it now. Anyone have trouble with returning them after being washed?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not soft at all","review":"Bought these sheets thinking they would be a good alternative to the 500ct I already have)(Organic Egyptian Cotton Sateen Queen Bed Sheet Set , 500 Thread in Sage). Looking through reviews they seemed ok. So when I got them, they were a bit stiff so I thought I would wash them and get them a little softer. Nope. Did not work at all. They are still stiff and not soft at all. Not sure if they are really 400ct and egyptian cotton. I would stay away from these if you want nice sheets.One thing that might differ is the color - one color might be different than the other. I had the smokey blue one, so that might be a one off chance that this color is the bad, unsoft ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"These sheets don't last","review":"I bought thee sheets for my son to go to college with last august 2009. He had several sets of sheets with him so these were not the only ones he used there. At first they worked great - they have elastic all the way around on the bottom fitted sheet - so they stayed on the slippery plastic coated mattress pretty well. Then the elastic gave out half way through the school year so they became unusable. I called Amazon who distributes Pinzon and they said that they only have a 30 day guarantee. Since it took longer than 30 days - around 90 - to wear out the elastic, they will not consider returning or replacing them. These will be the last linens I purchase from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"So uncomfortable!","review":"I was really excited about these, but was disappointed to find that they are like sleeping on sandpaper. The color and bed fit was fine, but the material is terrible. I have washed them multiple times, and tried fabric softener. Maybe there is something I am missing... maybe they get softer over time, but so far they are horrible. I had trouble sleeping on them because they are so uncomfortable' It's completely ridiculous. I read recently that thread count does not really determine quality of sheets despite common beliefs, and that companies can claim a higher thread count, by counting threads between the threads and there is no real regulation for it. These sheets seem to prove that discrepancy, and have been cast away to the basement."},{"rating":"1","title":"these sheets are NOT soft","review":"I washed them before putting them on my bed, and they are still so scratchy I'm taking them off this morning and putting an old set of sheets on. Very disappointing. I'd return them if I could...don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"They pilled/balled up within a month...","review":"After reading review after review, I selected these sheets as the best bang for my buck. These sheets have great reviews, but I wish I had noticed that the most popular reviews were written six years ago! Maybe they were better back then. The first few weeks we just loved the sheets; they are very soft and at the same time feel sturdy. We did not experience the problems with them being scratchy that others have had. Unfortunately, after the first washing the sheets started to pill/ball up. It got worse and worse, and within a month, we could no longer use them because they were a sea of little balls. I expected more from the Amazon/Pinzon brand and am really disappointed. It's obvious that there is very little consistency in the quality of these sheets. Save your money and go with something else! Amazon, please note that this product needs to be improved!"},{"rating":"1","title":"burlap","review":"sleeping on these sheets are awful..used a ton of fabric softener and they feel like burlap...itchy scratchy...thought they were a high thread count and egyption cotton....more like leaves than cotton...wish i could return them...so very disappointed...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratchy not soft","review":"I purchased the sheets based on the reviews of others. Mine must have been duds. They are stiff and scratchy even after repeated washings and the color faded unevenly for no apparent reason. Total ripoff."},{"rating":"1","title":"bleached splotches galore. loses color upon 1 wash.","review":"I bought these sheet set in eggshell and just popped it into the washing machine upon receiving it. I followed the instruction and used cold water and used my meyers all natural detergent. After 1 wash, I see bleached spots on both the fitted and flat sheets. and by bleached spots, i mean HUGE splotches of white against the eggshell color. This certainly did not happen with the other stuff in the same wash cycle. I generally do not complain about stuff I order via amazon because I'm usually shopping for a deal, but seriously, this is pretty ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sheets, even better for the price","review":"They look good, I didn't have any of the wrinkling problems others mentioned, I would buy them again. Very soft and breathable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not soft!","review":"I've tried everything to soften these up. Baking soda, vinegar, hot water soaks, enzymes. Nothing works. They wrinkle terribly and will never be soft. If you want crisp wrinkly sheets, you will love them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheets are softer after treating","review":"After buying these sheets, I had to treat it with soaking in fabric softener and then washing a few times to get it to become soft. It's still a little bit rough in the beginning, but after use, it gets better. The sheets are quite sturdy and I have not seen any pilling or other defects after many months of use.The fitted sheet also goes very deep, so there are no problems covering a really thick mattress, such as my double-sided pillow top mattress.The only downside is the sheets are quite rough to begin with, and it is quite a hassle to make them softer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Love the color and love the texture. It's so soft and silky feeling! When I washed it the sheets only got softer :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chemical Smell","review":"No stars for this product. They had an awful chemical smell when we took them out of the package. We washed these sheets 4 times with everything we could think of, and the smell did not wash out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price!","review":"If they weren't so wrinkly, I'd give them 5 stars without hesitation. HOWEVER,it's polyester that makes sheets come out of the dryer wrinkle-free, and polyestermakes you sweat at night--so it's a trade off. Cotton breathes!These sheets are heavy, like a good set of hotel sheets. They aren't terribly silky, but the weight makes themfeel nice and more expensive than they really are. After many washes, they still haven't pilled or lost their shape.I would definitely buy these again and would recommend to a friend. My sister has similarsheets from Pottery Barn, and hers were triple the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality material but not soft","review":"I ordered this product expecting to receive soft, luxurious sheets. The sheets that came are rough and scratchy. I washed them 5-6 times with minimal improvement. I tried everything from soaking to using white vinegar.A positive is that the sheets are durable and seem to be made with quality fabric. The negative is that they are not soft as stated in the product description.Continuous washing of the sheets will probably soften them up over time, but I'd rather not have to run my sheets through the wash 40 times to get my desired softness.I will be returning the sheets.EDIT: Amazon processed my refund for the full amount on the same day I dropped the package off at UPS! 2 stars for the sheets but 5 stars for Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Elastic on fitted sheet completely gone after 8 months","review":"We have had these sheets for 8 months, they are cozy enough, not thin at all. About a month ago noticed the fitted sheet kept coming loose and I was 're-making' the bed everyday. Today I noticed the elastic is completely gone from the fitted sheet. I suppose I could sew elastic in the corners, but I've never had to do this with any other sheets. It feels as though there's something under the hem all the way around, could be the elastic snapped somewhere, but I don't recall it having elastic anywhere but in the corners. Perhaps it's just a fluke with this set. On the plus side, the shipping was as promised... you know, you order it, go out to your mailbox and it's there. Awesome how quickly the Prime (2day) works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shrunk dramatically after first wash","review":"I was pleased with the look and feel of these sheets until after the first wash. They shrunk so much that they no longer fit our queen-size bed. Obviously, these sheets did not meet my expectations and I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Wrinkle Free","review":"I was looking for sheets to replace a set that always had wrinkles. Was hoping this set would do it; but, alas, these weren't the answer. After washing and drying (on a wrinkle free dryer setting) twice, these have the same wadded up look as the others. I thought I did enough research on material quality and thread count to find a good quality sheet, but I guess I need to know more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"The sheets were definitely worth the price, which is much cheaper than all the physical stores I visited, but they weren't as soft as I expected. Perhaps they will get softer with washes, as some have suggested. Also, I am used to combed cotton, which has a much different feel.One thing I liked that I didn't know from the description is that they were taller than my other sheet sets - meaning they fit around my mattress and the foam pads easily, so the fitted sheet doesn't pop off the corners of my mattress when I move around in my sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chemical smell wouldn't wash out!","review":"I was hugely disappointed in these sheets. The minute I opened them I was assaulted by a very strong chemical smell. Pesticide? Manufacturing chemical? I washed the sheets twice in warm water and gave them an extra rinse. The smell was still there! Needless to say, I returned them. Please, Amazon, check the quality of the products before you mail them. I am wondering what country these sheets were manufactured in, that they had such an unpleasant odor."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST CD YOU CAN BUY FOR UNDER A DOLLAR !","review":"I CAME ACROSS THIS CD WHEN I WAS LOOKING FOR A BARGIN AT A USED CD STORE....I DID NOT KNOW HOW MUCH OF A BARGIN IT WAS UNTIL I FOUND MYSELF PLAYING IT ABOUT 10 TIMES...I HAD JUST GOT NEW SPEAKERS IN MY CAR AND WANTED A GOOD CD TO TEST THEM OUT ON...THIS WAS IT.

When I first heard the album I thought I was listening to the same song over and over again, because the songs all sound the same. The only song I like on the album is \\"Leather\\". I can really relate to that ONLY song. The others are like childs play, they may be about reality, but not every day life. I like albums that have experiences of every day life. This album is for the younger age, such as 12-15. YES...the lyrics are somewhat mature, but the album to me I would advise for a younger audience. I have seen them perform at local clubs, and their on-stage performances ROCK! I think they are hitting it big, but yes the album sucks.

It was only after I used the great system for identifying the right spa for me, that I realized how badly outdated this book is. At least three of the recommended spas are nowhere to be found, apparetnly out of business. And of course the pricing and program information is way, way out of date.Some prices are now double those in the book and I found four spas who have radically revised their programs. To top it all off, the cover touts \\"Thousands of dollars in free coupons for your next spa visit!\\" The \\"coupons\\" look really questionable, and you'd have to spend many thousands at many different resorts in at least six different states to use them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ironic Humor, Exquisite Details","review":"This collection of short stories, translated from French, brims with abrupt scenes, cliffhanger endings that are often ambiguous, shifting points of view, and close-up dialogues between well developed characters. Gavalda's stories ring with understated humor, humor often developed through very small details: the line of pork products sold by a doomed narrator, the precision of a country veterinarian living an ordinary life, descriptions of lingerie, particular items of furniture acquired in elaborate anticipation of becoming a couple.Like an assortment of rich, hand-made chocolates: you don't want to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"great title...","review":"I wish the book lived up to the great title, don't know what I was seduced by when I bought this one, but it is a general waste of time.Shallow, quick, cool, emotionless, not what I expected from the reviews, alas.Sorry I bought it, there are so many books, so little time, and this one you can pass on despite the hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liquid Inspiration","review":"I was in need of a book and I didn't know where to begin...so I began shopping for titles. This captivates you right off. The novel is simply a defining moment in writing. I think it is one of the best pieces of literature I have ever read, in that it stays with you. Another unique ability this author has is she masters the ability to change \\"voice\\" of her characters from story to story. I have lent this book out numerous times and never without fail- everyone adores it. I would say the only possiblity that you might not be captivated by it is if you don't take the time to let it dissolve in your mind. Truly a fine fine book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wait no longer...","review":"I picked this one up because I had heard some good things and love Dorothy Parker. As a whole, I loved the collection. Gavalda is equally comfortable describing the intricacies of a Parisian date as she is writing (with chilling frankness) about a terrifying episode in \\"Catgut.\\" An excellent French writer whose voice is preserved in the translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Original Writing Style","review":"I really liked this book immensely. Anna Gavalda writes the way people speak, which makes the stories almost feel like you are sitting down and chatting with her. She is witty and audacious at times, which also adds to the charm. What I also liked was that she has some descriptions, such as when she is waiting for her date and goes into a bistro, and she makes you feel like you are in the bistro with her sipping rose and eating good hearty Parisian food. I think this book was just delightful and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of its kind","review":"This is simply the best and most entertaining historical study that I've ever had the pleasure of reading. It literally made me laugh out loud as well as tear up several times. I can't say enough wonderful things about this book. It reads like a very well written novel whose topic is endlessly fascinating. I've given it as a present several times since I first read it about 10 or 11 years ago and the recipients have all been as thrilled with it as I've been."},{"rating":"1","title":"very dated","review":"I looked forward to this book and after a long delay it came. I was very disappointed from the description I thought it was a new release. I was an old library book from the 80's that was discarded. Yes it has ancient history but really is outdated. I lived in Galveston for 15 years and just moved and it is way out of date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictively funkaholic","review":"Great, refreshing and original funky metal.The basslines are incredibly groovy and the hole sound is tight.

It wasn't until I saw them on TV and learned that they not only sing but play a variety of instruments and are Family! I bought the CD only knowing one song and soon was loving all of them. Would love to see The Corrs do an instrumental album...especially after hearing Rebel Heart. This group is great. I cannot wait to collect more of their music."},{"rating":"2","title":"um, cost effective?","review":"how can anyone dispute the amount of musical bang you get for around 3 bucks including shipping with this cd? I think that Radio and One Night are fine tunes. This cd is one very cost effective collection of music, so don't hesitate to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice pop music, nice sound","review":"I knew nothing about the Corrs when I bought this (it's for testing DVD-Audio). The tunes are very pleasant and there's a nice variety. The recording uses 5.1 but not ridiculously. If you're a Corrs fan you'll love this new mix; if you're not it's still a good demo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great band when all together.","review":"Have not heard them separate, know one of them is on tour now by herself, but as a group? Perfect.watch them on youtube, do some great covers as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"My introduction to the Corrs was a live show with Bono which I enjoyed. I happened on this CD and took a chance. I think I must have seen a different band. I guess that despite their known dislike of Americans, they decided to go top 40 to cash in. If not for the pauses on the CD, you might have a problem distinguishing one song from the other. Nothing clever, interesting, original, or worthwhile. Truly a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"You know what this will sound like already.","review":"As you know exactly how predictable this album will be I don't think I need to say much more about the music. The Corrs are about as entertaining as Chris De Burgh without his unintentional humour. The only thing that is remotely interesting about them is the fact that they are inexplicably very popular in high street fashion retailers like Top Shop and H & M. I have pondered upon why this should be so for some time, but I think it's probably because they motivate people to buy pants."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hypnotic blend of voices and melody","review":"The Corrs seem to be veering a bit toward the middle of the road with this, their third studio CD, but that's not a problem for me. I wasn't overly familiar with their music until I heard \\"Breathless,\\" which caught my attention immediately. The amazingly catchy melody and vocal harmonies stick in your brain after one listen. Nothing else on the CD is quite as upbeat as this first single, but that isn't necessarily a liability, as \\"Breathless\\" seems a bit like an anomoly in their catalog. The rest of the album is more subdued and thoughtful, with the melodies being a bit more subtle and haunting. Entertainment Weekly's reviewer condemned the CD, saying it sounded like \\"Wilson O'Phillips\\", but I'm not necessarily sure that's a bad thing. Cool it may not be, but if you're a fan of melodic pop with lots of harmonies, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of Corr-isma!","review":"We've already been to two wedding where \\"All the Love in the World\\" has been used as the newlywed couple's first-dance song. That is a true testament to the emotional power of this album. It has replaced old standards like Celine Dion and Whitney Houston, and in my book it is quite the righteous choice.The rest of the album lives up to that initial promise. My favorite tracks (like \\"One Night\\", \\"No More Cry\\", and \\"Rain\\") easily mix sentiment with beautiful melody, brought home ably by Andrea Corr - a woman whose physical beauty is only exceeded by the beauty of her voice. She is a pop star of the highest order, reminding me of the emotional connections I made to such prior songbirds as Dolores O'Riordan (The Cranberries) and Sinead O'Connor.Buy the album, put it on the stereo, and relax to the mellow, romantic sounds with someone you love. Trust me, it's great for those moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"It left me BREATHLESS","review":"Be a few months ago, I become excited about The Corrs releasing their new album In Blue. I popped it into my cd player, and gave it a good listen. I feel in love with it, and it remained in my cd player until yesterday, when I gave a listen to In Blue with true 24-bit 5.1 Surround Sound DVD Audio. I am telling you, the clarity is amazing, and it felt as though I had been listening to The Corrs live. I closed my eyes and pictured Andrea Corr standing up in front of me... it really did leave me breathless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I first heard the Corrs on their MTV Unplugged Special and was amazed at the tight harmonies and wonderful sound. When the new album was released I had great expectations, but what a dissapointment. It is so overproduced and has such a \\"Euro pop\\" sound that the uniqueness of the group is lost. I don't think the push towards this sound is going to bring much success.If you want to hear the Corrs, buy the Unplugged Album"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the Corrs?","review":"I have been a fan of the Corrs for roughly 3 years now. And this album is not Corresque at all. It is standard teenybopper trash in my opinion, with the exception of All in a Day and Rebel Heart. If you like standard american pop, buy it, you'll like it. But if you are looking for something remotely Irish like the Corrs used to be, buy The Corrs Unplugged, or Forgiven not Forgotten, or any of their previous albums. But since I know the Corrs are in this to make money, I'll give them credit with 2 stars as opposed to 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicting!","review":"This one is better than the first. You can't stop listening once you start. Beautiful vocals and great beats is all you need in a great CD. I would highly recommend this one in your shopping cart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where have they been?","review":"I saw the CD in a store and thought, \\"another new group.\\" Then one evening I surfed onto a site that had several Corrs tracks. After listening to them, I went back to the store and purchased the CD. I was surprised to learn that they've been around awhile. I will purchase other CD's. I hope they catch on in the USA. I don't think they can miss!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Band","review":"I'm not a big fan of this type of sound, but after hearing about them for a year and finally seeing them perform live on Leno, I was instantly a fan. Great band, great talent, great everything.Definitely a GREAT CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite all-time albums","review":"This album is one of the most pop-ish sounding offerings from the Corrs. It is danceable and catchy (Breathless, Irresistible, Radio, Rebel Heart) and contemplative (Give Me a Reason, One Night, Hurt Before). When I listen to music I mainly want to be feeling good. The slower and more melancholic tunes are needed to balance out the effect, so to speak. This album does all that I want perfectly.There are some more memorable Corrs songs on other albums, but this one has the most danceable songs. Sometimes I need to bop my shoulders a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much potential, but too much gloss","review":"Okay, I'm going to offend the legion of Corrs fans around the globe, but I really wanted to enjoy this release. Really. But the glossy, over-produced material (especially the Mutt Lange tracks that sound like Shania throw-aways)fails to let these gorgeous ladies and their equally gorgeous voices come through. For a band that sounds great in a live setting, their studio work leaves much to be desired. I had also hope for more Celtic-influenced tracks, but most of these make me recall the slick, soulless drivel that was once Wilson Phillips. While there will be hits off of \\"In Blue\\", it's not a CD that's going to leave a lasting impression."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Corrs have sold out and lost their uniqueness","review":"When I first heard the Corrs \\"Forgiven not Forgotten\\" (first album), I fell in love. Their unique blend of pop with traditional Irish elements was marvelous. The second album \\"Talk on Corners\\" was definitely good, but it had lost some of that Irish flavour. I was mildly disappointed. I actually skip over a couple songs on that cd. When I heard \\"Breathless\\" on the radio, I literally felt ill! It is the worst of 80's pop all over again! (And that was never good to begin with!) There was nothing unique or special about it. In short, The Corrs, capitalising on their amazing physical beauty and musical talent, have SOLD OUT. :*( Very sad, imho."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nauseatingly syrupy.","review":"The \\"filler\\" songs on this CD are some of the worst I've ever heard. The lyrics sound like they were written by sixth-graders and the music has no character. I thought I was getting something similar to the unique, gritty sound of The Cranberries, but alas, this is closer to Hilary Duff. Aside from \\"Rebel Heart\\" (which is one of my favorite songs ever), I can hardly tell they have any Celtic connection at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Average at Best","review":"The Corrs are good at what they do..Trad-orientated pop, but on this album, I feel that they have lost their way a little. Always difficult to follow a 'Talk On Corners', but this album is just average,at best. There are some nice tracks here like 'All the Love in the World', 'Radio' and 'Breathless' but apart from these, nothing else really rises to the challenge. Lyrical content is amatuerish with this collection and it sounds like an album that was not as lovingly nourished as the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I chose to review this version, 'cause \\"Judy\\" is probably the best track included to this cd. Others I like are \\"Rebel Heart\\", \\"Hurt Before\\" and \\"All In A Day\\". Okay...it's a good pop album, only a \\"little\\" over-produced, and it does have some good songs. I don't wanna start about \\"Give It All Up\\" (Corrs fans know what I'm talking about), then the new versions of \\"Radio\\" and \\"At Your Side\\" are less good than on \\"Unplugged\\". Another good track is \\"Say\\", a nice piece of work that really has a great intro AND outro. I'm sure a lot of people will like this one, but if you've heard \\"Forgiven, Not Forgotten\\" and \\"Talk On Corners\\", then you'll (probably) agree with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Awsome!","review":"So far, the best CD they have made! I was impressed with thier other CDs, but this tops them. BRAVO!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The US will discover what the rest of the world knows!","review":"I had the opportunity to live in Europe throughout 1999. During that time I discovered the Corrs' music. It amazed me that their music had not received airplay in the U.S.With \\"Forgiven, Not Forgotten\\" and \\"Talk on Corners\\", The Corrs delivered a nice blend of Celtic and Popular mucic. \\"In Blue\\" is a wonderful evolution of The Corrs music. It continues their unique blend of Celtic sound and Popular Rock, with an edgier sound that will please the American ear.I highly recommend this and other Corrs' selections to readers!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Phoned it in.","review":"I caught the Coors on a televised concert performance. The music seeemed refreshing, interesting, and pleasant. So I tried the \\"Forgiven Not Forgotten\\" album. I liked it. The only weak point for me was the fact that so much of the songs involved repeating the same lyrics over and over. By itself a small point and on the strength of the album I bought the next, \\"In Blue.\\"\\"In Blue\\" takes this repition to new heights of monotony with any redeeming features. It's like disco without the thumpa thumpa dance beat. There is nothing new or fresh about the music, lyrics or performances. It's as if this album is made up of the \\"B\\" sides of the songs on the prior album. Nothing inventive musically is going on. Nothing clever in the lyrics, lyrics, lyrics, and nothing original in the performances. Whatever \\"magic\\" they had before seems to be gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mutt purged the Irish from the Corrs","review":"As a follow to their wonderful first two records, this is a big disappointment. The distinctive blend of Celtic traditional music and catchy pop is gone. I hope they go back to their roots the next time around."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Corrs \\"in blue\\"","review":"After listening to this CD for the first time, I found that I enjoyed the music on this CD. The music is upbeat and the Corrs have wonderful harmonizing in the songs. I also have \\"Talk On Corners\\" and as other reviewers have said, the Irish flavor is missing on most of the songs on \\"In Blue\\", but I still enjoyed the music on this CD. \\"Breathless\\" is a great upbeat tune, and other favs on this CD are... \\"Say\\", \\"All The Love In The World\\", \\"Radio\\", \\"No More Cry\\", and \\"Give It All Up\\",(This one reminds me of Paul Simon's \\"You Can Call Me Al\\"). If you buy music for the pure enjoyment of it, I recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with the Older Stuff","review":"I was first drawn to the Corrs because of their unique ability to blend conteporary pop with traditional Irish sounds. Their CD, \\"Forgiven, not Forgotten\\" is beautiful. \\"Talk on Corners\\" was good as well. However, I was disappointed with \\"In Blue\\". \\"Breathless\\" is a great song no doubt. And the rest of the CD is enjoyable, but it's just not The Corrs to me. They're trying to be too American and I don't like it. I was always amazed at how they could entertain Americans while holding on to their Irishness. They made beautiful music. \\"In Blue\\" is just an attempt at being The Backstreet Boys. If you have been a long-time fan of The Corrs and are planning to purchase \\"In Blue\\", be prepared to be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Left Me Breathless!","review":"In Blue really left me breathless. The songs i really liked of the albums are Breathless, Give Me a Reason, Somebody For Someone, All The Love In The World, Radio, One Night, Irresistable,At Your Side and Rabel Heart. The rest are quite ok too. They really did a great attept to 'conquer the states'. Until now, I still love the album. A really must must must have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"In Blue? I'm blue.","review":"After seeing the band on SNL, I was hooked. I love their earlier work, and bought In Blue the first time I saw it on the shelves. Both my wife and I really wanted to like this album, but what a disappointment. Sadly, the captivating modern/celtic fusion and great musicanship of the earlier albums is gone. Instead, it's an overproduced, whitebread, Brittney/Christina/Shania-wannabe clone. I can't say I blame them for going after commercial success - the 12-16 yr old female market is a powerful demographic. But I won't be buying any more of their albums. I couldn't even give this away to my 23-yr old daughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope its not all downhill from here","review":"I love the Corrs not just for the sisters beauty but their music. I remember a time when I heard Irish Celtic music coming from them, but not here. This has been popped up production wise. The unplugged verisons of these songs are amazing. I recommend getting their actual Unplugged cd, but this is [bad]. I like a few songs, but I feel embarrased listening to this cd which isn't a good sign."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irish folk sound is lost!","review":"There is no culture in this album. I got it with hopes that it would be catchy yet orchestrated with strings like their previous album \\"Forgiven Not Forgotten\\" but no, I take a listen for the first time, and I find almost no strings. The fiddle or violin solos that I loved so much in FNF are nonexistant and the lovely irish drum is barely used. The drums sound more like a drum machine than anything else, yet I believe it is a drumset. If you're looking for songs like \\"Closer,\\" this album is not for you, because the Corrs turned over their talent to someone else and fell to the radio desires of the masses. In conclusion, I was highly disappointed and have lost respect for the beloved group of talented siblings we all call \\"The Corrs.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed with corrs","review":"I have the corrs other two ablbums Forgiven and Talk on corners and felt they were better than this one. I liked the mix of irish melodies and vocals on those two albums. On this album they seem to stray away from this formula. The only songs I liked on this album were breathless and rebel heart. They had the flavor of their other two albums but the other songs didn't quite catch that. I am sure they wanted to expand their music but I hope they go back to what Forgiven and Talk on corners had. I listen to them all the time. Here is for hoping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Forgiven not Forgotten was a truly amazing cd that had a really unique sound. The music was beautiful.This latest CD (In Blue) was a huge let down. Every song sounded the same except for Breathless...I couldn't believe the band would allow this cd to be released after the oustanding job they have done on the first album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Music!","review":"When I first heard the name \\"The Corrs\\", I thought, 'I'm not gonna like this' so I didn't even listen to it at all. Months went by before I heard a song on the radio that I though was pretty good. Turns out it was \\"Breathless\\", track 1 on this CD. Ever since then I have been converted. I love the music on this CD, especially the final song, \\"Rebel Heart\\", which has a nice Irish base to it. Highly recommend the album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff!!","review":"The Corrs are back, and here to stay!! I love their last album Talk on Corners and i must admit this will never quite live up to it, but it sure is good. My favourite songs are Rebel Heart, Hurt before, no more cry and somebody for someone. I ended up liking all the songs, even the ever so slightly cheesy Give it all up. Definetly recommended if you have heard any of the singles on the radio which took your fancy...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good album","review":"I am an everyday teenage guy. I listen to my fair share of rap and pop, and I dont usually like this kind of music. But as soon as I heard the first 5 or 6 songs of \\"In Blue,\\" I knew I had to have it! It has fast and slow songs, and are not all about love. I strongly recommend this cd, especially the songs \\"Breathless\\" and \\"all the love in the world.\\" Check it out, I am sure you wont be dissapointed. I took a risk in buying this album, and it paid off. I think you should too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely stunning!","review":"Although a fan of the Corrs from back in the Forgiven, Not Forgotten era might think In Blue is a load of rubbish, I must disagree! Being a fairly new fan at only two years, I find In Blue to be a great CD... It's fun to listen to with upbeat songs, but can also be very meloncholy at times. I would suggest this CD to anyone who likes music that makes you think and feel."},{"rating":"2","title":"In synch with In Blue","review":"I have a slightly different version than this, but it is the same songs. I fell in love with The Corrs with Talk on Corners, and admittedly, they stray a bit away from their Irish lyrics toward more mainstream pop culture. That definately doesn't take away from their performance on this cd though. Every single song from Breathless, (It certainly left me that, and the music video...WOW) to Give me a reason, and Radio (which is one of my favourites) I like the Spice Girls too, but I were to compare the Spice Girls vocals to the Corrs? Corrs, 10 times better hands down, even though I like both groups. Now, if you wanted a cd that introduces you to the Corrs, this is the one. It's like nothing you've ever heard before, and you'll fall in love with them. I guarantee it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new discovery............","review":"I just got this album today and I have to admit I purchased it because the song \\"Breathless\\" is on it. After listening to the whole cd I was impressed by this group who hails from Ireland. The violin, tin whistle, and guitar really complement their voices. This album has an enjoyable mix of fast as well as slow songs. My favorite tracks are of course Breathless, Give Me A Reason, Say, Irrestible, At Your Side, and Hurt Before. Though I have nothing to compare this album to, I still think anyone who enjoys pop music will like their music. The Corrs are great to listen to if you just want to unwind after a hard day. Get yourself a copy and you won't be disappointed. I sure wasn't!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Four great romance movies on one DVD","review":"I enjoy watching Harlequin romance movies because they are PG rated and don't have \\"hard core\\" sex scenes or profanity.

I have been gaga over her since \\"Yahaan\\", which was another great movie.It is always a treat to watch such movies out of all the junk that bollywood throws out. I agree that the starting of the movie could have done without the Bar song, but by the time the movie ends, you're left wondering.

Good vocals from Junior Marvin, strong backing from the band, and some catchy tunes.I had a chance to see the Wailers live in 2004 in Atlantic City. That band bears very little resemblance to this band. The 1994 band was doing original material exclusively on this CD. The 2004 band was strictly doing covers of Bob Marley's more popular songs.

For someone viewing this for the first time, as I was, it made it really disjointed and you didn't get a sense of continuity or getting to know the characters as you would if you watched a series in its entireity and in order. I get very cynical with 'best of' box sets as this would seemingly appear to be designed to be ( although I have heard that there were much better episodes not included - 'Blind is the Killer' for one) particullary if there is an intention at a later date to release the show in its entireity. I think if you are going to release a one season show like this, its not helpful to just release a few episodes - I really think it should be all or nothing.

This one got good reviews, and I see why. The stories are good, the acting is fine, sound and visuals are good - and neither of us remembers seeing this series, so it's all new to us. It's unusual for the Western hero to be the mayor, but here, he's not riding over the horizon chasing down bad guys, he's dealing with them in town. I rated it 4 instead of 5 only because it's not cool to describe everything as a gift from God; it's a very good show. ALSO - Wagon Train frequently has soapy episodes.

The premise that the heart is \\"a\\" or \\"the\\" center of human intelligence is interesting to consider, but the fact that the author emphasizes that all ideas are copyrighted to his company over and over leads one to wonder how much of the research results could be replicated.

A great deal of the research cited was generated \\"in-house\\" and provides the bulk of the scientific \\"validation\\" for the highly trade-marked and copyrighted procedures presented. Additionally, as a reader,I was very disappointed at the overt marketing content which seems to reduce the perceived value of this potentially important area of study. The HeartMath Solution falls short on hard science and, because of its self-referential style, is reduced to a very long brochure for the HeartMath Institute's follow-on commercial programs.

It's just OK, not great. The song selection seems to be lacking. There's not a whole lot of standouts there, unlike 2005's version which I enjoyed a lot. A lot of the songs start sounding too much alike and the vocalists all start sounding like the same person after awhile.That said, it's nice that you get over 2 hours of music for a reasonable price. It's just sometimes I wonder if there's enough material to really fill up two entire discs, or if they'd have been better off pulling the 12 best songs and putting it onto one disc.Normally the Ministry of Sound name would guarantee a good CD, but this one is just lacking that special something.

If you don't go to clubs, never heard of any DJ on the thedjlist [website] top 100 list, or like songs mixed from '80s tunes? Well, you might be ignorant enough of good trance to actually like this.

There is some discussion of the Star Wars myth-making, but it is intermittent and not very sustained. One of the chief advantages of this book is that it highlights some of Campbell's insights on myth and religion, and its primary disadvantage is that the dialog format (which makes it accessible) also lends itself to meandering digression.

This book was as boring and tedious to read as anything I've ever read. I found myself reading and re-reading the same sentences trying to figure out what in the world he was trying to convey. Perhaps the myths that ancients have come up with were because they didn't have any understanding of what was happening and they were trying to describe their experience with the language and perspective they had. They also thought the world was flat and that they could fall off if they went too far. Today we find an arrowhead in the sand and decide it has magical powers and want to create a religion around it.

People like him used to tell stories around fires to tribes, and now through the miracle of modern technology you can hear him weave his web of stories ranging from myths, legends, philosophies, and art in your own car. The only down side of this is that you must endure Bill Moyers' (the host of the recorded program) idiocies throughout. It's not that Bill Moyers is stupid, he just asks the wrong questions, and, on occasion, you can actually hear Campbell subtly mocking Moyers or growing frustrated with his lack of understanding. Aside from that, a great buy for all philosophy, history, myth, and fantasy lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"E pluribus, unum","review":"Campbell's \\"The Power of Myth\\" is a series of transcriptions of his conversations with Bill Moyers of PBS.

Weaving threads through such arcane and seeming unrelated topics such as Native American, Egyptian, Hindu, and Greek mythology, James Joyce, medieval romance, Star Wars, and the back side of a one-dollar bill, Cambell displays an intense passion for distilling away the metaphors that differentiate the multitude of myths, and finding the few gems that lie at the heart of them all.

Was I ever in for a treat. After reading the book and watching Campbell & Moyer in the videos, I was completely mesmerized by Campbell. I then took time to read \\"A Fire in the Mind\\", a book which covers the life of Campbell and written by Stephen & Robin Larsen.

This is a brilliant opening to the book. It gets one excited because they are going to learn techniques to be able to do this too! But it never happens. I'm a salesman and I thought this was going to be the answer to my prayers. It wasn't. I can honestly say, there is not one useful piece of information in this book with the exception of the links he provides for voice coaching and image consultants.

Instead, Lakhani takes a unique perspective and teaches us how to become experts, how to tell persuasive stories, how to arouse curiosity, and how to position ourselves and negotiate to win. His section on story-telling alone made me rethink how I speak to others and how people are truly persuaded.

Her extensive vocabulary enhances the tales of her journey, but the focus of the book is on the sketches rather than the actual travel adventures. For example, only one page of text describes her ten stormy days on Harris. The reader is traveling with an artist, so we read less about tourist destinations and more about the weather, the scenery, and the treck to get to the next hilltop - in order to sketch, of course. Whatever detail the descriptions of the journey are lacking are more than recovered in the sketches. Most are in black and white, with the occasional breathtaking color scene. This is a beautiful book, but it shouldn't be mistaken for a planning guide, or even a travel log. Instead it is a restful read, a pleasant escape into island scenery."},{"rating":"2","title":"For All Suzuki Students, Parents and Teachers","review":"This is a lovely book for all students and teachers who study music under Suzuki Methods, and family who supports them."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same","review":"I've been living in the Long Island area for years and it's painfully obvious that Little Buster is an artist with very little to say.

After all, he's 64 years old, with a bad heart. Mr. Nichols is very penetrating in his analysis/biography of Cheney. We may be currently living in a plutocracy, but some elements of democracy remain untouched.Reading this book explains much about the actions of Shrub, including the famous debate where he interrupted himself to answer somebody(?) And where were the President and Vice President on the morning of September 11? I'm pleased that Mr. Nichols wrote this book, but sad that our President is almost in an exile of his own making.Why are the wrong people reading this book?

Even if someone else has recorded a song, Johnny always sings it his way. The orchestration and arrangements of each song are perfect and unique. Johnny creates a mood of intimacy and sensuality as if he is just singing to you alone. I have always heard the song, How Do You Keep The Music Playing, with an orchestra accompaniment.

This is music that's guaranteed to set the mood and tone for a romantic candlelight dinner or just for reminiscing and remembering an old love from days gone by, Timeless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of limited value, even on your first move","review":"The sole market segment this book MAY assist are people who have never moved. The points made are so obvious that it could have been written by your next door neighbor, not an \\"insider.\\" The only \\"insider\\" aspect to this paperweight is that someone on the inside saw a market opportunity to cash in on a segment of the moving population with a catchy title and nice cover graphics. The \\"ABCs\\" of relocating, as PART I is described, offers about a couple of paragraphs on MAJOR topics ranging from \\"Negotiating a Profitable Home Sale\\" to \\"Insurance, Finance and Estate Guidelines\\".....hardly subjects that can even be skimmed in a few paragraphs. Not that I would expect a treatis, but to suggest in the index that such subjects are addressed, is nearly misreprestation. In sum, if you read the index, you have read the book, because the information which follows, to be generous, touches on each subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do people like this show?","review":"Maybe it is just me, but i don't understand why people like this show. Well, maybe not the show itself, but at least the music. I like three songs on this CD, QUEENIE WAS A BLONDE, UPTOWN, and WOULDN'T IT BE NICE. The first song is good and it goes downhill until track 10, where it is deicent again, and then it plummets back downhill. I don't like the Queenie, the Burrs is pretty good, but they can't compare with the ones from Lippa's WILD PARTY. If you like the story, go but Lippa's, and i can almost gauruntee you will like it better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plain and Simply.....","review":"YUCK.The Show was near torture to sit through, but to be fair the CD is less dull. LaChiusa neds to learn something about charisma before attempting another 'show'."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just can't compare...","review":"At the opening rehearsal for a show I was in, one member of the cast started out by mentioning that his favorite show was The Wild Party, and everyone should check it out. My friend had a copy of this CD, and I listened to it, but it most certainly did not catch my attention. I found it uninteresting, nothing special. I didn't understand the hype. I found out later that the guy in my show meant the off-broadway version. Then, I listened to the Off-Broadway version, and was immediately fan. This version is just ok. The off-broadway is just so amazing, the broadway version is just...not up to par. If you want some real thrills, check out the Off-Broadway recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"this aint no Rodgers and Hart","review":"What ever happened to the Gershwins, or Berlin, or Cole Porter or anyone else who can write music? On the positive side: The CD cover has nice art work. Otherwise: In my opinon, this music? is a pile of you know what. I defy you to tell me which song from the show that you're humming when you leave the theatre or after you've shut off the cd player? I guess i'm just a little miffed because I actually paid money for the CD (growl)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't invite me to this party.","review":"I saw the show in the theatre. Mandy Patinkin! Eartha Kitt!How can you go wrong? Right?Wrong. Two interminable hours of listless annoying music with annoying characters, in your face staging and a disjointed plot.But as a lover of Broadway lp's and cds, sometimes you get the album home and start listening to it at home and fine hidden gems. Right? Wrong. 55 minutes of listless annoying music that makes you want to take the cd out and throw it out the window.Check out the off broadway version. Much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chiusa or Lippa? Both lose","review":"I now own two versions of the Wild Party. I guess I never learn. They're very different in every way but charm. This Wild Party is a charmless story set to an irritating jazzy beat sung badly by people who usually sing very well. I know this show has its devoted fans, but I'm not one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Queenie was a success!","review":"I will be terse by saying that LaChiusa is a genious! After hearing the spellbinding Marie Christine soundtrack, one might wonder how LaChuisa could possibly top it. Well The Wild Party didn't, but it gave MC a run for her money. Both Marie Chrsitine and The Wild Party were robbed at the Tony's so everyone should go but the CD's! Aurda and Eartha are still the best around these parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite","review":"I bought this CD after I watched the Tonys and because I am a collector. I did not find any of the songs that interesting or memorable. The first number was interesting in how it set up the musical. The presentations of the characters was probably effectie on stage. The idea of going back to the \\"party\\" concept of the 30's is something so specialized it may have interest for only a few."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes but you cant hum the scenery","review":"Frankly the fondness for this show simply floors me. Why? Eartha Kitt was given the eleven o'clock number and nails it. The rest of the show seems discordant and unpleasant. Not one of the R&H types, but really Marie Christine was the more worthwhile effort from this composer. Brooke Sunny Moriber clearly will get a larger and more significant show than this one. Toni Collet was fine, but the score was undistinguished at best. Some claim its short run was undeserved and the public didn't get it. The public did \\"get it\\". The run was deserved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Severely cut, but well worth a listen","review":"This CD captures about half of Michael LaChiusa's score for _The Wild Party_, recorded by the original cast, for whom most of the numbers seem to have been specially composed. The show itself deviates considerably (and inevitably) from Joseph Moncure March's poem, and many of the performers, especially Mandy Patinkin and Eartha Kitt, are clearly too old for their roles. Still, Kitt's two numbers are magnificent, even in this severely truncated form, and Patinkin's trademark excesses have been reined in for a solid vocal performance.The cuts in the score for this OCR don't always make sense, but the overall product is surprisingly palatable, nonetheless. If you wondered what all the controversy surrounding the show was about, this album will give you a pretty good idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most powerful and brilliant scores in years!","review":"When I saw The Wild Party during its sadly short Broadway run, I was absolutely blown away by the entire experience. This CD somehow manages to bring the theatre experience into your home in a few CDs have been able to do. Michael John LaChiusa's music is absolutely perfect, covering the traditional Broadway idiom while also sounding perfectly within the languages of the late 1920s, jazz, and vaudeville. The impeccable cast--led by Toni Collette, Mandy Patinkin (in one of his best vocal performances to date), and Eartha Kitt--is not needed, but only enhances an already truly unique and powerful score. The music is intense and engrossing, so you may need to listen to it more than once in order to really \\"hear\\" every thing. But whatever you do, don't pass this CD by--it should be a part of every Broadway lover's CD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss this!","review":"If you can't get to NY to see the musical, listen to the CD (produced by Phil Ramone)! And if you've seen the musical, relive it.LaChiusa's music and lyrics take you to a dark, jazz age party that comes apart as the music progresses. The music and action flow as seamlessly as theater. These are not just songs excerpted from a musical.The ensemble cast includes strong vocal performances, esp. by Toni Collette, Marc Kudisch, Eartha Kitt, and Mandy Patinkin. (Could anyone else bring the passion and vulnerability to the role of \\"Burrs\\" that Patinkin has?)Disney on Broadway is fun, but here is something to listen to over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"AT \\"THE END\\" OF THE RAINBOW, YOU'LL FIND EARL GRANT !","review":"This song is a forever beautiful classic ballad !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"useless","review":"This book assumes you already know how to code in lingo.

This novel also marks the first appearance of Pearl the Wonder Dog, who has appeared in many subsequent Spenser books. Parker obviously loves dogs, and the passages of this novel describing Pearl's behavior are very funny.I'm not a huge fan of most of the Spenser books after 1990, but this is definitely one of the stronger ones.

He had the skill and poise of a veteran performer. And Paul Byrom's soaring tenor voice was showcased on this DVD; what an incredible voice.But I think that the performance time given to the singers was disproportionate, with McGinty and Byrom being in the spotlight considerably more than the other guys.I have the Heritage DVD also, and it is by far my favorite of the two. Although the set is much, much smaller and less extravagant than The Show's, the sound and picture quality of Heritage is far better (on my TV anyway), and that's what matters to me.Another reason I favor Heritage over The Show is that the audience in The Show seemed almost lifeless at times, whereas it was just the opposite with Heritage."},{"rating":"2","title":"celtic thunder","review":"now that i have every thing that they did i love this dvd i now have all 4 cd all 3 dvds i hope they put more cds and dvds out and maybe some blu-rays now that i have a blu-ray player"},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"Celtic Thunder: The Showby all means this was the best, my only regret is not getting it sooner, i take that back, i should have gotten 2 so that way i'd still have one to watch as my friends and family like it too"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Celtic Thunder, the Show DVD","review":"The show is brilliant, watch some of it every day.

There have been Irish folk songs that I have liked but never like these. They blend real well together and the most interesting thing about them is the different mix of personalities. I guess my favorite two of the group (if I can say just two since I like them all) is Ryne and Damian. I also like the fact that they mix in non-Irish songs.

I was duly warned by a negative review on this site, but bought it anyway and left it at the local Free-cycle spot immediately. I rated the CD one star for lack of an alternative.

Each has a strong and distinctive solo voice, but also blend well when they sing together. The music isn't all Celtic in nature - \\"Desperado\\" \\"That's a Woman\\" and \\"Puppy Love\\" are among those that aren't. The show is about 2 hours, and when they're finished, you'll find yourself wanting more! They are engaging performers who immediately connect with their audience. It would be difficult to choose a favorite - each having a unique style. This is not a \\"boy band.\\" It is a DVD you'll watch again and again! My only disappointment is that the CD only has about half the songs from the DVD. I wish they had made it a double CD set. I am hoping they will make another recording soon.

Brining these tradtional songs, but with new arrangements, to a whole new audience is such a great idea. Phil Coulter and Sharon Brown did an amazing job picking these guys (Paul is the only one who had a vocal career as his main job). I fell in love with Celtic Thunder when I saw this show in March 2008 and still love Celtic Thunder.

I'd call this cd a combination of what we heard on the Friday Night Lights soundtrack and what EITS put out on their other two albums. The crescendo isn't quite as apparent and is distinctly different in the way the band approaches it.#2. I had never laughed when I heard a song before from sheer giddiness until I heard Magic Hours. WOW! One of the most sensational instrumental riffs I've ever heard. The closing segments of the song were amazing. As good as anything EITS have done before.#3. A Song for Our Fathers: very dynamic work. One of the better EITS songs I've heard. It's almost otherworldly. This, along with Magic Hours, would be perfect songs for s score if they ever made a film about the apocalypse.All in all, a very good album.

You can get into small spaces and make fine, precision cuts thereby leaving as little pastic residue as possible. The hobby knife is good for cleaning off that residue once the piece is off the sprue. Be careful though, if you cut too deep you gouge out plastic from the actual piece. The tweezers are effective for placing decals and manipulating small parts. So far I haven't used the file very much.

The pliers cut well, and aren't very difficult to use, but have a tendency to leave white marks on the soft plastic. The sliding razor is helpful in scraping off the leftover nubs and minimizing the white marks. The tweezers are indispensible in applying stickers to the finished body of the gundam, but are too thin to set in parts, and have no grip whatsoever.

Many are not even in the sequence of the show. Instead, most tracks are studio mixes without some of the background elements like the voices. Several of the tracks don't even come from the final broadcast version of Lyre Lyre. A collection of LL and RO singing and music from the series is fine.

I did however totally adore the song We Can Work It Out. It was a great addition that should have been in the episode. But being an ardent Xena fan I can not complain to much.

I think a lot of the trouble can be attributed to careless writing and not checking one's sources.On the plus side (and even though the interior art and layout is pretty lame), I found the size, shape, and stupid Spiderman cover strangely alluring. Its just a neat size; maybe somebody could write a factual reference book in this format."},{"rating":"2","title":"Griffin earjams make earbuds confortable","review":"These earjams clip over the end of the regular earbuds and have different sizes and a soft feeling for the part that goes in your ear.I can only wear earbuds in comfort with the use of these.

The piece that clips on *doesn't fit* - it's way too big.

I paid half the price of an ipod for this and got twice the memory size. I bought it for the price and extras, recording feature and being able to hold pictures. Surprisingly she doesn't use these features much. The only disadvantage is having to charge it on your computer unless you spring for the extra accessorty wall charger.

I can control the frequency of freezes by allowing the unit to \\"think\\" after I touched a button or control. It's a little slow to respond to the commands.

In order to unfreeze the player, you have to find a small pin to fit in the tiny hole on the side. If you have no access to one at the time, it stays locked and then the battery could die completely. And I dont see an access point to even get to the battery. Sometimes the inside of the product with turn defective after a while. My boyfriend's Creative that I gotten him, the USB part couldn't find the USB cable connected to it, even though its been working fine for a month.

I never got why these guys never made it bigger in the states.I rarely skip any songs on this CD, but some stand outs for me on this album are Young Thing Wild Dreams, Among the Ruins, Beacon Hill, and Hold Tight. Shake Monster, while certainly a piece of classic 80s cheese, is a fun listen, too.I assume if you're looking at this album you know what Red Rider sounds like.

The failure to provide a proper history of the oriental art of Judo in Korea is deeply disappointing, especially since Korea is the only country in the world wherein the martial art created by Kano Jigoro is still taught as Kano intended it to be taught, as a military art. If one wants a videotape which illustrates the Korean adaptation and practice of the Olympic sport of judo, they may want to purchase this videocassette.

Gavilan and the Owl were the best characters of this book, along with Cort. I don't like how Mr. Brooks always kills off the minor characters. They are the coolest ones. I wish Par would die...Maybe Mr. Brooks will do a follow up of Talismans and kill off Wren and Par. Walker Boh is the only cool main character. The Elf Queen is the worst in the series besides The Sword of Shannara."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book to read","review":"The Elf Queen of Shannara has to be the best book that I have ever read in my life.I enjoyedthis book very much because as soon as I started to read it I could not set it down. you should read all of the books before this one because the book book goes back to the previous books to things that happened before and you might get mixed up a little bit like I did.

However, i think V7 is the best ( maybe it's because it was the first one i bought :-))V7 is compiled by DJ Bruno, which wasn't the case with the first six ( they were compiled by Jose Padilla ). I have also V5 & V6 so i can compare them both with V7. And without any doubt i can say that V7 is much more powerfull and emotional than V5 or V6.The V5 is generaly considered to be the best by many ( it's right behind V7 if you ask me ), but it's just too \\"mellow\\" and \\"easy\\" for me. V7 also has a more variable list of styles, a little bit of everything for everyone. Actually, there isn't a bad song in here, and the best include: the first four (expecially Moby & Deep and Wide ), Bedrock's \\"Beautiful Strange\\" and Bent's \\"Swollen\\" ( a really great song ).All in all, a good relaxing \\"chill - out\\" compilation.And if you like how it sounds, continue with V5 & V6."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not anywhere near as relaxing as advertised","review":"This is not for anyone searching for an ambient, downtempo bit of chill-out music, unless your idea of chill-out is frantic bar-hopping.

I initially decided to read it for summer reading at my high school and I know Dr. Curran personally (I have been seeing him for the past three years at school). After reading the first couple chapters, I had gained a new respect for him as a writer; he had clearly and informatively written his passages, in which he show a superior contol of language. He also integrated humor into his writing which made the book more enjoyable to read.Although I am aware that Dave has a rich vocabulary and is well educted, I was suprised that he integrated excerpts from Thoreau, \\"Big Two Hearted River,\\" and \\"To Build a Fire.\\" I have read these in my AP english class and this made it possible to connect with the book on another level."},{"rating":"2","title":"canoe Trip review","review":"Canoe Trip by David Curran is an interesting feat of adventure discovered in the Maine wilderness. A one man adventure that is full of surprises along the way. The book shows real life problems that would occur during a canoe trip in the Maine wilderness. These problems would occur only once in a life time, but for this adventurer these problems are common every day problems.This is an amazing book and would recommend it to anybody who likes adventure stories. The text is so detailed it felt like you were on the tripyourself.

This book does not rate a place in my collection. In fact, it might qualify as one of my worst buys - especially at the highly inflated price of $17.99. I found that the content did nothing to hold my attention and make me want to turn the page. Perhaps the depth of the author's experiences (or at least what he relates in this volume) can be discerned from his meal preparation - heating a can of Dinty Moore beef stew on a gas stove. That pretty well sums up his Maine Wilderness trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"truly a whole other experience","review":"I really couldn't wait to get this book after I found it here on Amazon. As a solotripper - one who takes his canoe alone and goes into the wilds - this book sounded wonderful.The author does a fantastic job of explaining why he does what he does. Some reasons I share, some I do not. He goes into some extended details that may be a bit much for a non-paddler to chew on, but the book should satisfy the appetite of anyone looking for ammunition to go alone and explore.In the end, a canoe trip alone is a time of growth, healing, and probably as much salvation as anything.While the world today is full of man-made noise, this book does well in trying to explain how beneficial it is to eliminate all of that. To be quiet. To be alone. It certainly made me look forward to my next trip...a gift I am sure the author takes pleasure in giving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canoe Trip","review":"Canoe Trip is an exciting novel about David Curran's solo canoe expidition through the Maine wilderness. Along the way, he encounters a few dangers including harsh weather conditions, rough water, moose, and the ever-present mosquito. David likes to do the trip alone because it is easier the plan, and easier to concentrate on his surroundings. These elements combined make for a book that will take you along the ride with him.You, the reader, will enjoy this book because for many of you, it will hit close to home. It's not like some other adventure stories where it takes place in the Amazon Jungles, or the Himalayian Mountains. No, this book takes place in Maine. This book is also very enjoyable because of its humor. It is laced in many parts of the stories.

I was unable to listen to any of the selections before buying this CD, and now I know why! Most of the arrangements sound like so much of the common junk coming out of Nashville these days.

It gives some incredible background to the attacks of September 11, 2001, going back to the early l990s and the first attack on the World Trade Center. It's not flattering to the Clinton administration, but the same is true of the Bush administration; it just so happens that Clinton was President for the vast majority of the time between the two attacks. It points the finger of blame, not so much at any person or administration, but at the *mentality* that got us to 9/11. It makes it so clear that appeasement and weakness cost us dearly, and that boldness, strength, decisiveness, and resolve are needed in the war against these Islamist thugs. This needs to be made available on DVD; every school should use it in their curriculum. Awesome work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Is This Kept From Americans","review":"The Path to 9-11 is a superb film about the biggest attack on America in the twentieth century.

It could also have chosen to be a parody of such horror films. Instead, it was as normal as any other Dawson's Creek novel. Normally, I would commend the authors for bringing to life the characters of an excellent show, but here, I criticise them for taking such a normal route with a title like this. It could easily have been called anything else, and it wouldn't make a difference.

The listings for The Prisoner and Pressure Drop, which were flipped on the original UK CD, are now correct, and the back cover group photo is slightly crisper. The remastering is slightly louder but no cleaner that the original '93 release, so I wouldn't bother replacing it on that account. Annoying why the powers-that-be didn't start by simply expanding on the original EP (this is missing three tracks), but evidently the CD format pulls together the tracks that can't be found elsewhere, so I suppose it follows the original vinyl concept.

Most good educators strive everyday to be more innovative, creative and seek to develop a love for life-long learning in students. Why else would we be in the field?

I wish he would have included some songs such as \\"Love Strong\\" and \\"Hands Down\\". If those cuts were on this CD, it would rate 5 stars, no doubt about it. Dan was the best at making \\"feel good\\" music that made you want to dance and party-hardy. The content showcases his endless musical talents and imagination.

To read absolutely. You won't regret it !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you teach Chicago history?","review":"Then this book is a must-have. Admittedly short on plot, this book does a great job of putting the reader at Chicago's Columbian Exposition of 1893. The characters are charming and give great insight into what experiences one would have when visiting the World's Fair. In addition, we learn about Bertha Palmer, philanthropist, and Jane Addams, social reformer: two important female historical figures in history.

While there is a considerable amount of biographical information in this book, it is not primarily a biography. Instead the title of the book is an good description of this books contents: a description of the political battles involving over water in the lower Colorado River basin and the role and impact that Carl Hayden played in this political drama. Towards the goal expressed by the title, this book is well written and an engrossing read. If you are looking for a general biography of Hayden that does not focus primarily on a single area of the senator's career then Ross R. Rice'sCarl Haydenis a better choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond the Bridge","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. Lots of suspense and excitement.

He doesn't stop with criticism, but instead suggests a new direction that can lead to fruitful advances in all areas of science, and proceeds to develop the beginnings of a new mathematical paradigm for studying complex, real-world systems.Drawing on almost forgotten advances as well as modern research, Ulanowicz weaves together the soft, crude world of ecology with the \\"hard sciences\\" of thermodynamics and information theory and comes up with something truly novel. The discussion examines issues as fundamental as causality and the direction of time, and yet remains strongly tied to the real world with examples and data.This book is absolutely indispensable for any scientist."},{"rating":"1","title":"FULL SCREEN ONLY","review":"Typical example of this type of film.I quite enjoyed it,though a bit slow.FULL SCREEN with Faded Color,though it looks ok,if your not too critical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre attempt of a \\"brilliant romantic comedy\\"","review":"This is a mediocre (not terrible, just mediocre) attempt of a romantic comedy. The story centers around an undecided young woman who can't decide whether she is really a lesbian, whether she loved the last girlfriend who dumped her for her inability to commit, whether she is now in love with a man or maybe with his... ex-girlfriend. As you can imagine, the situation will get complicated very quickly, giving rise to fairly trite situations.Acting is mostly mediocre, and would be just fine for a TV sitcom. Tina Benko and Justin Kirk save the day a bit, but the main character, played by Elizabeth Reaser, is very forgettable, rather silly, and not even very attractive. The dialogue tries hard to be witty, but it ends up in most cases being just trivial and quite unnatural. As other reviewers have pointed out, the screenplay really sounds a like \\"Woody Allen for beginners\\".Overall, a very forgettable movie, which I will quickly forget."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would have given it a minus three stars if it had been available","review":"This is the hardest to read textbook I have ever owned.

I have other things to do with my time besides trying to decipher what the authors are trying to say. It's as if it's written in code and you have to figure out what it means.

Also, they really need to balance their instruments better. I felt like I was going to fall off my chair when I listened how far to the right they had push a majority of the instruments.One of the things that I really enjoyed about this band was the fullness, the depth of their vocals and instruments.

Yah, it's different. Yah, it's a lot less heavy. Yah, it's extremely similar to nu-metal.

Savior Sorrow is no disappointment!","review":"Yes, I too admit I was unsure of the direction Mushroomhead would take without J Mann fronting- however, in my view, Waylon does NOT disappoint in the least! This sounds to me very much like early Mushroomhead that I discovered way back when. I agree with other reviewers that if you didn't enjoy Superbuick and other early (pre world tour) releases, you might not like this one. It's much more tune focused- instruments stand out more, it's lyrically strong and has great harmonies, but still packs quite the Mushroomhead whollop over the head beat-wise! Sounds to me sort of like AFI meets Godsmack; Can't wait to see this new Mushroomhead live when they come to Denver :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for old school Mushroomhead fans.","review":"If you were a fan of Superbuick, M3, and XX... and only mildly enjoyed XIII, stay far away from Savior Sorrow. The absence of J-Mann is like a huge void throughout the entire album. Waylon is good enough to fill in the harsh vocals, but doesnt have the rhythm and flow that Jmann brought to every song. Plus, Waylon sings clean vocals from time to time and sounds very (dare I say) emo-ish. There are a few touches of emo on more than one track(\\"Save Us\\",\\"Pretend(ing)\\"....).There a few good tracks on here(\\"The Doubt\\",\\"Burn\\",\\"Cut Me\\") but they're pretty generic and lack the signature Mushroomhead sound.Despite the disappointing new album I still plan to see them on tour Oct. 1st, and I hope they play a lot of old stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too all you people!!!!","review":"Let me start off by saying Mushroomhead is a 100,000 times better then slipknot!!!

If you like the last one they came out with you will like this one. So get it and hear some real music!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mushroomhead - 'Savior Sorrow' (Megaforce)","review":"Review number 44. First thing I thought to myself when I saw a couple of Mushroomhead videos were, they remind me of Slipknot but with better music. Just saw this over-the-top metal eight piece {is it?} play a club on their current U.S. tour. Had a lot of fun at this band's concert, have to admit. What is this, like their sixth album? I have some catching up to do here. Tunes off this current opus of theirs I dug the most were the rhythmic opener \\"12 Hundred\\", the in-your-U-G-L-Y mug \\"Tattoo\\", the familiar sounding \\"Just Pretending\\", the almost scary \\"Cut Me\\" and (hard to believe) the disc's actual ballad \\"Embracing The End\\". Some of their influnces were obviously Alice in Chains and Ministry. Should appeal to fans of Mudvayne, Korn, System Of A Down and Static X. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mainstream? Maybe, but they still make damn good music!!","review":"Mushroomhead takes one step closer to the mainstream crowd but they still know how to do there own thing and make it sound like SOME old Mushroomhead. Waylon does a great job replacing J Mann on this, but J is still missed...there was just something about the chemistry between J and Jeffrey Nothing that made you wanna beat stuff up. With that said this album plays second to no other Mushroomhead albums and is as good if not better than any of their other albums.Best Songs - 12 hundred, Simple Survival, Save Us, Erase the Doubt, Embrace the Ending.Worst Songs - Absolutely None....Every Song on this will blow you away, the ones above are just my personal picks.Pick this one up, Well worth the price and even more!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tracks","review":"This cd is great!

If you are a fan of the ingenuity, intensity and creativity found on their previous efforts, you will be dissapointed. I found a few traces on here of a once great band, but as one person had mentioned before it wholly sounds like some alt-rock radio band emulating mushroomhead.

Garbage!","review":"Hard rock/metal's best years (generally speaking), creatively and musically, were the 70's and 80's HANDS DOWN. Musicians back then could actually sing and play their instruments with ungodly style, melody, virtuosity, great hooks, and artistic talent compared to these current 'Nu-Metal' assclowns. Gimmicky, schlocky pseudo 'metal' bands like Slipknot, Korn, and Mushroomhead come along and pollute the genre with their disjointed, infantile screaming (not singing) and jackhammer guitars. Typical fare for musically stunted, pimply mallrat teens from troubled homes- or should I say trailers.

Case and the cd had a split all the way through"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, Experimental Effort From Metal Giants","review":"After a fantastic, near-perfect modern metal disc, this follow-up to 2005's \\"XIII\\" is a very solid effort, but perhaps slightly inferior in some ways....possibly due to a lineup change in the band, as well as record-label changes and general chaos. \\"Savior\\" is in many ways much more diverse than the band's last album, leaning even more in an experimental, almost post-metal direction, but seems less cohesive overall.That having been said, it is an excellent album, full of the ominous, rumbly downtuned riffage and weird electronic embellishments one expects from the band, and is definately recommended to any fan of modern metal. This album is full of great tracks; it would be worth picking up for the powerful and heavy \\"Save Us\\" alone. Although \\"XIII\\" remains my favorite; this album picks up the threads of the last album and in many ways follows them in new direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"aam; manze","review":"Enjoyable vivaldi.

I was actually bored on first hearing. The second time around, the disc came alive for me. The performances are breathtaking, with many interpretative felicities. If you are someone who can enjoy less-than-first-rate music becaue of stellar performances, this recording will delight you. Actually, I did like the music a lot more on repeat hearing.

It features selections from the World's Greatest Entertainer from 1913 through the early 30's.This CD is well remastered, but even modern technology can only do so much. The songs recorded before 1925 were sung into a horn to cut the record, so even with the best technology, it sounds like you are hearing Jolson through a garden hose or tunnel. The selections done with the use of a microphone (1925 and after) sound quite a bit better.Fans who want to get as much of Jolson as they can to complete their collection will definitely want this one; folks who want to hear clean, clear, and potent Jolson would do better to buy CD's based on his recordings from the 40's (Best of the Decca Years, or Jolson Live, for example)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Drafting Book","review":"I used this book as a textbook for a college Drafting For Theatre class.

I understand that's not the fault of the publisher, for McSweeney's is a great company. (Licensing is probably the key factor keeping this book from having a complete CD.) But I don't want to have to go through the book, downloading the songs I'm unfamiliar with, just to better understand the book.The essays are personal and quirky, like a lot of Hornby's other work, particularly his pieces in the SPEAKING WITH THE ANGEL compilation.

Everything else he has written I give 5 stars, and I could rave about those books without end. But unfortunately I recognized extremely few of the songs covered in this collection of his essays, and it kind of spoiled it for me.Now, I do realize that this is a fault of my own and not of the author. I think that this would have been a much more enjoyable book for me if I had been more familiar with the material.If you are considering reading this book, I would strongly advise perhaps downloading some of the songs or otherwise getting some ground on these artists before reading essays on their work. Even with an amazingly talented author like Hornby, you don't want to read 200 pages of essays when you have no background in the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea, No pay back","review":"My wife gave me this book for my Birthday. The idea was wonderful and I was intrigued. I had never read Nick Hornby, but I am a fan of High Fidelity. That night I went to bed the book and my kid's CD player. I started off well until I got to the 2nd essay \\"Thunder Road\\". Nothing on the CD. Now I suppose that I could find this song fairly easily, but since there are 31 essays and only 12 tracks on the CD I quickly got totally uninterested in the book. Why would anyone want to read about a tune that he didn't know or could listen to at the same time. I figure copyright must be the hangup, but I honestly can't imagine \\"The Boss\\" refusing to let a recognized author use an old song to gain a glowing review that might be read by thousands of readers. The book will remain unread & unlistened toat my house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Writing About Music -- What Could Be Better?","review":"This book is based on a great concept: Hornby takes a favorite song of his and tells you why it's his favorite. It's a mix of music criticism and memoir because sometimes he concedes that a song may not be the best one of its genre--but it's his favorite because it's associated with something special that happened to him--and he tells you about that special thing. Hornby is a good writer and makes it all work. Now, in the hardback version you also got a cd that included every one of the songs he talks about. But I have the paperback. You may be able to buy the cd separately. Not sure. The book is recommended. Oh, another comment: it's not as funny as The Polysyllabic Spree or Dirt vs. Housekeeping, or Shakespeare Wrote for Money -- his book reviews. He cut his teeth on Songbook. In those last books mentioned, he let his humor blossom gloriously.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Writing","review":"It's a credit to this book that I only know one single song mentioned in it, yet I've still found it interesting to read. The author's passion for music is clear, and I've enjoyed reading the details of why certain songs have touched him. He isn't afraid to talk about his feelings about music, about performers, and about the things that were happening in his life that meant certain music affected him. I like having this insight into an author's mind.I do wish I'd known some of the music from this book, though. I've made a list and plan on finding much of this music, and perhaps then I will reread it and see if I have a different impression after listening to the music.

Fans who read High Fidelity will know that music plays a key role in the lives of his characters. In this work on pop culture, Hornby writes about 31 songs that have personally touched and moved him. Some of them are instantly recognisable pop gems, others obscure to even hardened lovers of indy music. But Hornby's strength is in his writing. He makes each song come alive, as he narrates not only a brief history of the song and the band but also why he likes it and most stunningly what the song sounds like.

It is a very good overview of William Samuel McTell's excellent Columbia and Okeh sides, but you won't find any of his classic Victor singles here, and that's a pity, because it was at Victor that McTell recorded \\"Statesboro Blues\\", \\"Dark Night Blues\\", \\"Writing Paper Blues\\", \\"Stole Rider Blues\\", and \\"Mama T'Ain't Long 'Fo Day\\".But add this one and \\"The Early Years 1927-1933\\" to your shopping basket, and you'll have a very fine overview of Blind Willie McTell in his prime.Or you could just get the handsomely packaged box set \\"The Definitive Blind Willie McTell\\", or the exhaustive (and very reasonably priced) \\"The Classic Years 1927-1940\\"...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"Received the product in anticipation of listening to a restored classic but instead I can barely hear it. I placed it in my CD player and pushed play and heard nothing. I thought there was something wrong with the player but to check I put in one of my old CD's and it played fine. I put Blind Willie back in and pushed play and still nothing. I adjusted the volume almost to max and then I could barely hear it. I put in other CD's the I purchased at the same time as Blind Willie and the same poor quality. I guess I will be returning the whole set soon. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disapointed to say the least","review":"As difficult as it is to find information on the art of topiary, this disapointing book gives a very vague picture. Perhaps the most frustrating thing about the book is the illustrations. It seems more like a comic strip than an information resource. For instance the 3 or 4 pages given to standards shows hand drawn renderings that look like my 5 year old drew them. It is interesting that they devoted so many pages to different types of wire shapes. It seems obvious to me that vines will grow on a rack shaped like a bird, and they will grow on a rack shaped like an elephant. I just didn't \\"get\\" showing us all the different shapes, and giving them all their own page.

There is a natural progression throughout from basic Spanish mixed with English at the beginning to the later portion, which introduces prederite, imperfect and other verb forms.Even after completing three semesters of Spanish (and several viewings), I'm still catching new words.

Also, for almost all of the arm workouts they use equipment, like a pull up bar and other things, which I do not have and it was not suggested to have these on the box, I had no idea those would be required they just brought them out all of the sudden.

You can imagine how fun that was, strolling along with a bag full of dog poop ... and having the bag split open and spill its contents at (and on) your feet. Yuck.I tried to send an email to the manufacturer, letting them know about the problem, but every address I used (found on their website) was a dud. The messages just bounced right back to me.

As the part-owner of a commercial organic farm, some information I was hoping for is just not here: how do you remedy soil structure problems on a large scale?

She discovers soon that he's a white dog, a dog trained to attack black people. Interesting but depressing film about the impossibility to eradicate racism.

I had never heard of the movie and came across it by accident.White Dog is a poignant tale that does not end well,the way I hoped against hope that it would. The white dog used in the movie to portray how tragic racism can be was trained by his original owner to kill black people. The dog loves his new owner, a young actress who adopts him. She finds a black trainer who vows to de program the dog. When I watched the film I thought, why isn't the human being who trained the dog in the first place, punished? As a dog lover and a former German Shepherd owner, I am glad I saw White Dog. My dog was protective and loyal and would have given his life for me. As a human being, I wish that people would not use once innocent animals to destroy others.

It is very old fashioned so you have to get past that to enjoy the film. The scenes where the dog attacks are very scary. The movie is really very unrealistic because the dog comes home with blood all over it and the owner thinks nothing of it (completely dumb), and then when the dog attacks someone in front of everyone, she takes it to get retrained. In real life the dog would have been killed and this would not have been an option.

Procreating Vampires - Nancy KilpatrickAnd I found all these before page 118.The dialog is grating and the lead charactor is wishy washy, If your going to kill something, kill it already, stop threatening.In short the charactor Samantha is weak. It was almost as if getting raped by Sevastian was okay, a stronger character would have killed him for making her feel violated and dealt with the consequences later.

The book seemed written without a lot of thought or no outline - it just didn't flow or make much sense, had words spelled incorrectly, grammatical errors, and honestly it seems like no one reviewed it, edited it, or proofread it after it was written. The main character's reactions, comments, and behavior are over the top and ridiculous, there is no real character development or depth, the way the characters talk to each other is just silly, it's hard to really care about anyone in the book. Near the beginning of the book, one character meets another, then in the next couple pages, acts like he has no idea who the character he just met was!

The only problem about this album is that it doesn't have one of my favourites on it 'mansion & a yacht' which was on a single that I to get elsewhere back then.

Some times it's refreshing to dip in the old cd's and find a gem like Kurious. In a time where hip hop has turned to nothing more than garbage, I listen to this album and others from that era before hip hop was so processed. The beats are fresh, partly because of excellent production from the Beatnuts. After this album i never heard anything new from Kurious, i'm sure because album sales weren't as great as expected. And if Kurious was to come out with new material he would have to appeal to the masses and come wack like all the others who attempted comebacks recently. but we will always have the \\"constipated monkey\\" a hip hop classic!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY TINY","review":"I had read all the reviews of this item so I new it was small.

There's also the pasture challenges, where you ride around in different patterns to beat the clock. (Some are good to use in real life too, like the slaloms and the Big T.)

Then you can also pick what your horse's coat, mane, saddle, saddle pad and name it. Then you can practice riding, be in competitions, and ride in the pasture. Then pictures of you and your horse are saved in the Scrapbook and you can print them out.

BVW 125 contains an amazing revelation (about which I've heard nothing before -- but perhaps I've been inattentive): Gustav Mahhler built the Der Abshied segment of Das Lied von der Erde on the \\"Ich will auch mit gebrochnen Augen\\" aria in this work! I knew that, before composing Das Lied, Mahler was restudying Bach, but I had no idea how closley he modelled the most moving part of Das Lied (the Der Abshied melody motiff, harmony, voicing and tempo)on what Bach wrote long before him in this aria.

Still learning to control an immortal power she had gleaned from Romo in the first book, she wades through comical results. Her sister is getting married, her brother is wanted for murder, her other sister has been stripped of her powers, and a brother/sister team reminiscent of a male and female Ranger (Stephanie Plum series) are available to lend a hand. As in the first book, Midnight the cat steals the show with some of the best one-liners as he trades barbs with a female cat. And again, Poppy's house keeps getting torn apart. She needs to build a cinder block structure.

Don't be fooled to think these are different CDs!! they are the same, though this one has English titles. Plus, the Import version contains vocals on a few songs by the fabulous Maggie Reilly (former vocalist with Mike Oldfield) and an excellent artist in her own right. Check out her solo works (her greatest hits is a nice place to start if unfamiliar with her) and buy Lesiem's \\"Times\\" instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystical & Magical","review":"This is the third cd from the amazing group Lesiem. The music on this cd is simply amazing and takes me on a journey from beginning to end without losing my interest. From the first track Humilitas that is majestic and moving to the powerful choir based song Caritas, this cd is so consistent and thematic it is such a gift. The production and song writing is more mature than their previous two records and it shows a growth in several directions for the group. More female singers involved on more tracks and full on string arrangements make this music mystical and magical. Hopefully, this group will receive the recognition they deserve. For anyone that loves the sounds of Enigma, Era and groups in this genre, Lesiem's (Auracle) is right up there all the way around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds really good, more pop-like","review":"I thought it was a bit of a departure from the previous albums Illumination, and even Mystic Spirit Voices. With those two it sounded like the beats were designed AROUND the chanting, while in contrast, the chanting in Auracle sounded to me like they were designed SPECIFICALLY for the beats. I mean, honestly, if any of the guys at my church started chanting like THAT, we'd assume they were on CRACK :)Anyway, this album was more pop-like, to the point where I wasn't even sure it was Lesiem anymore (check out the track \\"Bonitas\\"). A lot more English vocals this time. It's definitely something different, nothing negative at all. I liked the CD a lot. I'd give it 5 stars, but I reserve that for albums that are TRULY special (like the album Odonata by Amethystium).Auracle is a great addition to my library, and a must-have for every fan of the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lesiem Auracle","review":"The magic expands with the third Lesiem release.

But \\"ILLUMNINATION\\" and \\"CHAPTER2\\" are identical - simply another order of the songs... Also the Albums \\"TIMES\\" and \\"AURACLE\\" are the same - with another order of the songs... Maybe I am just an idiot, for not reading the booklets first - but behind a new cover and title I simply didnt expect 2 year old songs in a new order..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not worth it.","review":"Yes, it sounds a little like Enigma. Like a hometown wannabe cover band. There's no depth to the sound, as if they didn't have the studio time or talent or money, and the vocals seem harsh and out of place instead of fusing with the music. Give this a pass. If you like this sort of sound, another group is Angel Tears and they seem much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't be worse if it tried.","review":"Terrible. This is such a bad record.

This book, however, throws us back a few decades. Yes, I realize that it's intended to be easy-going and fun, but it decends to the point of being surface and stereotypical. The characters talk like two highschoolers out of the eighties, more Valley Girl than today's teens would ever be. And their stereotypical eccentric shop-owner friend reminds us of so many other characters--see any John Hughes teen movie. Admittedly, there are some funny moments as the girls set out to get dates by transforming pet rats into real boys. But the whole theme of \\"the unpopular girl against the popular girl\\" ends up making the characters seem ridiculous and shallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing audio book tie-in version of a good movie","review":"I have watched the movie several times and enjoy it. But Mare Winningham's narration of this book is disappointing, to say the least. She reads much too fast, does not enunciate and there is little or no modulation or inflection. It's as if she is reading a very dry speech or a term paper. The audio quality is also bad, too low to really hear and understand, complicated again by the too-fast reading of the narrative. It is listed as \\"abridged,\\" but I cannot find a novellization or a full-version of it anywhere. Would have enjoyed reading the book or a good quality audiobook to get some in-depth understanding of the whole situation. I am an avid audiobook fan, as well as written word, but this one comes up lacking. Save your money.

I find them relaxing and informative. But this one is a joke. I rate the quality of video and audio on par with a junior high production.When the narrator jumps in to give info it cuts in with a loud pop. The video is even worse. How do you use a camera and not show what the person is doing. Standing back 10 feet, looking across a room while he is giving a foot massage.I could go on and on about this piece of crap. But I will just ask everyone nicely to not even bother with buying it. Please save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst amateurish production EVER","review":"If you're looking to waste some money in today's economy do I have a DVD set for you. This DVD set promises to teach 'SENSUAL MASSAGE', these videos are pretty much documenting how to give a basic 'RUB DOWN'... I learned ABSOLUTELY nothing new.

Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it advertises to be","review":"This DVD is not what it advertises to be. It's a basic massage video, nothing sensual about it. And even the instruction on the basic massage is lacking - they just show a couple massaging each other but don't explain the technique at all.The voiceover \\"instructions\\" rarely match what's actually happening on screen and is full of terribly corny \\"tips\\" like one that recommended buying a terry cloth robe from a local department store to add to the home spa feel. Please.I wouldn't recommend this video and feel like I completely wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"pointless","review":"After seeing all the reviews we thought the wrong video was in the case.

The mattress swells up over the next three days until it reaches its full thickness (a little shy of 10\\"). I am very pleased with the product. The smell was much less bothersome than most people claimed. It IS, however, very, very firm. I think I am going to add a three inch topper to make it a little more comfortable.

I have held off reviewing since a number of folks noted that problems didnt arise right away. So far we have not had any problems. My wife and I are very pleased with the mattress. The mattress arrived on day we were told it would. It was rolled tight and was wrapped in several layers of plastic. We installed it the next morning. We waited, so that there would be sufficient time for the chemical odor we had heard about to disipate. While there was a very light chemical odor, it was completely gone within a few hours. It was summer time, and the windows were open -- it may have seemed more if it was winter and we had to keep the windows closed. The mattress fit nicely into our frame and expanded to fill it completely. It had fully expanded within a few hours. We're very pleased with the firmness of the mattress. It is 'firm' but that is what we were looking for. We are very pleased with our purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Good. But, stinky.

What a wrong decision - another week of terrible back pain! I normally have no back issues so it was clearly attributable to this mattress. I also have no idea why some people describe it is \\"firm\\" - it is softer than a whipped cream. The moment you are on it you sink down, your back becomes an arc and next morning it feels like you were hit with a baseball bat.Now I don't know about more expensive quality stuff like Tempurpedic, but since my back is not a guinea pig I decided not to experiment more and got a spring mattress - next day my back pain was gone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift","review":"My spouse is very happy with this portable DVD Player.

He's a careful, easygoing voice with a dry wit and memorable characters, and his protagonists are fun and engaging. In this current installment, Holland Taylor, Housewright's first protagonist, is hired by an old nemesis. The nemesis is a particularly sleazy lawyer named Howard Truman. Howard wants Holland to discover who killed his client's wife, or failing that at least find the body of the deceased.Holland wanders off investigating, and runs across several interesting characters. The action moves to a small town outside of the big city, and from there things get very interesting and pretty amusing. The plot gets a bit complicated, but overall it's about what a detective novel like this should have.

I consider Dane Cook to be a moderately funny comedian, so I expected it to be one of those piece of crap movies that has the occasional laugh out loud moment. I laughed maybe once. The rest of the time, I winced and just felt embarrased for the people on screen. The fact that I watched this with my parents didn't help. One of the most uncomfortable experiences of my film-obsessed life. Ugh. Please pass on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I thought this movie was more about how Jessica Alba wasn't lucky I guess I should have read the back of the dvd!

The whole movie she acted cute and smiled and that was about it. They could have gotten any actress to play her part, as it required no talent.An old lady being hit with a frisbee is just not funny. Maybe if she fell off a cliff after being hit it would be. We have the stereotypical male, obsessed with breasts in this movie, and it gets annoying aftera while.The best part of the movie was the end credits where Dane made out with a penguin stuffed animal.Have fun with this one, but don't expect to laugh that much."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought I hated Dane Cook before I saw this movie, but...","review":"Apperently he sinks to a new low. I just don't get how anyone finds him funny whatsoever. He can butcher the best script ever written, and Good Luck Chuck was far from that.

There was nothing romantic or even funny about this movie.

Even after he \\"learns\\" his lesson or does whatever it is he does that makes it possible for him to get the girl, he is still not a likeable character. There is a limit to how much an audience can relate to someone who acts poorly all the time.

And Chuck's best friend is the very definition of crude. But I give it 5 stars because I love Jessica Alba for one thing, and it also strikes me that it has a good message: That sex is not meant to be casual, and that casual sex is un-fulfilling and even boring, so why bother? It leaves you empty and sad, which is probably part of the reason Chuck acted so crazy when he fell in love with Cam. Yeah I know, he was scared that she'd marry the next guy like all those other women, but the bottom line is that he loved her and realized that sex without love means absolutely nothing but pain and loneliness. So if you can get past the crude parts and the ridiculous sex scenes and get to the heart of the story, then beneath it all is a true love story with a life lesson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chick flick that guys actually won't mind!","review":"For the fairer sex, this movie's a spot on, quintessentially Cosmopolitan love story.

Im not prudish but it really burns me that they (whoever THEY are) must have known this would not make money at the box office if people were aware of how raunchy it was so they advertised it as romantic-comedy-date-movie-fare. You go in expecting something like a Drew Barrymore type flick and soon discover its more like softcore porn and boneheaded, not-funny humor. By then its too late to get back your money and the hour and 45 minutes of your life you just wasted. Sometimes suggestive humor is funny, but this is just crude, crude, crude, all the way through.

At it's heart there's a standard romantic comedy, but it's handled about as badly as anything I've ever seen. This was the directorial debut of Mark Helfrich, a fairly respected film editor. This kind of comedy requires a deft, experienced hand, but even an experienced director would have found it impossible to score saddled with this horrible, limp screenplay filled with mediocre sight gags and crude lingo that's about unhip as The Partridge Family. Every body tries, but it still arrives D.O.A. I thought the \\"extras\\" might provide a laugh, but the ad libs, the blooper reel, etc., all showed how unfunny this entire project was.

I thought it was going to be a good phone with all the features. I brought it home and it was great for about a 15 days. After that (which was obviously when the 15-day trial period ended), my phone started to stop working all the time, I had bad service, and then recently, my phone charger stopped working.I'm not 100% sure if it's the service or the actual phone, but I'm so frustrated with Verizon right now that I am almost willing to pay the $175 early termination and go back to Nextel."},{"rating":"1","title":"This phone is the worst","review":"Yeah, I mean it. This phone is the worst in reception and battery life, two most important areas one would look for in a good phone.I have been using this for a while now (more than a year) and I have at least one dropped call in a day. I make hardly 10 to 15 calls a day and one out of 10 is not 3%, you moron (I am addressing the customer service rep here who told me 3 to 5% of dropped calls is quite normal).The best place for this phone is the gutters, not your pocket."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this phone!","review":"After a great deal of research my husband and I decided on this phone and we are very glad we did. It's been great. The camera works well (although the zoom feature isn't really a zoom) and the flash is a nice touch. We both LOVE the hands free feature. Very very cool and handy. It has a lot of really great features that are easy to use. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I've had occassional problems with it getting a signal in certain areas. For example I've been in a store with another person (same carrier but different phones) who was able to make calls without a problem when my phone would barely get a signal and 'connect'. And there have been a 'few' (literally, just a few) mysteriously dropped calls. Not sure if it was the phone or the area... And FYI: it seems harder to find accessories for this phone- although they are available online and through the carrier. All in all, it's a great phone and we are very happy with it!

Ever since I upgraded in June of 2005, I have had more dropped calls and fewer received calls than the supposedly \\"inferior\\" older LG model I was using previously. In addition, the \\"Driving Mode\\" button on the side finds a way to activate itself while in your pocket (or purse, or wherever) at the most inconvenient times (like when you're in class, in a business meeting, etc.). So instead of quietly vibrating to notify you of an incoming call, it blurts out \\"CALL FROM ......\\" (fill in the ..... with the name of the person who is calling you).Battery life leaves you wanting another half hour at least.Additionally, the camera is poor even for the display on the phone itself, and even at the highest quality setting.There must be a better phone out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE!","review":"This phone is absolutely terrible. My first 6100 kept dropping calls and hanging up on itself after about 7 months of use. So, I went to Verizon a couple weeks ago and exchanged it for a new one.

I brought it to Verizon and it basically is broken and I need to get a new phone. Needless to say, I won't be getting this one again.

The VX6100 is quite an impressive package. All the features operate perfectly, the audio is very good, and the speaker surprisingly clear for it's size. Volume is very loud, if needed. I was concerned about not having a metal case like the V60i, but this one seems quite durable.

For example, if you want to turn the volume of the ringer high, the display shows you 5 staks of colored bars to show you the current volume level. Why in the world would you need that? A good display is one thing, a misused display is another. Poor engineering.3. standby time: 3.5 days5. talktime, I did not talk too much on it to discharge it, so I do not know.6. speakerphone is ok on the lowest volume.

Switched the batteries and it still wouldn't charge, so they switched me with another phone.I realize that I happened to get a couple lemons for phones but I am not impressed with the way they don't check their phones when leaving the company and there are features on my new phone which make me miss my old LG.I can't wait until I can upgrade my phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be good, but isnt","review":"This phone had so much promise..

I don't know if Cat Stevens can be considered a \\"heavyweight\\" in the singer/songwriter genre, but he certainly reached a creative peak with these beautiful compositions. Never quite as melancholy as Nick Drake, nor as psychedelic as Donovan, Stevens touched all the right chords here with these simple but timeless songs, the sparse backing and his lovely vocals.

However, unlike P.G., Mr. Westlake regularly works out of the less sunny realms of his imagination, as this book demonstrates, and will, from time to time, forgo camouflaging the fact with a pseudonym (for instance, his brilliant \\"The Ax\\"). What I'm saying is: Donald E.

When I called to cancel my subsription, I was on hold the first time for 15 minutes before giving up, writing and email only to be \\"invited to call customer assistance to discuss my account\\" and on hold the second time for over 25 minutes! Based on the shoty customer service, I would recommend that people avoid sirius! Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"I got the Here 2 Anywhere as a birthday gift. I was extremely excited but soon lost my enthusiasm. When I opened the first car docking kit I noticed the antennae connector was missing from the antennae. Had to take this one back. The 2nd kit I got the antennae connector came off! Had to go back for round 3. The 3rd try seemed to be intact but my reception has been VERY poor. I get static and popping on every factory preset reception station. In fact, my AM radio gets better reception. I took it back in and the installers inform me that the FM modulated receivers are notorious for bad reception, are not digital quality and there is not a whole lot you can do about it. I have a high end stereo system and did not purchase this with the intention of paying to get AM quality reception. Save your money and buy a digital ready deck and receiver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything I Wanted and More","review":"This is my second satellite radio. My first was not what I expected, too many commercials. I read about Sirius service with no commercials and purchased the Kenwood H2A.So far this Kenwood has given me no problems and was extremely easy to install. I did place the antenna on my dashboard and have no problems with reception. Sirius recommends the antenna to be placed on top of the vehicle. This unit receives a digital signal and in my opinion either you have the digital signal or you don't, quality of sound is excellent. No commercials on the 60 music channels that cover every genre coupled with 40 channels of news, sports and entertainment. The scrolling 4 line display provides song and artist information and has more preset channels than I can use.I highly recommend this unit and Sirius service. You will never go back to terrestrial radio once you have tried this radio. The monthly cost is less than the cost of one music CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a different tuner!!!","review":"Sirius radio is really great. I can't believe I went as long as I did w/o going to satellite radio.However, this tuner is junk. Mine broke after about 3 months. Then, it took en entire month to get it replaced through Kenwood. Now, the new tuner is starting to have the same problems as the first one.I'm going to try a different brand next to see if I get better results. It's a shame to abandon the car and home docking kits I already have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute little toy","review":"I bought this for my 2 year old daughter because she sees her sister get on the bus for school.She loves anything sesame street so this was right up her ally.

I oredered this book because its description gave the impression that it would be helpful to a beginning player for developing strategies. It is not at all helpful.

That said, I am sure it is my ignorance in not knowing what was meant by the title...I am sure this book would be helpful to those playing the game perhaps known as Chinese Mah...and has information on scoring that I didn't know existed.

Lesley has always had to prove herself to her family and others. Once she meets Darren they fall deeply in love and plans to marry. Until some designs are stolen and the evidence points to Lesley. She explains over and over to Darren and her family that she was not the thief. They don't believe her and she leaves carrying the secret that she is pregnant.Darren finds her and plots to make her go back with him. What he doesn't know is he is a father. When he learns about Dara he becomes determined to make them the family that they once planned for.This was an enjoyable read by Beverly Clark. I agree with the other reviewer that some of the key issues could have been explored a little more. And also some of the secondary characters may have their own book soon. You will enjoy this and other books written by Ms. Clark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Never Ending","review":"Lesley Wells-Evans was a brillant fashion designer.

Darren didn't believe her. Lesley left the state and tried to start her life over.Darren hunted her down. He wanted revenge. What he had not counted on was finding out he had a daughter. He was then determined to have Lesley and their little girl.I enjoyed Bound By Love. I have read all of Ms. Clark's books. I do think the plot of who stole the designs could have been explored a little further. The reason the person set Lesley up in the first place could have been explored to make the book even more powerful. Lesley and Darren's relationship was wonderful. It would be nice to see some of the secondary characters have a book of their own. All in All it was a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Love that cannot be broken","review":"It was an enjoyable read. What Daren wants he gets by any means neccessary.

I loved NL Christmas Vacation, and was thrilled when I saw this in the store for $5. It wasn't until I got home that I realized this doesn't include Chevy Chase, but does include an awful plot, and even worse acting. When there's a sequel to a movie, I don't expect it to top the original, but I do expect it to be worth watching. At least I'm only out $5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Deserve The Title...","review":"I have seen some lame ideas for sequels, but this one takes the cake. I wouldn't have been so upset if the movie had a different title, but this one is simply designed to fool fans of the first. No Chevy Chase, no movie, It's that simple. We have endured the Griswolds through four different adventures. Yes, Vegas was pretty bad, but I welcome sin city compared to this. Randy Quad looks very stressed trying to carry a film by himself. He's not pretty enough, nor funny enough to be a lead. Cousin Eddie loses another job, gets a settlement for a Christmas Vacation in the tropics. Of course, Eddie screws things up and they get stranded on a deserted island. It really is absurd! Watch the original again, twice even. There will be more suprises there than in this lame duck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable","review":"Man how I love the Vacation movies. I love them so much that I was able to overlook all of the bad reviews this movie got and bought it anyway. Simply put, it was painful to watch and I forced myself to sit through it hoping it would get better. It really is as bad as the others say and ranks among the worst movies I've ever sat through and I'm not picky. I've turned off much better movies for being unwatchable. Made-For-TV isn't even a good excuse because it's not even good enough for that. I had hope that Cousin Eddie could salvage this mess, but he couldn't. At least in the others, the disasters were in the movie and not the movie itself. I give it one star for participation and pity only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christmas Vacation 2 Sucks!","review":"This movie sucked!

I really enjoyed the first Christmas Vacation. When I saw CV2 on the shelf I was excited to see the saga continue. The movie starts out great....until the beginning credits end. While they did bring back an old Audrey they forget the core family...Chevy Chase and Beverly DeAngelo. Guess they knew to stay away from such a bad movie and so should you. Trust me. This movie is not enjoyable whatsoever.I would have given it no stars but they don't allow it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have been better with Chevy Chase","review":"I'm quite surprised at myself saying that, as I normally can't stand Chevy Chase - but I've discovered I can't stand Randy Quaid something worse! I think I would have preferred to watch Chevy, cos he's actually better.It's not completely a bad movie - I enjoyed the sunshine on the island, and it's a lot better than the depressing weather outside, just 4 days before Christmas. Uncle Nick's character was fabulous as soon as he appeared on screen, but he was the film's only saving grace. These National Lampoon movies (from what I've watched) seem to lurch from one overly predictable and highly unlikely disaster to the next. And there's something between Clark & Ellen from the previous movies, that make them utterly watchable - even if it is Chevy Chase.I wouldn't be recommending this movie to anyone anytime soon. It was a waste of time watching it, and I'm sure you could find something much better to do with your precious time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie Stinks!!!!!","review":"This is quite possibly the very worst movie ever made.The acting skill level was sub-zero and the story was poorly constructed.I can't think of one good thing to say about the movie except that it does end.Save your time for something worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I love all the Vacation movies with Chevy Chase, but this one was not good at all.

Chevy Chase (Clark) doesn't appear in it one bit. Audrey does return, though. The plot is that while on a tour of an island Uncle Eddy and the gang get marooned on an island. There they have to work to survive. They need each other. It all turns out to be a pretty good film. However, this does not even compare to the other National Lampoom films. And it certainly doesn't compare to the first Christmas Vacation. Sure it does have its laughs and funny parts, but it still doesn't come close to the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the?!","review":"The original Vacation and Christmas Vacation have to be two of my most favorite movies ever.

Yes, Christmas Vacation with Chevy Chase will forever live on as a classic for most of us but knowing that Randy Quaid has the guts to walk around in his skivies was worth viewing this made for television movie. I watched it, I laughed but we all know that rarely does a sequel compare to the original. Not sure I will reserve a copy of the forthcoming DVD (only because 2010 is a bit of a wait) but I will continue to hold Randy Quaid in the highest of regards for his unique portrayal of cousin Eddie.

Its worse than a made for tv movie. They steal all the worth while jokes and gags from all of the Vacation movies.

You get to see Dana Barron-Audrey-from the original Vacation. She is very hot in my opinion and brings the movie up to at least barely watchable.Bottom line- If you are a hard core Vacation fan and a sentimentalist, see this movie. If your not, then don't.

Not only did they manage to screw up the character of Cousin Eddie, they almost managed to ruin the Vacation films for me.

This is Fourth Uncle. The magic, sorcery, and martial art stories give way to the natural magic of one pointed concentration - in the cave of the primoridal, original, and pristine mind. I enjoyed this book so much, in spite of the tragic backdrop of pre and post Vietnamese war history. There is a great human truth here, that goes beyond religions, in the narration that radiates out through the eyes of a child coming into adulthood. There is also a lot of what is called by aboriginal peoples, \\"indigenous knowledge\\" about Viet Nam, which sadly may be disappearing because of enviromental desecration. This book is also a hommage to the folk doctor tradition. This tradition, so vital to the revitalization of the human spirit, is also in danger of being marginalized by institutionalized medicine.

The book concludes with stories of fun and friendship (and romance), as well as what happened to the nurses at the end of the war.Thoroughly documented with endnotes for each chapter, appendices and index, and an extensive bibliography, the book is appropriate for scholarly use. Jackson used many primary source materials, mainly interviews with and letters and other writings of the nurses who served.

We received it as a gift (and WOW whoever would pay $35 for this is CRAZY.). Our son is nearly five & needs help to load the truck, which has to be loaded fully to work without jamming; a time-consuming procedure, since the dominoes have to be loaded one-at-a-time. The dominoes themselves are also almost too lightweight to stand well on end, and are prone to easy collapse. After the initial newness wears off this toy is going to disappear, and that's something I've never even contemplated before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"Fun toy for kids 4 and up but wish it had come with a few spare parts.

I took a chance and purchased one even after reading her review for a couple of reasons. First, it was a great price with free shipping. Secondly, I assumed that the folks at Amazon would've figured out the need to check each table before shipping in the future after having mulitiple tables being returned broken. I was wrong. It weighs a TON, and getting it in my garage and then back out for the UPS man the next day was a pain.

I need recipes that are made from and for people like me. Imagine my pleasure at finding out they compile the years recipes in their magazines in beautiful hard-bound books. The quality of the books are really nice, the pages glossy which helps if you accidently splatter while cooking. There has also never been a recipe I've tried that I havent liked. Now I no longer get the magazines, I just buy the books at the end of the year. A REAL storage saver!

It's a horrible, mushy mix, that I doubt even came off the mixing board, and is unsuitable for discriminating ears. Not much EQ or dynamic range, and a very poor, and constantly-changing, mix/balance throughout.I can almost guarantee that Ruben Blades had nothing to do with, and would not approve of, this release. I suspect the audio (and it's accompanying video, which I also bought) were pirated. What a shame.

Find Prep Exams that you can get to refresh some key areas. Then, you will be ready for the exam. e.g. what's the home server really mean? COM port settings in the Notes.ini? etc. especially for SA1.

This is an essential album for any serious music collector to own. Boces is far different than anything that was out in its time. From the opening track Meth of a Rockette's Kick, (a 10+ minute opus that starts off with peaceful strumming of acoustic guitar and nice french horn playing then crashes into oblivion with walls of feedback over pretty female vocalings then delves into free form jazz featuring tuba and piano then ends on total freakout), to the closing acid lounge of Girlfren, each song on this album gets more and more enjoyable after each listen. First time you hear it, you'll be like \\"huh?\\". After about 5 listens it'll start to grab you and then slowly suck you in.

For example Newton's first law of motion is stated as \\"An object at rest and an object in motion maintains its velocity unless it experiences an unbalanced force.\\" How much wordier can it get?The entire textbook is this way and jumps from one subject to another with almost no logical order.

Only one or two options are offered for each body part, and no attention is given to color, total body proportion, age, or lifestyle. All photos are of the authors, who are quite slim, so no advice is given to heavier women. The most confusing advice in the whole book is that for women with big bottoms and saddle-bags: a-line skirts are recommended for saddle bags but not big bottoms. Then the reverse advice is given for pencil skirts. Don't women who have one problem often have both? What am I supposed to do, sew the front of an a-line to the back of a pencil? Guess what?

So what's the person who fits to categories to do when she sees that the recomended pant leg cut is flattering for one of her shortcomings and absolutely devastating for another?The answer: Get a different book. This book only provides simplistic descriptions of clothes that work in one particular body situation, and really doesn't explain how to adapt their advice to changing fashion. You can already spot a lot of trendy clothing from last year (or before!) that one wouldn't want to be seen in now. I thought the purpose of the book was to suggest timeless dressing?There are plenty of decent books out there that may require more reading than pictures [gasp!] but that will give you much more sound advice, and will be more useful in the long run."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Cannot Praise This Book Enough!","review":"This book is wonderful!I would get so frustrated when I would try on clothes, trying on outfit after outfit that looked horrible on me.

And, I knew what would look best and why before I even closed the dressing room door.Let's face it, we all have problem areas (even these two beautiful women!). We all can learn a great deal from this book.The book might be called \\"What Not To Wear\\" but, it could have easily been named \\"What to Wear to Look and Feel Your Best\\".

Even experienced shoppers go into denial sometimes. I have been \\"blessed\\" with big upper arms and a short neck, yet I somehow have a plethora of sleeveless tops in my closet. Some of them even have TURTLENECKS! I defiantly jumped on the sleeveless bandwagon, even though I wasn't entirely comfortable doing so. A pricey mistake that will not happen again, believe you me.I do agree that the book doesn't address every possible \\"problem area\\". However, many of the tips that work for one problem area will work for another. For example, the tips for a flabby tummy (lower rise pants, shirts not tucked in) work well to disguise a flat butt and a short waist.Finally, the writing is hilarious! I also give credit to Susannah and Trinny for using themselves as models--and not just dishing out criticisms to others.P.S. The version I have has American vendors in the back of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Not to Buy","review":"Unlike the other reviewers, I was very disappointed in this book. It addressed only a few figure flaws and did not offer any advice on how to dress for my particular figure problems (flat butt, broad hips, square shoulders). Little or no mention was made as to the effects of colors or types of fabrics and fabric designs on different figure types.

I'm sorry, but if you're really a woman troubled by having big ..., big arms, a big butt, a flabby tummy, saddlebags and/or thick legs, then I would NOT advise you to buy, or even to read, this book. The women who model the clothes that you should or should not wear for these body flaws have nearly \\"perfect\\" bodies. Let's see them write this book again and use real women, who really do struggle with trying to find the right types of clothes for they body types. Maybe women who wear over a size 10 pant and over a size medium top."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Turnoff!","review":"The word \\"vulgar\\" isn't often used about books these days, but it certainly applies to this one! The authors start with a negative viewpoint (\\"What NOT to Wear\\"), proceed to describe every possible body flaw, using the most disgusting terms possible, and then tell how women should disguise it. If you didn't hate your looks before, you surely will after you read through this book. Their models struggle to look fat and flabby at the appropriate points and succeed only in looking ridiculous. Rather than going through the agony of stuffing yourself into some clothing disguise, better to stand up straight, eat right and exercise!

The authors' idea of \\"big waist\\" or \\"big butt\\" or \\"flabby tummy\\".....was laughable!

I find they do a much better job of getting the design principles than the American version. There are pictures with each design principle so you can clearly see for yourself the principles in action.They give you some tough love and you will at first feel far outside your comfort zone on the outfits, but if you follow this guide, you will look 1000 percent better. My first day to work wearing the new wardrobe people thought I had somehow instantly lost 40 pounds. People did double takes and didn't at first recognize me with the new look. I was amazed at how the difference in just my wardrobe caused others to act around me. This experience was so motivating, it kept me in the gym working out until I really did lose 40 pounds (and more.)I highly recommend absconding with a copy of this book, even if you can only get it used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but a real waste of money.","review":"This book reads like one long beauty magazine article. Lots of pretty pictures, but not a whole lot of content. Much of the advice given is either common-sense stuff that most people can figure out from other sources, OR very much fashion-driven and reliant upon current styles (the fact that everyone seems to own capris, yet the authors seem to hate them, is just one example). On top of it all, reading this really can make just about anyone feel \\"imperfect.\\" While much of the advice is true, it does suffer from overkill a bit.

They are rather snobbish, not very attractive women, who lost me completely when they pushed wearing hide-tight maternity clothes that made them look like blimps, they apparently never heard of a good hair cut and finally, the hideous recommendation that you wear a dress over a pair of slacks.

Also, Trinny and Robin were the models for all the dos and don'ts. They both have super figures, so for most of the don'ts they had to try and exaggerate their \\"flaws\\". Trinny would slouch to exaggerate her small chest and Robin would puff-out out her tummy to look larger around the middle. Give me a break! These two really don't have the body flaws that so many real women have to deal with when trying to find cloths that fit and flatter.Save your money and don't buy this book. Instead, buy yourself some good fitting undergarments.

Much of the advice was old hat, and some of it I just didn't even agree with like busty girls shouldn't wear turtlenecks - cmon! And it only addressed specific body areas rather than all over body types.For my money Stacey and Clinton's book is the way to go. Haven't found one yet to rival theirs. And I guess I just like the way they seem to find beauty in all figure types and bring it out. I know Susannah and Trinny are British but their humor sometimes just borders on sheer viciousness.

Plus, the help is so generic and limited. They only give you a list of 4 or 5 helpful cuts/lines/lengths, and a series of 4 or 5 stlyes/etc. to avoid. Well, I realized that there are FAR more stlyes/etc. in the world than 5, so if I go to the store and find something NOT mentioned in the book, how am I supposed to know if I can wear it or not!? Most books are designed to give you a starting point to further progress your fashion savvy conscious, but this book did no such thing.

I expected a lot of advice and tips on dressing different bodies. What I got were a couple of pages on each problem type with humorously exaggerated fashion modeling by the authors.

Sometimes it's hard to understand why something (ex. shoulder pads) is wrong without seeing a more current alternative. The problem is that the so-called good examples are often equally bad. This book gets credit for imagining some truly freakish fashions. Who shows up to an interview with a knee length jacket and flared pants - unless it's for a Bea Arthur bio pic? Why criticize a dress for giving an eye-full and then laude a woman popping out of her v-neck on the preceding page and a woman sporting obvious nipples (can I say that on Amazon.com?) on the next page?

Again, buy Leah Feldon who doesn't play around and offers solid, timeless guidance.I gave this two starts nonetheless because, if you have money to burn, it won't kill you to add it to your shelves.

I have a cute figure, but no one really noticed. I wore the wrong clothes for my body type. Now I get CONSTANT compliments, even though I haven't lost weight or had plastic surgery. I've been in this body a long time but no one really noticed my figure until I followed their advice.(My only critique is that they use themselves as models for body type problems they don't actually have.)I also find I buy FEWER clothes than before because I know before I buy something whether its going to work for me.

The book states if you have a short neck to stay away from wearing turtlenecks & roundnecks and to WEAR deep V neck tops.

These babes will tell you which clothes to give away (to someone with the opposite set of problems), what to buy and why, how to wear it - and even where to buy it.

I had hoped it would give me solid guidelines on what to wear for my figure shape, etc. Instead all it contained were pictures of Trinny and Susannah modeling their figure flaws and tooting their own horns. Big deal. The commentary from both these women was critical and negative. We're not all built like supermodels and yes, some of us do have big upperarms, big thighs,wide hips and boobs. Why not concentrate on camouflaging these flaws and offering positive helpful suggestions on how to make one look their best instead of tearing ourselves down."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Not To Buy","review":"If you have only one problem area, this book might be for you.

Mostly good advice for maximizing your figure while hiding its flaws. Hard to believe it when you look at Trinny, but she does have a few figure flaws which the book points out. I think that's reassuring for the audience to realize that there really isn't a perfect figure, she is just working with what she has. I recommend this book but I do have a few cautions:As one of the other posters mentioned, many of the shops they recommend are in the UK, although with a little effort you can locate some of those same shops here in the states (Club Monaco for example).Also they really slam high waisted pants, completely ignoring the fact that those of us who have shorter legs long for the day when highwaisted pants are back in vogue.

Now, I don't know about the case surrounding W. Stevens, but I do know enough to realize that if the CIA wants you/your reputation discredited, that is kindergarten work for those guys. One doesn't just 'lay your proof out on the table..' and prove the CIA manipulated the legal system. Anyway, KKK's writing is anything but objective and it's a shame books like his get published.

Whatever your position on UFOs, you will find this book fascinating. Although Korff himself has had a UFO experience that he continues to be mystified about, he is a serious UFO researcher who believes that the whole field of UFOology can benefit from rigorous scientific examination of specific UFO claims. Extensively documented with footnotes, the book is marred only by a sometimes overly accusatory tone.

I took quick peeks to see what my daughters were viewing, and even those peeks left me feeling none too great.Bottom line: Fun fireplace, great fish, otherwise fun variety, but the digitally created stuff was not on par with fireplace and fish.

By the time you figure out a move you're on to the next one. Christi talks so fast and the music is so loud you can hardly understand what she is trying to say. She often goes into the advanced/optional part of a move before you have a chance to feel comfortable with the basic move.

The Human League are back.This is the first newly released CD that I've bought for a long time and I wasn't disappointed.It's worth buying it just for 'All I ever wanted' - a classic HL track. Hearing it for the first time brought back happy memories of 1981 and 'Don't you want me?'. Both are great, unpretentious pop songs.Another great track is 'Love me madly?' but what lets the album down for me is the number of instrumental tracks (7). It's not that they aren't any good, it just makes the album somewhat disjointed. Especially as after every vocal track comes an instrumental one. Just program your CD to play the vocal tracks first....To conclude, if you like the Human League you'll love this. It's got a retro feel to it without being stuck in an 80's time warp.Proper pop songs by proper pop stars.

To these ears, it's a repetitive mess that never gets off the ground. Davis' trumpet is buried in the mix, and there's no real melody to speak of either. The best track on the album is \\"Black Satin,\\" a cut that Bill Laswell remixed with superior results on the excellent Panthalassa CD in 1998. The sound quality on that album was far superior, and the song worked much better within the context of that CD. Here, it just serves as the theme for the last half hour of the disc.

It was ahead of its time when it was first issued in 1972. It still is.No one anticipated musical trends better than Miles and this albums is proof. His underlying use of of Indian motifs, raw funk grooves and corruscating electronica prefigured everything from Shakti and Weather Report (post Mysterious Traveller)to Trilok Gurtu's eclectic blend and acid jazz.It may not be a landmark like Bitches Brew but this is essential to understand where Miles and Jazz was headed."},{"rating":"2","title":"DIG IT!","review":"\\"On The Corner\\" is STILL sui generis - while it has antecedents, those are fully subsumed into an exceedingly singular whole, quite unlike anything or anyone else.

Who cares??If you MUST pigeon-hole the music you listen to, then STAY AWAY from On The Corner. It'll bake your noodle.Roundly vilified by all parties when first released, it has taken the world many, many years to be able to finally \\"hear\\" this recording without bringing all the category-driven baggage that was slapped on it initially.But that leaves YOU.

The beat and chorus lyrics, \\"I want you to be he-he-he-he-he-here, I want it to be no-no-no-no-no-now!\\" will hook you immediately. THIS SONG IS JUST SO MUCH FUN! Jon Pierce may just be some kind of music (songwriter, keyboardist, vocalist) genius. HIS LYRICS ARE CATCHY AND ROMANTICALLY LOVELY and as for vocals...well, HIS RANGE IS AMAZING! Check out the video on the band's own website and see for yourself! Finally, some delicious music is out there again. A real treat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NA Tour","review":"At first listen, \\"Apart\\" is a very infectious song. Elkland will be on tour with ERASURE this spring in NA.

I was expecting a guide book to all the eccentric festivals and weird places to see and take photographs of but Eccentric America definitely is not that. Whilst the book goes into depth with a lot of festivals the author doesn't put the same effort into attractions with sparse detail on the little number of places actually listed. I've extensively backpacked the USA and most of the weird attractions I came across are not even mentioned here. There is also a severe lack of photographs. Obviously the author attended a car show somewhere because that's what the majority of the six photograph pages are of. You'll find more eccentric attractions in the normal USA travel guide books than in here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"This would be the fourth time I have bought this album throughout the years!

Roger Lewin essentially provides a book report of the most significant controversies in paleoanthropological history with very little original insight. The result is a tedious review (especially the 78 pages discussing the KBS Tuft Controversy) of the seamy side of paleoanthropology. The recurrent theme is that of entrenched preconceptions - both professional and personnal - so dominating the actions of the foremost paleoanthropologists that they ignore the preponderence of evidence in favor of their own agendas. The book is replete with examples of the petty jealosies and egoism of the foremost names in paleoanthropology triumphing over a dedication for the search for the truth. With this book, Mr Lewin escapes the threat of becoming embroilled in the jealosies and controversies of other benchmark works as he provides nothing original to attack."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH IT!","review":"Hardly any air created by the three fans in this cooler pad.

Not recommended unless you have excellent vision!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disagree with negative reviews: well worth the money!","review":"I have the previous edition of this book, and it was the only reference (beside some tips from friends on things to do) that we used to find our way around and find cool things to check out while in San Francisco last December. The photos (yes, there's a lot of them) were actually pretty useful, I thought, since they served as a very good guide for what to look for when we hit a particular neighborhood, in terms of landmarks. We found the guide also to be right on in terms of restaurant references and pricing information, and if you want to stretch your trip to San Fran a bit, it also provides useful info for excursions into Napa Valley and the like.

It complemented a Frommers book well, which had lots of useful information, but required more reading to get a good idea of a neighborhood. I think this book would also benefit from another, more well-informed book, as this one lacked the in-depth details on a particular sight.The layout was also very busy and distracting.

While drenched in academic discourse and theory-speak, Wilson's wry humor and lyricism come through in chapter after chapter revealing the contestatory forces of an American Pacific coming unglued in the post-imperial era.

I first saw it on one of those home-organization shows.It prints labels from 1/4\\" to 1\\" wide, up to the length of the tape. The TZ labels it takes come in several colors (white, flourescent orange, yellow, red, clear, etc.) and types (basic laminated, strong adhesive, strong adhesive flexible [for labeling cables, etc.], tamper evident [which show if someone has tried to peel-off the label], etc.).The specialized label tapes can be pricey, but the instruction manual tells you how to save tape with different printing methods.I've had this label maker for almost 2 years and have never had a problem with it. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"65% of print cartridge is wasted!","review":"Please, do yourself a favor: think twice before buying this device. I just did a test with mine: I had 37 five-digit labels to print, so I put in new batteries and a new label cartridge and got to work printing them out. After an hour, I had a pile of my 37 labels -and a pile of 105 useless label strips. See, the thing about this printer is that it prints out a buffer strip before each label. Ok, so there should be an equal number of \\"buffer strips\\" as actual labels, right? Well, you'd think so, wouldn't you... Fact is, there were several dozen misprints -either nothing printed, or it printed only a solid colored bar or a couple of bars along the length of what should have been the label. this means that only 35% of what I printed can be used! Consider for a moment the price of the print cartridges... And think twice before buying one of these!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value and features","review":"I love the fact the unit came in a plastic carry case with room for multiple lables.

But to place it in context, showing the progression of French music from Berlioz to Debussy and Ravel, you learn a lot.Also, the conducting is just magnificent. By this time Munch was tired and trying to leave the BSO, but the board didn't want to let him go. So he just kept banging out these French warhorses, with little rehearsal, and each concert was an EVENT because he was always so spontaneous. He loses the orchestra at times (especially in the Berlioz) but it's great to see him drive the BSO over a cliff, as he does in the second movement of La Mer. Also note the impossible duration of the last note in Fantastique...Magnifique!"},{"rating":"2","title":"heartwarming and touching","review":"I had this book as a child and it was one of my favorites.

In Joel Martin's Sacred Revolt, the effort is made to stem the tide of assumption, broad generalization, and one-sided commentary of Southeastern American history. Unfortunately, this noble idea is unattainable in a historical monograph that falls prey to the same falliabilities as the histories it critiques. Due to the author being raised in the South,( born in Opelika, Alabama several miles from the actual site of the Battle of Horseshoe Bend of 1814) he is biased toward the subject. Martin's quest for the redemption of this particular piece of history is influenced greatly by his own beliefs. Interpreting, and thereby changing, history to suit his own needs makes this piece uncomfortably similar to the works it condemns. All this in additiion to an editor who seems to have given up half way through, has the reader questioning whether or not the author ever enrolled in English 101."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music","review":"It's great seeing and hearing these artists.

The most unintentionally hilarious moment is \\"Times are Changing\\" by the Byrds, the dancers are on the show are dressed in combat gear. Sam the Sham and the Pharoahs \\"Wolly Bully\\" is probably the best thing believe it or not. They are not trying to spread some kind of love vibe, they are just having fun.

He wasn't always in a shoot out or on a vendetta ride through the south. At times, he was just Wyatt and Tefteller does a great job of letting the reader see Wyatt from many vantage points. Through the eyes of friend and foe alike.He also debunks a lot of previously-held \\"truths\\" about Wyatt, which is necessary for any lover of historical fact.Any person wishing to learn about Wyatt Earp would do well to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting","review":"Received this as a gift from my wife.

Seen in that light, the story of what happened at the OK corral deserves a wide audience. This is a fine, well written book, offering a balanced view of Earp and his family. I found two things of particular interest: Tefertiller's portrayal of Josie Marcus (\\"Sadie,\\" Wyatt's commonlaw wife) as a real shrew in her later years, and his sympathetic view of Stuart Lake, Wyatt's first real biographer."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book could be used in history classes","review":"Casey Tefertiller did a perfect job writing this book. His fair and accurate analysis of the life of Wyatt Earp is interesting and hard to put down once you start reading.The research he put into the book is unreal. The section for references alone takes up I'd say what other authors make for a chapter or forward.Probably the only gripe I have is the font size is pretty small and the chapters are unusually long.

You'll come away with a knowledge of who he was and what his life was like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I must be from another planet. The positive reaction to this book leaves me confused. It's not an objective look at Earp, as is frequently said, but more hero worshipping. He actually lists the research done for the movie Tombstone as reference material!! I guess it says a lot about the reverence Wyatt fans approach him with that they think of this book as some kind of honest biography. The author sort of cops to what he's up to when he says that when all is said and done, Stuart Lake's bio had most of the facts right. How he came to this conclusion, I have no idea, but I think what he meant was that he and Stuart Lake had the same goal - to glorify Wyatt Earp. So we're still waiting for a good bio of this very interesting frontier character."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book review.","review":"This book is one of the most accurate and detailed accounts of Wyatt Earps life that I've ever read. It is full of factual information that the writer supports with refereces. You certainly get a sense of being there all through Earps' life with this book. I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in the real west. This is a great read that is hard to put down. Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wyatt Earp","review":"Like the quote on the cover of the book, I would have to say that the truth IS better than the fiction. This was a great story to begin with, but I think Mr. Tefertiller tells it in a way that keeps the reader interested and tells the story. It is not a typical non fiction book where the author just collects a bunch of names and facts and throws them in semi order. I truly enjoyed this read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Terrific Read","review":"I have always been fascinated by the Wyatt Earp legend from the movies. Therefore I picked up this book while visiting Tombstone. Casey Tefertiller does a great job leading the reader along Earp's life from the cowtowns of Kansas, to Tombstone and then on to his later adventures in California, Nevada and Alaska. I was intrigued by the telling of the twisted politics of Tombstone, by just how controversial and maligned Earp was during his lifetime, and the many people that stood by him. Where the book is most brilliant is that while you are reading it, and certainly by the time you're done, you feel as if you knew Earp and those he came in contact with. A great fun read about the Old West."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed but lacks a little emotion","review":"Excellent book for its purpose - but the excitement of Earp's life doesn't come through, which is probably a fault in me, not the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than fiction","review":"That I couldn't put this book down is a testament to the adage that truth is more interesting than fiction. The author places Earp in context, and gives both sides to his story. The politics of Earp's time defined him and interpreted his conduct. The press was just as partisan during Earp's life as it is today, but unlike today both sides were represented and reported. This book explains the life and times of Wyatt Earp through the press's eyes and with it articulates the continuing battle between the law-and-order right and the excuse-the-criminal-as-victim left. Wyatt Earp, his brothers, and Doc Holliday were not angels by any means, but were rugged individualists who courageously interjected themselves into fascinating events that made history. This book is a great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wyatt had Warts!","review":"This book takes the time to show Wyatt Earp- warts and all.

With my previous cable lock, you could take the key out as soon as the lock opened and then lock it without the key. It's a pain to coil it up with my too-large keyring dangling from the end.Getting the tip of the cable aligned with the lock mechanism to coil it as shown in the image takes a fair amount of forceful pushing and twisting to get it just right. Perhaps this will loosen over time. Or maybe I'll figure out what I'm doing wrong.Both of these \\"complaints\\" probably speak to the solidity of the locking mechanism."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly made","review":"Within the first month of owning this lock, parts of the vinyl casing over the flexible metal cord chipped off; not the biggest deal, but now, barely a year after purchase, the key/tumbler combination has deteriorated to such an extent that it takes several minutes to achieve the exact key position which will unlock the cable. Very frustrating. Will probably go back to buy a more expensive kryptonite product next, and will send in the existing lock to OnGuard for a replacement. Then I will own TWO locks when I only need one. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"I have confidence in this lock!","review":"This is a hefty lock! I commute to work daily and will be leaving this lock on the rack at work. It is stiff, but has some give to the cable, and a swivel lock head. So,(while not easy) it is doable to wrap around a rack or fence. I have not had problems with the key/lock being sticky, but it took a little practice to get used to the feel of it; and also had I some frustration in getting the key out of the lock, until I was reminded that it had to be locked to remove the key.

Corporate literati ...strike again.Since I already have Ham On Rye, Post Office, South Of No North, and numerous volumes of Bukowski poetry, this biography really is obsolete. It seems like Cherkovski pasted together snippets of the Bukowski collection, and added some of his own limited insights, placed the whole conglomeration between a cover and shipped it off to market.Anyone who has read even a limited amount of Bukowski's work will find nothing new in this biography. Save your money and purchase Buk's poetry. I recommend Bone Palace Ballet, or The Night Torn Made With Footsteps."},{"rating":"1","title":"An utter disappointment.","review":"Bukowski did the author of this book a great service by writing about his own life in his stories and poems, because that's the only information the author thought to use in his biography. He read Buk's books, told the real names of the people, put it all in chronological order, and that's it. This book didn't offer a single minor piece of insight into a man whose live I'd like to know more about. If you are looking for a real biography from someone who has actually done their research, I recommend \\"Locked in the Arms of a Crazy Life\\" by Howard Sounes. That author did his legwork and did created a work that is actually worth something to the reader. So yes, stay as far away as possible from this book, and you will be a more complete person."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing (sloppy, inaccurate) work.","review":"This book happens to devote two full pages describing Bukowski's friendship with writer Steve Richmond.

Myths and facts are distorted by clueless writers and historians of the winning side. Mixing the holocaust and the german soldiers in the front has been the greatest after war propaganda campaign. I recommend this book to anyone that wants to know how Waffen SS fought in the front, how they interacted with prisioners of war,how they felt about each other, ..etc. Want to live in absolute brainwashed ignorance? Keep watching the History channel and their biased WII programs..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant study of the SS","review":"Gordon Williamson went quite \\"against the grain\\" with his work, 'Loyalty Is My Honor'. Instead of the cliche' generalizations and finger-pointing most associated with post-war books on the SS, Williamson decided to let the actual German SS men who fought, and died, tell their own side of the story, in their own words. Quite revolutionary! After finishing this book I was struck by the absolute determination, will and sense of brotherhood enjoyed within the ranks of Hitler's SS. Surely the world has never known a more disciplined fighting force. For WWII buffs, this book offers a very real, very uncensored glimpse into a section of history most people would rather forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Honour is Loyalty","review":"This is one of the best first hand accounts on the Waffen SS I have ever read.I have many books on the Waffen SS and this one is on of my personal favorites because its easy to read and I believe very honest in regards how they felt about certain topics raised by the author, be it political ,military or their treatment in Allied captivity.You as a reader will not be disappointed, this book portrays the men of the former Waffen SS as what they really were elite soldiers who lived and died like all other soldiers in WW2. Not monsters as they are portrayed by the world media.Once you start reading it is very hard to put down and I personally love books like that."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],M={key:0},N={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(O,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-8e0350d1"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/60.md","filePath":"library/60.md"}'),R={name:"library/60.md"},P=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{j as __pageData,P as default};
